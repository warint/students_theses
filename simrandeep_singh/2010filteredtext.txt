 bi review 38/2010 1 jean-claude trichet: laudatio han tietmeyer speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank (ecb), münster city hall, westphalia, 26 march 2010. * * * lord mayor, mr hillebrandt, dear hans, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure give speech honour dear friend han tietmeyer. the westfalen-initiative make excellent decision induct han tietmeyer freiherr vom stein (1757–1831) westfälische ehrengalerie [westphalian gallery honour]. induction westfälische ehrengalerie mean honour prominent westphalians service region. of course, achievement han tietmeyer, like freiherr vom stein, see far beyond westphalia. the historical significance city hall also extend way beyond westphalia. it play host pivotal event history europe, witness negotiation conclusion peace westphalia 360 year ago. the treaty münster treaty osnabrück form basis establishment peace europe follow thirty year war. han tietmeyer also participate pivotal event europe’s history. indeed, play decisive role lay legal foundation europe’s economic monetary union. the introduction single currency represent great achievement date history european integration – process ensure six decade peace prosperity europe. today, europe face pivotal decisions. the global financial crisis result major challenge europe’s economic fiscal policies. i talk issue end speech. i pleasure spend many year work han – particularly 1987 1999. initially, han secretary state ministry finance i director treasury. later, period governor respective central bank coincided. when ecb established, become member govern council ecb. it han propose use members’ country origin determine seat plan govern council’s meet instead use alphabetical order decide sit next whom. after all, member govern council represent euro area whole. but maybe han want sit next me. because much fit tietmeyer trichet, also alphabet. i always greatly appreciate work him, i learn lot germany. han tietmeyer’s period president deutsche bundesbank coincide turbulence international financial markets. by comparison recent global financial crisis, mexican crisis asian crisis le dramatic european perspective. nevertheless, han tietmeyer recognise early stage threat unstable financial market could pose globalise world economy, initiative financial stability forum establish 1999. ten year later, one response global financial crisis enhancement financial stability forum, become financial stability board. the number participant 2 bi review 38/2010 increase remit extended. the financial stability board thereby become key institution reform international financial system. above all, though, han tietmeyer’s time bundesbank mark preparation monetary union. his tireless support rule ensure stability single currency prove entirely justified. the euro area’s 330 million citizen benefit fact currency wallet solid deutsche mark use (“so hart wie die d-mark”). the euro – stable currency the euro strong stable predecessors. the ecb ensure price stability euro area. at end year, average inflation rate since 1999 will, probability, around 1.95% – i.e. 2%. thus, euro need shy away comparison deutsche mark. the average inflation rate germany 1990s prior introduction euro 2.2%. in 1980s 2.9%. many people still don’t want believe it, euro increase inflation. however, price stability mean advantage germany enjoy result monetary union. without euro, financial crisis would certainly trigger additional turbulence currency markets, also cause damage german economy. people like han directly involve em crisis know talk about. in book “the euro challenge”, memory event 1992 1993 head – appropriately, i think – “monetary earthquake” “strong aftershock”. the successful resolution crisis another one han tietmeyer’s last achievements. europe’s monetary integration could end failure result episode. price stability is, without doubt, best contribution central bank make people’s well-being. nevertheless, many people virtually don’t take much notice central banks’ operation normal times. furthermore, mechanism transmission monetary policy decision complicated. this make important people able rely delivery price stability. in case ecb eurosystem, rely it. price stability primary objective. the govern council define price stability increase harmonise index consumer price euro area 2% medium term. the govern council has, addition, specify strive increase “below, close to, 2%”. with aid quantitative definition, succeed firmly anchor inflation expectation low level. this great assistance u period increase decrease inflationary pressures. the central bank work hard low inflation expectations, achieve primarily result decade credibly follow stability-oriented policies. those inflation expectation fundamental importance success monetary policy. it would therefore serious mistake aim high level inflation future. consequently, i stress number occasions, i strongly oppose idea. pandora’s box must remain shut. the weaken price stability objective question. price stability benefit u all. it safeguard purchase power value savings, prevent arbitrary redistribution wealth. only presence price stability price mechanism function efficient transparent manner. it main instrument steer market economy. bi review 38/2010 3 independence guarantee stability-oriented monetary policy an important requirement delivery price stability independence central bank. we know result painful learn process central bank undergo past. germany one first country independent central bank. i governor banque de france become fully independent. central bank independence “europeanised” become model ecb. on 1 january 1994, 16 year ago, i saw enormous difference make preside fully independent institution. it long demonstrate – theoretically empirically – central bank good able ensure low stable level inflation independent. of course, independence mean arbitrariness. instead, independence tie concrete objective. and independence require accountability. in case ecb, mandate specify delivery price stability primary objective. the quantitative definition price stability contribute anchor inflation expectations. it also provide people objective yardstick judge work. the mandate independence eurosystem enshrine europe’s treaties. these quasi-constitutional nature. monetary policy remove remit national politics. at time, ecb – like central bank – cannot complain lack advice politicians. this something tradition come independent central banks. don’t forget adenauer’s famous “guillotine speech” 1956. half century later, head state government attempt – again, unsuccessfully – influence monetary policy ecb. when growth weaken 2003 2004 leader three large euro area country demand instant reduction interest rates. the govern council refuse reduce rates, i proud refer adenauer precedent. later, end 2005, many government warn increase interest rates. we indeed increase rates, ecb stick mandate, today nobody dispute fact decision correct. at time, however, considerable pressure. we withstand pressure. in cases, criticism independent central bank spark restrictive decisions. expansionary policy rarely criticised. this show many pressure groups, well politicians, often short-term pressure, don’t think term time horizon consider central bankers. the ecb independent. it allow government, institution lobby influence monetary policy decisions. the citizen germany rest europe rely u continue deliver price stability year come. our defence mandate resolute first 11 year monetary union. a monetary policy pursue short-term objective doom failure. however, focus long term mean independent central bank also stand contrast short-termism financial markets. the global financial crisis also fundamentally result short-term thinking. challenge arise financial crisis the handle financial crisis economic consequence great challenge u all. government central bank intervene massive scale order stabilise financial system real economy. the monetary policy measure adopt eurosystem allow inflation expectation keep stable even crisis. from beginning, 4 bi review 38/2010 intervention design way allow u unwind easily soon condition improved. at time lose sight price stability objective. countries’ budget deficit rise substantially account crisis. rise debt level bring potential great conflict fiscal monetary policy. above all, also place burden sustainability public finance country question. it therefore interest every country return sound public finance quickly possible. in current circumstances, europe face pivotal decisions, important ever recognise prosperous union require determine action all. the important issue europe’s policy-makers live responsibilities. a i mention yesterday, govern council european central bank always stress need preserve reinforce peer surveillance inside euro area, strictly apply treaty provision stability growth pact, best function possible commission eurogroup. particularly regard government member eurogroup, ecb’s govern council always consider important would, college, live important responsibility regard fiscal policies, monitor relative competitiveness structural reforms. i therefore please head state government euro area could work solution, implement early declaration “take determine coordinate action, needed…”, maintain lead responsibility european policy makers. monetary union europe far monetary arrangement. a han tietmeyer say many year ago, monetary union community share common destiny. and forget also community values. price stability best contribution central bank make stability financial system. price stability even necessary condition financial stability. however, price stability sufficient condition. many people share responsibility financial stability, must live responsibility. the crisis reveal weakness institutional framework. thus far, sufficiently possible encourage member state implement policy line benchmark. fiscal policies, wage policy structural policy must conform stability target inflation 2%. i convince find way achieve this. conclusion before i finish, i like recount short anecdote. once, raymond barre prime minister [1976–1981], ask me, give i work treasury, whether i often travel brussels. in case, said, i must meet han tietmeyer. he said: “he influential, tough negotiator. if issue discus him, good luck!” that considerable compliment. germany europe much thank han tietmeyer for. he resolute ensure euro would stable currency. today, cope bad financial crisis since world war ii, say confidence euro stable currency since inception euro area stable community. a i say earlier, han tietmeyer author book entitle “the euro challenge”. i certain euro equal challenge. thank you. bi review 38/2010 1 glenn stevens: recent financial development address mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, aci2010 49th world congress, sydney, 26 march 2010. * * * welcome back sydney. the last time body meet 1992. at time australian economy early phase recovery deep recession. pessimism future deeply rooted. the financial system considerable strain. unemployment double digit still rising. inflation fall significantly, many people think temporary impact downturn. they think get recovery – despair – would return old bad habit high inflation. people worry lot australia’s substantial current account deficit. there relatively optimists. you might notice sort think today, countries. i imagine among participant 1992 meet one could get pretty long odds australia long upswing, inflation average “two point something”, survive financial crisis ensue global downturn one mild domestic downturn seen, face future fair degree confidence. this show hard forecast, course. but perhaps also demonstrate time, effort, discipline, good policy bite luck, economy return health citizen prosperity. financial market recovery to end, helpful global financial system gradually recover poise, near-death experience eighteen month ago. perhaps like patient suffer acute cardiac event, last tissue damage, quick intervention avoid something much worse. a period emergency life-support follow period recuperation, ongoing medication, patient able gradually resume normal activities. certainly function money market improve substantially. extreme counterparty risk aversion abate spread libor rate equivalent maturity ois rate come low level since mid 2007. the dramatic expansion balance sheet central bank major economy largely ended, though policy interest rate remain 50-year lows. australia’s situation advance regard. the expansion rba’s balance sheet unwind nearly year ago policy rate increase somewhat, reflect different circumstance face australian economy. but country seek manage “return normality”. an increase number country outside directly affect crisis begin process – though speed adjustment naturally depend national conditions. capital market also improved, spread sovereign bond yield private borrower across risk spectrum back “pre-lehman” levels, best rat borrower back almost mid-2007 levels. they quite back pre-crisis levels, then, probably low level anyway. similarly, spread emerge market sovereign well peaks. in fact overall borrow cost quality corporates emerge market sovereign similar slightly 2006. this fine price accompany gradual pick-up debt issuance. 2 bi review 38/2010 appetite risk increase significantly since end 2008, albeit occasional setbacks. of course expect would increased, since september october 2008 characterise sheer panic – word – flight virtually risk all. once global financial system actually go precipice, go re-appraisal. hence, even evidence continue emerge first half 2009 dramatic fall demand good services, share price spot commodity price begin recover. share price 60 per cent high “priced disaster” low point, commodity price index increase third. some individual commodity price rise much more. similarly, see preparedness take foreign currency risk, flow emerge market involve foreign currency credit risk increased. again, risk appetite return heady day mid 2000s, it. even flow see begin raise concern among policy maker emerge country potential risk asset market excess eventual capital flow reversal. the bank sector for major financial institutions, picture also improved. the general decline risk aversion ease fund problems, country able terminate scale back government guarantee program bank increasingly able access term fund market names. share price financial institution still privately own generally increase broad market. a number large american european bank accept public-sector capital injection crisis move repay them. the challenge remain ahead bank system major country nonetheless remain considerable. the outlook remain government ownership stake remain unclear. while loss come write-down security slow time back, loss still occur lend book result normal effect big recessions, least area commercial property. this continue while. in addition, banks, particularly large internationally active bank big trade operations, require additional capital time propose change global prudential standards. there considerable contrast picture one bank countries. it important note majority country bank crisis such. everyone affect seize market late 2008, afflict sort asset quality capital issue bedevil large us, uk continental european banks. this turn mean panic subsided, bank country able continue carry function – albeit difficult circumstance face much subdue demand credit, particularly corporations. australia good example this, though one. the low rate return equity earn among major bank past two year 10 per cent underlie terms; among small bank low 3 per cent. when market securitisation close major bank step gap increase rate house lending, albeit high prices. these bank able support business customer – price – previous cycle might choose cut. the rate provision bad loan stop rise several banks, non-performing loan likely peak considerably low share loan early expected. this general picture, even exact numbers, would, i suspect, replicate across much asia. these difference experience important backdrop international work regulatory reforms. there question must significant reform. to use bi review 38/2010 3 medical analogy again, recover patient usually advise consider dietary lifestyle changes, perhaps submit ongoing monitoring, order avoid emergency procedures. these change involve:  remove scope take excessive leverage via regulatory arbitrage;  make sure adequate capital hold risk incurred;  ensure good management fund liquidity;  countering, extent possible, inherent tendency human nature regulation form assessment risk pro-cyclical way;  improve resolution process ensure orderly rapid crisis management help manage issue “too-big-to-fail” institutions. these important goals. the australian authority support them. but say before, really serious problem generate relatively small number large, internationally active banks. they stem thousand bank around world need “bailed out” whose capital resource have, cases, prove adequate cover normal loss cyclical downswing. hence important shackle unnecessarily latter group effort constrain relatively small number cause much problem. challenge sovereign debt turn bank market generally, recent development increase focus sovereign debt creditworthiness. the initial manifestation late last year dubai world request six-month standstill agreement debt repayments. more recently, focus greece, reveal greek government’s current borrow requirement much large previously disclosed. greece small country – account half one per cent world’s gdp. the significance greece euro area country, mean two things. first, adjustment predicament cannot involve currency depreciation (unless leave single currency). the way grow problem gain competitiveness european economy via domestic deflation, difficult lengthy process. a large fiscal consolidation unavoidable part path. second, euro area interest effort succeeding, intense discussion whether, form, european assistance might forthcoming. any assistance would course pas test credibility generally europe, would need applicable similar term euro area country needed. this obviously difficult problem, policymakers concern continue work. perhaps broad significance difficulty face greece, unusually stark, reminder challenge face many government europe, matter unite state britain, long haul. ratio debt gdp rise quite significantly cases. there several reasons. the first size recession experienced, obviously reduce revenue add category spend – so-called “automatic stabilisers”. this effect relatively large european country occur everywhere extent. the second factor discretionary budgetary decision aim stimulate demand inject capital banks. in circumstances, former understandable; latter unavoidable. 4 bi review 38/2010 the “automatic stabilisers” presumably “automatically” move budget position right direction economy recover. the cost stimulus bank rescue measures, one-off nature, leave debt permanently higher. but without measures, economy might suffer much deep downturn extent budget deterioration could much greater, leave even big debt legacy. if end story, would want get worked-up debt ratios. unfortunately, though, story. for several important country trend increase debt-to-gdp ratio go crisis occurred. for domestic audience, let clear australia conspicuous exception. particularly mainland europe, pattern tend debt ratio rise quickly period recession, stabilise years, rise next recession. no doubt multiple factor work interaction change demographic generous welfare, health retirement system prominent. the factor also work, thing equal, lessen future potential economic growth. it certainly unprecedented country debt stock much large annual gdps. this usually see face requirement fight wars. those ratio subsequently come time. but situation different. the decline debt ratio see second world war, example, drive rapid growth output population expand productivity surged, easily repeat many major countries. it deep-seated trends, place crisis, really great cause concern; crisis bring sharply focus. the demographic driver continue foreseeable future, unwillingness inability tackle structural trend early “good times” significantly reduce future flexibility. so number advance industrial country face difficult fiscal decision year ahead. at point, significant discretionary tighten required. of course policymakers need get recovery well entrenched, many observer warn attempt early fiscal consolidation. but unless credible path fiscal sustainability also set out, growth could easily stunt rise risk premia build interest rate market worry long-run solvency. this happen yet; long-term rate many major advance country remain quite low. that provide window within plan eventual consolidation. since market fickle thing change, government surely want use window. economic recovery in mean time difference persist pace economic recovery across regions. in unite state growth spur swing inventory cycle think mark turn point second half 2009, observer still expect moderate growth year. in europe, momentum recovery le certain. in case old forecast cliché uncertainty apply spades. in contrast, apparent letter “v” reasonable description trajectory, date, important emerge country like china, india, brazil number small east asian countries. we expect see moderation pace growth production case year. this usually case “v-shaped” recoveries, since initial pace expansion considerably high long run sustainable growth rate. the question happen demand country course distinct happen production. full employment part emerge world probably bi review 38/2010 5 reach full employment north america europe. productive capacity therefore would remain meet demand emerge world, via import good service “old world”. that is, emerge asia part world could see live standard rise bite fast increase productivity, time, prepare meet demand imports. facilitate efficiently would course involve, among things, allow exchange rate change. the alternative approach would seek slow growth demand emerge world production approach full capacity, maintain internal balance give set exchange rates. but would leave unused capacity industrial country emerge world live standard low could be. these polar case – would course open policymakers steer path between. among asian policy maker many factor go think exchange rate trade capital flows. they degree suspicion rapid capital flow large movement exchange rates, understandable experience late 1990s. it also understandable small economies, extremely open, trade share 100 per cent gdp, wish see volatile exchange rate disruptive economies. moreover, issue go well beyond exchange rate per se; involve save investment patterns, national policy approach growth, speed adjust on. the point, nonetheless, current prospective difference economic circumstance significant part world likely put strain relative set macroeconomic policy exchange rate arrangements. this need careful management, concerned, next years. conclusion the stabilisation financial market bank system past year welcome development us. there still difficulty overcome financial institution key country result depth recessions, subject attention come year. look ahead, difference speed economic recovery start present challenge own, show capital flows, asset valuation exchange rates. when add loom long-term requirement fiscal consolidation number major countries, plenty market policy maker alike think about. i’m sure conference take issue great energy. i wish every success so. bi review 38/2010 1 daniel k tarullo: lesson crisis stress test speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, federal reserve board international research forum monetary policy, washington dc, 26 march 2010. * * * effective response dire situation often require bold action would unthinkable calm times. so financial crisis, central bank undertake extraordinary monetary policy measure government make major financial firm ward state. yet sometimes crisis also accelerate adoption policy practice might beneficially implement beforehand sensibly continue crisis passed. this even i examine instance latter phenomenon, define federal reserve’s experience comprehensive stress test major financial institution crisis. the supervisory capital assessment program (scap) fashion early 2009 key element crucial plan stabilize u.s. financial system. the stress tests, popularly called, require development fly, enormous pressure, idea academic supervisor consider time. after describe concept, design, implementation last year’s tests, i explain experience help prompt major change federal reserve supervision nation’s large financial institutions. then i discus experience stimulate debate merit publicly release supervisory information.1 origin execution supervisory capital assessment program by february 2009, many step already take restore health of, confidence in, u.s. banks. the u.s. treasury inject capital bank trouble asset relief program (tarp). the federal deposit insurance corporation expand guarantee bank liability temporary liquidity guarantee program. and federal reserve establish number lend program provide liquidity financial institution addition aggressive monetary policy actions. despite actions, great deal uncertainty remain future bank loss solvency, increase rapidly deteriorate macroeconomic condition early 2009. the treasury determine confidence could best restore make additional capital available bank unable raise private source amount necessary continue function effective financial intermediary even economic condition worsen appreciably. to evaluate much capital individual institution might require, u.s. bank supervisors, lead federal reserve, undertake stringent, forward-looking assessment prospective loss revenue – stress test – 19 large u.s. banks. use tarp funds, treasury establish capital assistance program (cap) provide need capital. let summarize mechanic stress tests. first, february 2009, scap bank ask perform capital-adequacy stress test two economic scenario – baseline adverse – use specify assumption gross domestic product (gdp) growth, unemployment, house prices. the baseline scenario reflect consensus expectation among professional forecaster depth duration 1 the view express remark necessarily member board governors. 2 bi review 38/2010 recession. the adverse scenario design severe plausible, probability roughly 10 15 percent macroeconomic variable could bad specified. the bank ask provide projection loss revenue two scenarios. loss project two-year horizon least 12 separate category loan asset classes, use year-end 2008 financial statement data start point. to guide banks, supervisor provide indicative loss-rate range system whole, derive analysis historical loss experience large bank quantitative model relate loan performance macroeconomic variables. bank inform loss estimate indicative range would closely scrutinized. second, supervisory team evaluate banks’ estimate identify methodological weaknesses, miss information, overly optimistic assumptions, problems. examiner detail conversation bank managers, lead numerous modification banks’ submissions. supervisor make judgmental adjustment banks’ loss revenue estimate base sensitivity analysis perform firms, comparative analysis across firms, supervisors’ judgments. third, supervisor supplement judgmental assessment objective, model-based estimate loss revenue could apply consistent basis across firms. each participate institution ask supply, standardize format, detail information supervisor could use estimate loss revenues, detail loan characteristics. these data allow supervisor make consistent estimate use independently construct models. finally, supervisor systematically incorporate input loss, revenue, reserve estimate institution. these estimate combine information exist reserve capital project capital buff bank would need two scenarios. a know, unlike country conduct stress exercises, take highly unusual step publicly report find scap, include capital need loss estimate 19 banks.2 this departure standard practice keep examination information confidential base belief great transparency process find would help restore confidence u.s. bank time great uncertainty. supervisor release methodology assumption underlie stress test first then, two week later, result individual institutions. the result show adverse scenario, 10 19 scap bank would need raise total $75 billion capital order capital buff target scap – tier 1 capital excess 6 percent risk-weighted asset tier 1 common capital excess 4 percent risk-weighted asset end two-year horizon. the merit publicly release firm-specific scap result much debate within federal reserve. in particular, fear weak bank might significantly harm disclosures. in end, though, market participant vindicate decision. they appear reassure three reasons. first, result deem credible market participants, owe part release detail assumption methods, well variation assessment banks. second, result release time uncertainty bank condition high, market participant fear worst. that is, perception tail risk high, scap result help reassure market participant severe plausible scenario, capital need large u.s. bank manageable. third, treasury stand ready 2 board governor federal reserve system (2009), “federal reserve, occ, fdic release result supervisory capital assessment program,” press release, may 7. bi review 38/2010 3 make capital available scap bank capital need cap unable raise private capital. in retrospect, clear public release scap result play important role stabilize financial system, supervisory follow-up improve capital levels. by november 2009, 10 bank require additional capital increase tier 1 common equity $77 billion, primarily issue new common equity, convert exist prefer equity common equity, sell business portfolio assets. none scap bank receive cap funds.3 many observer initially criticize stress test overly optimistic. on one hand, note gdp growth weak unemployment high 2009 project adverse scenario. on hand, house price fall much assume adverse scenario. a end 2009, actual loss 19 bank le one-half two-year loss estimate adverse scap scenario, actual revenue one-half two-year revenue estimates. nevertheless, wide variation across firms, soon tell whether firm perform good full two year scap estimates. the lesson scap a i suggest outset remarks, i doubt anything ambitious scap would try – least soon – exigency financial crisis. yet approach take scap inform discussion take place among supervisor academic time. not surprisingly, backdrop crisis, scap experience elaborate confirm principle advocate internally supervisors, broadly incorporate practice regulatory agencies. first, whether conduct bank supervisors, stress test must consider severe plausible scenarios, include low probability event potentially highly adverse effects. in period lead crisis – characterize strong profits, excess liquidity, low credit loss – many bank regulator skeptical possibility rapid severe deterioration ultimately occur u.s. housing, mortgage, short-term fund markets. if crisis teach u anything, must test tail, mode. a relate point stress test useful apply full range credit trade exposures. second, good management-information system critical ability firm manage risks. assess risk exposure across entire organization essential understand potential effect correlate risk exposure may reside distinct business line well different legal entity regulatory jurisdictions. yet scap, many bank unable quickly consistently consolidate risk exposure across products, business lines, legal entities, geographies. it little good run stress test, even one use sophisticate quantitative model, effectively capture relevant exposure bank’s information system poorly manage integrated. third, scap highlight importance multiple input risk-assessment process. it critical have, use, best available data. but equally important become slave one model method estimate losses. it precisely combination rigorous, data-driven analysis consider judgment 3 gmac receive capital injection treasury tarp’s automotive industry finance program. 4 bi review 38/2010 make stress test successful. the interactive iterative nature process help refine method assessment. fourth, scap underscore importance horizontal macroprudential perspective supervise bank organizations. during scap, simultaneous, consistent, comparative cross-firm assessment allow broad analysis risks, easy identification outliers, good evaluation individual firm estimates. because scap bank hold majority u.s. bank assets, also allow good understand interrelationship systemic risks. turn scap experience inform supervisory policies, i think effect best understand overall context reform motivate financial crisis. like regulator around world, develop implement improvement capital prudential rules. the congress consider legislative proposal enhance market discipline mean special resolution mechanism large financial firm affect structure financial service industry measure volcker rule limitation acquisition systemically important firms. these three mode reform – rules, market discipline, structural measure – must complement more-effective supervisory oversight, particularly largest, complex financial institutions. to end, federal reserve implement closely coordinate supervisory system cross-firm, horizontal perspective organize supervisory principle. we concentrate activity within hold company create risk firm financial system, increase risk insure depository institutions. an essential component new system quantitative surveillance mechanism large, complex financial organization combine macroprudential, multidisciplinary approach horizontal perspective. quantitative surveillance use supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, market-based indicator identify develop strain imbalance may affect multiple institutions, well emerge risk specific firms. periodic forward-looking scenario analysis enhance understand potential effect adverse change operate environment individual firm system whole. in fact, i believe useful step toward create practical, macroprudential supervisory perspective connect firm-specific information insight gain traditional microprudential supervision analysis systemwide development emerge stresses. here, precisely, scap experience help lead way. the question transparency one important element scap yet incorporate ongoing supervisory plan public disclosure stress test information. i think issue deserve consideration. a i recently testified, access higher-quality more-timely information financial products, firms, market necessary effective supervision.4 make data public – degree consistent protect firm-specific proprietary information – would additional benefits. in specific context great transparency supervisory stress tests, i see least two. first, release detail assumptions, methods, conclusion would expose supervisory approach great outside scrutiny discussion. sometimes 4 daniel k. tarullo (2010), “equipping financial regulator tool necessary monitor systemic risk,” statement subcommittee security international trade finance, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u.s. senate, february 12. bi review 38/2010 5 discussion help u improve assumption methodology. at time disclosure might reassure investor quality tests. either way, public’s reaction assumption method would useful. second, loan portfolio inherently difficult value without great deal detail information, increase transparency could important addition information available investor counterparties large institutions. if, i believe, progress too-big-to-fail problem integral effective reform financial regulation, must enhance market discipline. the market discipline make possible mean special resolution mechanism contingent capital effective market participant adequate information make inform judgment banks. there are, sure, countervail concerns. in normal economic times, market participant fear bad bank access government capital injection backstop, revelation major bank may capital need stress scenario might unnecessarily destabilizing. this possibility would increase market participant attach undue weight specific capital loss number release government. in practical terms, several way might increase transparency. one, course, would follow scap precedent, periodic release detail information assumptions, methods, result cross-firm, horizontal, forward-looking exercise, include firm-specific outcomes. this approach would probably maximize potential benefit potential risks. note, however, possibility destabilize market reaction may low information release frequently, major unpleasant surprise would le likely frequent, detail disclosures. of course, significant change economic environment might still lead unpleasant surprise result released.5 a second option would provide detail assumption method supervisor employ stress test withhold public release result individual banks. this practice could couple requirement systematic, timely, consistent disclosure large bank information material firmwide risk position exposures, fund liquidity profiles, operate performance, measures. like first approach, option would benefit open supervisors’ method discussion. by increase disclosure banks’ risk exposures, approach would also enhance market discipline, market participant could make forward-looking assessment banks’ conditions. however, benefit would lost, since information individual bank would standardize verify regulators. concomitantly, risk overreaction release information would still exist, would single number market participant could focus. a third possibility would supervisor release aggregate result horizontal, forward-looking assessments, along detail assumption methods, without require additional disclosure firms. this approach could still confer considerable benefit provide information public overall condition bank system well supervisory methods. it has, fact, apply japan’s financial service agency (fsa), conduct special bank inspection 2002 2003, japanese bank still recover crisis. the fsa publicly release aggregate result show difference banks’ fsa’s assessment loan quality, show fsa’s assessment stringent banks’. many major bank subsequently increase loan loss reserves, 5 in addition, would important assure routine release select supervisory information undermine ability maintain confidentiality supervisory information. 6 bi review 38/2010 inspection appear increase confidence bank system. of course, informational benefit market participant could substantially dilute unable distinguish condition individual firm reflect aggregate numbers. conclusion to conclude, sense degree experience scap experience inform change supervision large institution part broad enterprise regulatory reform. a issue stress test transparency, i look forward hear others ass merit alternative approach i describe and, course, new ideas. bi review 37/2010 1 jean-claude trichet: introductory statement plenary european parliament speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, plenary european parliament, brussels, 25 march 2010. * * * introduction sehr geehrter herr präsident, sehr geehrte damen und herr abgeordnete, ich freue mich, anlässlich d debatte zur entschließung über den jahresbericht 2008 d europäischen zentralbank heute bei ihnen zu sein. aufgrund d parlamentswahlen im vergangen jahr hat sich die diesjährige debatte deutlich verschoben. aber dy eröffnet mir die möglichkeit, die wesentlichen entwicklungen im letzten jahr vor d neu gewählten plenarversammlung zu erörtern, und ende auch auf die aktuelle lage einzugehen. comme vous le savez, la bce se félicite de relation très étroites avec le parlement, qui vont bien au-delà de obligation prévues par le traité. nous avon établi, au fil de années, un dialogue très fructueux. aujourd’hui, dans mon exposé, je passerai brièvement en revue le évolutions économiques observées en 2009 et le mesures de politique monétaire prise par la bce. ensuite, j’aborderai quelques point soulevés dans votre proposition de résolution et je terminerai par quelques remarques sur la situation actuelle. 1. economic development monetary policy past year so key development economy monetary policy past year? in 2009, european central bank operate environment future economic historian likely describe difficult one advance economy since second world war. follow profound intensification financial crisis autumn 2008, year 2009 start continue synchronise fall economic activity worldwide. until around april last year, economic activity declining, month month, fast model predicted. that often characterise experience “free fall” economic activity. the immediate policy action take central banks, government parliament across world stop “free fall” lay foundation gradual recovery europe elsewhere course 2009. i would venture say central banks, government parliament around world act resolutely did, could become difficult episode advance economy since first world war. the ecb vanguard world’s central banks. we confirm capability take bold timely action. 2 bi review 37/2010 our “trademark”, vital maintain confidence, ability take necessary immediate exceptional decision whilst, time, remain inflexibly attach primary objective maintain price stability medium term. the ecb’s medium-term orientation interest rate policy design non-standard measure help contain emergence deflationary inflationary risks. inflation expectation remain well anchor throughout crisis, provide essential support real economy bank system financial markets. some important non-standard measure use unlimited provision liquidity banks, extension operation period one year moderate, yet highly effective purchase programme cover bank bonds, reactivate segment bank fund market. overall, non-standard monetary policy measure – know collectively “enhanced credit support” – serve euro area economy well. they support function money market, contribute improve finance condition allow good flow credit real economy could achieve interest rate reduction alone. by large, bank pass sharply low key ecb interest rate household businesses. design timely exit strategy non-standard measure central part ecb’s response crisis. in september last year, set overall strategy. in december, decide implementation. the guide principle extent situation return normal, keep measure place long require risk change behaviour financial market participant undesirable manner. we wish breed dependency. thus, december 2009, begin gradually phase extraordinary liquidity measures, take account improvement financial markets. in particular, scale back number, frequency maturity longer-term refinance operations. but commit maintain fully accommodate liquidity support euro area

vice-chancellors; member entire university community; distinguish guests; lady gentlemen: it pleasure honour address distinguish audience topical timely issue eac integration solution economic growth employment generation kenya eac region. i wish focus talk domestic regional policy initiative impact growth, specifically employment situation kenya. may i start point unemployment reflect inability economic activity absorb labour human resource different levels. when talk economic activity, mean growth. it allow economic opportunity emerge. the important one; investment opportunity increase demand human capital. so employment derive demand, demand economic activity increase investment. but regional integration improve economic activity (growth) member country increase labour absorption – employment? this question need focus attention on. let try quick avenues: 1. eac provide wide market – induce firms’ production expansion size product line – satisfy wide market. 2. a large market require large investment outlay. 3. a large market diversify source income flows. 4. financial service cover region adjust high platform: instance, kenyan bank currently expand region significant way. the apply number sector retail service evident expansion nakumatt uchumi retail shop region. 5. large demand regional infrastructure facilitate trade production. the list long depend one starts, end, labour demand derive demand economic activities. to develop topic kenya, i wish develop three argument kenya’s case: first, policy solutions, evolution shocks; it often good start perspective policies, implemented, work even shock hit economy, economy return potential. how long take return potential determine pervasive persistent shock were. have say that, blue print growth employment creation lay narc government – “economic recovery strategy wealth employment creation” cover period 2003–2007. this bore fruit economy pick low 0.5 percent annual growth 2002 6.3 percent 2006 7.1

paradigm show success always generate success. once policy follow paper, generate desire results. but external internal shock hit economy 2008 step in. however, economy recovery path expect grow 2.1 percent 2009 3 4.5 percent 2010 5 percent subsequent years. it important perhaps explain time shocks, growth, investment even economic decision affect even affect outcome like consumption employment. three example include: 1. at individual level optimize welfare uncertainty. 2. irreversibility fix investment decisions. 3. informal sector expansion disequilibrium queue model employment. these short-run condemn u low equilibrium trap. second, eac common market potential employment.  in general, country africa form regional economic integration arrangement order to; secure access large market enhance trade flow process attract much need foreign direct investments; low trade cost among neighbours; leverage lock domestic reforms; create framework regional cooperation resource pooling; increase bargain power political cohesion.  economic integration potential economic growth; create wealth; improve labour social condition result good division labour country base comparative

finally, vision 2030 unemployment kenya: the vision 2030 aim transform kenya newly-industrialised, middle income country: mean solve unemployment problem kenya? to solve unemployment, need long-run vision growth investment support short-run policy like macroeconomic policies, specifically: fiscal monetary policy also trade policies. 4 bi review 37/2010 a) fiscal policy fiscal stimulus the

consolidate public finances. the second realignment capital flows, give likelihood extend period low interest rate advance economies. and third challenge increase domestic demand asia. (i) public finance of three issues, one attract attention recently public finances. this partly result go greece but, broadly, reflect difficult fiscal position many advance economy currently find themselves. in unite states, federal budget deficit 2009 around 10 per cent bi review 37/2010 3 gdp. in japan, deficit almost large, euro area whole around 6 per cent, euro area country much large deficit average. furthermore, large deficit come three decade ratio public debt gdp g7 economy whole trend high (graph 4). they also come time significant medium-term budget pressure due age population. graph 4 0408004080g7 – net public debtper cent gdpsource: imf2014%200920041999199419891984% over come years, many government need take significant step improve public finances. the flexibility determine time size step limit fact go current downturn already high level debt. a result poor start points, many tread fairly narrow path. on one hand, tighten fiscal policy near term risk derail recovery, risk damage loss confidence. how risk manage likely major effect world economy evolve next years. presumably, require affect country credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies. while easy say do, ensure confidence investor important ingredient recovery sustained. (ii) capital flow this bring second, related, issue – capital flows. most advance economy currently operate well full capacity and, give subdue nature recovery, likely time excess capacity wind back. one consequence that, provide inflation expectation remain well anchored, official interest rate economy – currently historically low level – likely remain average considerable period time (graph 5). in contrast, elsewhere, include asia australia growth stronger, interest rate likely relatively higher. this interest differential likely lead flow capital major advance economy asia better-performing area world. 4 bi review 37/2010 graph 5 0481204812g7 – average policy ratesources: federal reserve bank new york; global financial data; thomson reuters2010%19901970%200019801960 in asia, concern already emerge implication this. in particular, country worry potential volatile capital flow destabilise economies. the concern capital inflow near term late turn capital outflow interest rate advance economy eventually normalise, could disruptive. a way insure risk, central bank continue accumulate foreign reserves. a number country region also concern effect capital inflow domestic bank systems, take step rein bank lend growth, particularly case property price increase strongly. a relate consideration effect capital flow exchange rate region. in general, considerably le tolerance large movement exchange rate many country australia. in case, movement value australian dollar largely see stabilise force economy. there also general acceptance view that, next years, real exchange rate likely high average past decade so. in contrast, much asia, international trade share considerably high australia, movement exchange rate tend view concern, particularly see drive speculative capital flows. one relate consideration impact asset market around world extend period low official interest rate major advance economies. when global economy situation around five year ago thing work well. while current environment different middle 2000s, early experience suggest need watch financial side global economy carefully, particularly interest rate unusually low. (iii) domestic demand asia the third issue i would like touch growth domestic demand asia. for decades, many country asia growth strategy focus exports. give strong growth consumption major western economies, strategy worked. however, many country asia recognise give subdue outlook advance economies, need strong emphasis growth domestic demand case past. china provide good example here. over past two decades, share household consumption chinese gdp decline 50 per cent 35 per cent – bi review 37/2010 5 low level international standards. this decline reflect two broad developments. the first reduction share national income go households; early 1990s, share stand nearly 70 per cent, late 2008, fall le 60 per cent (graph 6). the second factor increase household save rate; early 1990s, around 30 per cent household income saved, today share close 40 per cent. graph 6 china – household income saving55606570556065702530354025303540sources: ceic; rba2008disposable incomeshare nominal

consumption growth often see something would follow strong exports, rather driver economy itself. this view gradually change lead increase focus structural reform increase share national income go household sector reduce household save rate. while reform area difficult, important asia, whole, continue grow strongly face subdue demand export region. how thing play three area – public-sector debt, capital flow structural policy asia – significant impact global environment australian economy find year ahead. a reserve bank spell number time recently, central scenario relatively positive one. the economy asia expect continue grow reasonably solidly, advance economy expect subdue recovery, weigh need consolidate balance sheet household public sectors. around central scenario are, however, clearly risks, particularly associate three issue i touch on. give risks, one question policy set? the reserve bank’s general approach proceed basis central scenario, prepare respond thing

causes, intensity scope reflect unprecedented disequilibria. large unsustainable current account imbalance across major economic area integral buildup vulnerability many asset markets. in recent years, international monetary system fail promote timely orderly economic adjustment.14 further postpone adjustment serve increase vulnerabilities. in past, frustration adjustment current account surplus country generate deflationary pressure rest world. similarly, today, adjustment burden shift others. some advance country – include canada – recently see sizable appreciation currencies. their ability increase domestic demand response limited. 14 this failure ample precedents. over past century, different international monetary regime struggle adjust structural changes, include integration emerge economy global economy. in cases, systemic country fail adapt domestic policy manner consistent monetary system day. a result, adjustment delayed, vulnerability grew, reckoning, came, disruptive all. bi review 36/2010 5 the net result could suboptimal global recovery, adjustment burden country large imbalance fall largely domestic price wages, rather nominal exchange rates. history suggest process either could take years, repress global output welfare interim lead another crisis, would accelerate adjustment, terrible cost. the g-20 framework could address issue the g-20 framework promote strong, sustainable, balance growth global demand, launch last november st. andrews, scotland, attempt learn lesson history. the g-20 framework stress share responsibility country global economic performance. under framework, member agree mutual assessment monetary, exchange rate, fiscal, financial policies, assistance international monetary fund (imf). the implication policy level pattern global growth risk financial stability review finance minister central bank governor preparation agreement common action g-20 leader canada south korea year. to illustrate stake, bank canada generate three scenario evolution global growth current account positions.15 the first business-as-usual scenario (chart 3). no significant change make current mix policies, create situation similar one lead recent crisis. in particular, advance country make fiscal adjustment necessary stabilize debt dynamics, household save rate increase.16 a well, emerge asia continue finance u.s. deficit reserve accumulation, effectively impede real exchange rate adjustment. in short run, combination policy provide fiscal boost, last. in response rise public debt burden, global interest rate begin rise, crowd private investment ultimately low potential growth. this, turn, worsen fiscal situation. global economic growth fall steadily and, 2013, 2.7 per cent (compared 4 per cent average rate great moderation 2002–07). more alarmingly, global imbalance reassert explosive rate. path public external debt unsustainable could lead another crisis. an obvious lesson draw scenario advance country need engage fiscal consolidation medium term. indeed, express policy industrialise countries. but would alone sufficient rebalance global economy? consider second scenario fiscal consolidation advance country debt-to-gdp stabilize 2015 (chart 4).17 other country maintain current policies. in particular, neither real effective exchange rate adjustment increase trend domestic demand growth asia’s emerge economies. 15 note scenario purely illustrative represent bank’s base-case projection. they generate use boc-gem-fin, bank’s global general-equilibrium macro model. see k. beaton, c. de resende, r. lalonde, s. snudden, “prospects global current account rebalancing,” bank canada discussion paper, forthcoming 2010. 16 country make necessary fiscal adjustment stabilize debt dynamics. there stabilization debt-to-gdp ratio 2015. in “framework” scenario, debt/gdp unite state stabilize around 75 per cent gdp. in “do nothing” scenario, u.s. debt/gdp would reach 95 per cent gdp 2015. 17 at 120 per cent unite states, 130 per cent euro area. 6 bi review 36/2010 in scenario, deficient demand globally. with monetary policy constrain zero low bound, deflation emerges. a consequence, real interest rate increase sharply, growth stalls, fiscal consolidation become difficult. it cold comfort global imbalance effectively eliminated. the cost prolong global recession, massive forego output. if scenario occur, risk protectionism would undoubtedly rise, potentially exacerbate damage. finally, consider “framework scenario,” one highlight large gain g-20 process could – – produce (chart 5). in case, fiscal consolidation second scenario complement policy increase domestic demand emerge asia modest real effective depreciation u.s. dollar (across major currencies). in case, current account imbalance stabilize low level and, importantly, global growth rise 3.7 per cent 2010 4.5 per cent 2011. growth strong, sustainable, balanced. there doubt would much good last scenario (table 1). by

considerable, isn’t assure country take necessary steps? there two issues: misdiagnosis coordination. regard former, view global imbalances, miss opportunity but, rather, modern morality tale. to them, deficit country profligate grasshopper whiling away hour sun, surplus country ant prudently husband resource anticipation winter. the problem diagnosis ignore symbiotic nature global economy.

suggested, country simultaneously export way growth.20 the framework process appeal country’s altruism. a show table 1, framework scenario pareto improve – every region good it. the second issue coordination. to stimulate private domestic demand, surplus country could enhance social safety nets, reform financial system liberate trap save small medium-sized enterprises, sharpen relative price

kohn: homework assignment monetary policymakers speech mr donald l kohn, vice chairman board governor federal reserve system, cornelson distinguish lecture davidson college, davidson, north carolina, 24 march 2010. * * * the event past year raise many question central bankers. although prompt innovative action federal reserve central bank help prevent severe economic downturn turn something even worse, experience also highlight number area need study see whether improve conduct monetary policy. i’ve title presentation “homework assignments” i don’t think answer clear, though i venture tentative thoughts. i four assignment list; i could easily more. and others would yet different list. i recognize complexity question could keep u profitably engage whole semester, let’s see i outline challenge possible response evening. the first two assignment concern policy action federal reserve central bank take financial crisis. a key part federal reserve’s response fulfill traditional role provide backup liquidity sound institution time financial turmoil. in break tradition, provide liquidity nonbank financial institution well banks. one assignment evaluate implication change character financial market design liquidity tool federal reserve disposal panic-driven run bank key financial intermediary market threaten financial stability economy. in addition provide liquidity unprecedented scale, reduce policy interest rate (the target rate overnight loan banks) effectively zero, continue ease financial condition cushion effect financial shock economy make large-scale purchase several type securities. my second assignment involve improve understand effect purchase associate massive increase bank reserves. the third fourth assignment relate whether change conduct monetary policy normal time could make financial instability wrench costly economic consequence le likely. number three involve consider whether central bank use conventional monetary policy tool – adjust level short-term interest rate – try rein asset price seem move well away sustainable values, addition seek achieve macroeconomic objective full employment price stability. the fourth final assignment concern whether central bank adjust inflation target reduce odds get situation policy interest rate reach zero.1 change financial market federal reserve’s liquidity tool financial market evolve substantially recent decades. the task intermediate investor borrower shift time banks, take deposit make loans, security markets, borrower saver meet directly, albeit assistance investment bank help borrower issue security make 1 the view express necessarily colleague board governor federal open market committee. william nelson board’s staff contribute remarks. 2 bi review 36/2010 market securities. an aspect shift growth securitization, loan might book bank convert security sell markets. serious deficiency securitizations, associate derivative instruments, structure evolve hold securitized debt heart financial crisis. among things, structure expose bank system risk neither participant financial market regulator fully appreciated. the implication change far reaching, i want concentrate bear tool use supply liquidity financial system. every central bank adapt liquidity facility degree, federal reserve adapt most. before crisis, federal reserve adjust liquidity provide financial system daily operation relatively small set broker-dealer narrow set collateral – treasury debt, agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities. those transaction effect change quantity reserve balance bank hold federal reserve banks, liquidity distribute interbank fund market bank system unite state around world. in addition, federal reserve stand ready lend directly commercial bank depository institution “discount window.” at discretion, bank could borrow overnight above-market rate broad range collateral need short-term funding. but structure prove inadequate crisis. interbank market stop function effective mean distribute liquidity, increase importance direct lend discount window. at time, however, bank become extremely reluctant borrow federal reserve fear borrow would become know thus cast doubt liquidity condition. importantly, crisis also involve major disruption important fund market institutions. commercial paper market long serve source fund lender nonfinancial businesses; investment bank could borrow even short term secure basis lender begin doubt underlie collateral; bank overseas could reliably exchange currency swap market fund dollar asset beyond short terms; investor pull money market mutual funds. these disruption pose threat availability credit household business run bank bank-centric financial system. intermediary unable fund force sell assets, drive price exacerbate crisis; unwilling make market necessary allow household business borrow; household business unable borrow unable spend, deepen recession. the federal reserve respond provide fund become unavailable bank intermediaries. we reduce spread discount rate target interbank rate, lengthen maximum maturity loan bank overnight 90 days, also provide discount window credit regular auction overcome reluctance borrow. in addition, create emergency liquidity facility meet fund need key market participants, include primary security dealers, money market mutual funds, user short-term fund markets.2 we generally adhere time-honored central bank principle counter financial panic: lend freely solvent institution penalty good collateral. we also lend dollar central bank could help bank jurisdiction meet dollar fund needs, thus ease pressure u.s. money markets. now financial market function much better, close emergency facility create lend nonbanks. the homework assignment think 2 primary dealer broker-dealer trade u.s. government security federal reserve bank new york. bi review 36/2010 3 design liquidity facility go forward. i’ve tentatively conclude recent crisis demonstrate financial system dependent security market banks, need retain ability lend good collateral certain group sound, regulated, nonbank financial firms. i’m suggest establish permanent contingency liquidity facilities, federal reserve retain authority create tool necessary meet liquidity need group nonbank institution panic impair ability security markets, well banks, function board governor find absence function would threaten economy.3 the collateral would good quality institution sound minimize credit risk federal reserve. hold open possibility without cost. with credit potentially available federal reserve, institution would insufficient incentive manage liquidity protect unusual market events. hence, emergency credit would generally provide group institution regulate supervise limit moral hazard. if federal reserve directly supervise institution would potentially receive emergency discount window credit, would need ongoing collaborative relationship supervisor. the supervisor ensure institution implicit access emergency discount window credit nevertheless maintain conservative liquidity policies. the supervisor would also provide critical insight financial condition borrower quality available collateral generally whether lend necessary appropriate. large-scale asset purchase buildup reserve base the federal reserve central bank react deepen crisis fall 2008 open new liquidity facilities, also reduce policy interest rate close zero. such rapid aggressive response expect cushion effect shock economy reduce cost borrow household businesses, thereby encourage keep spending. in addition, federal reserve number central bank provide guidance usual likely future path interest rate help financial market form accurate expectation policy highly uncertain economic financial environment. in particular, concern market participant would fully appreciate long anticipate keep interest rate low. if hadn’t, intermediate- longer-term rate would decline less, reduce stimulative effect low policy rates. give severity downturn, become clear low short-term policy rate alone would sufficient. we need go ease financial condition encourage spending. thus, reduce longer-term interest rates, like mortgages, purchase large quantity longer-term securities, specifically treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, agency debt. central bank lot experience guide economy adjust short-term policy rate influence expectation future policy rates, underlie theory practice behind action well understood. however, economic effect purchase large volume longer-term assets, accompany expansion reserve base bank system, much le well understood. so second homework assignment monetary policymakers interest economist study effect balance sheet expansion; good understand help 3 i refer loan extend individual trouble institution like american international group, whose disorderly failure would catastrophic consequence economy. that sort lend appropriately do fiscal authority conduct association exercise new authority regulate resolve systemically important institutions. 4 bi review 36/2010 successor if, unfortunately, find similar position, help u unwind unusual action took. one question involve direct effect large-scale asset purchase themselves. the theory behind federal reserve’s action fairly clear: arbitrage short- long-term market perfect even market function smoothly; arbitrage especially impair panic investor put unusually large premium liquidity safety short-term instruments. in circumstances, reduce supply long-term debt push price securities, low yields. but much? uncertainty likely effect complicate calibration purchases, symmetrical uncertainty effect unwind action – reduce portfolio – factor decision time sequence step return portfolio normal level composition. good study sort action sparse. currently, rely large part study examine much interest rate drop purchase announce unite state abroad. but event study may ideal mean predict consequence reduce portfolio, part economic financial environment different, also event study measure effect develop reverse time. we also uncertain how, exactly, purchase put downward pressure interest rates. my presumption effect come mainly total amount purchase relative total stock debt outstanding. however, others argue market effect derive importantly flow purchase relative amount new issuance market. some evidence primacy stock channel accumulate recently, price mortgage-backed security appear change little flow purchase trend down. a second issue involve effect large volume reserve create buy assets. the federal reserve fund purchase credit account bank hold us. those deposit call “reserve balances” part bank reserves. in explanation actions, concentrated, i done, effect price asset purchase spillover price relate assets. the huge quantity bank reserve create see largely byproduct purchase would unlikely significant independent effect financial market economy. this view consistent simple model many textbook monetarist tradition monetary policy, emphasize line causation reserve money supply economic activity inflation. other central bank colleague federal open market committee (fomc) emphasize channel discussion effect policy zero low bound. accord type theories, extra reserve induce bank diversify additional lend purchase securities, reduce cost borrow household businesses, spark increase money supply spending. to date, channel seem effective; interest rate bank loan relative usual benchmark continue rise, quantity bank loan still fall rapidly, money supply growth subdued. banks’ behavior appear consistent standard keynesian model liquidity trap, demand reserve become perfectly elastic short-term interest rate approach zero. but portfolio behavior bank shift economy confidence recover, need watch study channel carefully. another uncertainty deserve additional examination involve effect large-scale purchase longer-term asset expectation monetary policy. the buy, reserve ultimately need absorb asset ultimately need dispose conduct monetary policy, behavior interbank markets, federal reserve’s balance sheet return completely normal. a consequence, type purchase increase inflation expectation among bi review 36/2010 5 observer may see risk reduce reserve raise interest rate timely fashion. in fact, longer-term inflation expectation generally quite well anchor past year unusual federal reserve actions. and develop test tool need remove accommodative monetary policy appropriate. i confident federal reserve tighten policy well advance threat price stability, successful execution exit demonstrate emergency step need lead high inflation. monetary policy financial imbalance the past year illustrate two lesson relationship macroeconomic stability financial stability. first, macroeconomic stability doesn’t guarantee financial stability; indeed, circumstances, macroeconomic stability may foster financial instability lull people complacency risks. and second, shock financial system substantial, especially weaken large number intermediaries, decrease aggregate demand large, long lasting, quickly easily remedied conventional monetary policy. give heavy cost financial crisis, question naturally arise could avoided. my third assignment reexamine whether conventional monetary policy use lean financial imbalance well aim traditional medium-term macroeconomic goal maximum employment price stability. one key question whether likely know enough asset price misalignment effect policy adjustment misalignment give u confidence deliberately tack away time exclusive pursuit macroeconomic objectives. obviously, reduce odds financial crisis would beneficial, need balance important objective potential cost uncertainty associate use monetary policy purpose. one type cost arise monetary policy blunt instrument. increase interest rate damp activity across wide variety sectors, many may experience speculative activity. moreover, small policy adjustment may effective rein speculative excesses. our experience 1999 2005 even substantial increase interest rate seem effect dot-com stock speculation first episode house price increase second. and large adjustment would incur great incremental costs. a consequence, use monetary policy damp asset price movement could lead variability output inflation around objectives, least medium term. among things, great variability inflation could lead inflation expectation become le well anchored, diminish ability central bank counter economic fluctuations. we simply good theory empirical evidence guide policymakers use short-term interest rate limit financial speculation. give current state knowledge, preference time would use regulation supervision strengthen financial system lean develop problems. monetary policy would use imbalance build regulatory policy either unavailable prove ineffective. the homework assignment improve ability identify incipient financial imbalance understand interaction change policy interest rates. a relate issue, i’ll assign extra credit, critical conduct policy future. some observer attribute bubble observe asset price recent year decades-long downward trend real interest rates. in view, decline interest rate cause investor reach yield purchase risky asset high returns, drive price risky asset fundamental values. many critic central bank ascribe drop real rate monetary policy decision keep rate unusually 6 bi review 36/2010 low, average, business cycle from perspective, decision central bank make policy rate shape underlie determinant balance save investment, including, past decade so, high save propensity newly emerge asian economy sluggish rebound investment globally recession early last decade. nonetheless, important understand reason decline average real rate whether low rate likely persist – tough problem extra credit assignment. for one thing, economic expansion gain traction central bank back current highly accommodative stance policy, policymakers need understand longer-term trend real rate influence point policy rate become restrictive. for another, rate go continue low historical standards, regulator need especially alert sign reach yield investor contribute excessive risk-taking. inflation objective the final homework assignment concern inflation objective central banks. central bank widely choose target inflation rate near 2 percent. the federal reserve require law conduct monetary policy achieve maximum employment stable prices. we haven’t announce explicit inflation rate target consistent dual mandate, federal reserve governor reserve bank president publish individual forecast inflation long run, conditional individual view appropriate monetary policy. those forecast indicate fomc participant believe inflation converge 1–3/4 2 percent time. recently, prominent economist call central bank raise inflation target 4 percent. shift inflation target would tend raise average level nominal interest rate thus give central bank room low interest rate response bad shock economy run zero bound. although i agree hit zero bind present challenge monetary policy, i believe central bank raise inflation targets. central bank around world work 30 year get inflation level largely ignore business household make decision future. moreover, inflation expectation well anchor low levels. increase inflation target could result more-variable inflation bad economic outcome time. first all, inflation expectation would necessarily become unanchored inflation move up. i doubt household business would immediately adjust expectation new target expectation would well anchor new high levels. instead, i fear could long learn process, inflation trend recent decades. second, 4 percent inflation may high ignored, business household may take inflation account write contract make investments, increase odds otherwise transitory inflation would become persistent. for reasons, raise longer-term objective inflation could make expectation sensitive recent realize inflation, central bank actions, economic conditions. that great sensitivity would reduce ability central bank buff economy bad shocks. it could also lead more-volatile inflation long run therefore high inflation risk premium nominal interest rates. it notable economic argument raise inflation target well understood, major central bank raise target response recent financial crisis. another approach problem central bank target gradually rise price level rather constant inflation rate. imagine plot consumer price index (cpi) today onward increase 2 percent year. central bank would commit adjust policy keep cpi near line. bi review 36/2010 7 the advantage approach, theory least, negative shock drive price target level, people automatically expect central bank increase inflation get back trend. in principle, expectation would low real interest rate without central bank change inflation commitment, even nominal interest rate pin zero. it could also make easy people make long-term economic decision could anticipate inflation miss would reverse time, reduce uncertainty future price level. while i appreciate elegance price-level-targeting idea, i serious doubt would work practice. central idea federal reserve would commit hit price level grow constant rate fix point past. the specific inflation rate could expect future would change time, depend inflation realize point. you could know inflation rate expect know current consumer price index fed’s target index future. in addition, inflation rate could expect would different different horizons. moreover, central bank able control inflation considerable lag even imprecisely, process hit target would likely involve frequent overshoot correction consequently frequently shift inflation objectives. contrast approach communication require central bank target specific inflation rate. for example, central bank target 2 percent inflation rate typically put target prominently webpage. if bank instead target price level grow 2 percent, webpage would provide table inflation rate target variety horizons, target would change month. i fear rather anchor people’s expectation prices, could leave perplexed. a tell, i see compel reason central bank stick current inflation objectives. those reason relate importantly effect central bank’s communication behavior credibility public’s expectations. more study lead good understand linkage central bank action expectation formation improve ability central bank achieve society’s inflation output objective effectively variety circumstances, include severe negative shock type recently experienced. conclusion many central banker economists, included, little complacent come crisis. we think know enough basic structure market economy achieve economic price stability relatively minor perturbations. and think tool necessary deal liquidity shortage maldistributions. the reality didn’t understand economy well think did. central bankers, along policymakers, professional economist private sector fail foresee prevent financial crisis result serious unemployment loss wealth around world. we must learn experience. the question i’ve pose tough, address issue successfully enable central bank reduce odds future crisis respond effectively bout instability still might arise. bi review 35/2010 1 nil bernstein: the danish krone crisis speech mr nil bernstein,

interest rates. to counter tension dollar market, danmark nationalbank intervene fx swap market 18 september, i.e. crisis really erupted. dollar offer krone total dkk 3 billion maturity 7 days. likewise, early october, danmark nationalbank intervene euro market, offer euro total dkk 17 billion maturity 7 day 1 month. danmark nationalbank previously intervene fx swap market recent times. the intervention fx swap market turn temporary impact market. the danish market euro dollar liquidity considerable, intervention via fx swap market also entail draw substantial amount foreign-exchange reserve. pressure krone prompt danmark nationalbank intervene heavily directly foreign-exchange market late september first week october. intervention sale foreign exchange total dkk 1 billion september reach monthly all-time high 4 bi review 35/2010 dkk 64 billion october. there considerable day-to-day fluctuations. on days, intervention purchase approach dkk 15 billion. intervention danmark nationalbank concentrate period around 7 24 october, raise interest rates. we could literally see reserve pour coffers. i felt like drive car without brakes. monetary-policy interest rate sustain strong pressure krone lead danmark nationalbank increase monetary-policy interest rate several occasion october (chart 5). on 7 october, lend rate raise 0.4 percentage point. the follow day, ecb reduce key interest rate 0.5 percentage point, thereby widen interest-rate spread more. it unpleasant raise interest rate accept widen spread time central bank low support financial sector. the way interpret something must rotten state denmark! but choice. these interest-rate increase short-term impact krone. in hour immediately danmark nationalbank’s announcements, krone weaken intervention sale foreign exchange necessary. the interest-rate instrument desire effect. few domestic counterparties buy krone response interest-rate increases. on 15 october, ecb introduce full allotment weekly main refinance operations, pressure krone ease temporarily. euro area bank able obtain sufficient liquidity ecb, reflect market spread euro area. on 24 october, capital outflow – drive foreign investor – lead danmark nationalbank raise interest rate further. subsequently, spread euro area 1.75 percentage points, enough make domestic insurance pension company particular turn towards danish krone again. issuance cp the substantial intervention sale october drain foreign-exchange reserve. in previous crises, possible immediately increase reserve issue short-term cp loan late replace

(chart 6). how long would take situation would begin improve? after 14 october, danmark nationalbank finally able issue cp behalf danish government (chart 7). this continue almost daily basis throughout rest 2008. other initiative we manage keep head water, solely due intervention interest-rate increases. a number factor play important role. bi review 35/2010 5 the shortage euro dollar liquidity, combine dysfunctional financial market – notably freeze interbank market – lead ecb feed establish swap line central banks, include danmark nationalbank. via swap lines, national central bank able offer euro dollar liquidity domestic banks. danmark nationalbank establish swap line feed 24 september 2008. the need facility highlight fact volume offer dollar auction draw upon full. the swap line feed – total usd 15 billion – fully exercise three auctions. on 27 october 2008, danmark nationalbank ecb establish equivalent swap line 12 billion euro. although limit reached, security danish bank relation euro fund undoubtedly boosted. the swap facility helpful address banks’ liquidity needs. it emphasise facility affect foreign-exchange reserve support krone directly. it support krone indirectly calm market fx swaps; ecb’s back send strong positive signal market. issuance 30-year government bond another key factor. there extensive demand danish market domestic bond long maturity – particularly part pension funds, need hedge long-term commitments. in november december 2008, danish government take extraordinary step issue 30-year bonds. a result, danish pension fund restructure portfolio foreign domestic securities. this support krone. last – least – equally important government, short notice early october 2008, decide issue guarantee deposit loan danish banks. it impossible say exactly impact measure, know bank rescue package i, was. non-residents withdraw krone deposit total dkk 70 billion danish bank october 2008. this package contribute strongly keep capital outflow crisis manageable level. time determination essential element term ensure confidence danish banks. a i see it, danish bank would far bad without guarantee, danmark nationalbank’s ability keep krone stable might call doubt. but government provide bank guarantee total around 2.5 time denmark’s gdp, potential claim foreign-exchange reserve increased. if bank failed, guarantee might call short notice. if loan raise abroad, would affect foreign exchange reserve. therefore, need increase reserve even important. the turn point krone crisis come late october, stabilisation krone market enable u buy back foreign exchange. large scale buy-backs take place 4 november 2008. partial normalisation situation make possible u follow suit ecb low interest rate 0.5 per cent 6 november. in december, monetary-policy spread gradually narrow total 0.75 percentage point. conclusion (chart 8) during 2009, danmark nationalbank gradually reduce interest rate spread euro area narrow again. today, monetary- policy spread 5 basis points. but actual money-market spread around 50 basis points, mainly due substantial amount excess liquidity euro area. 6 bi review 35/2010 over last year, danmark nationalbank build foreign exchange reserve much high level use be. it exceed dkk 400 billion. the dollar swap line federal reserve expired. so, many way situation normalised. but learn mean outside euro area small economy fixed-exchange-rate regime. this give food thought. we make through. i ponder upon – least openly – could happen speculation krone hadn’t subsided. we still fix exchange rate regime. a recent development shown, euro membership – – guarantee easy access foreign borrowing. that depend one’s ability keep house order. there substitute sound economic policy inside outside euro. but small open economy storm magnitude sweep market – would rather currency worry about. thank attention. chart 1 bi review 35/2010 7 chart 2 chart 3 8 bi review 35/2010 chart 4

mario draghi, governor bank italy chairman financial stability board, handelsblatt, germany, conduct mr hermann-josef knipper mr katharina kort publish 19 march 2010. * * * handelsblatt: the whole europe worry greek crisis. what greek sort financial problem ? mr draghi: i think best thing come credible fiscal adjustment plan implement promptly. the delay commitment are, le effective reduce spread government bonds. the quick better, i say start doing. the commission ecb, imf extent, involve well. they must persuade fiscal plan. of course monitor timely implementation important design it. greek clearly see political price pay unavoidable. handelsblatt: be confident greek plans? mr draghi: yes, i would like see implementation. handelsblatt: do need strict rules? mr draghi: yes, obviously need strict rules. it early specify ones, greek crisis show construction make resilient. handelsblatt: what mind? mr draghi: my opinion differ one express minister finance, mr. wolfgang schäuble. the first thing bear mind able create pillar stability euro everything preserve it. no matter many critic say, low inflation, low finance cost amazingly protect world turbulence euro. so preserve stability credibility concept. greek crisis show construction make resilient show potential cracks. handelsblatt: what do make euro stronger? mr draghi: first ask market nervous, greece also countries. incidentally spread go also aaa rat countries, a aa rat countries. market nervous financial market condition enormously worsened, within euro outside euro-area. but reason market nervous see clear collectively get exit strategies. the first thing clear, well defined, well-timed exit strategy high budget deficits. this top list priorities. handelsblatt: which second priority? mr draghi: i think extend stability growth pact. so far, able monitor mechanism extent enforce mechanism balance sheet. we reinforce concept extend structural reforms. the reason country grow undertake structural reform facilitate growth. handelsblatt: do anything specific mind? bi review 35/2010 1 mr draghi: for people part creation stability growth pact discussion go back late ninety suggest time several people, included, make pension reforms, market reforms, competition reform forth. these reform make grow end. at time, country object thing engrave history social texture would accept discipline could accept budgetary area. handelsblatt: what implication present situation? mr draghi: i think time make one step further. at least country euro need mechanism basically induce great cooperation among government great discipline. ultimately, price stability, budgetary discipline economic growth three pillar financial stability. this refer medium term start work do month. handelsblatt: what do short term? mr draghi: in case fiscal crisis like one greece, mechanism identification intervention clear, well-designed, market provide money country want. what market want trap confuse muddle situation see clearly – situation nobody would ready lend. if clarity firmness direction investor lend money. only end this, think need kind emergency financial assistance like one mr. schäuble proposed, think it. handelsblatt: do agree minister schäuble? mr draghi: the minister rightly make point there. now pool monetary policy considerably complex ifm dictate discipline country without say anything monetary policy. still, “macro-lever” imf. handelsblatt: be favour european monetary fund? mr draghi: i think thing well do lay monitor implementation mechanism probably would need european monetary fund. we cannot think european fund would actually resolve issue. i would start finance crisis, solution crisis. in present market conditions, though, emergency finance rate high market rates, could respond temporary liquidity problems, would wrong make mechanism linchpin actions. handelsblatt: do need new structure enforcement mechanism? if so, kind structure? mr draghi: not much structure, need concept much along way stability growth pact, concept endorse governments. handelsblatt: another pact? mr draghi: yes, another pact. in euro area need strong economic governance provide coordinate structural reform discipline. handelsblatt: go back emf, think might send wrong incentives? mr draghi: this danger exist must whatever consider emergency measure exclusively liquidity purposes. nobody want think fund mechanism could resolve crisis. country must relay availability fund draw difficulties. i don’t think mr. schäuble anybody think this. handelsblatt: would recommend strict rule country respect agreements? 2 bi review 35/2010 mr draghi: yes, need strict rule provide economic political cost high case today deviation rule use financial mean come market. handelsblatt: because financial crisis, rat agency highly criticised. do think ecb provide ratings, suggested? mr draghi: no, i think would right. the creation european rat agency could represent solution trust american rat agency other. but task still entrust central bank. handelsblatt: why experience credit rat agency unsatisfying? mr draghi: loophole regulation allow conflict interest. one wonder rat agency see big amount dubious financial product create 2005 2008 could rate properly. one answer issuer basically big investment banks. so, rat agency become clear 90% business do banks. this exactly capture banks. much do change this, still lot done. handelsblatt: what think of? mr draghi: we project fsb we, regulators, look way reduce importance rat regulation. we must look alternative define mechanisms. handelsblatt: but market need ratings… mr draghi: market need rating. investor want ratings. at fsb think need good differentiation. one thing triple-a government bond, one thing triple-a structure bond. it always possible structure bond way triple-a, even component “junk”. so must rat agency allow investor distinguish one triple-a another triple-a. handelsblatt: when go find solution? which step reform financial regulation? mr draghi: one two important project fsb capital liquidity regulation, reform basel 2. it implementation schedule end 2012. handelsblatt: be right fear basel iii might limit credit flows, prejudge economic recovery? mr draghi: first i hope recovery way. there risk i think fear exaggerated. bank do lot already raise capital. we reach globally accept definition capital. the basel committee fsb work time choose implementation new rule prejudge economic recovery. handelsblatt: be confident globally coordinate regulation? lately see lot tension eu us. mr draghi: i think tension exaggerated. many proposal publicly discussed, like “volcker rule” tax bank u uk, already discuss fsb. handelsblatt: you criticise work goldman sachs, u investment bank accuse involve dubious transaction greece. what tell u it? mr draghi: when i leave italian treasury, 2001, rule italy forbid take position investment bank. nevertheless, i go harvard teach six bi review 35/2010 3 4 bi review 35/2010 month there. then i enter goldman sachs. since begin i make clear work 10 year government government officials, would embarrass ask business goldman. i therefore insist develop client private sector. and that’s happened. i 3–4 years. handelsblatt: any country among clients? mr draghi: no, i never make transaction government. the reason simple: i busy corporate investment bank private clients. handelsblatt: have ever greece? mr draghi: i never greece work reasons. those transaction do arrival goldman sachs. there transaction greece i never involved. i would also like point i deputy ceo, position exist goldman sachs. handelsblatt: when think goldman sachs greece, think good idea goldman help greece mask budget? mr draghi: that’s difference lies, difference purposes. one debt management, one debt concealment. that concealment bad thing. if greece make mess budget lie numbers, would much easy us. handelsblatt: which quality good ecb president? talk monetary policy, consider “hawk”? mr draghi: you ask ecb observer think “dove”. you must always keep mind price stability monetary policy credibility crucial importance growth. jean-claude trichet: hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 22 march 2010. * * * dear madam chair, dear member committee economic monetary affairs, it pleasure today first regular hear 2010. over last months, since meet december 2009, euro area economy whole continue gradually recover. but number issues, relate country financial market developments, lead intense discussion euro area functioning. this make today’s discussion timely. wir sehen, welche großen herausforderungen sich durch die finanzkrise für die europäische wirtschaftspolitik ergeben. wir sehen auch, e heißt, mit wirtschafts- und währungspolitik verantwortungsvoll umzugehen. die stabilität d gemeinsamen währung ist die verantwortung aller. aujourd’hui, comme le veut la tradition, je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique, en portant une attention particulière à l’élimination progressive de mesures non conventionnelles prise lors de la période de crise. ensuite, j’aborderai le deux sujets sur lesquels nous nous somme mi d’accord concernant la politique budgétaire et le déséquilibres mondiaux. economic monetary development a mentioned, since previous hear last december, economic financial condition continue improve, albeit moderate pace. economic activity estimate increase 0.1% third fourth quarter last year. recent information confirm expect moderate recovery current year. this line late ecb staff projections. also forecast institution confirm expectation, annual growth rate round 1% 2010, gain pace 2011. in assessment govern council, risk outlook remain broadly balanced, predict already last year, recovery likely uneven across region section time. high uncertainty continue prevail. a regard price developments, continue witness low inflation low inflationary pressure recent months. inflation february 2010 stand 0.9%. the outlook inflation remain line price stability risk outlook remain broadly balanced. specifically, expect inflation stay around 1% near term, remain moderate policy-relevant horizon, line relatively slow recovery demand. our monetary analysis continue confirm expectation low inflationary pressure medium term, reflect weak expansion money credit. the growth loan enterprise particular anticipate remain weak time ahead, annual growth rate loan household positive strengthening. these development still line regularity past business cycles. we monitor credit development closely month come. while clear evidence credit constraint euro area whole, situation differ across countries, sector bi review 34/2010 1 company sizes. to large extent, weak growth loan due unprecedented severance 2009 recession. indicator inflation expectation medium long term remain firmly anchor line aim keep inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. it background govern council keep level key ecb interest rate unchanged early month, regard current level appropriate. the significant monetary impulse stem interest rate reduction last year spread market interest rates, transmission rate charge bank household corporation continue perform well. this transmission need see conjunction non-standard measure ecb taken. these measures, notably provision full allotment liquidity bank one-year maturity collateral, effective provide fund bank favourable conditions, stabilise money market, foster pass-through interest rate reductions. phase non-standard measure in line economic monetary assessment, govern council decide early month continue gradual phase extraordinary measures. we wish breed dependency. bank take intermediation appropriate incentive so. the 12-month operation already discontinue 6-month operation upcoming next week last one. in addition, decide re-introduce variable-rate tender regular three-month operation late april. at time, continue provide euro area bank system unlimited access central bank refinance shorter-term operation (with one-week one-month maturity), long need case mid-october year. this continue support credit provision euro area economy. let also say something longer-term monetary policy issue , i know interest you, namely relationship monetary policy asset prices. the financial crisis revive long-standing debate relationship monetary policy asset price bubbles. this debate centre straightforward question: should monetary policy aim prevent emergence asset price bubbles? while question simple answer, ecb’s monetary policy strategy approach well suit cope challenge bring unsustainable asset price developments. our mandate maintain price stability medium term. protracted, unsustainable financial trend atypical swing risk price financial market pose risk price stability road. the close link monetary development evolve imbalance asset credit market imply monetary policy need detect imbalance early stage respond implied, longer-term, risk price stability timely forward-looking manner, thereby contribute financial stability. our monetary analysis, concentrate monitor money credit, that. it strategic framework embed degree implicit “leaning wind” excessive money, credit asset price growth. judgement course necessary address asset price dynamics. the ecb develop considerable expertise analysis monetary credit development implication risk price stability, prove invaluable asset also throughout financial crisis. fiscal policy euro area i would like turn fiscal policy now. a know, financial sector support budgetary loosen context financial economic crisis – euro area country – cause sizable fiscal imbalances. meanwhile, country euro 2 bi review 34/2010 area exceed 3% reference value deficit ratio. under circumstances, stability growth pact, put place safeguard sound sustainable fiscal positions, rigorously applied. the ecb call strengthen governments’ commitment strictly adhere provisions. national policy maker give fiscal consolidation top priority context ongoing economic recovery, bring deficit ratio 3% gdp line ecofin recommendations. base stability programme updates, government appear track year, measure necessary come year correct excessive deficit within set time horizon. a regard composition fiscal adjustment, welcome focus expenditure side, size public sector significantly increase crisis expenditure-based consolidation prove effective past. government enhance credibility fiscal consolidation strengthen national budgetary framework implement structural reform increase potential growth. in context, i welcome european commission’s initiative europe 2020 strategy strong role eurogroup multilateral country surveillance overdue. at time, important fiscal surveillance pact remain process right fundamental principle treaty pact fully preserved. a successful exit strong fiscal expansion wake recent crisis require ambitious measure strong political regard implementation. i confident european fiscal policy maker succeed restore sustainability public finances. the adjustment effort undertake irish government recently greek government see promise first step upcoming consolidation process. policy response imbalance one main driver financial crisis large global external imbalances. these imbalance imply massive capital inflow deficit countries. those inflow partly finance issuance financial instruments, whose value shatter turmoil. the imbalance reflect lack medium-term orientation towards stability sustainability macroeconomic policy key deficit surplus economies. the euro area contribute build-up global imbalances. it current account remain close balance years. the crisis induce partial reduction global imbalances, correction appear largely cyclical. some important structural factor lead unsustainable imbalance remain largely place. a risk unsustainable global imbalance might re-emerge period ahead therefore rule out. rule would require rigorous policy adjustment key deficit surplus economies. the g20’s decision create process mutual assessment members’ macroeconomic structural policy fundamental respect. to successful, process require peer surveillance execute fairly without complacency, country economy concern operational capacity change domestic policy accordingly. these necessary condition pave way good function global economy. the euro area enter process positive standing, give medium-term orientation monetary, fiscal macroeconomic policies. let conclude recall macroeconomic imbalance confine global level also appear within euro area. these imbalance remain challenge, largely reflect lack adjustment number member states. it remain indispensable country concern bring monitor cost competitiveness indicators, structural reforms, fiscal consolidation effort line bi review 34/2010 3 4 bi review 34/2010 principle rule underlie function monetary union. this would allow euro area economy reap fully macroeconomic benefit emu. axel a weber: challenge opportunity competitiveness emu member states. the euro financial crisis – german experience presentation professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, copenhagen business school, copenhagen, 22 march 2010. * * * 1 introduction dear president johann ross (copenhagen business school), dear professor peter birch sørensen (chairman economic council, denmark), dear gouverneur christian noyer governor niels bernstein, lady gentleman the global financial crisis experience since autumn 2007 challenge monetary fiscal policy nearly industrialise countries. in addition, call regulatory regime question cause profound reform process initiate national, european global level. with respect european monetary union (emu) financial crisis make clear important euro stabilise factor economy member states. nonetheless, challenge lie ahead financial crisis economic downturn accompany diminished. in particular, financial crisis lead renew debate perceive imbalance euro area. this discussion new, divergency build steadily since launch euro. however, year precede financial crisis, strong global economic expansion ongoing economic integration within euro area partly mask problem arise differential developments. a financial crisis call unsustainable business model question ruthlessly reveal structural nature disparities, move centre stage. take specific adjustment process monetary union account, think condition sustainable growth euro-area economy achieved. in follow remarks, i address two aspect recent experience within euro area. first, advantage monetary union financial crisis. second, challenge overcome order resolve divergency build within euro area. the current debate focus difference price competitiveness emu member states. however, view loss competitiveness root problem rather symptom underlie unsustainable structural development member states. accordingly, mark gain price competitiveness german economy experience result necessary structural reform finally address 2003 domestic problem high structural unemployment, rise social security contribution repeat excessive public deficit become pressing. i therefore take close look german experience try draw conclusion country lose competitiveness since launch euro. 2 euro – gained? my positive assessment first ten year monetary union result mainly fact emu clearly contribute favourable climate economic growth within euro area. throughout financial crisis, however, euro prove far growth factor euro area. in several respect stabilise member economies. a market participants’ risk aversion increased, additional risk would depress bi review 34/2010 1 propensity invest. therefore, absence exchange-rate risk within euro area represent additional benefit crisis. more specifically, even though effective exchange rate euro area rise sharply financial crisis – fall recently – euro prevent emu member state witness scenario europe experience former times, example crisis european monetary system (ems) 1992/93. at time, em expose massive flight primarily d-mark, result significant tension among em currencies. this cause massive adjustment problem economy appreciate currency inflationary pressure. finally, fact bank within euro area obtain short-term liquidity eurosystem term condition prove great advantage financial crisis. it significantly mitigate money market tension therefore serve buff global financial market shocks. this protect small economy especially. otherwise would probably need make additional effort defend credibility currencies, example form high interest rates, intervention foreign exchange market swap agreement central banks. 3 economic divergency – challenge emu 3.1 increase intra-emu heterogeneity the search cause financial crisis intensify discussion global imbalances. what often overlook discussion fact euro area whole almost balance current account. consequently, euro area contribute build-up global imbalances. however, economic divergency within emu need addressing. one important reason grow heterogeneity within euro area benefit monetary union, particular low interest rate elimination exchange rate risk, always use wisely tempt country live beyond means: too often inflowing capital reach productive sectors, case cheap easy access fund lead excessive credit dynamic facilitate rise household corporate debt ultimately cause real estate market overheat. in addition, fiscal policy often fail use high growth low interest rate reduce deficit sufficiently. in economy rigid partly flexible labour market large expansionary stimulus result accelerate wage increase well excess productivity growth, reduce price competitiveness export domestic firms. consequently, price competitiveness diverge significantly one euro-area member state another since introduction euro. whereas small group countries, lead germany, achieve gain price competitiveness, large group suffer significant losses, amongst others greece, italy, spain portugal. these underlie economic divergency within euro area also reflect persistent discrepancy current account position emu member states. a long flourish world economy growth dynamic within euro area mask associate problems, development neglected. however, financial crisis reveal unsustainability state therefore increase awareness risk involves. these risk imply depress future growth prospects, disturbance capital flow market doubt sustainability large external borrow requirement well difficulty monetary policy result grow heterogeneity euro-area member states. hence, correct structural problem root economic divergency one major challenge future: for example, domestic firm become competitive increase productivity keep cost check, labour market flexibility increase order mobilise large share work age population facilitate reallocation 2 bi review 34/2010 worker profitable sectors. and structural deficit bring sustainable level broaden tax base or, preferably, cut expenditure government consumption certain transfers. take current account one indicator extent divergencies, one could get impression financial crisis halt trend grow heterogeneity within monetary union, since current account position narrow significantly year 2008 2009 (except italy france). however, close look development underlie change current account deficit show reduction still largely cyclical drive mainly sharply fall import rather increase export market shares. hence, profound far-reaching change undertake country live beyond mean thereby drive divergency within euro area. in order sketch structural reform initiate necessary adjustment bring back heterogeneity within euro area natural sustainable level, i turn experience germany undergo adjustment process. 3.2 the german experience this adjustment process often perceive portray significant improvement price competitiveness due ongoing wage moderation major reform labour market social security system. however, perception miss point actually occur past years. the price competitiveness german economy indeed decline dramatically year 1990 1995. during reunification process, number domestic imbalance build become apparent mid-1990s. the prominent oversized construction sector strong wage price increase despite decline average labour productivity owe inclusion eastern german economy. the german corporate sector react extremely unfavourable position domestic international market painful, eventually successful restructure process include innovation, outsourcing, wage moderation well balance sheet clean-up. it note market-based adjustment neither initiate manage policy makers. however, actually force german government undertake set major reform couple intensify domestic problem depress growth increasingly constrain policy makers’ scope action. in economic downturn follow burst “new economy” bubble early 2000s, persistently high unemployment peak 5 million people 2005 well overburden social security system lead high fiscal deficit protract period meagre gdp growth. thus, adjustment area economic social policy become inevitable. finally, 2003, bold labour market reform introduced, modernise labour market structure low high employment threshold economic growth. they accompany fiscal consolidation adjustment social security systems, particular pension system. these structural reform pave way necessary market-based corrections, example wage set intra-plant working-time flexibility, take place. they painful, economy much good shape afterwards. in view, core lesson draw germany’s experience. it true economic growth germany unusually dependent foreign trade last upswing mid-2003 early 2008, would ill-advised deduce experience need actively propping-up domestic demand, example via encourage high negotiate wages. rather, german export boost strong, ultimately unsustainable global economic growth, whereas pick-up private demand high unemployment start decline repeatedly burden exogenous forces. for bi review 34/2010 3 4 bi review 34/2010 example, need cut excessive public deficit require restrictive stance fiscal policy rapid rise energy price 2008 absorb sizeable pick-up nominal disposable income upswing broaden domestic economy. what therefore often neglect germany able serve important buff world demand height financial crisis via still robust private consumption well large fiscal stimulus packages. look ahead bear mind prospect global economic growth well regional breakdown, german economy unlikely replicate growth profile recent upswing. in external environment characterise le steep hopefully healthy expansion, german enterprise naturally focus domestic market before. political coordination process go beyond purpose set framework market-induced, smooth reallocation resource neither necessary helpful. 4 conclusion lady gentlemen, adjustment process german economy undergo reunification first year monetary union show market-based correction even severe domestic structural problem possible necessary reform addressed. in addition, effort inconvenience associate adjustment pay lead strengthen economic condition individual economy euro area whole. the emu urgently need market-based adjustment prerequisite economic divergency come halt, sustainable economic growth within euro area thereby continue success euro. jean-pierre danthine: calm water storm? speech mr jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, money market event, zurich, 18 march 2010. * * * i. look back we emerge financial economic crisis major proportions. the extent value destruction last two half year may well match loss register great depression. the lesson draw historical episode leave u wiser. they alter, fundamental ways, understand finance macroeconomics hopefully, well, behaviour economic participant – good design economic system. today i begin look back review main event occur since last money market event happen coincide turn point financial crisis. i look forward describe snb perceive immediate future. finally i briefly address two press challenge confront u – exit unconventional monetary policy measure rethink financial regulation. let turn attention started, is, u real estate sector. during long period low interest rates, low risk premia, subdue volatility general economic optimism, u house price increase unprecedented wave end 2006, point bubble burst. the loss housing-related wealth cycle peak trough staggering, something order usd 7 trillion.1 part loss paper losses, since everyone enter market peak portion loss absorb household themselves; rest must bear financial intermediaries. to day worldwide write-down financial sector, including, limit recognise loss house sector, estimate usd 1.7 trillion.2 however, still counting, late result publish world’s major financial institute reveal. there many example real estate crisis recent past, include one switzerland early nineties. what distinguish current crisis breadth international character. these two characteristic intimately related: rapid expansion subprime mortgage internationalisation mortgage-based financial instrument bring international capital u real estate sector. this capital help inflate property bubble first place; also explain subsequent crisis turn international financial market event global economic crisis! a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation come figure lose flow income least 10% world gdp. we escape new great depression, end worldwide income loss probably exceed income loss associate great depression. since last money market event year ago, international financial system emerge brink collapse, financial condition improve broad front hesitant economic recovery initiated. by large, trough financial front reach q1 2009 economic low point probably attain one two quarter later. exceptional fiscal monetary policy measure contribute without doubt developments. representative chart last year show strong recovery equity markets, return calm money markets, decrease credit spreads, return 1 source: feed flow fund statistics, datastream. 2 source: bloomberg. bi review 33/2010 1 activity corporate bond issuances. noteworthy fact that, contrast development countries, credit crunch switzerland. in country, elsewhere, expansionary monetary policy key element response crisis. from october 2008 march 2009, snb carry massive reduction libor target range, pursue de facto zero interest rate policy. a march 2009, snb adopt measure term “unconventional” order loosen monetary rein room interest rate reduction. these measure take three main distinct forms: longer-term repo transactions, purchase bond issue domestic borrowers, purchase foreign currencies. today, view international perspective, swiss economy relatively favourable position. gdp grow two consecutive quarters. inflation back positive territory without excessive upward pressure. fear deflation, constitute one major risk past year, yet disappear receding. employment long fall unemployment may stabilising. the swiss export sector strongly hit crisis still fragile. economic activity sustain domestic consumption (both private public) construction activity. last year’s gdp growth, –1.5%, constitute bad performance swiss economy since 1975. yet figure considerably good correspond figure develop economies. let u spend moment examine remarkable fact private consumption growth switzerland remain positive throughout practically stage downturn. immigration precaution two key word explain exceptional result (with third contribute factor fact disposable income stay high real terms, owe strong pre-crisis growth performance job market robust might feared). the recent immigration positive contribution consumption. but even per caput figure consumption decrease crisis. this possible because, much textbook fashion, swiss consumer able, time crisis, draw save comfortably replenish storm arrived. this exemplary, important lesson learn crisis use future, hold true household company public entity well. there many way express message, allow refer french classical literature recall jean de la fontaine’s celebrate fable cricket ant: “la cigale et la fourmi”. in fable, cricket accumulate surplus plenteous summer day precede crisis, find “fort dépourvue quand la bise fut venue”, is, “found winter wind blow free, cupboard bare bare could be”. the fact that, situation, ant fable eager lend sing cricket lend realism analogy. ii. current environment short-term prospect what now? we yet ashore relatively positive assessment previous paragraph reflect definitive evaluation. first, private consumption could le robust condition labour market improve le currently anticipate even deteriorate again. here main worry

ability swiss exporter continue redirect effort towards 2 bi review 33/2010 dynamic region world economy, particular emerge asia may crucial test. this region lead world term economic recovery crisis. it clear proponent reasonable version decouple hypothesis win side intellectual debate. on global level, inflation pressure expect remain subdue economies. in advance economies, headline inflation expect pick near neutral level 2009, remain low 2010. for switzerland, path inflation short term largely dictate recent movement oil price associate base effects. inflation nevertheless remain positive throughout 2010. this follow negative rate 0.5% 2009. assume monetary policy remain unchanged, snb’s forecast show inflation reach 0.7% year. the snb’s forecast also show inflation begin increase begin 2011, reach 2% first half 2012. iii. policy challenge future 1. exit strategy for snb, return normality pose difficult conceptual problem. the unconventional measure develop combat current crisis part modify nature liquidity created. liquidity result repos currency swap temporary: flow back automatically transaction renewed. liquidity create acquire foreign exchange swiss franc bond permanent. the issuance snb bill routinely practice since october 2008 give snb tool play central role liquidity absorption. the next speaker, colleague dewet moser, concentrate technical aspect exit strategy. suffice say toolbox available. it question how, when. on time issue, long variable lag monetary policy decision impact inflation, decision start tighten difficult one. it necessary balance risk move soon, economy may yet fully able withstand move, tighten late give much room potential inflationary pressures. there magic recipe. all reason level aggregate economy, is, term average. this means, particular, part economy even late feel though soon. what certain current expansionary monetary policy cannot maintain indefinitely without incur inflation risks. therefore, household firm prepare return, sometime future, world high interest rates, exchange rate guide market forces. this normal state affairs, concern shake bad habit learn extraordinary time remember ultimately responsible long-run viability decision operations. 2. safe financial system: regulation it learn recent events, must adapt. there lot could said. however, i modest confine put forward three simple idea become part general consensus, outline g20 fsb agendas. firstly, game u (the central banks, regulators, government) versus (the bank managers, financial sector). what stake design economic system efficient, compatible rule market economy favourable value creation. one essential lesson financial crisis system properly designed. there nothing bad per se speculation, high risk take even high level remuneration, provide principal fully assume consequence actions, provided, particular, tax payer remain picture. it clear financial system satisfy requirement. in bi review 33/2010 3 advance g20 countries, public-sector capital injection bank sector far estimate 3.4% gdp!3 this low bind risk assume public sector; latter may close 25% gdp major western economies, accord recent estimate j.c. trichet.4 there absolutely economic, let alone moral, justification situation individual enjoy high level remuneration high return time good, public sector come rescue time bad. in ideal world, responsibility financial sector – rather regulator – come credible proposal change. these proposal must inevitably imply main players, particular manager creditors, much stake past. depend creative find solutions, financial institution small le prone risk taking. for managers, least, must mean bonus tie long-run performance firm. logically, one could envisage go further. the first real source asymmetry principle limit liability. beyond certain level remuneration risk taking, one ideally envisage system mimic partnership full personal liability. the fact probably ambitious justify ad-hoc complementary form regulation. shareholder large pay due crisis, creditor typically not. this level gain correct incentive (ultra-high leverage worry creditor first, regulator afterwards) protect tax payers. by definition bank rely great deal credit; conceptually clear creditor come play taxpayer something go wrong. this would naturally case via bankruptcy proceedings. if cannot go far crucial role bank certain financial institutions, must find way creditor step taxpayer involved. this achieve way anticipate part bankruptcy outcome (living wills) or/and form automatic conversion significant proportion bank debt equity. secondly, consideration address financial stability issue lens individual institutions. we know enough. microprudence must supplement macroprudence, i.e., system design encourage well-managed individual institution act, particular time crisis, way make life hard institution stress. the issue clear, perfect solution le obvious. at moment, regulator talk dynamic provision capital requirement conditional cycle phase. the key idea regulator may want lenient bad time individual institution breathe room. if case, logical consequence overall requirement (e.g. capital adequacy rules) tough good times. of course jean de la fontaine would argue simply good management regulation superfluous! thirdly, important realise perfect solution perfect design. this mean need pragmatic attack problem various angles. some new regulation proposal elegant attractive go straight heart problem (convertible debt contingent capital), others le pretty (e.g. size requirements), accept state affair clear intellectual picture major issue. a final note issue remuneration. there may may truth idea (not popular moment) financial sector high contributor national value creation, explain high level remuneration sector. but banker convince require honest source income: truly high productivity leverage? it view return profit 3 source: imf (2010),

prospect global economic recovery speech mr andrew sentance, member monetary policy committee bank england, british chamber commerce annual convention, london, 18 march 2010. * * * i would like thank michael hume abi hughes research assistance i also grateful helpful comment colleagues. the view express necessarily reflect bank england member monetary policy committee. over three-and-a-half year i spend far monetary policy committee, one thing strike forcefully way uk economy heavily influence international developments. the global financial crisis recession result highlight clearly. but even felt full force crisis late 2008 early 2009, uk inflation push 5% surge global energy commodity prices. and look back whole history mpc since 1997, shock uk growth inflation committee worry significant international global dimension.1 these global influence uk economy partly reflect economic history. flow overseas trade, investment finance play major part shape development british economy, create highly international business financial environment uk. but link global economy also strengthen globalisation, reinforce international linkage across world economy global economic system become integrate interdependent.2 1 key global economic disturbance period include asian crisis (1997/8), burst “dotcom” bubble follow impact 9/11 war afghanistan iraq (2001–3), oil commodity price volatility mid-2000s. 2 i discuss impact globalisation detail early speeches. see, example, “monetary policy turbulent times” (21 april 2009) “energy environmental challenge new global economy” (21 september 2009), available bank england website: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/speaker.htm#sentance. bi review 33/2010 1 the performance global economy therefore critical prospect uk recovery. and therefore encourage global economy bounce back strongly follow sharp contraction output trade late 2008 early 2009. a chart 1 shows, growth world gdp second half last year return around prerecession growth rate world trade also bounce back strongly. this recovery world economy appear continue early month year. for example, volume international air traffic, highly sensitive world growth trends, 6.4% year ago january 2010.3 despite gloomy headline surround release late uk trade figure last week, uk economy benefit revival world trade activity. the late trade data show since second quarter last year, volume uk good exports, exclude oil erratics, rise 8.5%.4 this equivalent annual growth rate 15% – around three time trend rate uk export growth since early 1990s.5 but import bounce back too, trade deficit shrink present. in short-term source concern – rise import stage cycle usually sign recovery demand turnaround stock cycle. but time, see rise export help close uk’s trade deficit. the positive response export order confidence show range recent business survey suggest significant boost international trade performance way – support competitiveness benefit sterling’s depreciation since mid-2007. this bounceback world economy much strong might expect year ago.6 so drive it? and resilient might prove be? in view, three main factor drive recovery last year – bounce back business consumer confidence, strong growth asia emerge markets, impact policy stimulus. these three factor also key bear future global economic prospects, i discus briefly turn. recovery confidence a key factor plunge world economy recession massive shock business consumer confidence across major economy world global financial system appear rock reel late 2008 early 2009. since then, confidence gradually recover financial system stabilise shock wave traumatic event eighteen month ago subsided. 3 see http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/economics/ data compile international air traffic association (iata). 4 the 8.5% increase relate seven-month period q2 2009 nov–jan 2010. 5 uk export good service grow volume term 5.4% per annum 1992 2007; export good exclude oil erratics increase 4.5% period. 6 this reflect upgrade world growth forecast 2010. for example, imf forecast gdp growth across world economy year rise 1.9% april 2009 3.9% late world economic outlook (january 2010). 2 bi review 33/2010 one indicator recovery confidence performance stock markets, reflect improve assessment business prospects. a chart 2 shows, equity market uk u recover around 60% trough year ago. alongside improvement financial market confidence, business survey indicator also improve across global economy. chart 3 show composite measure survey purchase manager major world economies. the negative read around year ago give way response consistent rise activity expectation future growth. bi review 33/2010 3 the natural momentum recovery that, growth continue memory recession fade, consumer business confidence continue build. over time, cutback investment firm deferral major consumer purchase begin reverse. a result, expect consumer investment demand gradually strengthen long new shock confidence emerge. growth asia emerge market alongside general recovery confidence, key engine world recovery strong rebound asia many emerge market economies. a chart 4 shows, forecast growth year next major asian market – develop emerge market economy whole – continuation healthy growth rate see economy throughout past decade. there good grind believe strong performance asia emerge market continue engine world economic growth recovery continues. first, healthy supply-side fundamental economy asia – large potential labour supply, region account half world’s population, scope continue productivity catch-up advance economies. second, government asia many emerge market economy remain commit market-oriented policy continue integration world trade system, prove important underpin rapid growth development past.7 third, public private finance generally good shape. the bank financial institution major asian economy directly affect crisis way financial sector u europe. government finance also start strong position, mean fiscal policy continue support private sector demand much le need serious fiscal retrenchment result. 7 see, example, the east asian miracle: economic growth public policy, world bank, 1993. 4 bi review 33/2010 these strong demand supply-side fundamental help mitigate concern impetus asia emerge market quickly fizzle out, undermine re-emergence global imbalances. and increase importance asia world economy mean material influence growth world economy. a chart 5 shows, seven large economy asia-pacific region, include india, china, japan australia, account close quarter world gdp – far short contribution world gdp unite state european union. indeed, worry growth asia emerge market may prove strong, fuel growth asset price put upward pressure global energy commodity prices. a chart 6 show – strong growth develop economy emerge market mid-2000s associate significant upward pressure volatility oil, food metal prices. bi review 33/2010 5 recent movement oil price sensitive news pace global growth, commodity price pick generally growth return world economy. if momentum global recovery sustained, risk upward price pressure direction, knock-on impact broad measure inflation around world. the role economic policy the third engine growth world economy present stimulus provide range policy measures. economic policy play role stabilise world economic financial condition three ways: first, direct intervention underpin stability bank financial system generally many economies; second, stimulatory fiscal policies; third, supportive monetary policy – low interest rate direct injection money support demand low interest rate climate, mpc’s policy “quantitative easing”. however, current level stimulus monetary fiscal policy design turn around economy wake trauma experience 12–18 month ago. a confidence build private spend recovers, likely appropriate gradually withdraw least policy support demand, without jeopardise growth prospects. the need re-adjust economic policy obvious fiscal side, deficit high historical standards, particularly us, europe japan – chart 7 shows. these large deficit reflect important role public spend tax policy play worldwide stabilise economic condition recession. but ensure sustainable public finance medium-term, budget gap need close recovery. in many countries, policy-makers rightly concern negative consequence demand tighten fiscal policy quickly abruptly recovery still fragile. but tighten fiscal policy pursue part longer-term, credible well worked-out plan much le likely negative demand-side effects, may offset benefit supply-side performance economy. 6 bi review 33/2010 progress put public finance sound foot increase confidence reduce uncertainty future economic prospects, provide much good climate recovery private sector demand. it also support supply-side performance economy help firm individual plan long term. the effect deficit reduction financial market also positive private sector demand. long-term interest rate likely low world government deficit rein in, risk destabilise financial market movement also reduced. again, likely provide much good climate private sector investment long-term spend plan generally. an additional mechanism negative demand-side consequence fiscal tighten offset maintain relatively loose relax monetary policy. so arm withdraw policy stimulus – tighten monetary policy – need take account potential impact deficit reduction demand, activity inflation. what imply monetary stance level interest rate inevitably vary country region different monetary authority make judgement pace extent tighten appropriate circumstances. indeed, monetary authority asia-pacific region, growth strong inflationary worry greater, already begin tighten policy. elsewhere, uk many major economies, current set monetary policy still reflect aggressive loosen policy counter severe downside risk recession year ago. a downside risk recede recovery become firmly established, important reassess much stimulus still need keep economy steady course consistent low inflation. conclusion the turnaround global economy last year quite impressive, give scale shock financial crisis. that give u grind encouragement continue growth global economy provide supportive backdrop recovery uk – even important markets, economy euro area, may turn around slowly. indeed, imf’s medium-term forecast world economy next five year point strong global growth experience previous recovery major recession 1980s 1990s, chart 8 shows. bi review 33/2010 7 8 bi review 33/2010 but also many uncertainty affect current outlook global economy i would highlight four key influence shape recovery unfold next years. first, i argue improvement business consumer confidence key ingredient economic turnaround far. and absence shock global economic system, expect confidence among firm household continue recover, support growth private sector spend help recovery build momentum. but give experience recent times, cannot rule new shock could set back recovery. second, major financial adjustment take place major economy europe unite state bank adjust lend behaviour seek rebuild balance sheets. this adjustment continue dampen recovery demand side atlantic degree, though impact lessen process financial repair rebuild progresses. third, world growth recovery far particularly strongly drive performance asia emerge markets, dynamism large extent offset slow growth elsewhere. in view flash pan, structural feature world economy live in, expect continue impetus global growth direction. however, saw mid-2000s, also associate risk upward pressure inflation global energy commodity prices, momentum world growth become strong. fourth, high degree stimulus provide fiscal monetary policy combat recession need withdraw period time. return budget deficit sustainable level require prolong tighten fiscal policy many countries, include uk. monetary policy provide offset continue support growth private spend – though appropriate degree monetary stimulus need continually reassess light progress recovery home abroad impact inflationary pressures. give turbulence see major economy world last two years, natural worry setback recovery, uk overseas. in past, economic recovery smooth linear. so expect see variability growth rates, home abroad, recovery develops. however, look data volatility, also good grind expect growth world economy continue provide healthy support uk’s economic recovery year ahead. and, time, likely bring different set policy challenge one face course recession. jean-claude trichet: strengthen european union’s framework crisis management open statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, european commission conference “building crisis management framework internal market”, brussels, 19 march 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like thank commission invite today’s conference. i trust discussion help identify avenue strengthen european union’s framework crisis management resolution year come. the evolve crisis reflect crisis today’s perspective, i would say call “the crisis” deeply evolve phenomenon. it evolve crisis liquidity full-scale crisis bank finance, global financial economic crisis. and well aware, great deal attention currently focus fiscal policy public finances. at time, policy-makers around world far fend number threats: global meltdown finance, downward spiral economy massive increase global level unemployment. fundamentally, crisis valuation. but also crisis lead us, continue lead us, fundamental re-evaluation. we re-evaluate understand nature risk major market disruptions. we re-evaluate potential response term implementation monetary policy effectiveness fiscal policy. and citizen policy-makers, re-evaluate understand role finance economy societies. in particular, must consider fundamental question relative importance limit pure financial “game” markets, potential abuse market power, and, importantly, function financial sector broad economy. in view clear litmus test function: whether finance serf real economy. financial reform therefore must ensure finance properly reconnected real economy. reform need go beyond bank sector much attention focused. we also look closely non-bank financial institution set-up function financial markets. financial market always efficient. they also always broad, liquid represent fair competition view positions. quite often, specific market segment oligopolistic, dominate large actors. in oligopolistic markets, information handle particularly problematic, view dominant actor evolve fashion set trend that, herding, move valuation line warrant medium-term fundamentals. a recognise, leave own, finance potential spiral control, example leverage cycles, trigger financial disruption, wealth destruction economic hardship people. bi review 33/2010 1 therefore, one great challenge economics public policy time restore financial economic stability, rebuild confidence prospect economy improve future function financial systems. * * * the main agenda today progress make build crisis management framework financial system european level. i make remark key issue moment. but first i would like reflect learn crisis term fundamental issue systemic risk. systemic risk a pre-condition meet challenge crisis prevention crisis management deep understand nature systemic risk. the financial crisis reveal many respects. it reveal scale potential fallout failure large financial institutions. it reveal fragility financial system feature trend cut across institutions, market infrastructures. and illustrate amplitude consequence adverse feedback loop financial system real economy. all three element i describe key feature systemic risk: first, contagion; second, build-up financial imbalance unsustainable trend within across financial system; third, close link real economy potential strong feedback effects. to identify source systemic risk recommend remedial action task macroprudential supervision eu, cross-border crisis management framework help handle large complex financial intermediary whose disorderly failure could pose systemic risks. a crisis management framework the national legal institutional arrangement number member state seek improve framework prudential supervision financial stability. we european central bank support improvements. one key remain issue accompany great interdependency national financial system thereby bolster process eu financial integration desirable welfare point view. this require appropriate action eu level address possible systemic impact fail cross-border financial institutions. the ecb therefore fully support commission initiative develop eu-wide resolution framework remove obstacle effective crisis management pertain eu cross-border financial institutions. the commission suggest useful classification main issue discussion three areas: early intervention supervisors; bank resolution; insolvency proceedings. let devote word them. first, area early intervention enhancement cooperation among supervisory authority important, address ail cross-border financial institution. it improve achieve convergence regard minimum set tool available supervisory authority involved. this may require also common terminology regard instance type reorganisation measure use financial institutions. 2 bi review 33/2010 second, regard bank resolution, priority pursue enhance coherent framework action supervisory resolution authorities. to avoid moral hazard, authority ready intervene appropriate action contain possible impact financial stability and, appropriate, ensure orderly winding-up affect financial institution. in single market, effort make facilitate coordination action national authority involve resolution cross-border bank financial group. over medium term, would helpful achieve close institutional convergence, enhance role authority within resolution process, recognise particular lead role administration ail financial institutions, full respect due role judicial system. third, regard insolvency proceedings, new initiative require promote harmonization eu level. today, national legal regime still diverse term rule procedure apply. it recognise harmonization eu level may difficult achieve, underline key crisis resolution. therefore, utmost effort devote assess outstanding problem identify possible way forward. the ecb strongly support recent establishment commission group expert pursue aim. there one central challenge crisis management framework speed. the rapidity unfold development one great challenge policy makers. and even though financial crisis mean new phenomena, speed transmission accelerate tremendously past decades. the unfold sovereign debt crisis 1980’s occur course years, asian financial crisis developed, peak, months. and last intensification present crisis, start september 2008, spread around globe course half-days. many factor contribute acceleration, include process global financial integration, increase leverage institutions, technological advancement allow instantaneous transmission information world-wide accumulation long period time unsustainable global imbalances. hence, key message crisis management framework need able cope speed financial development unfold. the role infrastructure policy action concern bank also system whole, particular address market functioning, include cds. the current reflection international level include also initiative aim strengthen core financial infrastructure markets. indeed, essential condition place ensure financial system able withstand possible shock financial infrastructure strengthen reduce risk contagion. moreover, regulator ensure financial market participant behave full compliance rule additional source risk would derive improper behaviour. in context, attention attract current juncture credit default swap (cds) market. i would like highlight importance certain financial instruments, introduce consideration positive effect hedge risks, misuse speculative manner. i share consensus global level regulator equip appropriate tool able investigate act effective coordinate manner. we need transparency cd markets, investors. bi review 33/2010 3 4 bi review 33/2010 transparency market public good. authority must able gather information, ass possible risk financial stability detect possible improper conduct. in respect, key priority term enhance resilience cd market establishment central counterparty facilities. such ccps help, particular, diversify share risk exposure margining procedure reduce incentive take excessive risks. moreover, ccps deliver much need transparency party involved. conclusion the define characteristic financial crisis collapse confidence. the define characteristic current crisis loss confidence seem permeate whole world almost instantaneously. at height crisis – irrational exuberance turn excessive pessimism – i repeatedly state regain confidence essence. since then, confidence short term restored, least bold courageous policy action around globe. go forward, need strengthen longer-term confidence, require policy framework robust future challenges. that agenda i know plan make progress today. thank attention. petar goshev: alleviate negative effect financial crisis welcome address mr petar goshev, governor national bank republic

governor sverige riksbank, centre business policy study (sns), stockholm, 18 march 2010. * * * carl andreas claussen gabriela guibourg contribute speech. assessment monetary policy important several reasons. first, riksbank independent position relation riksdag government since 1999. this means, instance, executive board make monetary policy decision without seek take instructions. the riksbank’s independence give governor great deal power. it therefore also important activity riksbank monitor assess governor call account. a high level transparency regular assessment also necessary maintain legitimacy riksbank’s activities. second, regular assessment also help ensure riksbank develop monetary policy analysis best possible way. every year, riksdag committee finance examine ass monetary policy conduct riksbank precede years. the riksbank compile publish material assessment. we publish material day ago. the main message material riksbank respond crisis take forceful measures. the repo rate cut almost zero riksbank announce intention let repo rate remain level relatively long period time. the turbulence financial market also mean monetary policy le impact normal. the riksbank respond complement monetary policy extensive lend banks. in way, monetary policy help dampen fall production employment. it also help keep inflation line target long term. this i intend talk today. first, however, i would like say word principle important assess monetary policy. what consider ass monetary policy? when one say monetary policy conduct past year good? the answer question naturally depend target monetary policy is. the riksbank explicit inflation target accord annual change consumer price index (cpi) 2 per cent. a monetary policy act time lag, base forecasts. the riksbank’s forecast base assumption repo rate – riksbank’s policy rate – develop way monetary policy regard well-balanced. in normal case, well-balanced monetary policy mean inflation forecast close inflation target couple year ahead time forecast inflation real economy (production, employment unemployment) fluctuate excessively. it thus question find appropriate balance stabilise inflation stabilise real economy resource utilisation. the riksbank therefore conduct generally refer flexible inflation targeting. one might think enough simply compare outcome inflation inflation target assess monetary policy. but simple, two reasons. the first take time change repo rate effect inflation real economy. during period time, shock may occur push economy different direction forecast. the monetary policy adopt may right, riksbank unlucky unforeseen shock lead inflation deviate target. bi review 32/2010 1 the monetary policy adopt may wrong, riksbank lucky unforeseen shock nevertheless lead inflation hit target. the second flexible inflation target mean riksbank strive stabilise inflation around inflation target also stabilise resource utilisation around normal level. this sometimes entail difficult balance act. shock may, example, occur make difficult quickly bring inflation target without create major fluctuation real economy. one may choose let outcome inflation deviate target. this deviation deliberate represent part compromise stabilise inflation stabilise resource utilisation. so, one ass monetary policy? two approach used. the first ass monetary policy couple year monetary decision concerned, inflation real economy time react monetary policy measures, use information available time assessment, include information become available decision made. this is, words, assessment fact, call assessment ex post. although may interest analyse shock occur monetary policy decision made, practically self-evident monetary policy could good shock occur late know time decision made. an assessment fact therefore necessarily relevant form assessment. a relevant approach put position decision maker time decision make try ass decision give information available. in words. perform assessment base information available decision makers, call assessment ex ante. the question answer whether analysis interest rate decision reasonable give information forecast available time. do riksbank, example, arrive reasonable balance stabilise inflation stabilise resource utilisation? an assessment base information available decision maker also great advantage conduct real time immediately publication monetary policy decision information analysis decision based. one thus need wait couple year see outcome inflation real economy be. the decision riksbank therefore assess debate ongoing basis. an important part assessment flexible inflation target policy ass credible inflation target is, measure term extent various economic agents’ inflation expectation correspond inflation target. if inflation expectation stable close inflation target target credible therefore easy riksbank stabilise inflation resource utilisation. a i already said, take time monetary policy impact inflation real economy. monetary policy therefore govern forecasts. it question choose repo-rate path forecast inflation resource utilisation entail best possible stabilisation inflation resource utilisation. a forecast play central role monetary policy decisions, course important riksbank employ good forecast method us relevant information available forecast produce accurate possible. an important step assessment monetary policy therefore investigate whether forecast reasonably accurate. one way compare riksbank’s forecast forecasters. the riksbank make comparison every year. another component assessment monetary policy analyse predictable monetary policy impact market rates. monetary policy mainly act influence expectation regard interest rates, inflation real economy future. expectation regard repo rate year immediately ahead affect interest rate 2 bi review 32/2010 long maturities, therefore inflation real economy, repo rate period next monetary policy decision. the predictability monetary policy measure term well market predict next repo-rate path. how effectively monetary policy steer market expectation market rate measure term closely market expectation regard future repo rate correspond repo-rate path published. the riksbank’s material assessment monetary policy sweden 2009 base principle i describe entail certain renewal compare assessment previous years.1 i intend present material assess monetary policy 2009 riksbank publish day ago. a probably know, include meet hold april 2009 i enter reservation monetary policy decision advocate low repo-rate path, grind would good stabilise cpif inflation resource utilisation without lead problem financial stability function financial markets.2 however, speech today i focus policy conduct majority executive board. 2009 – extraordinary year monetary policy in 2009, riksbank continue conduct increasingly expansionary monetary policy. the aim attain inflation target mitigate effect financial crisis real economy. from february begin july, riksbank cut repo rate 2.0 per cent all-time low 0.25 per cent. the repo-rate path, riksbank’s forecast development repo rate year ahead, also revise downwards every monetary policy meet period. during rest year, repo rate repo-rate path leave unchanged. a result turbulence financial markets, however, impact monetary policy weak normal 2009. the riksbank respond problem complement monetary policy extensive lend banks. so, nature forecast assessment form basis monetary policy decisions? the repo rate cut 1 percent repo-rate path adjust downwards february in february, appear downturn economic activity, sweden abroad, would severe would happen much quickly previously assess riksbank. at monetary policy meet 10 february, riksbank therefore decide cut repo rate whole percentage point one percent. the repo-rate path adjust downwards repo-rate cut 2009 indicate (see figure 1). 1 for detail description one ass monetary policy see lars e.0. svensson, “assessing monetary policy”, speech uppsala university, 13 march 2009. 2 for detail description argument behind reservation see lars e. o. svensson: “why low repo-rate path?”, speech umeå university, 24 february 2010. bi review 32/2010 3 4 bi review 32/2010 the monetary policy report february 2009 present forecast base report’s main scenario alternative forecast base repo-rate path adopt meet december 2008.3 these show figure 2.a, high repo rate path (the blue break curve) represent forecast december 2008. the low repo rate path (the red break curve) represent riksbank’s main scenario february 2009. the riksbank’s inflation target express term cpi inflation. however, vary strongly late part 2008 2009, due major change repo rate. this cpi include mortgage costs. in situation, reasonable instead look inflation measure term cpif, exclude interest rate changes. figure 2.b illustrate riksbank’s forecast cpif inflation, base two repo-rate paths. the low repo-rate path, propose main scenario, give inflation forecast, measure term cpif, approach 2 per cent two year ahead. the high repo rate path instead give inflation forecast fell widely short target entire forecast period. equivalent forecast cpi inflation show figure 2.c. the riksbank us number measure indicator measure resource utilisation economy. one measure output gap, calculate percentage difference gdp estimate trend.4 if gap positive, signify level activity economy high gdp trend level. the opposite 3 alternative forecast repo rate publish monetary policy reports, three time per year. alternative forecast repo rate also discuss ahead remain monetary policy meetings, publish monetary policy updates. 4 the trend estimate use so-called hodrick-prescott filter (hp filter). this statistical method divide movement variable trend cyclical components. the method describe weight double-sided move average great weight place observation close hand gradually decrease weight distant observations. the output gap accord hp method necessarily interpret riksbank’s overall assessment resource utilisation. apply gap negative. figure 2.d illustrate output gap base two repo rate paths. both path result negative output gap forecast period, say resource utilisation normal level. however, use repo rate path main scenario give le negative output gap, use measurement method, use repo rate path december 2008. the low repo-rate path thus stabilise cpif inflation resource utilisation good high repo rate path. further repo-rate cut april july gdp continue fall dramatically first quarter year, sweden well abroad, gdp forecast 2009 revise downwards compare riksbank’s assessment february. the riksbank also assess cpi inflation would fall rapidly 2009, largely due rapid interest rate cut implement end 2008 start 2009. at monetary policy meet 20 april, repo rate cut 0.5 percentage point 0.5 per cent. the repo rate expect remain low level begin 2011 (see figure 1). in july, assessment decline economic activity 2009 would slightly deep assessment make riksbank april. the riksbank’s assessment repo rate repo-rate path need even lower. the repo rate cut 0.25 percentage point 0.25 per cent monetary policy meet 1 july. the repo rate expect remain low level autumn 2010 (see figure 1). the riksbank also assess cut represent threat function financial markets. furthermore, riksbank deem that, follow cut 0.25 per cent, repo rate practice reach low bound. bi review 32/2010 5 the alternative repo-rate path publish monetary policy report july associate forecast cpif inflation output gap show figure 3. the majority executive board adopt repo-rate path mark main scenario. the situation financial market sweden abroad start show sign improvement spring, still highly uncertain. major divergence market’s repo rate expectation riksbank’s repo-rate path also arise year (see figure 4). this result monetary policy le impact intended. partly reason, riksbank decide lend sek 100 million bank form fixed-rate loan maturity 12 months. it deem measure could contribute low interest rate loan company households. 6 bi review 32/2010 the repo rate repo-rate path leave unchanged rest year follow decision july, increase number sign turnaround economic activity sweden abroad. at monetary policy meet 2 september 22 october, decide keep repo rate unchanged 0.25 per cent. the forecast repo rate also hold unchanged occasion (see figure 1). figure 5 illustrate alternative forecast repo rate, inflation resource utilisation discuss monetary policy meet october. bi review 32/2010 7 8 bi review 32/2010 a complementary monetary policy measure, riksbank decided, occasions, make fixed-rate loan sek 100 billion available bank twelve months. the recovery deep recession continue autumn. at monetary policy meet 15 december, riksbank resolve leave repo rate unchanged, 0.25 per cent. the forecast repo rate also hold unchanged. how different monetary policy alternative assessed? in connection every monetary policy decision, executive board make assessment repo-rate path need monetary policy consider well-balanced. one natural way assess repo-rate path best give situation compare forecast inflation resource utilisation alternative repo-rate paths. such comparison find chapter 2 monetary policy report material assessment monetary policy 2009 recently publish riksbank.5 the alternative scenario usually present form figure show forecast inflation various measure resource utilisation particular repo-rate path expect give rise to. 5 see "material assess monetary policy 2009", sverige riksbank. a box material assess monetary policy 2009 describe method summarise information alternative forecasts. this method us easily-grasped measure, so-called mean square gap, effectively interest rate path stabilise inflation around inflation target resource utilisation around normal level.6 allow illustrate method use example monetary policy report publish october 2009, box present method. figure 6 show forecast development inflation measure term cpif resource utilisation measure term output gap various repo-rate path discuss monetary policy report october 2009. the various repo-rate path show figure 6.a. the path middle main scenario, repo rate path majority executive board choose meet october. the low path one i advocated. figure 6.b show forecast cpif inflation repo-rate path expect give rise to.7 the output gap, show figure 6.d, calculate way figure i present earlier. figure 6.c show mean square gap. a low mean square gap inflation entail good acquisition inflation target; good stabilisation inflation around inflation target. a low mean square gap resource utilisation entail good stabilisation resource utilisation around normal level. consequently, close point lie origo, “south-west” figure, small total deviation inflation inflation target resource utilisation normal level. from figure 6.c, see low repo-rate path alternative scenario monetary policy report october 2009 close origo dimension inflation measure term cpif. it thus stabilise inflation resource utilisation better. 6 the mean square gap inflation measure gap inflation forecast inflation target or, precisely, mean square deviation inflation forecast inflation target forecast period. the mean square gap resource utilisation, measure output gap, measure deviation forecast resource utilisation normal resource utilisation – precisely, average square gap forecast period. for discussion see lars e.o. svensson, “evaluating monetary policy,” forthcoming koenig, evan, robert leeson, eds., from great moderation great deviation: a round-trip journey base work john b. taylor (revision update speech uppsala university 13 march 2009). 7 one may ask focus cpif cpi. in situation extensive repo-rate change large direct effect cpi, i consider appropriate focus stabilise cpif around inflation target, instead cpi. bi review 32/2010 9 however, assessment majority executive board low repo-rate path appropriate. at monetary policy meet hold course year, view several member executive board effect low repo-rate level economy financial market uncertain therefore reason cautious reduce repo rate 0.25 per cent. it easy make reliable estimate forecast potential production resource utilisation. the riksbank’s estimate forecast potential production hour work need improvement development. such development work currently underway. in 2009, financial crisis reduce potential production resource utilisation economy low give level production before. there doubt, however, resource utilisation low remain low normal forecast period (see figure 7). 10 bi review 32/2010 the numerical inflation target entail great progress practical monetary policy make possible measure evaluate target fulfilment monetary policy much efficient manner before. however, fact monetary policy direct towards stabilise inflation, also towards stabilise resource utilisation has, absence quantitative measure stability variables, make difficult measure evaluate target fulfilment stability dimension. quantitative measure mean square gap make possible measure evaluate target fulfilment, however. work underway riksbank determine measure used. the result work successively report monetary policy report document publish riksbank. how outcome 2009 compare forecasts? inflation far target record fall gdp the rate inflation, measure change cpi, average –0.3 per cent 2009; thus far inflation target 2 per cent. this explain – i already mention – riksbank’s substantial repo-rate cuts, begin autumn 2008. the riksbank’s repo-rate cut lead low mortgage rate mortgage rate include cpi. measure term cpif, cpi fix mortgage rate, inflation stable average 1.9 per cent 2009. the repo-rate cut 2008 2009 make full realisation cpi inflation would low. in long term, however, repo-rate cut help keep cpi inflation line target. the fact cpi inflation far target thus see result deliberate monetary policy autumn 2008. gdp fell 4.9 per cent 2009. this large fall swedish gdp single year modern times. average unemployment increase approximately 2.2 percentage point year amount 8.4 per cent 2009. both employment number bi review 32/2010 11 12 bi review 32/2010 hour work fell significantly. the reason sweden hard hit global crisis swedish economy highly dependent exports. the effect gdp reinforce fact household increase saving. company also sell stock great extent year, thus reduce investment stock contribute fall gdp. the impact financial crisis surprise forecaster the turmoil financial market part picture influence monetary policy forecast since 2007. it nevertheless come surprise situation would deteriorate dramatically autumn 2008 result dramatic fall production around world. neither riksbank analyst predict strength global financial crisis much would affect inflation development real economy. figure 8 show forecast average cpi inflation 2009 make various forecaster 2008 2009.8 the figure show pattern time roughly forecasters. during first half 2008, forecaster expect inflation would 2 3 per cent 2009, actual outcome –0.3 per cent. the explanation overestimation forecaster foresee financial crisis would take dramatic turn autumn and, consequently, inflation would fall quickly result riksbank’s repo-rate cuts. once financial crisis upon u dramatic downturn economic activity follow wake begun, forecaster revise forecast downwards quickly substantially. from begin 2009, forecast gather around actual outcome. 8 the analysis base data gather national institute economic research. one advantage data show exactly forecast made. the forecast comparison cover ten forecast institution whole-year forecast gdp growth, cpi percentage unemployed. the ten forecast institution are: swedish ministry finance, swedish retail institute, national institute economic research, swedish trade union confederation (lo), nordea, seb, svenska handelsbanken, confederation swedish enterprise, swedbank riksbank. the figure interpret follows: each mark represent particular inflation forecast. the red mark show riksbank’s forecasts, blue mark show forecast make number forecasters. it possible see high inflation rate forecaster predict look vertical axel, horizontal axel show forecast made. the dot line figure show actual outcome cpi inflation 2009. figure 9 show forecast gdp growth 2009 make various forecaster 2008 2009. in case, too, clear forecast follow common pattern. initially, forecaster tend overestimate gdp growth 2009 during first half 2008, estimate average growth 2009 would approximately 2 per cent. a appear bi review 32/2010 13 14 bi review 32/2010 financial turmoil would dampen growth sweden abroad, gdp forecast gradually revise downwards. after april 2009, many forecast gather around actual outcome gdp growth, –4.9 per cent. however, forecaster revise forecast upwards towards end year thus surprise low outcome. all all, note riksbank overestimate outcome inflation 2009 approximately extent average forecasters, although exception july september 2008 riksbank’s forecast overestimate prospect inflation high degree forecaster (see figure 8). this energy price increase expect spring, lead inflation reach 4 per cent summer 2008. the riksbank thus saw risk substantial increase price food oil would also lead rapid increase prices. unusually high inflation expectation also contribute assessment. with regard outcome gdp growth, riksbank’s overestimation approximately average forecasters. all forecaster continue overestimate gdp growth 2009 even first quarter 2009. in words, forecaster predict economic downturn sooner other. how accurate riksbank’s forecasts? a monetary policy base forecast important riksbank’s forecast acceptably accurate. however, possible ass accuracy analyse forecast single year. even forecaster good average accuracy may le successful individual year. a fair assessment require long observation period. a fair comparison accuracy different forecast take account fact forecast make different point time different forecaster therefore information available them. in comparison forecast make material assessment monetary policy, method use take difference account.9 figure 10 show adjust absolute average error inflation forecast period 1999–2009, absolute forecast error cpi inflation adjust difference forecast horizon.10 the short bar, small forecast error high accuracy forecast. 9 see m. andersson t. aranki, “a comparison different forecasters’ ability give publication date effect”, sverige riksbank economic review, no.1, 2009. 10 the average error calculate mean value forecaster's forecast error forecast period. the absolute average error mean sign individual forecast deviation take account. the major forecaster – swedish ministry finance, national institute economic research riksbank – report individually, others report average. it may worth note riksbank’s forecast third inflation report 2005 base assumption unchanged repo rate forecast period. this may hamper accuracy. the difference different forecaster small hard find significant variations. the forecast different forecaster tend follow relatively closely, indicate figure 8. in material assessment monetary policy similar figure forecast gdp growth unemployment (see figure 11 figure 12). take together, figure show riksbank, like forecasters, tend overestimate cpi inflation gdp growth underestimate unemployment period 1999–2009. bi review 32/2010 15 with regard forecast repo rate still soon compare forecast performance various forecaster riksbank publish repo rate forecast three years. with short assessment period, chance play large role make meaningful draw general conclusion forecast performance. figure 13 nevertheless show accuracy forecast repo rate period 2007–2009 forecaster publish forecasts. 16 bi review 32/2010 on average three years, forecaster tend overestimate repo rate, riksbank large forecast error five forecasters. the main reason riksbank’s relatively large forecast error period previously mention overestimation forecast cpi inflation july september 2008. on occasions, riksbank’s forecast overestimate prospect inflation great degree forecasters. a i say earlier, overestimation due concern part riksbank significant increase price oil food spring, combination unusually high inflation expectations, would lead increase inflation. the credibility inflation target confidence inflation target form stable inflation expectation close target fundamental riksbank’s effort achieve price stability stable resource utilisation. this inflation expectation affect wage formation pricing. stable inflation expectation thus contribute stable inflation. a high level credibility inflation target also increase possibility riksbank stabilise resource utilisation. if increase inflation rapidly reflect high inflation expectations, riksbank would force act quickly forcefully would otherwise necessary dampen demand prevent inflationary impulse gain last foothold. the fluctuation real economy would thereby great inflation expectation good anchored. establish credibility belief inflation keep low stable therefore important effort increase macroeconomic stability. if inflation expectation indicate various survey stable close inflation target year ahead, interpret mean public confident riksbank achieve target. the survey tn sifo prospera carry inflation expectation among money market agents, employer employee organisation purchase manager retail sector manufacture industry show case. figure 14 show average expectation regard cpi inflation one, two five bi review 32/2010 17 18 bi review 32/2010 year ahead among participant prospera survey. inflation expectation five year ahead close 2 per cent, show credibility inflation target high. inflation expectation short horizon base great degree current actual inflation.11 the exceptional circumstance monetary policy follow wake financial crisis, substantial rapid cut repo rate, push cpi inflation unusually low levels. this, together severe downturn uncertainty prevail concern recovery economy, mean hardly surprise short-term inflation expectation target. how well market’s expectation regard repo rate match riksbank’s repo-rate path? since february 2007, riksbank publish forecast development repo rate period ahead. a publish repo-rate path make easy explain riksbank’s view development reason public financial market monetary policy decision made. the aim improve riksbank’s ability steer expectation regard monetary policy conduct future. expectation regard repo rate influence long-term interest rate turn important economic decision household companies. the riksbank update repo rate path monetary policy meetings, hold approximately every month. during two-month period, new information development economy may emerge. if riksbank successful communicate principle monetary policy, market participant able predict rather 11 see t. jonsson p. österholm, “the property survey-based inflation expectation sweden”, work paper no. 114, 2009, national institute economic research. well new information affect riksbank’s repo rate path. this help ensure small deviation market’s expectation day publication repo-rate path repo-rate path riksbank actually publishes. the riksbank’s repo-rate path 2007 2008 were, large, well predict market. in four case six, expectation already line riksbank’s repo-rate path publication, interpret indicate market’s ability predict understand monetary policy strong. when significant deviations, market case adjust expectation towards repo-rate path publication, also indicate general difficult understand riksbank’s reasoning. despite fact economic situation highly uncertain february 2009 repo-rate path significantly lowered, new repo-rate path predict relatively well market market’s expectation also shift close new repo-rate path publication (see figure 15). from april 2009, however, relatively large difference market’s expectation riksbank’s repo-rate path appeared. in advance monetary policy meet april, market expect forecast repo rate next year would low again. however, riksbank’s new forecast entail considerably low repo rate 2010 2011 market expected. even so, riksbank’s new forecast significantly affect market expectation (see figure 16). bi review 32/2010 19 20 bi review 32/2010 in period lead december, market expectation development repo rate change relatively little, even though riksbank cut repo rate forecast july hold forecast entire autumn. however, december, market expectation approach riksbank’s forecast (see figure 4). so gap market expectation riksbank’s repo rate forecast 2009 explained? some deviation may explained, example, possibility statement low bind repo rate interpret mean upside risk repo rate, explain all. a major part deviation thus remain explained. one possible explanation may money market participant take positive view economic development. for example, may expect gdp growth inflation high future state riksbank’s forecasts, thus require tight monetary policy. however, hypothesis support survey expect economic development. these show money market participant expect low inflation low gdp growth period ahead riksbank.12 the market participant seem believe different reaction pattern riksbank express repo-rate path. the disagreement among member executive board may contribute this. at monetary policy meet july, september, october december, reservation publish repo rate path enter member consider repo rate path 2010 slightly higher. 12 see tn sifo prospera’s survey expectation inflation gdp growth among money market participant 2009. see also lars e.o. svensson (2010), “policy expectation policy evaluations: role transparency communication” sverige riksbank economic review, no. 1, 2010. bi review 32/2010 21 monetary policy mitigate effect crisis the riksbank react forcefully successfully major shock occur since autumn 2008 – even i personally, reveal reservation course 2009, would like see riksbank react even forcefully thus stabilise inflation resource utilisation even better. the global recession follow wake financial crisis surprise u meet mark shift monetary policy entail rapid repeat cut repo rate summer 2009. the repo-rate cut lead low mortgage rates, turn push cpi inflation. however, cut help keep cpif inflation close target. the series repo-rate cut begin autumn 2008 necessary order mitigate effect financial crisis real economy achieve good attainment inflation target. without substantial reduction repo rate, gdp would fall even more. monetary policy also complement extensive lend banks. these complementary measure help financial market function effectively, ease supply credit increase impact monetary policy. ben s bernanke: the federal reserve’s role bank supervision testimony mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 17 march 2010. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * chairman frank, rank member bachus, member committee, i please opportunity discus federal reserve’s role bank supervision action take strengthen supervisory oversight. the federal reserve’s role supervision like many central bank around world, federal reserve cooperate agency regulate supervise bank system.1 our specific responsibility include oversight 5,000 bank hold companies, include umbrella supervision large, complex financial firms; supervision 850 bank nationwide state-chartered member federal reserve system (state member banks); oversight foreign bank organization operate unite states. the federal reserve’s involvement regulation supervision confer two broad set benefit country. first, wide range expertise, federal reserve uniquely suit supervise large, complex financial organization address safety soundness risk risk stability financial system whole. second, federal reserve’s participation oversight bank size significantly improve ability carry central bank functions, include make monetary policy, lend discount window, foster financial stability.2 the financial crisis make clear financial institution large interconnect failure could threaten stability financial system economy must subject strong consolidate supervision. promote safety soundness individual bank organization require traditional skill bank supervisors, expertise examination risk-management practices; federal reserve develop expertise long experience supervise bank sizes, include community bank regional banks. but supervision large, complex financial institution analysis potential risk financial system whole require traditional examination skills, also number form expertise, include macroeconomic analysis forecasting; insight sectoral, regional, global 1 in aftermath crisis, view involvement central bank bank supervision strongly complement role lender last resort, guardian financial stability, monetary policymaker receive increase international support. for example, follow problem northern rock unite kingdom, bank england give statutory responsibility area financial stability, power collect information bank augmented, many call give increase supervisory authority. in germany, plan shift bank supervisory power financial service regulator bundesbank receive significant attention. in european union, new european systemic risk board establish national central bank european central bank play key role effort protect financial system systemic risk. more broadly, industrial country today central bank substantial bank supervisory authorities, responsible broad financial stability, both. 2 see ben s. bernanke (2010), letter christopher j. dodd richard c. shelby (with enclosure, “the public policy case role federal reserve bank supervision regulation”), january 13. bi review 31/2010 1 economic developments; knowledge range domestic international financial markets, include money markets, capital markets, foreign exchange derivative markets; close work knowledge financial infrastructure, include payment system system clear settlement financial

expertise macroeconomic forecast make monetary policy, important help identify economic risk institution markets. in addition, acquire in-depth market knowledge daily participation financial market implement monetary policy execute financial transaction behalf u.s. treasury. similarly, federal reserve’s extensive knowledge payment settlement system develop operation world’s large systems, supervision key provider payment settlement services, long-standing leadership international committee payment settlement systems. no agency can, likely able to, replicate breadth depth relevant expertise federal reserve bring supervision large, complex bank organization identification analysis systemic risks. even federal reserve’s central bank function enhance supervisory expertise, involvement supervise bank size across country significantly improve federal reserve’s ability effectively carry central-bank responsibilities. perhaps important, crisis demonstrated, federal

preserve supervisory authority federal reserve need carry central bank function effectively. improve federal reserve’s supervision bank organization the federal reserve strongly support ongoing effort congress reform financial regulation close exist gap regulatory framework.5 while await passage 3 for discussion, see bernanke letter dodd shelby note 2. 4 our ability monitor key payment settlement system also depend critically supervisory powers, several key institution involve payment settlement state member bank edge charters. without bank supervisory authority, federal reserve would ability examine regulate institutions. 5 lack strong consolidate supervision systemically critical firm organize bank hold company prove serious regulatory gap. in addition, gramm-leach-bliley act 1999, federal reserve’s consolidate supervision bank hold company narrowly focus safety soundness bank subsidiary heavily reliant functional supervisor bank regulate nonbank subsidiary companies; turn,

financial intermediation signal inefficiency sector. the challenge policymaker develop financial sector answer challenge economy. in order address market inefficiencies, central bank 2 bi review 38/2010 stakeholder undertake significant reform bank sector. these reform include operationalisation credit reference bureaus, payment system improvements, open new currency centres, automation trade system treasury bonds, activation horizontal repos. i spend next minute highlight initiatives. operationalisation credit reference mechanism: the bank (credit reference bureau) regulation operationalised 2nd february 2009. this facilitate share credit information institution license bank act. this link allow industry build information capital critical credit market. it also enhance access credit smes individual constrain lack physical collateral. further, bank sector able address problem non-performing loan origination point credit history applicant take account credit appraisal

accordingly. further, failure bank system extend maturity loan product consequence characteristic nature deposit largely short term, also assessment price risk. to support economic development, need development bank product support long term lending. these development bank product play significant role influence downward trend commercial bank lend rates. the central bank therefore explore development bank product introduce market enhance monetary policy transmission mechanism lengthen maturity profile commercial bank term loans. development bond market: the central bank successfully raise fund infrastructure development government infrastructure bonds. these infrastructure bond facilitate finance government’s infrastructure program also set pace issuance similar bond corporate entity kengen safaricom. this, couple automate trade nairobi stock exchange important vibrant bond market. in addition, deepen widen bond market, central bank implement follow measures:  issuance

you recall central bank kenya, nairobi stock exchange capital market authority collaborate automation trade treasury bond nse. the main objective initiative make bond trade secure, efficient create vibrant market. the expect improvement market activity also improve market liquidity encourage investor participate bond market. operationalisation horizontal repos: we introduce interbank master

reserve system, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 25 march 2010. * * * chairman frank watt, rank member bachus paul, member committee subcommittee, i appreciate opportunity discus federal reserve’s strategy exit extraordinary lend monetary policy implement combat financial crisis support economic activity. a know, i previously submit prepare testimony hear topic cancel weather conditions. i request testimony include record hearing. this morning, lieu repeat previous prepare statement, i would like summarize key point early testimony update committee recent developments. broadly speaking, federal reserve’s response crisis recession divide two parts. first, financial system past 2–1/2 year experience period intense panic dysfunction, private short-term fund become difficult impossible obtain many borrowers. the pull back private liquidity time threaten stability financial institution market severely disrupt normal channel credit. in role liquidity provider last resort, federal reserve develop number program provide well-secured, mostly short-term credit financial system. these programs, impose cost taxpayers, critical part government’s effort stabilize financial system restart flow credit american family businesses. besides ensure range financial institution – include depository institutions, primary dealers, money market mutual fund – access adequate liquidity extremely stress environment, federal reserve’s lend help restore normal function support credit extension number key financial markets, include interbank lend market, commercial paper market, market asset-backed securities. a financial condition improved, federal reserve substantially phase lend programs. some facility close course 2009, others expire february 1.1 the term auction facility, fix amount discount window credit auction depository institutions, discontinue past weeks. a today, facility still operation offer credit multiple institutions, regular discount window, term asset-backed security loan facility (talf), support market asset-backed securities, back auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, student loans. reflect notably good condition many market asset-backed securities, talf schedule close march 31 loan back type collateral except newly issue commercial mortgage-backed security (cmbs) june 30 loan back newly issue cmbs.2 1 the exit program substantially complete: total credit outstanding programs, include regular discount window, fall sharply peak $1–1/2 trillion around year-end 2008 $71 billion last week. 2 the talf extend three- five-year loans, remain outstanding facility close new loans. the late schedule close cmb portion facility reflect board’s assessment condition sector remain highly stressed, well fact cmb securitizations complex take long arrange types. 2 bi review 37/2010 in addition, federal reserve normalize term regular discount window loans. we reduce maximum maturity discount window loan 90 day overnight nearly loans, restore pre-crisis practice. in mid-february federal reserve also increase spread discount rate upper limit target range federal fund rate 25 basis point 50 basis points. we emphasize closure emergency lend facility adjustment term discount window loan response improve condition financial markets. they expect lead tight financial condition household business hence constitute tighten monetary policy, interpret signal change outlook monetary policy. the second part federal reserve’s response crisis recession, besides provision liquidity financial system, involve standard le conventional form monetary policy. after reduce short-term interest rate nearly zero, federal open market committee (fomc) provide additional monetary policy stimulus large-scale purchase treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed security (mbs), agency debt. all told, federal reserve purchase $300 billion treasury security conclude purchase $1.25 trillion agency mb $175 billion agency debt end month. the federal reserve’s purchase effect leave bank system highly liquid, u.s. bank hold $1.1 trillion reserve federal reserve banks. a range evidence suggest purchase associate creation bank reserve help improve condition mortgage market private credit market put downward pressure longer-term private borrow rate spreads. at meet last week, fomc maintain target range federal fund rate 0 1/4 percent indicate continue anticipate economic conditions, include low rate resource utilization, subdue inflation trends, stable inflation expectations, likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate extend period. in due course, however, expansion matures, federal reserve need begin tighten monetary condition prevent development inflationary pressures. the federal reserve number tool enable firm stance policy appropriate time. most importantly, october 2008 congress give federal reserve statutory authority pay interest balance bank hold federal reserve banks. by increase interest rate banks’ reserves, federal reserve able put significant upward pressure short-term interest rates, bank supply short-term fund money market rate significantly earn hold reserve federal reserve banks. actual prospective increase short-term interest rate reflect turn high longer-term interest rate tight financial condition generally. the federal reserve also develop number additional tool able use reduce large quantity reserve currently hold bank system. reduce quantity reserve low net supply fund money markets, improve federal reserve’s control financial condition lead tight relationship interest rate pay reserve short-term interest rates. notably, build capability drain large quantity reserves, federal reserve work expand range counterparties reverse repurchase operation beyond primary dealer develop infrastructure necessary use agency mb collateral transactions.3 in regard, federal reserve recently announce 3 primary dealer broker-dealer trade u.s. government security federal reserve bank new york. bi review 37/2010 3 criterion apply determine eligibility money market mutual fund serve counterparties reverse repurchase agreements. a additional mean drain reserves, federal reserve also develop plan offer depository institution term deposits, roughly analogous certificate deposit institution offer customers. a proposal describe term deposit facility recently publish federal register, federal reserve finalize revise proposal light public comment received. after revise proposal review board, expect able conduct test transaction spring facility available necessary thereafter. the use reverse repos deposit facility would together allow federal reserve drain hundred billion dollar reserve bank system quite quickly, choose so. when tool use drain reserve bank system, replace bank reserve liabilities; asset side overall size federal reserve’s balance sheet remain unchanged. if necessary, mean apply monetary restraint, federal reserve also option redeem sell securities. the redemption sale security would effect reduce size federal reserve’s balance sheet well reduce quantity reserve bank system. restore size composition balance sheet normal configuration longer-term objective policies. in case, sequence step combination tool federal reserve us exit currently accommodative policy stance depend economic financial development best judgment meet federal reserve’s dual mandate maximum employment price stability. in sum, response severe threat economy, federal reserve create series special lend facility stabilize financial system encourage resumption private credit flow american family businesses. a market condition economic outlook improved, program terminate phase out. the federal reserve also promote economic recovery sharp reduction target federal fund rate large-scale purchase securities. the economy continue require support accommodative monetary policies. however, work ensure tool reverse, appropriate time, currently high degree monetary stimulus. we full confidence that, time comes, ready so. bi review 37/2010 1 nil bernstein: recover danish economy house market development speech mr nil bernstein, governor national bank denmark, annual meet danish mortgage banks’ federation, copenhagen, 24 march 2010. * * * the global economy mend. the upswing fragile, though direction economic indicator clear, recovery seem slightly strong expect autumn. the recovery strong emerge develop economies, remain slightly subdue europe. the overall picture economic setback pronounce region financial sector particularly expose inflate asset values. the development yet lead reversal labour market usa europe. the rebound international economy primarily result many countries’ still expansionary fiscal monetary policies. the extraordinary monetary policy measure slowly phase out. but central bank begin raise interest rates. public finance deteriorate across industrial countries. and eu member state expect run budget deficit exceed 3 per cent gdp year. this mean hold prospect include excessive deficit procedure focus consolidation leaf little room manoeuvre support economic upswing further, turn self-sustaining. the situation greece category own. lack confidence greece’s ability get public finance track unaided boost premium loan greek government. ireland latvia example illustrate scale measure need restore confidence. the recovery danish economy also expect slow hesitant. the road ahead likely bumpy. this year’s growth insufficient halt increase unemployment. the corporate sector considerable spare capacity, unemployment expect rise yet another year. denmark small open economy, one job four relate exports, directly indirectly. wage competitiveness therefore play important role danish economy, crisis result weak export market hence weak sell opportunities. erosion wage competitiveness lead loss market shares. the loss quite substantial relative many comparable countries. there clear tendency country whose competitiveness deteriorate bad also fare bad export markets. collective bargain finalise climate rise unemployment considerable uncertainty economic development. there prospect low wage inflation previous years. which welcome. but hardly prospect change competitive environment. change real wage expectation period strong labour market uphill struggle. and also clearly highlight problem arise demand reach unsustainably high levels. *** financial condition expansionary amid historically low short-term interest rates. adjust tax inflation, real interest rate adjustable-rate mortgage currently low. this support house market. in judgement, house market 2 bi review 37/2010 slowly recovering, price adjustment do current low interest rate level. bud optimism see among potential buyers. i usually refrain official prediction interest-rate developments. but today, i make exception. i quite sure rate 1-year adjustable rate mortgage cannot sustain current low level. i try predict rise. but i advise homeowner others stretch budget tight make end meet current low interest rate level. normalisation interest rate rise unemployment may present certain risk development. if low growth continue euro area come period, normalisation interest rate postponed. by contrast, strong economic growth could cause interest rate rise, case, unemployment stabilise perhaps begin fall. house market development rise equity price cause household wealth rise again. combine continue handsome growth disposable income upbeat consumer expectations, mean take positive view outlook private consumption. the decline consumption crisis sharp denmark countries. despite fairly good rise incomes. the consumption ratio thus dip stand low level. this, together general stabilisation economic development slightly positive sentiment, pave way return confidence household spend increase disposable income consumption residential investments. however, indication first month year suggest strong reversal. the low interest rate gradually stimulate economy number years. therefore, interest rate underlie expansionary effect economy year ahead. this also apply fiscal policy expansionary stance past year yet fully show through. initial fiscal consolidation thus unlikely change picture economy slow recovery path. the fiscal challenge daunt consolidation necessary come year avoid untenable increase government debt. there avoid – even still great deal spare capacity economy. add erosion wage competitiveness, strong pressure expenditure, heavy tax burden, low productivity increase limit job supply. the danish economy face serious challenge far beyond cyclical factors. and mortgage credit. the international financial crisis demonstrate need financial institution big capital buff large stable liquidity reserves. event deem unlikely risk management model actually occur. international work go order formulate agree new rule address problem unveil crisis. it important reach agreement across national border continents, condition financial business largely irrespective location. for denmark, seem unique mortgage credit system face challenge deal le own. it therefore important carefully consider concentrate effort new rule adjust special conditions. here i focus essential aspect see today. bi review 37/2010 3 the liquidity regulation proposal include classification asset base liquid are. government bond claim central banks, international organisation etc. consider fully liquid, corporate bond mortgage-credit bond include maximum 50 per cent. finally, asset cannot included. denmark seek mortgage-credit bond include stock fully liquid assets, provide liquidity comparable government bonds. liquidity – also stressful situation – crucial point. we believe prove danish mortgage-credit bond highly comparable government bonds. and that’s intend do. another aspect concern adjustable-rate mortgage specifically. during financial crisis, financial institution generally saw fund source market dry up. this reason many government find necessary issue state guarantee financial institutions. the rule draw board therefore pose requirement stable funding. the definition stable fund imply danish mortgage-credit bond remain term maturity le one year cannot included. moreover, lend maturity one year must cover stable funding. such rule highlight risk associate danish adjustable-rate mortgages. these 30-year loan fund via short-term bonds, primarily maturity one year. every year issue institute refinance loan. at first, risk pass borrowers, bear it. if not, invariably return lender. we cannot ignore real risk inherent design danish adjustable-rate mortgages. a design imply loan worth kr. 500 billion must refinance every year finance 30-year loans. i today try guess whether final formulation basel rule make impossible maintain adjustable-rate mortgage know today. in situation, i find constructive sector seek solution line traditional mortgage-credit lending. finally, i make remark danish discussions. i understand work go ease requirement danish cover bonds, loan exceed 80 per cent property value due decline property prices. the so-called ltv rule. today, rule value property declines, cover bond loan exceed 80 per cent property value, issue mortgage-credit institute find additional collateral mortgage. i see little likelihood possible requirement. and i doubt would benefit danish mortgage credit long run. we introduce slight doubt quality danish cover bonds. the legislation cover bond provide bank possibility allow investor cover bond secure creditor respect number asset banks’ balance sheets. this arrangement make cover bond much safe asset senior debt issue bank. the bank therefore use cover bond long-term fund without become prohibitively expensive. the bank use cover bond tool good match maturity asset liability side thus reduce liquidity risk. cover bond therefore fund tool, example help bank comply future liquidity regulation. against background, danmark nationalbank support idea abolish possibility. on behalf danmark nationalbank, i hereby thank danish mortgage banks’ federation successful cooperation past year. 4 bi review 37/2010 thank attention. bi review 37/2010 1 thomas m hoenig: the financial foundation main street speech mr thomas m hoenig, president federal reserve bank kansa city, capital market summit: “getting main street back work”, u chamber commerce center capital market competitiveness, washington dc, 24 march 2010. * * * the view express author necessarily reflect federal reserve system, governors, officer representatives. history tell u country succeed endure economically must adhere simple set principles. no matter market’s complexity, principle anchor financial system overall economy. and fundamental principle commitment maintain integrity institution within system. this commitment provide culture sound business ethics, confidence rule law, reliability contracts, culture fair play level field. how individual firm compete field them. there almost always diversity firm within highly competitive appropriately regulate commercial system. some firm large, many small dynamic. those relax, resist change, cheat know lapse result failure, determine market. if stray core principle fairness ignore rule law, distort play field inevitably cultivate crisis. when market long competitive, firm become monopoly oligopoly matter know know. then, economy lose ability innovate succeed. when market perceive unfair advantage others, foundation economic system compromised. in instances, example, bonus far exceed economic value provided, bonus economist call economic rent. it earned, received. the protect act protected, retain status independent performance, public suffer. i like say, “if give someone monopoly, act like monopolist every time.” i open comment nation today react financial crisis interruption flow capital. it also process address cause effort prevent recurrence. while call action myself, i uneasy i see far. the attempt address capital market role “financial foundation main street,” appear place much high value rhetoric substance necessary reform. a nation, violate central tenant successful system. we see formation powerful group financial firms. we inadvertently grant imply guarantee favors, suffer consequences. we must correct violations. we must reinvigorate fair competition within system culture business ethic operate rule law. when this, eliminate small businesses’ need capital, make access capital earned, be. the inevitable crisis the bank system go unprecedented era change start 1980s lawmaker begin remove roadblock interstate banking. this evolution continue pick speed year follow number legislative move validate creation ever large banks. the scope activity continue grow 2 bi review 37/2010 1990s end decade saw merger citicorp traveler group. that merger require divestiture certain activities, become unnecessary passage gramm-leach-bliley act. the legislation allow single financial company engage commercial banking, investment banking, insurance underwrite brokerage. this expansion activities, argued, create strong system overall institution diversified. for example, rather entirely reliant single community industry, real estate, strong system create bank serve broad nationwide base. a downturn single market would offset stability areas. although new era finance widely supported, critical ingredient miss road expansion innovation: framework would limit dangerous excess development perverse incentives. undoubtedly, important omission way deal large firm use new growth opportunity become “too big fail (tbtf).” although bank legislation 1991 specifically try limit federal deposit insurance corporation’s (fdic) ability protect fail bank creditors, regulator could make exception large institution whose failure might pose threat economy financial stability. a result, tbtf embed legal framework. the growth large institution distort framework financial system way tbtf. large complex institution become difficult regulate supervise. in cases, regulator resource authority keep grow innovative financial system, particularly period regulatory rule replace risk-focused supervisory system. it difficult examiner get large bank tighten operations, especially bank generate tremendous profits. these large institution wield considerable influence. an obvious example way fannie mae freddie mac able game political system account problem avoid tight regulation realistic leverage constraints. look back, one see crisis inevitable, reason tbtf firm would push boundary crisis. in 1999 speech financial megamergers, i conclude “to extent institution become “too big fail,” … uninsured depositor creditor protect implicit government guarantees, consequence quite serious. indeed, result may le stable le efficient financial system.” more decade later, thing i change statement government guarantee long implicit. action financial crisis make protection quite explicit. the result so, protection mean? tbtf status provide direct cost advantage firms. without fear loss creditors, large firm use high leverage, allow fund asset low cost debt instead expensive equity. a year-end, top 20 bank firm hold tier 1 common equity equal 5.1 percent assets. in contrast, bank institution hold 6.7 percent equity. if top 20 firm hold equity capital level small bank institutions, would require $210 billion new equity reduce asset $3 trillion, combination both. (see attach charts.) state bi review 37/2010 3 another way, almost one-quarter asset hold large institution support le equity capital. furthermore, tbtf reduce cost debt firm issue. due imply government support, rat agency explicitly increase debt rat large bank organization intrinsic rat would assign base bank’s condition amount leverage. not firm get use debt, debt cheaper. this framework fail serve u well. during recent financial crisis, loss quickly deplete capital large, over-leveraged companies. a expected, firm rescue use government fund trouble asset relief program (tarp). the result immediate reduction lend main street, financial institution try rebuild capital. although institution raise substantial amount new capital, much use repay tarp fund instead support new lending. in words, i suggest economy would good serve diverse financial system. certainly community regional bank organization hurt financial crisis recession many firm face large loss associate problem commercial real estate lend areas. but despite problems, many small bank continue lend. in 2009, 45 percent bank asset $1 billion increase business lending. policy change all event bring u today, talk lack credit availability main street. the good news, is, market slowly correcting, credit growth begin flow main street, provide job growth economic recovery. however, rapid easy. the fact main street prosper without healthy financial system. we healthy financial system future without make fundamental change reverse wrong-headed incentives, change behavior reinforce structure financial system. these change must make large firm long incentive take much risk gain competitive fund advantage small ones. credit must allocate efficiently equitably base prospective economic value. without changes, crisis remember textbook go again. a step toward avoid outcome assure consistent allocation main street, i three recommendations. first, must enable capitalism work reduce incentive large financial institution take much risk allow fail orderly manner. this accomplished, so, must credible resolution process force shareholders, responsible senior management, creditor incur loss company take excessive risk become insolvent. to credible, resolution regime must independent political process base rule law. only then, creditor force firm operate low leverage. the current legislation house congress begin address issue. unfortunately, still leave considerable room exception hand treasury. this need attention. you find specific recommendation accomplish kansa city fed’s website.

review 36/2010 1 mervyn king: uncertainty macroeconomic policy make – art science? lecture mr mervyn king, governor bank england, royal society conference “handling uncertainty science”, london, 22 march 2010. accompany slide speech find bank england’s website. david aikman, philip barrett, sujit kapadia, mervyn king, jam proudman, tim taylor, iain de weymarn tony yates (bank england) contribute paper. * * * 1. uncertainty public policy most question public policy relate uncertainties. answer depend upon ability understand evaluate uncertainties. yet many commentator member public want believe certainties. they want cut thicket caveat technical difficulty “bottom line”. we see economic policy, weather forecast interpretation secret intelligence. five year ago, bank england meet office hold informal seminar exchange idea communicate measure uncertainty general public. although fail persuade broadcaster explore issue economic weather forecast depth, bilateral relationship develop bank paul hardaker, move meet office take royal meteorological society, flourished. today’s conference tribute paul’s persistence. it could hardly timely. at heart debate climate change, chilcot inquiry war iraq, speed necessary fiscal consolidation public finances, lie question evaluate respond considerable uncertainties. at seminar 2005, discuss three questions. first, model phenomenon interest, right balance simplify assumption technical rigour? second, open don’t really know? third, communicate uncertainty, prevent intend audience focus excessively one two parameter underlie distribution expense whole picture? the discussion compare bank england’s fan chart outlook inflation meet office’s plume chart forecast temperature. this paper update discussion, present new way communicate uncertainty evaluation monetary policy committee. reference economics meteorology interest u span both. they two discipline unite common need grapple complex system communicate forecast wide audience. it enough explain experts. much value forecast understand – subtlety – general public, least sub-groups agricultural industry case meteorology involve wage bargain case economics. the use misuse forecast cause problem bank england meet office recent years. the bank’s forecast inflation criticise overstate size confidence interval period 1995 2007, so-called “great stability”, understate financial crisis occurred. and meet office recently announce long publish forecast weather forthcoming season “failed” predict cold winter wet summer (in part country) last year. the seasonal forecast replace monthly predictions. in statement, meet office said, “by nature, forecast become le accurate look. although identify general pattern weather, science exist allow exact forecast beyond five days, absolutely promise certain type 2 bi review 36/2010 weather”. but publish forecast outcome virtually certain would admission least partial defeat. if description probability distribution misinterpret medium public, discover message robust fragile survive process communication wide audience? first, need consider form view likelihood different outcomes. 2. unpredictability economics science unpredictability challenge face practitioner many disciplines. a kenneth arrow, nobel laureate economics, say four-year experience weather officer u world war ii, “one thing i learn meteorology actual science guarantee exactness”. economics may may actual science, certainly suffer try predict future. there least three explanation unpredictability common economics scientific disciplines. first, assign probability particularly difficult infrequent high-impact event financial crises, tsunamis, climate change, precedents. because sample event small, learn process assessment likelihood change, possibly sharply. second, even system deterministic rather stochastic unpredictable. small difference start condition imply different outcomes. weather system display chaotic dynamics, small initial forecast error may lead large revision forecast out. economists, contrast, often rely simple linear models, additive stochastic errors. in model phenomenon choice, among expert area often live debate, whether useful use deterministic chaotic stochastic models.1 but motivation case bring importance unpredictability. another feature hind predictability priori indistinguishable shock different effect systems. if drop grain sand randomly sand pile, drop light match random forest, infect random person disease, may minimal, localise effect may lead respectively avalanche, wildfire epidemic. the outcome depend state system shock hit (the steepness sand pile, dryness forest, density population) precise point system hit.2 third, system subject sudden transition locally stable states. in economics science, find example system multiple stable states. and switch may hard predict. model circulation pattern north atlantic ocean suggest either vigorous, help warm northern hemisphere water transport low latitudes, shut almost entirely. the magnetic property iron provide another example system different stable states. when expose temporarily external magnetic field, iron retain magnetism even external field removed: external condition consistent 1 see, example, sugihara may (1990). 2 in relation latter, key node player may instrumental spread shock (anderson may, 1991). this think apply financial system show priori identical shock differ effect depend shock hits. and, inspire literature sand piles, scheinkman woodford’s (1994) model inventory dynamic show small shock may cause aggregate fluctuations. bi review 36/2010 3 different state system, depend history.3 many economic system also exhibit form hysteresis path dependence. for example, change social attitude towards personal bankruptcy, inflation unemployment may affect equilibrium outcome variables. 3. policy response unpredictability predict precise time dynamic instability set difficult. it is, however, possible identify sand pile forest prone large scale instability determine factor contribute instability. analogously, many people, include bank england, identify vulnerability financial system crisis without actually able predict crisis would begin. economist able learn discipline cope type instability. for example, insight ecology epidemiology apply financial network (for discussion, see haldane 2009), economist learn much engineer control dynamic systems. the key policymakers focus make structure underlie system robust shocks. for example, avalanche area snow may “seeded” that, induce small avalanches, chance large avalanche mitigated. and fire-risk areas, control burn fire break sometimes use limit risk large fire. in context financial system, policymakers could impose “glass-steagall” style separation payment system network risky activities. action also take mitigate impact bad outcome. for example, might mean build avalanche net fence; fund fire-fighting service; launch lifeboat. in context financial regulation, might entail reduce cost associate resolve financial institutions, example require bank develop resolution recovery plans, require force subsidiarisation foreign bank branches. a always, however, risk intervention unintended consequences: shortly titanic sank, steamer, s.s. eastland, capsize lake michigan, loss around 850 lives, destabilise extra lifeboat require post-titanic regulations! 4. decision make uncertainty role belief the analogy economics science take far. a key difference economics physical science role play active decision-makers – household business – whose presence complicate substantially dynamic system. in particular, economic outcome sensitive way people behave uncertainty, belief past, present future. perception uncertainty affect behaviour. if enough people uncertain future job prospect save precaution, may lead firm cut employment, increase chance job indeed lost. but uncertainty whether rain today change weather. belief adapt time response change environment; turn affect show economic system behave. because surround environment affect economic decision-making, probably genuinely “deep” (and, therefore, stable) parameter 3 this particular example fortuitous earth science biology, since help u date rock fossil contain chart continental drift, base history change magnetic field earth. 4 bi review 36/2010 relationship economics. in contrast, many set physical science stable “rules game” (e.g. law gravity good approximation one day next). the study decision make uncertainty distinguish ancestry economics. frank knight (1921) write difference risk (where frequency could use calculate probabilities) uncertainty (where objective basis derive probabilities). of course, true bayesian would assume people would able construct subjective probabilities, behaviour would govern beliefs. but keynes (1936) make much pervasive nature uncertainty explanation business cycle instability subjective probabilities. occasional sharp change expectation could, did, result. that exactly happen autumn 2008, sudden synchronous collapse business confidence around world. so behaviour economy depend part upon belief future event hold various players: consumers, business governments. outcome endogenous belief likelihood outcomes. and context may self-fulfilling equilibria. sudden shift belief particularly relevant many decision-makers interact. the behaviour bank’s depositor many equilibria, depend upon belief whether depositor likely run bank. change perception uncertainty may transmit rapidly, amplified, potential affect behaviour coordinate way.4 a restaurant may much busy identical competitor first customer even dine next customer suspect first may know something don’t, follow, others subsequently join herd. the reverse may occur follow evening. disentangle incremental role shift belief often difficult. for example, afire sale asset one bank may mechanical amplify impact bank effect market prices, could simultaneously affect bank via confidence beliefs, people become le optimistic valuation asset one asset class distress.5 the role belief behaviour affect outcome mean premium understand decision-making uncertainty. in economics, broadly speak two approach model decision make uncertainty: standard, “rational” approach “homo economicus” assume belief base efficient process available information, “behavioural” approach, inform psychology literature, highlight psychological trait violate assumption underlie “rational” view. the two approach yield different conclusion desirability policy intervention form take. in practice, applicability approach depend context. rationality may reasonable approximation decision carefully consider (perhaps return “good” decision high). but behavioural economist psychologist contend people often make decision use simple “fast frugal” heuristic limit time, information, cognitive capacity (gigerenzer todd 1999). 4 for example, caballero krishnamurthy (2008) show liquidity shock presence knightian uncertainty cause investor hoard liquid assets. this occur firm assume worst-case scenario – unable access liquidity require – cause hoard liquidity. alternatively information disperse across large number people, noisy signal economic fundamentals, outcome may determine “information cascade”, outcome hard predict (banerjee, 1992; bikhchandani et al, 1992). 5 see may arinaminpathy (2010) model financial system make distinction. bi review 36/2010 5 there strong experimental evidence people subject bias collect process information uncertainty, process occur intermittently.6 the evidence suggest people also frequently incoherent assessing, assign process probability – even highly artificial set information complete – find particularly difficult ass probability low high, partly le scope learn cases. there also evidence that, make complex decision without full information, decide whether eye surgery, people often use rough heuristics, go first impressions, appearances, gut instinct intuition. we want highlight four main aspect behavioural view: (i) perception risk show unduly influence recent personal experience. after earthquake, demand earthquake insurance first increase declines, probability next large earthquake may grow time.7 so-called “depression babies” seem take le financial risk generations.8 such effect may explain fear financial crisis decline time memory last crisis fade. (ii) decision uncertainty show sensitive way question presented. people understand probability good express term natural frequency (1 10,000) rather percentage (0.01%). this one symptom wide confusion probabilistic concepts. research gerd gigerenzer others show doctors, example, often mislead information present form probability rather sample frequencies. the statement diagnostic test 5% probability false positive misinterpret often statement 5 patient every hundred take test show false positive.9 and compound fact many forecast kind reference back sample frequency informative. forecast make today weather inflation rate date future unique; outcome repeat experiment. decision save future pension provision, example, difficult make subject experimentation, although learn experience others. (iii) people tend follow action others. that effective strategy. for example, game show “who want to be a millionaire?”, “ask audience” lifeline 91% success rate, show wisdom crowds.10 but experiment also show substantial proportion people choose glaringly incorrect answer simple question tell answer others choose (even though question answer correctly isolation).11 in sport setting, goalkeeper face penalty tend dive, rather stay middle goal, direction penalty suggest appropriate.12 such type behaviour reflect fact people unwilling 6 see collection article kahneman, d, slovic, p tversky, a (1982). 7 for example, see palm (1995). she find affect earthquake likely take insurance afterward. but effect fade time elapse earthquake. 8 for example, malmendier nagel (2006) report experience high stock return life likely hold stock report low risk aversion; experience high inflation le likely hold bonds. 9 see, example, gigerenzer, g edwards, a (2003). 10 see surowiecki (2004). 11 see, example, asch (1951). 12 see bar-eli et al (2007). 6 bi review 36/2010 risk failure pursue strategy different norm. the penalty failure may le others fail way – keynes point true banks. (iv) people excessive faith judgement subject confirmation bias wishful thinking. an experiment, well know literature, ask respondent report 90% confidence interval around estimate set unknown quantity (e.g. diameter moon).13 but true answer lay outside report confidence interval half time. this reflect general result people overly confident judgements. this effect suggest may tendency understate uncertainty could explain “severe” stress test scenario use bank crisis mild. 5. policy implication these observation decision make uncertainty economics implication policy along three dimensions. first, decision make uncertainty affect dynamic economy. some psychological bias discuss offer explanation “herding” behaviour “risk illusion” (a tendency over/underestimate likelihood different type events). take together, bias could offer explanation periodic bout exuberance economy financial system particular.14 a bear assessment likelihood range possible outcomes. our ignorance people behave uncertainty, together presence feedback behaviour, outturn beliefs, highlight difficulty pitfall economic policy making. second, recognition belief behaviour play important role dynamic system affect type policy action desirable. ensure panic spread one reason guarantee bank deposit follow run northern rock september 2007 necessary. third, communication part policy response uncertainty. in respect, economic financial system differ physical systems. in latter, no-one listening. the control strategy physical system define scheme relate set policy instrument certain feature environment (e.g. fire leave booster rocket rocket veer leave target). but economic system – people’s belief future policy action affect behaviour today – control strategy comprise plan set instrument (e.g. raise bank rate expect inflation rises) also plan condition belief policy maker would respond future. that involve communication. 6. communication a communication strategy involve decide much information communicate, form. reveal information entail cost benefits. an optimal communication strategy balance cost benefits. consider first benefits. information valuable improve quality decisions. many government agency valuable information private citizen cannot easily 13 see plous (1993). 14 tucker (2009) discus might create friction could counter use so-called macroprudential instruments. bi review 36/2010 7 obtain themselves. an example information collect office national statistic economy social trends. central banks, too, may information shock hit economy, propagated, indeed way policy likely respond. provision information issue may help people reduce forecast error take inform decisions. a discuss earlier, complex economic system may multiple equilibria. movement depend expectation belief others’ beliefs. that especially strategic complementarity benefit strategy depend choice strategy others. communication might help coordinate belief good rather bad equilibrium results. suppose private investor begin doubt health bank central bank know fundamentally solvent. a signal central bank bank solvent may help change beliefs, thus ensure continue liquidity hence solvency healthy bank. but may clear bank solvent, practice often smoke without fire. communication may help improve credibility public policy. economic policymakers often confront problem future policy set optimal today likely policy would optimal follow tomorrow. before central bank independence, problem monetary policy government promise deliver low inflation credible. wage price setter know contract base assumption future inflation would low, government would able resist temptation generate inflation high promise would temporarily boost employment output. so initial promise believed. once expectation high inflation embed price wages, point rational government tolerate high inflation, cost reduce would deep recession. the idea give central bank independent control monetary policy remove temptation inflate.15 communication potential solution credibility problem. if policymakers transparent objective policy – strategy follow pursuit objective – easy hold accountable actions. this increase incentive policy maker meet objectives. despite benefits, always follow communication beneficial. more communication costly self-defeating. first, private participant face cost collect process information could mean important message lost. the bank england could publish many document create internally month. but would simply make hard really important information get through. le more. we could minute minute revision weather forecast terrorism threat estimates, might overwhelm genuine flood bomb warn want people respond.16 second, communication sometimes aggravate market failures. suppose rspb know secret location rare bird nesting. to preserve biodiversity, may great benefit ensure bird nest undisturbed. if rspb reveal secret, bird watcher may converge location. here, le full transparency mitigate problem. an example spirit whether use commercial bank bank england’s lend facility concealed. if use facility make public, 15 for exposition credibility problem monetary policy, see kydland prescott (1977); account benefit central bank independence, see fischer (1994). 16 this idea receive theoretical attention recently follow encouragement sims (2003). he sketch model agent “rationally inattentive”, focus information diagnose make important contribution minimise forecast errors. 8 bi review 36/2010 depositor would ask used: attach even small probability possibility bank trouble, would rational withdraw deposit – trigger run bank. anticipate reaction, risk bank would choose use facilities. further, market participant might use information facility use spread malicious rumour hope profit market reaction. such rumour-spreading would privately beneficial rumour-spreaders, socially harmful. that design discount window lend facilities, bank decide disclose average usage quarter, lag.17 communication forecast easy. probability hard understand. yet forecast number estimate probability distribution.18 and cannot assume people obtain information neutral form. indeed people information convey via medium may filter reinterpret information. this lead incentive problem. instead simply report information future prospect make available forecasts, incentive summarise prospect single number describe one part probability distribution way make good story. that suggest merit try communicate directly public. forecasts, probabilistic statement general, easily misunderstand misinterpreted. a result, forecaster may decide withhold information, even when, correctly understood, something useful forecast – case point recent meet office withdrawal medium term seasonal forecasts. when expert retire field, leave wide open quackery – shortage quack whether medicine, economics meteorology. so major challenge explain that, although may precise prediction effect particular policy action, wholly ignorant consequences. find illuminate way express judgement difficult important. we must pretend know do, must avoid delusion spurious precision. 7. communication practice: fan chart it time put flesh bone abstract discussions. it time fact show – slide show graphical representation uncertainty future inflation bank england us communicate view outlook. the bank england publish range document describe uncertainty analysis economy, hence uncertainty inherent set policy. our longest-running, perhaps best known, quarterly inflation report, bank produce since 1993. in it, monetary policy committee communicate view uncertain future use method draw idea discuss above. in inflation report, mpc set late projection key economic variables. the important projection inflation. the committee clear 17 morris shin (2002) study case central bank reveal noisy signal. that signal, unavoidably inaccurate (e.g. central bank forecast), give inappropriately high weight private decision private participant expect others use it, want ensure action far line others’. this example public communication coordinate inferior equilibrium. morris shin also show public information crowd private information. by ensure agent overweight public information decisions, mean agent observe decision infer le private information others motivate them. in limit, everyone take decision solely basis public information, could reveal nothing private information may also have, act on. 18 dale, orphanides osterholm (2008) illustrate welfare fall private sector overestimate accuracy central bank forecasts. bi review 36/2010 9 target meet, set government. inflation, measure change consumer price index, 2% times. but interest rate take time affect inflation, forecast inflation integral set monetary policy. and mpc’s forecast probability distribution, rather single number, communicate fan chart. that depict mpc’s view probability range different outcomes. each forecast cover three year forecast period, horizon expect current stance monetary policy majority effect. here example fan chart (see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2010/speech432.pps). it show inflation projection publish february 2010 inflation report. each fan chart condition particular path bank’s policy instruments. this one assume bank rate follow path expect financial markets. the mpc also publish another fan chart conditional different policy assumption, namely bank rate remain current level throughout forecast. we believe chart helpful communicate big picture mpc need get across. the fan chart work show committee belief would happen inflation today’s economic circumstance repeat 100 occasions. in give quarter future, cpi lie somewhere red shade area 90 100 occasions: 10 time dark red band, 10 time pair light red bands. the dark shade refer increase probability density give point. of remain 10 every 100 occasion inflation expect lie outside shade part fan altogether. but distribution tail event explicitly specified, would require spurious degree precision part mpc. the fan chart design communicate specific concept important policy. next, illustrate use february fan chart. but first, let’s briefly recap recent history inflation. here, see past couple year inflation volatile, first rise sharply around 5% fall back recently [slide 2]. look ahead, mpc felt likely inflation would rise first quarter year [slide 3]. you see projection entire 90% distribution cover shade fan high last data point. remember, though, 10% distribution specified, mpc rule possibility inflation might remain unchanged fallen. since projection published, new data release inflation january, show green marker [slide 4]. this show inflation indeed risen. so look even likely inflation first quarter 2010 close middle mpc’s fan chart. thereafter, mpc expect inflation likely fall back target period [slide 5]. you see likely outcome, show dark band, inflation stay target end forecast period. but mpc also saw upside risk projection, stem possibility current high level inflation might become embed inflation expectations, make inflation persistent. to make risk easy discern, mpc also make available chart cross section probability distribution particular point forecast horizon, like one show [slide 6]. the upside risk mean end forecast horizon, mpc judge inflation likely target it. we see chart, narrow band towards leave hand side mean mass vertical line mark 2% mass it. but show projection like this? many economic forecaster publish forecast single, likely outcome. in view, sort forecast informative, actual probability correct close zero. in contrast, whole distribution contain much information. what matter policy entire distribution outcomes. the fan chart useful contain information relevant likely distribution bank rate. to explain current policy setting, provide 10 bi review 36/2010 information likely path policy, mpc need communicate judgement outlook whole. most central bank also try illustrate uncertainty around projections, albeit slightly different ways. the european central bank, example, present forecast range define twice mean absolute forecast error past [slide 7]. the federal reserve produce projection show range individual [most likely] forecast – view federal reserve bank president governor. this show spread whisker [slide 8]. they also produce measure “central tendency” truncate distribution exclude three high three low forecasts, represent boxes. this representation difference view within federal reserve different probability distribution future outcomes. in experience, communication uncertainty future inflation important explain monetary policy. the swedish riksbank adopt similar approach use fan chart key tool communicate view outlook. [slide 9]. look back, see communication strategy evolve light experience past 17 years. [slide 10] show even early days, try get across uncertainty around projections, illustrate “trumpet” uncertainty leave hand panel. it 1996 introduce sophisticate fan chart, right, main device communicate outlook. a part evolutionary process, complement projection inflation, mpc also produce fan chart activity economy – specifically gdp – since november 1997. ordinarily, show projection four-quarter growth rate, commentators, standard way look gdp. [slide 11] show recent data gdp, portray sharp decline output past two years. there two point highlight chart. first, fan around historical data [slide 12]. that reflect fact economic data frequently revise time – sometimes heavily. cpi, contrast, rarely revised. the chart show quite lot uncertainty past data. the mpc belief likely current vintage data revise slightly. but big picture large decline output likely remain even mature data. uncertainty past important component uncertainty future, reflect forward-looking part gdp fan [slide 13]. the second point forecast part chart show return growth likely. but chart look might feel mpc quite optimistic, painful, deep recession expect economy rebound. in ways, true. but would mislead inference. the reality even growth rebounds, level activity still likely remain weak considerable period compare peak start 2008. the economic environment likely continue feel far normal time. after all, ultimately level activity, rather growth rate, matter employment degree inflationary pressure. it precisely draw point recent edition inflation report include extra chart [slide 14]. this show level output correspond growth chart. in practice, find that, even though chart show information, level chart effective get big picture message across. despite efforts, still nuance find challenge communicate. the fan chart convey rich view uncertainty current forecast. but cost hard see distribution change compare precede forecast. so perhaps unsurprising commentator find hard grasp subtlety forecasts. that lead suggest publish table bi review 36/2010 11 key summary statistic day forecast – mean, median mode distribution. we fear make statistic available, hard effort communicate outlook whole get wash away extreme focus point estimates. we want medium commentator summarise outlook single number, prevent u get broad view across. a well lead over-simplification, publish information also promote over-interpretation forecast. whilst fan chart represent committee’s probabilistic view future, important recognise incomplete information distribution. we therefore overplay particular parametric form chart. a result, make little sense place lot weight particular summary statistic distribution. rather, committee make broad statement – “inflation likely target”. be precise risk overstate mpc’s degree knowledge distribution. so mpc’s concern early publication numerical parameter risk trivialise policymakers’ overall view economy, misrepresent view overly precise. the fan chart design strike right balance two hazards, give broad brush articulation distribution committee judge appropriate. but always room improvement. so turn idea consider provide additional information particular aspect distribution, help deal difficulties. for example, next chart show distribution change since previous forecast place two distribution side side, [slide 15]. this chart show likely outcome dark red band shift compare early forecast. but change likely outcome reflect degree rest fan chart – offset upwards shift balance risks. this clearly see note dark line flat light one right hand side chart, steep left. a discuss earlier, aim mpc communication convey useful information broad distribution, without drive spurious accuracy. there many way this. one idea investigate show chart mpc’s view probability inflation 2% target particular point time. this show [slide 16]. such chart speak whole distribution, facilitate easy comparison previous forecast round [slide 17]. but still problem assign precise probability give outcome. a solitary bayesian policymaker may comfortable that. but reality unique answer encapsulate collective judgement mpc. in bank’s experience, mpc member find important focus distinguish different broad order magnitude future events, le interest debate whether something happen 49 time 100 52 times. one answer tension describe problem words. but carry difficulties. an alternative design graphical device prevent illusion spurious precision. simple graphical change chart [slide 18] emphasise mpc’s view best express precise numerical probability. but downside sort representation readily permit comparison successive forecasts. instead, alternative mpc consider present “probability ribbon” [slide 19]. this show range estimate probability inflation exceed target, define edge relevant band fan chart. in preserve broad impression committee’s overall view, yet filter artificial accuracy. for 12 bi review 36/2010 instance, committee think chance inflation would 2% high 2011q1 15% 20%. we use february forecast highlight key message mpc want communicate. in early part forecast period, probability inflation target high. this data inflation well target present, also fan chart relatively narrow. but projection inflation fall forecast period. this imply fall probability inflation target. towards final part projection, probability inflation target rise back broadly one half. this chart emphasis that, spite likely outcome inflation target, nature distribution risk imply probability exceed target one two. we also combine usual top-down fan chart information cross-sectional density produce 3d fan chart [slide 20]. the particular advantage chart show overall density change time. for instance, distribution narrow, start forecast period, probability density centre fan higher, simply mpc confident central forecast here. overall, however, point view policy determined, well communicated, broad distribution matters. 8. conclusion self-confidence infectious. it also dangerous. how often draw false comfort apparent confidence professional advisor promise certain success disappoint subsequent performance? uncertainty pervade almost public policy questions. economics many discipline unite common need grapple complex systems. a crisis autumn 2008 showed, system sometimes subject abrupt changes, precise time cannot easily identify advance. but policy-makers often expect anticipate unpredictable. how retain trust public open true degree uncertainty? or, put another way, appropriate bedside manner policy-makers deal complex uncertain problem public debate? we explain bank england try deal challenge context monetary policy. we sure much learn, effort improve communication continue long time come. reference anderson, r may, r (1991),

foremost guarantee soundness financial institution therefore entire financial system. responsible finance bank albania focus three main directions:  bank supervision  transparency accountability  education first, responsible finance cannot understand phenomenon responsibility leave market players’ initiative. it grasp merely right also obligation market players. if agree principle, advocate promoter – indeed, position bank albania far concerned. from central bank’s point view, responsible finance begin sound supervision bank financial system. it constitute obligation central bank provide saver right financially strong financial institution ensure latter conduct operation line best business principles. the bank albania pay particular attention financial stability exert effective risk-oriented supervision institution licence supervises. moreover, effective supervision also encompass importance give promotion competition protection customer interests. and last, least, principle responsible finance apply prudential bank supervision preservation financial stability, harmonize monetary 2 bi review 36/2010 fiscal policy. this principle consider integral essential part monetary policy decision-making harmonization fiscal policy. hence, bank albania guarantee monetary policy impair financial soundness bank non-banking institution individuals; contrast support financial market player make part decision-making process. allow dwell upon monetary policy decision-making transmission process public. this process crucial guarantee maintenance macro finance balance economy. in view this, bank albania commit economic financial education public, view undertake concrete initiative establishment financial culture albanian society necessity. however, task cannot perform alone; guarantee balance require co-operation financial system, private sector public large order respond decision-making efficiently rationally. the last two years’ event push many people discus consistency efficient market theory ability economic agent rational. although yet soon (and time needed) make full analysis cause behind crisis, i bring attention key element impair individuals’ ability late markets’ ability efficient rational. this analyse crisis understand implication responsible finance. it hold true stakeholder fail term decision-making make wrong, irrational inefficient choices. but also hold true almost borrower complete information type credit borrow financial instrument purchasing, unable understand financial implication financial monetary commitments. they also push believe house price go financial risk cease exist. unfortunately, cannot say bank push people borrow type loans. do explain customer interest rate extend time forgiven, price swing remain stable? do provide necessary information? if answer question “no”, agent entire information available make rational choices. and happens, entire economy financial system along severely hit. against backdrop, transparency represent obligation customer’s right know every detail transaction, also obligation soundness entire financial system. lack transparency encumber transmission information consequently, guarantee proper condition agent rational decision-making. therefore, transparency responsibility needed. in order enhance banks’ transparency customer albania, bank albania approve regulation “on minimum requirement disclosure information bank branch foreign banks” “on transparency bank financial product services”. i would like note lack transparency appear form intentional conceal information simply result negligence, also result wrong selection tool mean communication. the disclosure information prompt, best, efficient comprehensible way responsibility market players, institution customer customer institution. in regard, pity i note microcredit advertisement may find mileage board amateur graffiti smudge national roads’ border – large part information name institution. these institution build clear communication strategy public respect product offer, lend term product offered, – particularly important – objectives. transparency entail competitive advantage universal bank regard lend term assistance bi review 36/2010 3 able provide consider loan portfolio well-management. responsible finance mean donor choose best skilful partner involve activity, exert pressure institution allocate fund guarantee transparency information require memo reports, market, evident transparent target groups. efficient market decision-making also need central bank’s transparency responsibility, therefore bank albania pay great deal attention respect. however, well-aware transparency information decision-making represent necessary sufficient condition guarantee efficient response economy. it often occur – particular economy – financial illiteracy become significant hindrance market efficiency, since economic agent may able accurately interpret information communication decision-making authority may respond decision unpredictably. this situation similar give people appropriate tool carry certain job without show first function operate them. consequently, responsible finance without education. use reasoning, perceive education obligation governmental academic institution respond public right educate. market efficiency rationality may guarantee entire economy (not economists) enjoy minimum level economic education. be educate imply comprehend interpret information respond it, however necessarily mean able resolve every economic financial problem yourself. be financially educate mean know necessary address expert (the economist) order make good choices, convince transparency responsibility. this mean financial responsibility form obligation personal social right long-term economic financial prosperity. this education limit institution (universities financial system) need economists. economic financial education address entire public form public good economic agent possible ways. a i note above, try educate public concrete initiative publication educational booklets, launch educational programme students, train seminar journalists, high school teacher economics social workers. in regard, bank albania always active regard public education, also search partners, come financial education room everyone, particular academia. it purpose recently establish bank research institute opportunity co-operation academia. the albanian public lack weekly economic-related column press, educational classes, public lectures, professional assistance public similar. these normal activity academia educational institution develop world, since primary purpose create public good society. social return social impact become ever-increasingly important objective profit-seeking financial institutions, economy education limit strict traditional classroom teaching. analysis comment almost always approach criticism, rarely – say hardly ever – approach explain interpret certain economic phenomenon. against backdrop, responsible finance go beyond financial system’s boundaries; stretch player responsibility guarantee possible ways. i invite interest player co-operate order guarantee financial responsibility, provide active contribution accord role economy. bi review 36/2010 1 bandid nijathaworn: post-crisis challenge emerge market – stake central banks? keynote address mr bandid nijathaworn, deputy governor monetary stability bank thailand, south east asian central bank (seacen)/bank england seminar macroeconomic monetary policy management, brunei darussalam, 22 march 2010. * * * first, i want thank seacen, centre central bank study bank england, ministry finance, brunei darussalam invite deliver morning’s keynote address. the seacen’s advance course seminar always important learn forum central banker asia discus common challenge well share practical experience. so, i much appreciate opportunity speak today. on personal note, also year since i last speak forum, responsibility bank thailand deputy governor october last year change monetary policy financial regulation supervision. this brief tenure oversee financial stability, especially manage financial system height global financial crisis, valuable experience make appreciate even responsibility, complexity, challenge central banking. and reflection experience i want share morning, post-crisis challenge emerge economy stake central banks. my address today focus three issues. the first lesson learn past crises. the second post-crisis environment implication emerge markets. and, third challenge central bank go forward. first, lesson learned. those central bank fifteen year witness least two major financial crisis put task central bank manage economy spotlight. the first asian financial crisis 1997–98, second current global financial crisis. although two crisis share many similarity well exhibit important differences, common origin globalization inability global financial system deal effectively consequence globalization. in asian crisis, origin external imbalance individual economies, private sector indebtedness, currency mismatch, sudden reversal capital flows. in current crisis, origin lay large global imbalance, excessive-risk take financial institutions, accumulation large systemic risk. in context policy, two crisis produce many useful lesson need do prevent recurrence crises. while shortage lesson learned, bank thailand two crises, list lesson learn come four important lessons. the first nobody crises. this say crisis happen economy, whether large small, develop emerging, without sophisticate financial system, regardless whether country fix flexible exchange rate system. and crisis happens, impact large globalize nature market drive spillover contagion. for emerge markets, mean risk future crisis wide-ranging internally externally induced. the externally-induced crisis either imprudent policy choice elsewhere failure systemically important market institutions. and see current crisis, impact externally-induced crisis contagion as, even severe, internally-induced home-grown crisis. 2 bi review 36/2010 therefore, lessen risk future crises, prudent good policy choice must make countries. if not, chance crisis repeat remain high globalize world interdependence economy policies, interconnectedness country trade financial flows. the second lesson that, monetary policy must remain focus maintain low stable inflation environment, crucial sustainable growth, clear current crisis low stable inflation alone sufficient ensure financial stability. this risk financial stability come many source domestic inflation. in current crisis, house bubble excessive risk-taking financial institution precipitate crisis environment stable prices. therefore, maintain financial stability, attention must pay key source risk imbalance, price stability, systemic implication economy’s growth stability. this second lesson. the third lesson relate importance robust resilient financial sector times. for emerge markets, mean strong bank sector. in current crisis, strength bank sector enable asian economy cope successfully impact global crisis. these strength underpin sector’s strong capital base, limit exposure subprime-related toxic assets, low reliance external funding. such strength quality accident. they result deliberate policy reform financial system, strengthen supervision financial institutions, revamp financial regulation, risk management, governance asian financial crisis. the point i want stress quality help u current global financial crisis quality need keep. the fourth lesson benefit long-term growth stability come discipline policy management pursuance policy enhance flexibility economic system. the 1997–1998 crisis important lesson asia point. discipline policy reduce risk internally-induced crisis due policy error provide authority great room flexibility deal unexpected event shocks. in current crisis, ability many asian economy respond aggressively impact crisis without undermine policy credibility case point. from experience, policy discipline relate closely decision make long-term perspective. the lack discipline often reflect policy focus overwhelmingly short-term outcome. in economics, emphasis short-term outcome tend reduce volatility initially cost much large volatility welfare loss late date need adjustment postponed. a long-term perspective, hand, allow adjustment spread less volatility effect economic welfare. next, enhance flexibility economy policy raise role price mechanism allocation resource another crucial policy choice make important difference economy emerge markets. again, asia learn lesson well 1990’s. since then, reform policy regime increase flexibility, especially exchange rate, contribute importantly great resiliency ability economy asia adjust change external environment. so, fact asian economy do good time policy response crisis, also policy choice make long time ago increase flexibility. let turn second part talk post-crisis environment challenge emerge markets. the challenge emerge market post-crisis world shape importantly force change emanate new global economic financial environment. some force relate cyclical shift trade financial flow response bi review 36/2010 3 new configuration risk opportunity arises. others represent fundamental change new structure economic financial relation country emerge replace old structure dismantle crisis. recent discussion issue point new normal global growth, rise asia, increase role government economic system new economic reality post-crisis world. but amongst three possible new changes, i think important far-reaching implication emerge economy durability composition global growth. the new normality global growth see low average rate growth, weigh slow growth advance economy balance sheet problem households, banks, government. emerge markets, hand, see rapid recovery expansion, lead describe two-speed global economy. implication two-speed economy emerge market two-fold. first, differential growth outlook provide incentive reallocation investment emerge market asset investor look high return. this result large persistent capital flow emerge market important implication exchange rate, domestic liquidity, inflation, asset prices. second, two-speed economy represent shift centre economic gravity advance country asian region. but whether shift sustainable depend crucially transition manage policy emerge markets. chief amongst exchange rate arrangement policy reorient growth driver export domestic demand. successful handle two issue significantly reduce risk threat financial stability emerge economy associate strong persistent capital flows. therefore, manage risk grow safely era new globalization stake emerge economy go forward. let turn third final part talk challenge central banks. the task set ahead central bank emerge markets, therefore, many. first foremost manage challenge pose new globalization pursuit price stability. important context monetary policy framework address challenge price stability time allow central bank pay close attention financial stability. next question role central bank policy play support economy’s transition export-led growth balance growth. such transition require redirection economic incentive export domestic consumption investment. at minimum, transition require strengthen economy’s financial system ensure efficient intermediation resource productive investments. against backdrop, i want leave think challenge macroeconomic policy important emerge market central bank go forward. the first monetary policy challenge place monetary policy framework deal effectively threat price stability need oversee risk financial imbalance era globalization. in current crisis, clear particular monetary policy framework superior deal challenge. nonetheless, experience many inflation-targeting emerge economy crisis demonstrate price stability financial stability preserve even extreme financial circumstance flexible inflation-targeting regime. this because, inflation-targeting, monetary policy flexibly combine macroprudential measure address concern financial stability without undermine credibility monetary policy. the bank thailand pursue line flexibility since 2004. moreover, inflation-targeting also offer flexibility set inflation target term choice core headline inflation, well level inflation target itself. 4 bi review 36/2010 this flexibility mean monetary policy great room maneuver respond shocks. with flexibility, view inflation-targeting remain useful framework monetary policy emerge economies. the second challenge manage macro-implications large persistent capital inflows, especially risk financial stability, context small open emerge economy. at time, challenge real country region challenge demand compare similar episode 1990’s. this time capital flow link finance payment imbalance majority economy region, reflection global phenomenon ample liquidity worldwide. hence, potential capital flow large volatile, effective management impact require constellation policies, economic financial. under inflation-targeting, flexible exchange rate system first line adjustment help lessen risk financial stability. next, manage impact domestic liquidity, useful central bank variety monetary tool absorb liquidity influence market conditions. but, deal effectively price financial stability, two instrument needed. the first monetary policy focus price stability. the second bank regulation effective supervision ensure financial stability maintain robust resilient financial system. important context emerge economy strengthen risk management governance financial institutions. furthermore, needed, monetary financial policy supplement macroprudential measure aim reduce procyclical behaviour financial system. and finally, run fiscal surplus effective counter-cyclical measure restrain impact demand expansion domestic inflation asset prices. the third challenge develop maintain robust, efficient, resilient financial system. a i note earlier, resilient bank sector crucial help economy adjust impact external shock. an efficient financial sector also raise ability private sector manage risk. in last fifteen year since asian crisis, much do strengthen region’s financial systems. nonetheless, much still achieve context financial market development, enhance competition, put place need financial infrastructure help facilitate good risk management bank private sector. in thai case, move direction launch second financial sector master plan last year focus improve efficiency, access, comprehensiveness thai financial sector. in general, apart low risk financial stability good risk management, robust efficient financial sector also raise capacity emerge economy generate investment local savings. this, view, real issue lie solve problem global imbalance. so, much conclude i plan say morning address. i hope useful. again i want thank seacen, ccbs bank england, ministry finance, brunei darussalam, invitation, wish successful seminar well full reward career respective central bank. thank you. bi review 35/2010 1 christian noyer: financial stability europe world – french perspective speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france chairman board director bank international settlements, open podium debate “the euro financial crisis – lesson perspectives”, copenhagen, 22 march 2010. * * * it great pleasure copenhagen gate euro area. this make stimulate discus issue relate single currency, financial crisis emerge new financial order. it allow share experience perspectives, valuable policy-makers. i would like focus remark emerge new financial order. more specifically, minute i have, i would like share thoughts, candid way, three important policy questions. how make financial system resilient? how reduce procyclicality financial systems? how best address systemic risk? resilience central bank strong stake resilience financial systems. an environment financial stability reduce risk monetary policy instrument become le efficient due friction volatility financial markets. strong prudential standard certainly prerequisite. it apparent level quality pre crisis capital bank system adequate type loss experience expect materialize broad economic downturn. large capital liquidity buff necessary especially trade activities. in basel framework recently take decision lead much robust resilient bank system future, strong capital liquidity base. the challenge, now, calibrate phase new framework way impede recovery contradict macroeconomic objectives. in long run, want strong balance sheet bank system. in immediate future, disorderly deleveraging one main downside risk recovery process. strike right balance, action communication, important, difficult. the top-down assessment underway context basel committee fsb try reach balance. the broad point propose reform significant macroeconomic consequence factor design implement them. while crisis clearly global ramifications, impact financial system uniform across world. difference financial structure matter. bank remain central financial systems: especially true continental europe responsible 80% financial intermediation. these difference suggest careful craft regulatory answer crisis. our experience france banks’ universal model weather storm relatively well. it would major paradox put place rule would challenge universal models. there need scope different country tailor solution circumstances, time within globally agree framework. 2 bi review 35/2010 many bank improve significantly capital position raise high quality capital. yet, bank may feel comfortable new capital position barely new minimum. indeed, critical issue go forward relate behavior bank respect capital buff retain top exist minimum. if bank target buff regulatory minimum, endogenous market outcome, may need raise even large amount equity expect look current package. on one hand know empirical study weak capitalize bank typically exhibit weak loan growth compare better-capitalized banks. on other, bank may find le costly adjust loan volume loan price capital, friction market bank capital make latter option expensive. finally, regulatory framework need manage avoidance regulatory arbitrage, keep innovation form structural change. for this, necessary, sufficient condition standard comprehensive coverage consistent across jurisdictions. i sure, instance, leverage ratio, implement compulsory instrument, would meet double test. at current level account divergences, consistency difficult achieve. furthermore, risk would encourage migration credit activity towards – le regulate – part financial system. it therefore important consistency apply across standard countries. convergence account standard precondition consistent implementation prudential reform discuss basel committee. it also essential new prudential standard bank become truly universal. procyclicality strictly speaking, procyclicality tendency financial system fluctuate around trend economic cycle. by extension, procyclicality encompass “amplification mechanisms” initial shock result wide movement asset prices, credit flows, market liquidity, and, possibly, real economy. our account prudential regime increase procyclicality recent years. in mark market environment, asset price movement quickly translate change capital base financial institutions. this, turn, trigger additional demand asset increase prices. this kind “inverted demand curve”; demand increase prices, may create condition deep last financial instability. address procyclicality cause regulation therefore priority. the first line defense procyclicality account framework. i strongly support current focus change account rules. more precisely, move incur loss model forward look model essential. we need robust, auditable straightforward provision system account level base forward look model would allow provision effort commensurate credit risk time. this framework also simple, bear mind ultimate objective create synergy prudential account standards. the basel committee work comprehensive approach, cast “principles revision ia 39”. account standard setter also work hard. i firmly believe two step require go forward. one iasb follow principle basel committee. another iasb fasb adopt common methodology regard provision base expect credit losses. this precondition ensure g20 country convergent account systems. some procyclicality also trim prudential regulation. effort make solvency ratio potentially le procyclical welcome pursued. in particular bi review 35/2010 3 effort aim impose measure risk “through cycle” “downturn” useful. other option take procyclicality prudential standard include fix buffer, would act capital conservation device. i see limitation option. it hard see fix buffer, suppose top minimum requirement, would perceive new regulatory minimum. also, hard see mechanism may adverse impact banks’ share ownership. another avenue address procyclicality prudential rule put place countercyclical capital buffer. the logic simple and, principle, appealing: mechanism, index macroeconomic variable, would force bank build capital reserve allow consume reserve downturn. this would expect ensure bank accumulate use self-insurance synchronization financial cycle. in practice, still need clarify condition set trigger release surplus capital accumulate mechanism. such mechanism may necessarily cumulative others may choose. systemic risk moral hazard a technique manage allocate risk become sophisticated, network counterparties expand scale complexity. this was, truly, systemic change properly understand fully capture regulator time. credit market risk supposedly broadly spread. but counterparty risk increased. overall, overall impact financial stability may well negative. there might temptation ass systemic risk crude “size” criterion. “too big fail” certainly warrant special treatment. but, position role even small medium size actor may also put situation strong influence system’s dynamics. there need account dimension systemic importance interconnection, complexity, substitutability. furthermore, “systemic” character strongly depend circumstances, environment specific feature financial system. draw priori list systemically important institution would give false sense certainty. it may also fuel moral hazard associate firm perceive market – exactly – systemic. various initiative currently discussed, include strong cooperation supervisor and, controversially, additional capital charges. they certainly require thorough analysis it essential avoid threshold effect never forget risk continuous nature, time-varying state-contingent. the debate systemic firm echo also concern activity business model institutions. it especially country public intervention rescue financial system massive scale. the presumption small lean financial institution would pose le risk financial macroeconomic stability large diversify ones. yet, fact suggest cannot hold general lesson crisis. indeed, bank suffer crisis precisely specialized, investment banks. by contrast, large universal banks, reliant large deposit base, could withstand shock comparatively better. to deal systemic risks, lot merit investigate i would call “market options”. financial innovation bring essential contribution growth prosperity. it also create significant instability. to reap benefit innovation reduce risks, need robust resilient financial system infrastructures. in respect, concentrate systemic risk central clear counterparties important market (interbank, derivatives) may bring u long way reduce them. even ccps, counterparty risk never disappears. clear house concentrate risk remain vulnerable default major participant. they operate appropriate 4 bi review 35/2010 oversight order ensure properly capitalized; maintain robust risk management practices; meet high standard governance. they must also dependent liquidity provision financial intermediaries, mean access, time, central bank liquidity. credit default swap (cds) case point. the market opaque increasingly concentrate small number institutions. worldwide, five bank – one base europe – account half cd market. besides, lead cd player trade primarily among actual transfer risk cd become limited. concentration interconnectedness increase financial crisis. they source vulnerability, risk liquidity market threat efficient pricing. the transparency cd market also enhanced. data warehouses, hold register positions, key player respect: whatever location, provide supervisor regulator access data need conduct effective macro- micro-surveillance. with strong market infrastructure great transparency, good position ensure cd provide safe contribution finance economy. most remark focus major vital impetus enhance financial regulation. i cannot conclude without mention change financial regulation panacea strengthen financial system ensure new financial order le prone instability. what also absolutely critical macroeconomic policy derail financial stability. a i mention introduction, free lunch member monetary union. the credibility policy financial stability contingent upon conduct policies. discipline fiscal policy precondition achieve macroeconomic financial stability. look future, macro-prudential policy framework could provide room maneuver. in nutshell, macroprudential policy could alleviate constraint associate conduct monetary policy face asset price instability. it might also alleviate burden fiscal policy limit systemic risk thus low need state financial rescue packages. that said, practice, develop well-articulated macroprudential policy framework raise challenges. i trust benefit address worth impressive hard work currently underway. thank attention. bi review 35/2010 1 duvvuri subbarao: some issue currency management remark dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, foundation stone lay function bank note paper mill, mysore, 22 march 2010. * * * 1. it pleasure privilege participate function lay foundation stone bank note paper mill. a special hearty welcome hon’ble finance minister, shri pranab mukherjee, whose active support, launch vital prestigious project would possible. 2. i want use opportunity speak occasion highlight significance paper currency, touch history production currency note india address certain issue currency management. importantly, i would also like outline importance paper mill launch today. 3. currency note circulation increase significantly since time rbi establish 75 year ago. the value note circulation country increase rs.172 crore 1935 rs.7,00,000 crore 2009. in term volume, note circulation increase 124 million piece 1935 51 billion piece 2009. in fact, china, india large producer consumer currency notes. 4. a economy grows, people need currency payment instrument settle transactions. notwithstanding several innovation field payment settlement, common people country, indeed many develop countries, still use paper currency routine financial transactions. the ratio currency public gdp 12 per cent 1951 currently around 13 per cent demonstrate currency still remain important mode payment country. it reserve bank’s responsibility, sole issuer notes, make available good clean note adequate quantity public. history evolution production note india 5. currency/bank note among mass-produce commodity world. the genesis paper money generally attribute token money evolve around 10th century china. in india, enthusiastic experiment muhammed bin tughlaq 14th century issue token

this follow set another press dewas madhya pradesh nearly fifty year late 1975. meanwhile, 1967, security paper mill capacity 1500 metric tonne per year establish hoshangabad mp. by late 1980s, demand currency note exceed capacity two government note presses. to meet demand-supply gap, instance government india, reserve bank established, 1996, two currency press – one mysore salboni west bengal. these set wholly own subsidiary rbi viz. bharatiya reserve bank note mudran pvt. ltd. (brbnmpl). by 1999, brbnmpl’s two new press start work full capacity make country self reliant currency note printing. clean note policy implementation 9. in 1999, sufficient print capacity firmly established, reserve bank adopt “clean note policy” circulation fairly good quality banknote withdrawal unfit/soiled banknote circulation destruction. in pursuit clean note policy, rbi several things. we mechanize process note sorting/processing destruction unfit note start 2000-01. recognize practice staple note result disfiguration notes, impede machine process reduce longevity, rbi issue directive bank section 35a bank regulation act stop staple currency note instead secure paper bands. rbi advise bank sort note re-issuable non issuable category reissue clean note public. finally, rbi launch awareness campaign exhort public desist write watermark window note fold staple notes. 10. a part mechanization system improvement drive, instal many 54 high speed currency verification process

currency chest well equip note sort machines. we also system overhaul improve productivity, reinforce safeguard minimize errors. 11. the effort result credible improvements. in two year period september 2007 september 2009, accumulation soil note currency chest issue office bring 190 day process capacity 68 days. the disposal soil note increase 7.3 billion piece 11.9 billion pieces. fresh note issue currency chest public increase 10.7 billion piece 2006/07 13.8 billion piece 2008/09. fake currency/counterfeit note 12. counterfeit money almost old print currency. at period history, consider treasonous enough warrant punishment death. it 1650 ad paper money develop counterfeit flourished, especially within america counterfeit money common genuine money. counterfeiter become skilled first federal coin issue u government 1780s, dy cut ex-counterfeiter. however, advent colour copier electronic device late twentieth century make counterfeit easier. bi review 35/2010 3 around world, government lock fierce race counterfeiter keep one crucial step ahead term technology security features. government also tighten measure check counterfeiting, apprehend counterfeiter impose deterrent harsh punishments. 13. data available public domain suggest incidence counterfeit vary across different countries. while australia, counterfeit note detect around seven piece per million note circulation (2008-09), canada 76 (2008). in new zealand, number low 0.71 counterfeit per million note circulation (2008-09), whereas switzerland ten. a euro, roughly one counterfeit per 14,600 bank note circulation (2008). at home india, fake note report detect bank fake note find remittance receive rbi 2008-09 amount eight per one million note circulation. the data however include counterfeit seize police. the data show that, international metric, incidence counterfeit note india alarming. nevertheless, counterfeit per se matter serious concern government reserve bank. 14. while subject estimate fake notes, i want make clarification. last year, newspaper erroneously quote figure nayak committee report estimate forge currency note circulation. the nayak committee, set 1988 go dynamic currency management, make estimate fake currency. what estimate project value note circulation year 2000 rs. 1,69,000 crore. the medium incorrectly report number fake note circulation. 15. the reserve bank’s role address problem counterfeit lie improve security feature currency notes, put place system fake note make entry bank channel promptly detected, raise public awareness levels. for sake completeness, let list measure initiate reserve bank address menace counterfeiting:  awareness publicity campaigns.  augment security features. non disruptive withdrawal note old series replacement note new series.  use note sort machine large cash handle branch phase manner note sort reissue customers. to start with, branches, daily average cash receipt rs. 1 crore, march 2010, daily average cash receipt rs. 50 lakh rs. 1 crore, march 2011.  installation note sort machine select non-chest bank branch (210) rbi mix criterion viz. volume cash handling, counterfeit detection proximity international border.  atm equip sensor detect counterfeit notes. till then, bank ensure atm fill note sort sort machines.  creation forge note vigilance cell banks.  formation security committee state include representative police, banks, etc. deal problem counterfeiting.  strengthen security system currency chest intensive supervision chest rbi. 16. rbi’s effort check counterfeit effective equally effective effort banks. bank ensure counterfeit note promptly detect enter bank system, prompt accurate reporting. they 4 bi review 35/2010 ensure clean genuine note issue atm counters. a currency note integral part daily life, we, users, understand various security feature notes. these feature prominent, easily identified. enhance public awareness far effective deterrent counterfeiting. polymer note 17. cost longevity important issue currency management. after due consideration, consultation government, reserve bank decide introduce one billion piece r 10

country. however, main raw material require – banknote paper – heavily dependent imports. the exist facility hoshangabad meet 5 per cent requirement. we need significantly increase self-sufficiency regard number operational, economic strategic reasons. produce paper decidedly cheaper, importantly check counterfeiting. the banknote paper market strong oligarchy. india’s demand banknote paper –

but, certainly large institution receive significant government support. commercial real estate drag earn quarter yet, bank failures. but segment industry recover model, focus relationship banking, prosper economy recover expands. interestingly, look preliminary data, i suspect future analysis crisis find regional community bank crisis actually may do good job serve local market maintain lend standards. while group bank high concentration commercial real estate capital, evidence work effectively, instances, cooperatively large bank borrower work reduce losses, base knowledge active monitor customers. some large bank would well-served take lesson. it also coincidence breakdown part marketplace, substantial portion regional community bank increase loan businesses. during 2009, 45 percent bank $1 billion asset increase business lending. 2 bi review 34/2010 and may make large bank uncomfortable hear this, regional community bank manage operate competitive disadvantage. for large financial firm implicit, recently make explicit, guarantee taxpayer dollar use protect failure, regardless risk assume. it discuss legislation address issue special class large firm deem too-big-to-fail. this one item must address real competitive equity among financial institutions. what propose may need strengthened, start. let end remark quickly comment federal reserve’s role supervisor regional community banks, something soon come debate senate perhaps house. the strong opposition remove federal reserve regional community bank supervision, voice others federal reserve, drive idea simply protect “turf” save federal reserve jobs. the record clearly show federal reserve system make important change operation move benefit country whole regardless impact federal reserve. most notably, federal reserve among strong supporter check 21 legislation, realize would mean eventual loss thousand federal reserve check process jobs. the legislation improve efficiency payment system, painful personally see elimination hundred job district, step take best serve nation. in case, however, serve best interest nation mean reduce federal reserve’s supervisory role. give importance 6,800 regional community bank locate almost many community across country, inconceivable central bank unite state would role oversight, supervision state member bank bank hold companies. the federal reserve system design founder goal supervise broad cross section u.s. banks, assure equitable access federal reserve liquidity facility regardless institutional size location, contribute stability financial system – wall street america’s main street. it job well. in crisis ‘80s, affect large small banks, bank supervise federal reserve proportionately impose least loss fdic fail relative bank supervise federal agencies. in addition, federal reserve’s role supervision bank bank hold company provide critical information local economy place muskogee, okla.; santa fe, n.m. scottsbluff, neb. and answer question: yes, role regional community bank supervision support responsibility member federal open market committee, expand understand local regional economies. strip federal reserve responsibility supervise regional community bank bank hold company unacceptable anyone care equity nation’s bank system, large small bank, nation’s regional local economies. confine federal reserve’s supervisory role large firm will, i fear, inadvertently make federal reserve central bank large firm disenfranchise 6800 banks. the map tell story. when congress create federal reserve nearly century ago, give u decentralize system span continent. the explicit purpose structure good balance interest main street wall street. recent experience confirm structure important today then, perhaps so. community bank important bank system economy, therefore continue important federal reserve. i say deserve repeating: it would bi review 34/2010 3 tragic irony outcome crisis gain power large firm expense 6,800 regional community banks. if so, would win wall street. bi review 34/2010 1 ben s bernanke: preserve central role community bank speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, independent community banker america national convention, orlando, florida, 20 march 2010. * * * i’m glad able meet speak independent community banker america. i greatly value chance hear directly challenge face today. a everyone audience knows, challenge daunt indeed, go far beyond parochial concerns. community america try cope economic consequence severe financial crisis since great depression – high unemployment, lose income wealth, home foreclosures, strain fiscal budgets, uncertainty future. because community bank integral local economies, front line, speak, deeply engage confront problem uncertainties. your commitment communities, include willingness provide credit service support small businesses, home purchases, commercial development, reason optimistic nation’s ability meet current challenge return economic health. one america’s economic strength relatively great reliance bottom-up rather top-down growth development, individual creativity, local knowledge, trust bear longstanding relationship help foster economic creativity progress. of course, precisely ability foster bottom-up growth, build local knowledge relationships, set community bank apart financial institutions. it important economic health maintain diverse resilient financial system community bank play important role. a crisis shown, one great threat diversity efficiency financial system pernicious problem financial institution deem “too big fail.” i spend time today discuss effort federal reserve policymakers make put end too-big-to-fail problem thus help foster effective competition financial services. i also want speak today link institution mine. the federal reserve always special relationship community banks. a turn crisis management support economic recovery, relationship become important ever. toward competitive, efficient, innovative financial system the unite state financial system remarkably multifaceted diverse. some country rely heavily large bank provide credit financial services; system, contrast, include financial institution sizes, wide range charter missions. we also rely country array specialize financial market allocate credit help diversify risks. our system complex, i think part variety important strength. we many, many way connect borrower saver unite states, direct save productive channel essential prerequisite successful economy. that said, financial system job well, must impartial efficient arbiter credit flows. in market economy, result best achieve open competition level play field, framework provide choice consumer borrower give innovative efficient firm chance succeed grow. unfortunately, financial system today fall substantially short competitive ideal. 2 bi review 34/2010 among serious insidious barrier competition financial service too-big-to-fail problem. like you, i remember well frighten week fall 2008, failure near-failure several large, complex, interconnect firm shake financial market economy foundations. extraordinary effort federal reserve, treasury, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), agencies, together similar action counterpart countries, narrowly avert global financial collapse. even extraordinary actions, economic cost crisis severe; i little doubt that, global financial system disintegrated, effect asset values, credit availability, confidence would result far deep longer-lasting economic contraction. it unconscionable fate world economy closely tie fortune relatively small number giant financial firms. if achieve nothing else wake crisis, must ensure never face situation. the cost u firm deem big fail stunningly evident day financial system teeter near collapse. but existence too-big-to-fail firm also impose heavy cost financial system even placid times. perhaps important, firm publicly perceive big, interconnected, systemically critical authority permit failure, creditor counterparties le incentive evaluate quality firm’s business model, management, risk-taking behavior. a result, firm face limit market discipline, allow obtain fund good term quality riskiness business would merit give incentive take excessive risks. have institution big fail also create competitive inequity may prevent productive innovative firm prospering. in environment fair competition, small firm chance outperform large companies. by token, firm make grade exit, free resource uses. our economy static, bank system static either. in short, competitive, vital, innovative financial system market discipline encourage efficiency control risk, include risk system whole, end too-big-to-fail problem all. but done? some proposal make limit scope activity financial institutions, i think number idea worth careful consideration. certainly, supervisor empower limit involvement firm inappropriately risky activities. but even proposal implemented, technologically sophisticate globalize economy still need large, complex, internationally active financial firm meet need multinational firms, facilitate international flow good capital, take advantage economy scale scope. the unavoidable challenge make sure size, complexity, interconnectedness insulate firm market discipline, potentially make tick time bomb inside financial system. to address too-big-to-fail problem, federal reserve favor three-part approach. first, colleague supervisory agency must continue develop implement significantly tough rule oversight serve reduce risk large, complex firm present financial system. event past several year clearly demonstrate large, complex financial institutions, bank hold companies, must subject strong regulation consolidate supervision. moreover, crisis show supervisor must take account potential risk financial system whole, individual firm isolation. implement supervision way seek identify systemic risk well risk individual institution difficult challenge, fact traditional approach focus narrowly individual firm succeed prevent crisis likely would succeed future. consequently, federal reserve work international colleague require systemically critical firm increase hold capital liquidity improve risk management; overhaul supervisory framework bi review 34/2010 3 large institutions, improve effectiveness consolidate supervision incorporate oversight comprehensive, systemic perspective. the second component strategy end too-big-to-fail increase resilience financial system itself, reduce potential damage systemic event like failure major firm. for example, federal reserve lead collaborative effort improve clear settlement credit default swap derivative enhance stability market repurchase agreements. limit fallout failure major firm directly beneficial crisis, also help reduce too-big-to-fail problem, government much le reason intervene belief financial system resilient enough handle significant failure without excessive disruption. third, government oversight alone never sufficient anticipate risks, increase market discipline essential piece strategy combat too-big-to-fail. to create real market discipline large firms, market participant must convince one firm unable meet obligations, shareholders, creditors, counterparties protect loss government action. to make threat credible, need new legal framework allow government wind failing, systemically critical firm without serious damage broad financial system. in words, need alternative resolve fail firm neither disorderly bankruptcy bailout. a prototype framework already exist – namely, rule set forth federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 1991 deal fail bank. a fdic able fail bank, government should, appropriate circumstance appropriate safeguards, able seize wind failing, systemically critical firm. institution permit receive assistance open, authority must empower sell, merge, break institution necessary avoid disorderly unravel threaten financial system whole. the resolution agency allow protect shareholder capital provider clear authority impose loss debt holders, override contracts, replace manager director appropriate. if, end, fund must inject resolve systemically critical institution safely, ultimate cost must fall taxpayer small financial institutions, institution source too-big-to-fail problem. i don’t want understate difficulty create effective resolution framework large, interconnect firms. such firm extraordinarily complex, term legal structure range sophistication activities. the resolution large institution whose operation span many country pose particular challenges, legal framework vary across countries, authority country naturally seek protect interest depositor creditor jurisdictions. we must also recognize resolution might well take place context broad crisis, government might force address problem multiple firm simultaneously. careful plan therefore essential. an idea worth explore require firm develop maintain so-called live will, help firm regulator identify way simplify untangle firm crisis occurs.1 1 see daniel k. tarullo (2009), “supervising resolve large financial institutions,” speech deliver institute international banker conference cross-border insolvency issues, new york, n.y., november 10. 4 bi review 34/2010 the federal reserve community bank the federal reserve community bank much common beyond mutual concern too-big-to-fail problem. our interest community bank root found federal reserve 1913, nearly century ago. president woodrow wilson founder fed, take note two previous fail attempt establish u.s. central bank, intentionally avoid create single, monolithic institution locate washington new york. instead, establish system 12 reserve bank locate major city around country. (it federal system – hence term, “federal reserve.”) why america’s central bank give unique structure? the reason provide legitimacy broad geographic presence across nation institution often make difficult decisions. over time, structure provide federal reserve grassroots connections, local insights, diverse perspective federal institution enjoy. we always look opportunity interact learn community bankers. event like one important venue exchange ideas, i’ve mentioned, many others. for example, community banker sit federal advisory council, meet board governor three morning year discus development economy bank industry. we meet similar schedule second official council, thrift institution advisory council, bring together thrifts, save banks, variety depository institutions, smaller, around country. in addition, community banker sit board advisory council fed’s 12 regional reserve bank 24 reserve bank branches. both board reserve bank organize regular meet involve community bank range participants. for example, reserve bank meet community bankers, community development organizations, stakeholder discus barrier opportunity extend credit small businesses. of course, many regular interaction community bank arise oversight bank hold company state-chartered bank choose join federal reserve system. this supervision guide board, conduct day-to-day reserve bank examiners, many live work within district serve many years. we believe approach ensure federal reserve supervision community bank consistent discipline also reflect local perspective take account difference regional economic conditions. for example, midwest, many community bank specialize agricultural lending, federal reserve examiner maintain special expertise agricultural economy associate lend practices. they also draw frequently expertise regional agricultural economist district maintain up-to-date understand local conditions. so many banker tell u federal reserve examiner analytical tough, tell u unfair uninformed what’s go local economy. we believe kind response speak effectiveness supervisory program community banks, take pride professionalism quality community bank examiners. one particularly valuable aspect federal structure that, years, provide policymakers washington way keep close touch continent-spanning, highly vary economy unite states. when i attend board director meet regional reserve banks, i regularly, one interest portion go-round, director provide perspective local economic developments. quite often, director community banker provide valuable contributions. that fact surprising. by nature, community bank interact many part area economy – consumers, small businesses, large businesses, real estate developers, even local governments. this breadth vision, together good sense underlie economic force work locality, give community banker unique perspective development part bi review 34/2010 5 country. when feed analyze economic developments, necessity rely official economic data identify broad national trends. however, official data often mask diversity u.s. economy; moreover, data inherently backward-looking, tell u happen past quarter year. in contrast, grass-roots information obtain community banker community business leader serve reserve bank director provide forward-looking perspective economic development concerns, well level detail qualitative insight often lose aggregate numbers. our contact community banker also provide critical insight state nation’s banks. because remarkable diversity u.s. financial system, supervisory agency focus large bank institutions, without knowledge community banks, would get limit potentially distort picture happen bank system whole. close connection community banker enable federal reserve good understand full range financial concern risk face country, current difficult problem commercial real estate lend impediment small business lending. for example, recent pattern commercial loan growth different large small banks, link community banker help u good understand trends. the community bank perspective also critical try ass burden effectiveness financial regulation. a group, community bank also important nation’s financial stability, particular focus responsibility federal reserve. although case current crisis, instability generate small institution well large one – occur great depression thrift crisis, cite two particularly dramatic examples. additionally, lender discount window community bank depository institutions, rely information expertise obtain supervisory responsibility lend safely, particularly time stress. for reasons, supervisory relationship state-chartered bank join federal reserve system immensely valuable, range contact community banks. conclusion i know community banks, special strengths, flourish system provide fair competition; indeed, many step difficult time provide credit support economic recovery. to create competitive system, well safe one, need end too-big-to-fail problem all. we continue focus issue, welcome constructive idea quarters. we federal reserve look forward maintain long-standing relationship community bankers. you bring u insight bank industry economy obtain nowhere else. and recovery progresses, expect continue aid nation’s return prosperity make good loan creditworthy borrower communities. we want continue work help play important role. in so, together help ensure bright future economy community banking. tarisa watanagase: the international monetary system remark dr tarisa watanagase, governor bank thailand, executives’ meet east asia-pacific (emeap) – eurosystem high level seminar, sydney, 10 february 2010. * * * liquidity challenge crisis while advance country epicenter global financial crisis adopt unconventional measures, asian economy face liquidity crunch, hence need unconventional measures. in case thailand, financial institution rely entirely local deposit encounter liquidity problem. nevertheless, contingency, central bank expand list collateral use get liquidity central bank. a international liquidity, bilateral central bank swap line readily available imf’s flexible credit line also welcome prompt response. a know, asia also chiang mai initiative cmi, serf anchor confidence psychology channel. on broad global liquidity issue, triffin dilemma view issuer international currency take advantage special status stimulate domestic demand liquidity global market. i return point late part remark. lesson learn asian crisis from first-hand experience deal asian crisis, i believe important go back origin vulnerabilities, liquidity solvency problem. on reflection, i think late global crisis originate advance economy similar asian crisis decade ago, particularly boom-bust cycle cause excess liquidity. and, aftermath crisis, advance country take path response asian country take past ten years. allow put perspective similar path crisis responses, see clearly need do individually globally. experience thailand asia in asian case, thailand particular, premature open financial sector open offshore bank unit lead excessive capital inflow could effectively arrest high interest rate policy, give fix exchange rate regime lack effective policy tools. the macroeconomic mismanagement aggravate lax supervision financial institution lack adequate risk awareness public private sectors. all factor lead asset price bubble eventually burst. but, asian financial crisis make thailand different place decade late much strong economic resilience, together significant progress regulatory institutional reforms. today, macroeconomic policy framework emphasize monetary stability also financial stability broad in-depth surveillance cover household, financial, real estate sectors. this strengthen surveillance framework allow u take pre-emptive macroprudential measure tackle potential imbalance specific sector bi review 34/2010 1 develop significant vulnerabilities. in parallel, financial sector regulation supervision strengthen significantly, aim ensure financial institution market take prudent risk enough buff cope potential systemic risks. country asia progress path i mention asian crisis. in addition individual efforts, another important development regional effort precautionary measures. the late development chiang mai initiative multilateralization also help bridge gap ifis emerge market economy liquidity arrangement timely disbursement. what still ongoing establishment regional surveillance unit asean+3 facilitate prompt disbursement liquidity facility provide u good understand risk vulnerability regional context. global crisis: address root cause would asian crisis look back far asia come crisis put perspective recent global crisis policy responses. in view, past crisis also cause combination excessive liquidity, inadequate surveillance supervision regulate shadow bank sector advance countries. too much trust place market mechanism, prove failed. a case sub-prime markets, risk awareness adequate supplier demander financial instrument preemptive action take despite risky characteristics. the response crisis country prevent next crisis different asian economy ten year ago. the call make g-20 leader include put focus financial stability, strengthen financial sector regulation supervision, enhance surveillance mechanism individual international levels, especially effective surveillance role liquidity support ifis, particularly imf, mention important initiatives. please allow comment issue i’d like highlight. what do need do effective surveillance: good global citizen one immediate response crisis strengthen effective surveillance capacity national international levels. we course right track effort create robust effective surveillance system view ensure timely policy actions. tackle problem early stage help lessen chance micro shock adversely affect macroeconomy, also safeguard spillover one country rest world. in today’s globalize world, spirit good global citizenship essential. hence, financial sector surveillance, i support idea systemically important economy need participate financial sector surveillance fsap, include stress testing, support global surveillance objectives. a overall global surveillance, need effective role ifis, particular imf. effective surveillance mean capacity ensure right policy action public sector sufficient risk awareness management private sector policy market response generate positive feedbacks. underpin effective surveillance course credibility legitimacy governance structure ifis. in regard, i believe need sincere push continue improvement imf truly credible effective organization surveillance. 2 bi review 34/2010 deal inherent instability: develop deep broad financial market multi-currency system i’d like emphasize even achieve embrace good global citizenship, almost certain next crisis. but, hopefully, happen immediate future, perhaps come different source vulnerabilities. so, imperative public private sector remain vigilant risk-focused identify change nature risk new source vulnerabilities. the last point i’d like touch upon vulnerability current international monetary system. let return triffin dilemma discussion mention earlier. a issuer international currency take advantage special status overly stimulate domestic demand, lead excess liquidity global market undermine stability international monetary system end. however, whether current vulnerability international financial system lie triffin dilemma policy blunder on-going debate. regardless nature vulnerabilities, clear enough high quality financial asset relation financial investors’ demand. this factor doubt contribute underprice risk importantly, high degree concentration u financial assets, liquidity. this point especially important global economy resume normal path emerge market economy accelerate growth development, without doubt wealth accumulate. this result great global resource search investment global financial markets. therefore, i believe need financial capital market deep broad enough acceptance investor help absorb increase wealth provide alternative quality investment globally. look around, emerge market economy certainly good position develop financial market direction. this consistent concept risk diversification. over long term, instability, whether inherent not, would decline develop financial capital market also, default, multi-currency system reduce risk concentration one individual financial market currency. conclusion in closing, i believe policymakers world need focus effort aspect policy challenge parallel include surveillance, financial market developments, regulations, risk management. i strongly believe market player respond policy incentive therefore policymakers responsibility put right policy incentive place. there quick fix take long time painful adjustment country epicenter global crisis resume normalcy. in asia, take decade strengthen economic resilience. because past efforts, able weather crisis relatively well. that said, work asia still ongoing strengthen policy framework tool deal future crisis surely last. importantly, mindful world much le fiscal space cushion potential global contraction, next crisis hit. while may easy advance effort national level, achieve policy coordination global level much difficult. time, spirit cooperation bi review 34/2010 3 4 bi review 34/2010 good global citizenship, well maintain policy risk focus essential u go forward. thank you. ioannis papadakis: combat impact financial crisis welcome remark mr ioannis papadakis, deputy governor bank greece, european bank

give opportunity share preliminary think achievement effort support imf program region concert private sector involvement. the financial crisis erupt 2007 third incarnation. have start crisis affect certain marginal financial market us, subsequently spread fast impact felt financial real sector economy world. in current incarnation, turn fiscal crisis, market realize true cost measure implement minimize damage impact macroeconomy. in addition, crisis bring fore number weakness deficiency function international financial system, put effectiveness supervisory regulatory framework microscope. the discussion regard origin crisis work need do create long list “do’s don’ts”. it also lead even lively lengthy discussion appropriate mean achieve ultimate goal time require measures. let briefly mention five area action, i believe deserve priority:  first, need deal effectively short-termism quest high profits, protect system incentive create excessive bonus irrational price risks.  second, transparency financial market structure need enhance put great emphasis risk disclosure systemically important institutions, instrument markets.  third, pro-cyclicality financial system need mitigate improve quality quantity bank capital ensure bank create enough prudential liquidity buff good time reliable shock-absorbers depend, bad time come.  fourth, need macro-prudential approach financial supervision take account link financial behaviour, economic activity macroeconomic policy (e.g. crisis trigger freefall economic activity call policy relaxation, exit could postpone economic recovery), also interconnectedness financial institutions, market cross-border activity.  last least, whole system check balance must breed complacency actor involved, crisis show tail event may rare still possible. with benefit hindsight, would perhaps unfair say initial policy response crisis timid extent reluctant. soon however, face unprecedented challenges, governments, national central banks, international financial institution supervisory regulatory authority around globe demonstrate remarkable unity purpose. the extraordinary magnitude crisis lead acceptance extraordinary measure needed, repeat 1930s averted. in bi review 33/2010 1 order forestall impact crisis, policy maker deploy conventional instrument (such cut key policy interest rate increase public spending) well battery non-conventional ones. i would add, i may, intellectually excite period, often drive think outside usual toolbox. indeed, sometimes force think unthinkable, realize crisis situation accept wisdom always wise. even importantly purpose, come realize globalize world “no country island.” international interrelationship today strong country go alone open seas. this lead enhance international effort coordinate exist new arrangements. the international financial institution play catalytic role here. we must acknowledge thank it. the institution accept magnitude crisis could address actor act alone. the european bank coordination initiative start little year ago ad hoc effort stabilize flow fund economy central eastern europe. it attain stature successful coordinate mechanism, worth keep and, appropriate, replicate part world. this initiative achieve admirable coordination official private sector. the mere fact many diverse actor bring together act consensual way common, well own, good encourage indication international community matured. after year endless theoretical discussion potential merit private sector involvement crisis management resolution, ebci emerge almost spontaneously appropriate response actual acute problems. coordinate international assistance country need deserve crucial mitigate impact crisis. for example, balance payment support package imf eu six european country help deflate mostly exaggerate market concern fundamental viability region’s economy bank sectors. the size firmness wide commitment act catalyst mitigate reverse negative mood toward particular country region. the precision timeliness mutual commitment mark turn point bring u back brink fully fledge regional crisis late winter 2008/early spring 2009. give importance foreign-owned bank region’s financial sectors, co-ordination pivotal address reversal capital flow dampen economic cycle. the precise firm commitment every one party involve allow u promptly address potential co-ordination failures, shape macro-prudential approach deal impact crisis region and, so, enhance efficiency policy measure take individual country. we bank greece proud supportive initiative, right inception. needle say, shall continue support whatever circumstances. a initiative stands, even position successfully tackle detail devil often lurks. for example, need adequate external finance reserve build-up balance need strengthen financial stability avoid excessive lend expansion. the european bank coordination initiative owe much success effort make every one us. what achieve far provide u impetus continue effort towards good cooperation concert. here europe, memorandum understand 2008 among supervisory authority already foster good deep cooperation, creation late year new institutional framework financial supervision regulation also provide firm basis effective coordination. what wish strive enhance long-lasting stability european and, ultimately, international financial system. 2 bi review 33/2010 bi review 33/2010 3 i congratulate good effort last year bring safeguard stability country involved. i thank participate today’s meeting. the bank

institution – big issue remark mr paul tucker, deputy governor financial stability bank england, european commission conference “building crisis management framework internal market”, brussels, 19 march 2010. * * * many thank input mark adams, andrew bailey, peter brierley, geoffrey davy andrew hewitt, financial stability board colleague discussion resolution issues. for background work michael grady secretarial support sandra bannister cheryl feeney. i delight today’s conference, first major conference commissioner barnier. a many colleague know, i chair financial stability board’s work group cross-border crisis management. but remark today offer personal capacity, albeit draw international dialogue. the conference well time give commission’s work possible eu directive resolution regimes. an increase number national authority already establish prospectively establish special resolution regime resolution commercial banks, enable transfer deposit good asset another bank, bad asset creditor claim go insolvency process. at high level generality, distress bank split continue good bank, typically acquire healthy bank; gone-concern bad bank, go administration. insure deposit travel “good bank”. all creditor typically travel “bad bank” become claimant insolvency. we confident help buttress stability. encouragement eu member state establish regime would really useful. but also know that, itself, insufficient. it cannot cope distress lcfis (“large complex financial institutions”) without injection public money. in first place, every country special resolution regime solve problem resolve cross-border bank groups. second, regime cannot cope investment banking, whether national global, buyer cannot found. even (hypothetical) lcfi operate entirely within single jurisdiction, counterparties, customer contract domicile there, standard resolution regime could effect orderly run of, example, massive, complex derivative portfolio. put over-the-counter derivative though central counterparties would help. but would securely solve problem. today i want surface big issues, encourage eu international community generally explore possible solutions. in so, i take objective twofold: (i) first, avoid disorderly disruption provision financial service economy event firm distress; (ii) and second, put market discipline back system, loss fall uninsured creditor well equity holders, without public sector solvency support. bluntly, challenge sustain provision financial service crisis without state bail uninsured creditors. bi review 33/2010 1 handle lcfi complex derivative/trading portfolio some type business activity, particularly complex trading, lend well standard resolution tool i summarise now. not least, unwind derivative book especially complicated; typically require dynamic hedge preserve value, would hard indeed liquidation. counterparties flee. fund flees. the lehman aig experience demonstrate this. so, different context, time take berkshire hathaway wind complex derivative portfolio gen re subsidiary; years, months. what done? one route, suggest examples, would authority finance wind complex trade positions, would effect analogue us-style debtor-in-possession financing. the authority would prefer creditors. that kind approach could use either briefly, order bridge insolvency procedure, would amount put framework around kind operation nyfed mount week contain disruption failure lehman’s u broker-dealer. or, alternatively, could principle use prolong period, finance run whole book. in either case, however, would expose authority risk loss, would always deliver objective i think share. it would assure preserve orderly market cases. and would insufficient firm actually insolvent. a quite different, rather profound approach would deploy super special resolution framework permit authorities, rapid timetable, haircut uninsured creditor go concern. by haircutting creditor go concern, would need close business immediately (or, regulator wished, even all). that high-level description. variant obviously exist. instead haircuts, uninsured creditor could part claim convert equity. and would need clear regime apply normal rank capital structure, common equity subordinate debt wipe senior unsecured debt haircut (or converted) all. precisely investment bank highly levered, relatively small percentage haircut (or conversion equity) could materially recapitalise distress firm. creditor would recapitalise distress lcfis, state. in that, share feature contingent-capital bonds, would statutory basis could apply unsecured creditor extreme circumstance systemic distress. the crucial feature haircuts/conversion would apply front creditor go concern. by contrast, standard commercial-banking resolution regimes, “bad bank” go insolvency process go concern, de facto haircut apply creditor ex post, realisation asset liquidator – process almost always destroy value. a “going concern” approach would effect combine feature standard regime resolve commercial bank (rapidity, public policy objectives) feature u chapter 11 non-financial company (haircuts creditor continue business). of course, kind super-special resolution regime i air could exact replica chapter 11 – capital structure distress lcfi would restructure quickly, weekend overnight, could rely negotiate settlement creditors. for reason alone, common exist commercial-bank resolution regimes, would plainly need safeguards.1 perhaps important might 1 for safeguard uk srr, see bank act 2009 (restrictions partial property transfers) order 2009 (si2009/322). 2 bi review 33/2010 super special resolution power could apply authority make formal determination firm’s distress would otherwise seriously threaten systemic stability. the modality would, i suspect, end vary accord countries’ particular circumstances. in some, financial authority might decide scale haircuts/conversions; perhaps countries, might think senior judge decide basis application financial authorities. it also worth say maintain lcfi business mean would neither preclude require regulatory action management or, crisis passed, wind-down part business time. nor would regime broad kind i sketch exclude restructure bank group functional subsidiaries, different resolution tool apply to, say, deposit-taking/payments; custody global cash management; business illiquid lend small medium-sized enterprise households; trading/derivatives business wholesale bank generally. that would inconsistent reduce number legal entity lcfi groups, perhaps order magnitude. the current fsb-sponsored work develop “recovery resolution plans” top 25 lcfis design identify kind step warranted. resolution could, therefore, take place alongside structure regulation one key element reform package strengthen global financial system. a super-special resolution regime along line would, face it, go quite long way towards reintroduce market discipline – put uninsured creditor risk even systemic situations. i innocent enough way market think wouldn’t affect behaviour. of course, would lead changes, time, capital structure investment bank operations. proper transitional period would needed. i suggest worth debating. maybe fatal flaw. we certainly search flaws. but find way resolve massive complex trade books, regulation business would probably fierce otherwise order crush probability failure. resolution way cop failure. key voice non-bank financial sector corporate treasurer finance bank system. what would get it? they might benefit avoid risk authority choose liquidate lcfi think big fail, depletion value entails; think lehman. they would, effect, trade loss one part portfolio prospect protect rest investment fallout credit crunch would follow disorderly demise distress lcfi. the cross-border dimension the big issue handle resolution internationally active banks. this challenge even fairly vanilla commercial bank groups. there basel concordat home host authority co-operate supervise international bank since 1975. it update 1983 1992 take account group-level consolidate supervision follow failure banco ambrosiano bcci. but concordat base false premiss: division supervisory-labour peacetime carry smoothly period really matters, distress? because, happens, neither standard resolution regime commercial bank super-srr kind i outline going-concern restructure could apply easily cross-border activity lcfis. srr tool cannot automatically apply extraterritorially. it seem policymakers need face to, decide whether fix, really big issue insolvency resolution law apply internationally active financial companies. bi review 33/2010 3 broadly speaking, countries’ law apply either territorial principle international insolvencies, consistent separate procedure bank’s entity different jurisdiction (so-called “separate-entity resolution”); universal principles, consistent single procedure apply resolution international bank branch abroad, wherever locate (“single-entity resolution”). i believe top-level policymakers choose kind regime want. this issue need elevate level middle-ranking technocrat where, great fault own, wallow long. the issue articulate long 20 year ago, follow bcci’s failure.2 nothing much do globally. so second half remark today, i want sketch problem arises. (i) territoriality territorial approach resolution adopt due potential conflict interest home host-state authorities. these may reflect, example, host country want rely home country act interest financial stability host country; different conflict trigger objective special resolution regime powers. there number problem territoriality. it undermine coordinate cooperative resolutions, create uncertainty encourage race asset collateral across jurisdictions. relate that, reduce effectiveness special resolution regime allow host authority ring-fence local asset benefit local creditors. and, even render resolution infeasible legal structure lcfi differ substantially operational structure, local legal entity dependent part group vital services. great harmonisation srrs across major jurisdiction might help reduce distrust countries’ approaches. but harmonisation remove potential conflict interest home host authorities. the current debate around subsidiarisation global commercial bank group stem large part problems. the think policymakers cannot solve territorial problem, embrace – bank would go local, degree ring fencing. that course may conceivably wide advantage – example, area macroprudential regulation3 might give authority great degree influence domestic credit conditions. but also need consider whether might cost approach. for policy issue reach closure, need know way forward resolution. (ii) pure universalism what end spectrum? in principle, alternative approach would shift universal approach. a pure form universalism would rule separate resolution insolvency proceedings, ring-fencing and, therefore, race assets. it might encourage 2 basel committee bank supervision (1992). “the insolvency liquidation multinational bank”, bank international settlements. it key conclusion were: (1) close multinational bank, supervisor pay attention nature time communication among communication creditors, shareholder management; (2) nature liquidation rule may relevant manner multinational bank supervised; (3) difference liquidation rule across jurisdiction winding-up affect return depositor creditor operation deposit protection schemes; (4) coordination cooperation liquidator affect return creditor liquidation affect role supervisor liquidation. 3 see bank’s recently publish paper: “the role macroprudential policy: a discussion paper” tucker p m w (2009e), “the debate financial system resilience: macroprudential instruments” barclays annual lecture london. 4 bi review 33/2010 cooperative approach cross-border resolution. there would one, global resolution, lead home authority. but pure universalism also face major obstacles. first, would imply surrender national sovereignty – replace pre-defined enforceable rule determine role different authority different jurisdictions. second, unless step take rule need sovereign capital last resort operations4, might well need accompany ex ante burden-sharing mechanism, facilitate share cost resolution across jurisdiction bank activities. in theory, could address main home host authority lcfi agree set bind principle govern distribution cost universal resolution across jurisdictions. an alternative would design single resolution regime lcfis, implement along universal line supranational resolution authority. but would country prepare tolerate loss fiscal independence overturn national insolvency law model would entail, especially require government commit recompense agency unlimited amount future? that definitely question central bankers. (iii) modify universalism pure territoriality pure universalism corner solutions. we live world country close one corner, others close other. some suggest intermediate solution might feasible. this would involve “territorial” country decide resolve financial institution headquarter jurisdiction universal basis. (a possible example approach recent crisis fdic’s resolution unite commercial bank, involve “purchase assumption”5 extend chinese subsidiary hong kong branch follow coordination amongst authority us, china hong kong.) a “modified” form universalism would involve host authority choose defer cooperate resolution bring home country authorities, provide certain condition held. separate insolvency proceed might employ host countries, allow proceed remit home country, “lead” resolution. variation might need subsidiary branches. subsidiary distinct legal entities, worldwide creditor claims. so would need within kind joined-up whole. at high level, precondition something like might include: (1) equitable treatment creditor regardless jurisdiction, creditor host country likely penalise resolution bring home country authorities, host authority would strong incentive ring-fence; (2) broad harmonisation resolution regime across major jurisdictions. also, government continue contemplate possibility fiscal support crisis, might need kind agreement – conceivably case case – 4 for discussion capital last resort see, see tucker p m w (2009f) “the crisis management menu”, suerf, ceps belgian financial forum conference: crisis management cross-roads, pp. 13 tucker p m w (2009b), “the repertoire official sector intervention financial system: last resort lending, market-making, capital”, bank japan’s 2009 international conference, tokyo, may 2009, pp. 17. 5 a “purchase assumption” term use fdic describe healthy institution purchase asset fail deposit taker. bi review 33/2010 5 6 bi review 33/2010 principle govern contribution impose country meet cost resolution. but idea i air first part remark aim help take table. a principle equitable treatment worldwide creditor depositor would consistent imposition loss unsecured creditor uninsured depositors, either going-concern restructure kind i outline early application standard srr tool gone-concern bad banks. but would require loss impose equitable basis, respect exist priority rank regardless jurisdictional-location creditors. that might require recognition across main jurisdiction certain safeguards.6 and, approach would require bind agreement amongst home host resolution authorities. vague assurance would trick, domestic authority could change mind really mattered. host home authority would need “skin game” underpin co-operation. and co-operation distress circumstance could helpfully flow back supervisor work together peacetime. an obstacle approach might countries, legislation mandate preferential treatment creditor depositor local entity cross-border banks. but might weigh legislature current reality fiscal authority find inject equity save bank preserve stability, protect worldwide creditor home creditors. to clear, i advocate particular approach here. i want authority articulate issue clearly, leader make choice think consequence choice. i’m sure really put now. and, course, whatever done, within europe would need find eu version sit national global regimes. summary my purpose today advocate solutions. it identify big issue float possible avenue discussion eu internationally. the big question clear enough. can resolve distress lcfis orderly way without inject public money? one possible way cut too-big-to-fail adjust sense “fail” involves. perhaps involve liquidation administration. perhaps involve binary shift “going concern” “gone concern”. but involve loss equity holder uninsured creditors. it rekindle market discipline. it preserve flow financial services. those are, surely, essential component resolution leg regulation, structure, resolution triangle make reform debate. individual country economic area eu get far own. to cope distress global banking, need decide whether want international collaboration resolution cross-border bank groups. that question which, one way another, high reach authority answer part reform debate. once clear, question structure regulation might become clearer. a lot rest whether resolve distress lcfis. we need answer big questions. 6 example safeguard include: creditor leave bad liquidation; net set-off agreement respected; secure creditor claim collateral keep together; capital market arrangements, cover bond programme securitisations, protected. jean-claude trichet: interview le point interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, le point, frankfurt main, conduct messrs romain gubert patrick bonazza 15 march 2010 publish 17 march 2010. * * * le point: the country euro area come agreement help greece save attack speculators. doe reward bad behaviour betray principle maastricht treaty? jean-claude trichet: the country euro area echo commitment make head state government regard take determine coordinate action, prove necessary, safeguard stability euro area. one thing i see greek crisis – fundamental importance – nobody question principle stability growth pact. on contrary, principle robustly reaffirmed. the greek government adopt series significant, necessary, convince bold measures. it clearly indicate objective comply fundamental principle stability growth pact within reasonable period time. this important. remember 2003 2004, period le turbulent current situation, pact strongly criticise – particular previous french president former german chancellor – ecb step robust defence pact order prevent render meaningless. now, nobody question it. the people vehemently criticise pact past realise extent need respect – cohesion euro area whole order preserve strengthen confidence households, firm investors, thereby foster growth job creation. le point: you’re optimist. the greek demonstrate dissatisfaction. they don’t really seem ready tighten belt … jean-claude trichet: survey – include conduct recently – show people greece understand well need put public finance order adopt measure necessary order return growth job creation. like everyone else share single currency, greek economy – moment join euro area – enjoy number significant advantage monetary terms. be part euro area strengthen greek economy. thank euro, long subject exchange rate risk, access integrate economy comprise 330 million european citizens, benefit currency inspire confidence therefore afford greece low medium long-term market interest rates. it external current account deficit finance fact belong euro area. of course, exchange significant advantages, rule stability growth pact must fully respected. le point: all same, find greece cheated. it hide shameful secret financial situation partners. how stop happen again? jean-claude trichet: this situation totally unacceptable. and it’s major problem country euro area suffer result misconduct. to ensure good governance currency, credibility budgetary information provide euro area country must absolutely reproach. we fully support european commission: eurostat, european statistical office, must extremely broad power disposal. it must able check information supply greece country basis actual evidence necessary power investigation. such situation must recur, either greece country. bi review 32/2010 1 le point: there two scenario come weeks. the positive scenario: greece saved. in second, spain next weak link … jean-claude trichet: at stage, i reason doubt solidity euro area countries, long implement respective stability programme rigorously. each country determine stabilise situation far public finance concerned. i keen stress consolidate situation euro area whole, far budget deficit concerned, bad among industrialise countries. for example, consolidate public deficit euro area amount 7% gdp, unite state japan amount 10%. all us, without exception, serious problems. le point: many people criticise you, despite crisis, agree flexible – short, allow euro area country take debt order stimulate economies. do critic case? jean-claude trichet: frankly, i don’t know anyone could want current budgetary situation worse! do really want responsible burden child grandchild debts? i believe that, face bad crisis since second world war, central banks, ecb particular, act quickly, clearly boldly. government europe throughout world take necessary decision real time. in opinion, do job well. weigh budget even would sensible. le point: you are, conversely, also criticise provide liquidity support banks. and prompt creation speculative bubble ... jean-claude trichet: that case. we adopt host bold – “non-standard” – measure since summer 2007 order provide european bank necessary liquidity. this essential order allow bank continue finance real economy spite crisis. that said, market slowly recovering, and, gradually return normal, progressively unwind exceptional measure introduce order refinance banks. le point: give sheer size, would return inflation way government eliminate debts? jean-claude trichet: throughout crisis, since summer 2007, european central bank central bank euro area, banque de france among them, always act view restore confidence. do really believe suggest give inflation loose rein would restore confidence? households’ confidence? firms’ investors’ confidence? if i say today – obviously absurd hypothesis – i’m rate inflation around 4%, would see, real time, every single market participant drastically raise market interest rate price future inflation. what’s more, sizeable risk premium cover possible change would added. household would lose confidence. finance would much costly firms. and government would see cost service debt soar. inflation – which, incidentally, fellow citizen say firm “no” – definitely solution! le point: since onset crisis, politician say carry thorough review financial system. but they’ve tackle tax haven traders’ bonuses. not much review, it? jean-claude trichet: there global consensus among industrialise country emerge economies, first, principle market economy remain best way create wealth, second, global system lot le fragile much robust resilient and, third, best methodology consist work together g20, financial stability board and, particular, basel committee. we obligation achieve results. our democracy would forgive u if, future, 2 bi review 32/2010 bi review 32/2010 3 another crisis deep one experience 2008 2009. we’re look scapegoats. we strengthen, systematically methodically, frailty global financial system. those say storm passed, return “business usual” grossly mistaken. that’s way achieve growth create job necessary. le point: would you, example, favour creation european rat agency? jean-claude trichet: it true rat agency great deal influence. it ideal global oligopoly three agencies. that said, artificial creation must always avoided. we closely monitor issue. le point: and creation european monetary fund (emf)? jean-claude trichet: the govern council ecb yet take position issue. i say that, understand correct, would possible source financing, subject extremely strict condition without constitute form subsidy, would aim prevent phenomenon could cause financial instability euro area country. it would monetary entity, adjective seem appropriate me. in case, i believe activity fund, created, strictly control confine case extremely serious specific threat. but i would repeat govern council ecb yet take position issue. le point: could scenario envisage country long able meet obligation leaf euro area? jean-claude trichet: i always say i comment absurd hypotheses. join euro area major decision. it membership adapt suit circumstances. it share common destiny countries. all current member join euro area basis maastricht criteria, accordance treaty, also basis broad consensus across major strand political spectrum country. this seem essential, precisely involve share common destiny. rasheed mohammed al maraj: the corporate governance code kingdom bahrain welcome address his excellency rasheed mohammed al maraj, governor central bank bahrain, launch propose new corporate governance code, manama, 16 march 2010. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen: it give great pleasure today take part launch propose new corporate governance code public company kingdom bahrain. although initiative lead ministry industry commerce, central bank involve stage development new code strong supporter it. we work financial sector list company implementation spirit letter new code. although high standard corporate governance essential publicly list companies, especially important firm financial sector. if i may refer back speech i give world islamic bank conference december last year, financial institution – bank particular – like corporation director need consider interest shareholders. financial institution special position trust charge look people’s money. this mean interest creditors, depositors, policy holders, client need equal weight shareholder decision take board directors. recognition directors’ fiduciary responsibility is, therefore, essential element corporate governance bank financial institutions. unfortunately, global financial crisis provide many illustration failure corporate governance. there common pattern behind many fail financial institution last 18 months. in many cases, chief executive dominant figure make sure alone take important decisions. there culture open debate discussion within senior management institutions, result member board director feel able challenge chief executive’s decisions. many bank board lack bank experts. individual recruit board bank connection rather knowledge bank industry ability ask right questions. in case many fail bank standard corporate governance fell far short expected. it board director challenge aggressive growth strategy pursue chief executives. it board director ensure proper risk management control system within bank. it board director ensure senior management bank properly take account possibility experience extreme stress scenarios. finally, board director ensure remuneration structure line long-run interest bank rather reward short-term risk-taking. the need high standard corporate governance is, therefore, one main lesson draw global financial crisis. it context cbb view new code significant development strengthen bahrain’s reputation well regulate financial centre. the new code build current international best practice corporate governance. for example, reflect corporate governance principle develop organisation bi review 32/2010 1 2 bi review 32/2010 economic cooperation development become benchmark international standard field. of course, special responsibility board director financial institution i mention early mean cbb need continue apply corporate governance requirement matter internal high level controls, avoidance conflict interest, various public disclosure report requirements. these need remain detail new code, example set public disclosure requirement financial institutions. the cbb’s detail requirement corporate governance therefore continue exist parallel new code. it important public company bahrain, financial non-financial, enter fully spirit new code. it see matter comply another set regulations, something influence corporate culture company bahrain. great transparency effective governance structure long-run serve increase attractiveness bahrain foreign investor seek establish expand operation mena region. in conclusion i would like take opportunity thank dr. hassan fakhro, minister industry commerce, support cooperation introduction new corporate governance code, steer committee excellent work achieved. thank attention. daniel k tarullo: toward effective resolution regime large financial institution speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, symposium build financial system 21st century, armonk, new york, 18 march 2010. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * two year ago week, bear stearns succumb severe liquidity stress. it rescued, eventually absorb jpmorgan chase, finance assistance provide federal reserve. although would take another six month accumulate stress uncertainty pose immediate threat nearly major financial institutions, clear retrospect arrange marriage, accompany dowry government financing, set expansion universe firm perceive big fail. during financial crisis, government authority unite state elsewhere believe two realistic option face serious distress large financial firm. first, could try contain systemic risk stabilize firm capital injections, extraordinary liquidity assistance, subsidize acquisition le vulnerable firm, combination supports. second, could allow firm fail enter generally applicable bankruptcy processes, risk time fear uncertainty run similarly situate firms. the bear stearns deal example first policy option. lehman brother example second. when bankruptcy set firestorm exceedingly dry tinder financial market fall 2008, u.s. government decide failure large, interconnect financial institution risk bring entire financial system. it respond situation trouble asset relief program provide capital, temporary liquidity guarantee program extend debt guarantees, large financial firms. indeed, face possibility cascade financial crisis, government around world select bailout option cases. but cost approach le dramatic crisis, le significant afterward. entrench too-big-to-fail status obviously risk impose significant cost taxpayer. it undermine market discipline, competitive equality among financial institution different sizes, normal regulatory supervisory expectations. the desirability third alternative hobson’s choice bailout disorderly bankruptcy obvious – hence prominence regulatory reform debate proposal special resolution process would allow government wind systemically important firm orderly way still impose loss shareholder creditors. the crisis also focus attention special problem create failure large, internationally active financial firm. in remark i elaborate relationship resolution regime effective overall system financial regulation supervision, international domestic spheres.1 at risk oversimplification, i would state relationship follows: first, effective domestic resolution process necessary complement supervision would bring market discipline decisionmaking large financial firms, 1 the view express necessarily member board governors. bi review 32/2010 1 counterparties, investors. at time, even well-designed resolution mechanism substitute reform regulatory rule strengthen supervisory oversight. second, high legal political hurdle harmonize cross-border resolution process suggest that, foreseeable future, effectiveness process largely depend supervisory requirement cooperation undertake distress appear horizon. i would suggest importance propose requirement large financial firm produce so-called live device could good tie supervisory resolution process together. a resolution regime large, interconnect firm a compel case process is, debate around resolution proposal highlight challenge craft workable resolution regime large, interconnect firms. the basic design problem regime must advance goal financial stability market discipline. while goal usually complementary, time compete – especially period high financial stress, time consistency problem loom large. in midst crisis, government fearful financial upheaval tempt provide assistance supposedly uninsured creditors, even cost increase moral hazard post-crisis period. despite consequent design difficulties, i think certain essential feature special resolution process. first, new regime use rare circumstance firm’s failure would serious adverse effect financial stability. that is, presumption generally applicable bankruptcy law apply nonbank financial firm – even large, interconnect ones. one way help ensure regime invoke necessary protect public’s interest systemic stability use “multi-key” approach – is, one require approval multiple agency determination high standard govern use special regime met. second, invoked, government broad authority wind company orderly way. this authority include – among thing – sell assets, liabilities, business unit firm; transfer systemically significant viable operation firm new bridge entity continue operations; repudiate burdensome contract firm, subject appropriate condition compensation. third, clear expectation shareholder creditor fail firm bear loss full extent consistent preserve financial stability. shareholder firm ultimately responsible organization’s management (or, likely, mismanagement) suppose first-loss position upon failure firm. shareholders, therefore, pay price firm’s failure benefit government-managed resolution process. to promote market discipline part creditor large, interconnect firms, unsecured creditor firm must also bear losses. here potential conflict policy goal obvious. while loss impose creditor increase market discipline long term, immediate effect could provoke run firm broadly similar position business strategies. thus extent loss manner apply may need depend fact individual case. at least, however, subordinate debt, financial interest qualify regulatory capital, fully expose losses. fourth, ultimate cost government assistance provide course resolution process prevent severe disruption financial system bear firm financial service industry, taxpayers. the scope financial institution assess purpose appropriately broad, reflect wide range financial institution likely would benefit, directly indirectly, action avoid 2 bi review 32/2010 mitigate threat financial stability. however, large interconnect firm likely would benefit most, seem appropriate firm bear proportionally large share cost cannot recoup fail firm itself. to avoid pro-cyclical effects, assessment collect time. establish resolution regime characteristic is, i would suggest, one important financial regulatory reform every country already mechanism place. it would lend substance idea market discipline solid third pillar financial regulation, along strong prudential requirement improve supervisory oversight. still, implicit forego discussion, untested regime probably acquire complete credibility actually apply successfully. for reason, among others, important ensure regulatory tool help compensate uncertainty associate essentially untested mechanism. international effort resolution issue the loom actual failure large, internationally active financial firm inevitably complicate already challenge process resolution. mismatch amount maturity asset liability hold firm various country operate lead host government take special action protect interest depositor creditors. and different insolvency regime apply separately incorporate subsidiary across world. some regime may substantively inconsistent one another, may account special characteristic large international firm. a natural response, one find pepper various law journal years, propose international treaty would establish harmonize appropriate insolvency regime throughout world. just state proposition see enormous hurdle realization. the task harmonize divergent legal regimes, reconcile principle underlie many regimes, would challenge enough. but effective international regime would also likely require agreement share loss possible special assistance associate global firm’s insolvency. despite good thorough work undertake basel committee bank supervision (basel committee) financial stability board, must acknowledge satisfyingly clean comprehensive solution international difficulty occasion insolvency within sight.2 it would certainly useful jurisdiction could least broadly synchronize standard bankruptcy special resolution procedure applicable fail financial firm. but even significant advance would settle many nettlesome problem raise cross-border insolvency. it thus seem reasonably clear effective management problem will, least foreseeable future, require regulatory coordination supervisory cooperation large firm’s failure become real possibility. in one sense, observation reinforce importance international agenda strengthen capital liquidity standards. it also counsel continue attention effort ensure globally active institution subject effective consolidate supervision, information-sharing arrangement among home host country supervisor well design implemented. to end, key supervisor central bank large global bank begin meet regularly discus crisis planning, particular attention contingency liquidity planning. 2 see basel committee bank supervision, cross-border bank resolution group (2009), report recommendation cross-border bank resolution group (basel, switzerland: basel committee, september); financial stability forum (2009), fsf principle cross-border cooperation crisis management (basel, switzerland: fsf, april). (the financial stability forum subsequently rename financial stability board.) the basel committee’s cross-border resolution group release report recommendation today, fsb present final report recommendation g-20 october. bi review 32/2010 3 the crisis demonstrate issue around cross-border liquidity support difficult. liquidity pressure may arise unexpected places, time coordination short, failure one jurisdiction likely spread quickly jurisdictions. the basel committee committee european bank supervisor work definition liquid assets, common stress-testing metrics, structural balance sheet measures. we actively discuss appropriate division responsibility home host authority provide liquidity support relate issue approach cross-border branch operations. some call question traditional assumption home country authority will able support worldwide operation bank group headquarter jurisdiction. it clear approach might work better, obvious need broad international consistency careful calibration prudential requirements. one key issue identify basel committee’s cross-border bank resolution group complexity interconnectedness large organizations. often complexity motivate tax regulatory factors, rather clear business purpose. give way firm structure linkage key system institutions, resolution organization carry significant risk spillover key markets, payment systems, systemically important institutions. the cross-border bank resolution group consequently recommend develop initiative would result simpler, le interconnect organizational structures. live will this point lead u one much-discussed idea, firm-specific resolution plan – sometimes refer colorfully, though wholly accurately, live wills. this proposal provide good opportunity advance aim link resolution mechanism regulatory tools, domestically internationally. in one variant idea, internationally active bank would require develop, potentially execute, resolution plan – literally, plan demise. such requirement could doubtless helpful degree, notable limitations. most obviously, difficult predict advance crisis part firm great stress, geographical region may affect severely, condition various market economy be, well stability counterparties similarly situate institutions. furthermore, government may understandably reluctant rely much upon wind-down plan develop internationally active financial firm mismanage brink failure, place institution peril. finally, management institution expect seek preserve much value shareholder possible planning, whereas supervisors’ objective crisis achieve orderly resolution, often entail wind restructure insolvent firm way effectively wipe shareholder interests. the live requirement could broaden make potentially useful supervisory tool healthy firms, well resource event resolution become necessary. under approach, firm would, addition develop resolution plan, require draw contingency plan rescue short failure, identify obstacle orderly resolution, show quickly produce information need supervisor orchestrate orderly resolution need arise. these plan need evolve organization’s business economic condition evolve, accordingly, plan need become regular part normal supervisory processes. a live type could remove uncertainty around possible resolution. it would force firm supervisor review contingency plan regularly. a part ongoing oversight, supervisor could target area firm’s plan fall short best practices. focus legal, contractual, business relationship among 4 bi review 32/2010 bi review 32/2010 5 firm’s subsidiary could yield significant benefit prudential supervision normal, well stressed, times. the various element regulatory system could thus good integrate identify mechanism connection transmission risk liability affiliate identify relationship may present obstacle ready sale businesses, proceed might allow firm avoid failure. central success live supervisory tool quality information would make available crisis. some information would relatively static. a firm would inventory legal entities, along legal regime applicable one, map business line legal entities. a firm also would document interaffiliate guarantees, funding, hedging, provision information technology key services. this information would need deal crisis, matter specific form. once centrality accurate, comprehensive information understood, become apparent significant upgrade management information system (mis) may way firm satisfy live requirements, federal reserve find lead

organization measure manage risk global, consolidate level, also legal entity basis. together, information requirement live will need measure manage risk legal entity level help create right incentive firm simplify structure without necessarily require supervisor delve detail bank group’s structure. conclusion all work resolution, domestic international, important necessary. but must realistic accomplish. in light happen past two years, imperative government convince market put large financial firm resolution process rather bail creditor shareholders. yet one guarantee future resolution systemically important firm proceed smoothly predictably. resolution mechanism must understand silver bullets, critical piece broad agenda direct systemic risk too-big-to-fail problem. mario draghi: modernisation global financial architecture – global financial stability remark mr mario draghi, governor bank italy chairman financial stability board, committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 17 march 2010. * * * thank much invite take part important debate european national parliaments. international regional cooperation national political leadership essential complement achieve global financial reforms; debate committee really helpful purpose. it ultimately national regional legislatures, accountable voters, must decide implement reforms. the strain global financial system ease considerably last twelve months: bank raise funds, asset write-down diminished. nevertheless, element fragility still present various part financial system risks, mainly relate deterioration traditional loan books, bunch refinance need next years, new source risk sovereign risk. it essential count, year come, fully restore ability bank sector perform essential task economy. we come long way towards strengthen financial system since crisis began. but hard work ahead u finish up. in remarks, i focus mainly forward challenges. but let start take stock get to. three thing important get u now:  first, recognition that, closely integrate system, sit boat;  second, leadership g20 process, eu play important role, agree objective timeline substantial reform;  third, establishment mechanisms, fsb, hasten coordinate policy development need meet objectives. when i say get far, i speak unprecedented amount international dialogue co-operation important financial system issues, result substantive change either come place. while many issue remain resolved, europe, u elsewhere, are, collectively, fundamentally reshape framework systemic financial oversight:  first, top-down, system-wide oversight arrangement put place national, regional international level. these include encompass surveillance, broaden macro-prudential perspectives, well mechanism trigger action identify risks. example european systemic risk board relate arrangements, u financial service oversight council, imf-fsb early warn exercise, establishment fsb itself.  second, part this, major jurisdiction region overhaul regulatory supervisory structure strengthen responsiveness systemic risks, improve coordination close gaps. the fsb many way international manifestation efforts;  third, regulatory perimeter expanded. major jurisdiction finalize legislation first time establish formal oversight otc derivative market major dealers, hedge fund credit rat agencies. in bi review 31/2010 1  fourth, put place cross-border oversight crisis management contingency plan large complex global financial institutions, function core supervisory college crisis management groups. at level essential regulatory policy buttress financial stability, let recall:  that process calibrate fundamentally revise global bank capital framework establish strong protection improve risk coverage, high quality capital, counter-cyclical buff constraint build-up bank sector leverage;  second, develop implement global liquidity standard bank promote high liquidity buff constrain maturity mismatch create condition crisis;  third, make progress develop policy framework tool roll back moral hazard risk pose institution systemically important;  fourth, eliminate perverse incentive pervade securitization, include scope leverage develop opaque off-balance sheet vehicle change account standard regulatory prudential rules;  fifth, develop series supervisory tool raise standard governance, risk management capital conservation core financial institutions. in context, let note that: – make strong progress towards forward look expect loss provision regime credit loss dampen procyclicality align account prudential objective key area; – make good headway towards establish compensation regime good align risk take significant financial institutions. i selective enumeration. but point i want make underestimate accomplished. each area difficult right. that able progress global policy development case implementation broad front, fight serious financial crisis, something never happen before. so, direction move internationally encouraging. but hit homestretch areas, political leadership determine whether accomplish credible robust global reform deliver protection citizen rightly demand, yet preserve enormous advantage internationally integrate financial system. we must reaffirm commitment global solutions, demonstrate willingness reach agreement issue stand way. we cannot way. in process, must guard pressure water stringency global reforms. that pressure originate within financial industry concern preserve competitive advantage surprise. but pressure also evident hesitation country impact reform financial institutions. this hesitation strong start point weaker. however, would serious unfortunate mistake allow different start point result weak standard need future. give economic social cost crisis, simply cannot afford sub-standard outcomes. and fail, risk country region go way 2 bi review 31/2010 system fragment, significant global costs. hence, must keep focus achieve global standard credible, part this, agree transition phase-in arrangement enable u move there. i come back point. let speak key area need make headway month ahead. first foremost, must complete revamp basel capital framework liquidity standard, along complementary changes, include provisioning, address problem procyclicality see crisis. we make major step forward issue december, basel committee release – schedule – full package reform proposals. comprehensive impact assessment underway ass consequence december capital liquidity proposal bank sector. this complement top assessment calibrate new minimum requirements, take account of, among things, loss experience crisis, impact banks’ role financial system benefit cost new requirement steady state. a i mention earlier, critical let current strain condition shape standards, instead keep focus rigorous framework need ensure balanced, sustainable bank year ahead. while bank sector already make significant progress raise level quality capital liquidity, immediately implement full stringent minimum requirement could negative effects. we design appropriate transition grandfathering arrangement rule out. we set train jointly basel committee, imf key partner, thorough macroeconomic impact assessment inform phase-in implementation arrangements. preliminary result assessment stream available june/july. calibration work continue fall, broad feature framework, along transition arrangements, ready g20 summit november. country need pas necessary legislation implement reform accord agree timetable, eu forefront this. second, year must agree measure credibly reduce moral hazard systemic risk cause firm “too big fail”. tbtf first foremost national problem – bad institution big save. but affect moral hazard consequence problem go unresolved. there silver bullet one-size-fits-all solution here. one focus work therefore provide supervisor tool enable take action national context exist authority – governance, intensity supervision, structural simplification, capital surcharges, etc. systemically important financial institution resilient even period broad financial system stress events. capital, liquidity leverage expectation reflect that. but never able fully eliminate potential failures, therefore key requirement across jurisdiction establishment effective resolution framework allow type size institution fail, adequate co-ordination framework across borders. this tall order, know. however, effective cross-border resolution prove reach, strengthen case alternative solutions: place restriction activities/size/structure make institution resolvable, raise capital requirement systemic institution point likelihood impact default reduce low level. this come cost

1 kevin warsh: it’s greek – economic event last three year speech mr kevin warsh, member board governor federal reserve system, rotary club atlanta meeting, atlanta, georgia, 28 june 2010. * * * the view express necessarily colleague board governor federal open market committee. nellie liang, daniel covitz, william english, brian madigan board’s staff contribute remarks. it tempt view economic event last three year series unrelated, unpredictable, unfortunate financial shocks. and easy – easy, really – bemoan late flare-up crisis conditions, chalk global economy’s continue string bad luck. if ail u nothing case bad fortune, mix metaphor moment right: black swan catch perfect storm. and need induce durable global economic expansion amount do now-familiar spend package weekend shock therapies, would know luck indeed changing. if so. in view, strong, sustainable u.s. economic expansion hand fates. it rest hand – hand fiscal, regulatory, trade, monetary policymakers. equally, rest business leader like atlanta rotary club. we soon give notice third anniversary since onset global financial crisis. a mark occasion – continue witness shock arise intermittently unevenly – might worth debunk popular view become part crisis narrative. in stead, i begin i believe truths, perhaps hide plain sight along. subprime mortgage core global crisis; indicative dramatic mispricing virtually every asset everywhere world. the crisis make usa, first manifest here. the volatility financial market source problem, critical signpost. too-big-to-fail exacerbate global financial crisis, remain trouble legacy. excessive growth government spend economy’s salvation, principal foe. slow creep protectionism small accomplishment, equal meaningful expansion trade investment opportunity enhance global growth. the european sovereign debt crisis upset stability financial markets; demonstrate far remain sustainable equilibrium. turn private-sector liability public-sector obligation may effectively buy time, alone buy neither stability prosperity horizon. in balance remarks, i survey recent economic financial market developments. next, benefit burden recent u.s. experience, i offer change next edition policymakers’ crisis response guide. finally, even amid great uncertainty economic prospects, i seek discussion path policy. economic financial market development recent economic data support moderate recovery economic activity. a federal open market committee (fomc) note last week, information receive past couple month suggest recovery proceed labor market improving, albeit gradually. household spend increasing, remain constrain high unemployment, modest income growth, low house wealth, tight credit. business 2 bi review 90/2010 spend equipment software rise significantly; however, investment nonresidential structure continue weak. owe less-than-assured economic outlook broad uncertainty public policy, employer appear quite reluctant add payrolls. after sizable increase march april, private nonfarm payroll employment rise 41,000 may. employers, however, continue lengthen workweek exist employees. notably, workweek production nonsupervisory worker manufacture reach high level since july 2000, overtime hour per worker stand pre-recession levels. meanwhile, broad measure inflation remain subdued. and long-term inflation expectation appear stable. financial conditions, notably, become le supportive economic growth. in early may, concern intensify regard fiscal difficulty european countries. financial market volatility resurface vengeance u.s. markets. the imply volatility equity price (vix) jump level see year. in short-term fund markets, spread libor (london interbank offer rate) ois (overnight index swap) rate widen commercial paper rate many issuer jumped. investor become decidedly le will provide fund long tenors. treasury yield fell near historic lows, part investor seek refuge dollar-denominated, highly liquid, safe-haven assets. equity prices, react increase risk prospect weak global growth, also fell. broad equity price index touch low much 14 percent recent peak april. and retail investor may experience one scare many; outflow equity mutual fund appear rival retreat late 2008. risk spread u.s. investment-grade high-yield bond price rose, corporate bond issuance fell half run-rate early year. broad measure industrial commodity price decrease substantially peak – mostly account weak expect global demand. there been, however, modest improvement across market recent weeks. a i noted, moderate cyclical recovery characterize last several quarter unite states. but recovery proceeding, investor remain uncertain trajectory. financial market participant still search – perhaps good characterize lurch – new equilibrium. the economy’s path depend part whether new market public policy equilibrium establish keep financial repair process track. if volatility financial market persist elevate levels, expect pickup business fix investment may disappoint. business leader unite state may react late long series shock postpone investment capital labor alike. in way, massive excess cash balance might source strength, reminder caution. if, however, volatility level across asset market abate – indicate financial repair process continue – economic recovery continue apace. business consumer would good position convert recovery durable expansion. an update crisis response manual give recent u.s. experience respond financial crisis, allow offer consideration idea inform policy response go forward. you judge whether policymakers – home abroad – receptive ideas. first, don’t blame mirror. in time economic weakness financial distress, policymakers often trouble message embed financial market price bank lend statistics. some supervisor might disagree – even strongly – price market assign bank system’s financial wherewithal. some elect official may bi review 90/2010 3 blame commercial bank low level lending. some out-of-favor fiscal authority may take great umbrage price assign fund costs. still, outlaw class security upbraid industry tend counterproductive. second, don’t fall love mirror. in benign economic times, market price lull investor policymakers false sense security. financial market price may appear sanguine prospect fundamental suggest. the cost issue 10-year treasury bond german bund might exceptionally low historical standards. inflation expectation may appear well anchored. but guarantee future performance. market price adjust slowly steadily…until don’t. then, market price act nonlinear fashion. that’s policymakers end fewer, le desirable options. and economy do harm. so, messages, might think financial market mirror, imperfect still tell reflection reality. third, facts, force, predominant policy response. prevail wisdom policymakers must overreact market do. in view, uncertain proposition. if problem unique isolated, game theory suggest overwhelm force might serve policymakers’ interests. but, problem isolated. and game. market continue clamor explicit government commitments. good fee proverbial beast fact force. the federal reserve-led stress test one example balance reasonably struck. fourth, free lunches, early-bird special dinner. economic trend – fiscal, monetary, trade, regulatory – tend improve immediate continually give preference important. the economy’s long-term growth prospect must give top billing. a economist charles schultze remind us, wolf door termite wall require attention.1 the sooner house’s structure strengthened, better. a way forward the job policymakers, like business leaders, get easier. there understandable tendency – amid uncertain environment – defer tough decisions. but, might find frame policy choice – confront tough judgment – prudent way forward. the recent round turmoil financial market cause many fiscal authority around world reconsider whether spend way prosperity. some conclude fiscal consolidation may good path economic expansion. that spend cut key establish credible path fiscal sustainability. that channel government fund higher-yielding private-sector activity lower-yielding public-sector activity undermine economic potential. that fine-tune aggregate demand require precision difficult government execute effectively. and, market force often certain promise fiscal spend multipliers. fiscal policymakers must wrestle difficult question timing, external conditions, economic potential, policy credibility. ultimately, view, fiscal consolidation happen either policymakers choose path, get choose them. the former preferred. the event europe remind u latter likely policymakers act timely way. 1 charles l. schultze (1989), “of wolves, termites, pussycats: or, why we should worry budget deficit”, brook review, vol. 7 (summer), pp. 26–33. 4 bi review 90/2010 what about conduct monetary policy? the challenge monetary policy dissimilar confront fiscal authorities. the allure short-term gain must balance dispassionately longer-term potentially large consequences. last week, fomc announce would maintain target range federal fund rate 0 1/4 percent, continue anticipate economic condition likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate extend period. the feed announce change size composition balance sheet. however, publish minute recent fomc meet make clear committee carefully consider critical aspect balance sheet policy. in view, feed pursue deliberate, well-communicated strategy clearly differentiate path fed’s policy rate size composition balance sheet. the fed’s policy tool conflate confused. one survive feature fed’s extraordinary action breadth tool disposal. they comprise handy set, remind u every problem nail. and hammer toolkit. by considering, communicating, and, potentially, deploy policy tool independent one another, best chance achieve federal reserve’s dual objective price stability maximum employment. i consider fed’s policy rate – federal fund rate – dominant tool conduct operation go forward. it far away powerful, effect economy financial market clearly understood, effective communicate intentions. the fed’s balance sheet $2.3 trillion – $1.6 trillion represent long-term treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, agency debt acquire since late 2008 – considered, sized, comprise independently policy rate. in view, macroeconomic effect extraordinary hold le significant, effect financial market condition le clear, markets’ understand objective le

strict scrutiny. i would want convince incremental macroeconomic benefit outweigh cost owe erosion market functioning, perception monetize indebtedness, crowding-out private buyers, loss central bank credibility. the fed’s institutional credibility valuable asset, far consequential macroeconomic performance hold long-term treasury security agency securities. that credibility could meaningfully undermine take action unlikely yield clear significant benefits. indeed, federal reserve continue give careful consideration appropriate size composition exist holdings. actual sale take place near term. but, depend evolution economy financial markets, consider gradual, prospective exit – communicate well-in-advance – portfolio mortgage-backed securities. in make judgment, continue ass investor demand assets. ultimately, view, gradual, predictable asset sale feed facilitate improvement mortgage finance financial markets. any sale asset need signal policy rate soon move higher. our policy tool indeed use independently. i would note feed successfully communicate demonstrate ability exit extraordinary liquidity facility late 2009 early 2010, even continue policy extraordinary accommodation. bi review 90/2010 5 conclusion the unite state greece. we largest, robust economy world. we deepest, liquid financial markets. and dollar world’s reserve currency, bestow key advantage

governor national bank republic macedonia, 23rd annual conference group bank supervisor central eastern europe, ohrid, 15 june 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, dear participants, it honor share moment exchange think about, today, important question domain financial intermediation. it special pleasure address open 23rd annual conference group bank supervisor central eastern europe. there doubt key word every supervisory body liquidity solvency, quantity quality permanently test resilience bank system functioning. therefore, standard liquidity solvency constantly check two key aspects: (1) whether, amid various adverse shocks, set maintain satisfactory resilience bank system (2) whether point calibration key category time enable efficient, rational financial intermediation. the financial crisis begin august 2007 clearly shock world sharpness and, say, length. liquidity vanished, many institution turn insolvent, financial intermediation key link economic reproduction chain lot place world, especially develop countries, certain moments, almost entirely collapsed. everything put question: current economic theories; monetary fiscal policies; micro macroprudential policies; whole financial regulation. suddenly, one satisfy global financial framework. a gallop start reexamining. the fear recurrence crisis possible deepening, almost three year keep eye creator economic financial policy wide open. why happen us? a lot write search cause crisis, lot examine written. one part relevant expert say: (1) the so-called “great moderation” period gdp inflation fluctuation reason, wrong sense comfort illusion settled, crisis period behind us. some relevant economic mind convince u that. paul krugman, “the return depression economics” (2008) remind u statement nobel prize winner robert lucas “the central problem depression-prevention solved, practical purposes” statement ben bernanke famous speech name “the great moderation”, claim lucas modern macroeconomic policy solve business cycle problem precisely reduce problem point mere shade rather important economic question. (2) daniel k. tarullo, member feed board governor find reason replace basic regulatory framework establish great depression 1929–1933, mostly limit commercial bank traditional lend activities, regulatory framework 1970s start install deep change organization 2 bi review 90/2010 regulation financial markets, culminate adoption gramm-leach-bliley bill 1999. he say “with innovations, traditional commercial bank business model put strong pressure sides: liability side balance sheet bank form attractive save instruments, fund invest money market, asset side, growth public company international competition”. until end century restriction cluster commercial bank great depression era replace regulatory set could operate national level, involve much broad set activity practically join every kind financial companies. tarullo says, highly complex financial hold company started... independent investment bank grow group big, complex highly indebted companies... financial engineer quickly change character entire financial service sector. securitization accompany instrument unite capital market traditional lend activities, fuel growth so-called shadow bank system. (3) allan greenspan late paper “the crisis” write reason it: a. “it global proliferation securitized, toxic u.s. subprime mortgage immediate trigger current crisis”. but, says: “the root crisis reach back, best i judge, aftermath cold war”. late explain actually large increase aggregate demand come from, formerly third world nations, especially china, replicate export-oriented model so-called asian tigers, argumenting data “the save rate develop world soar 24% nominal gdp 1999 34% 2007, far outstrip investment rate”. b. “subprime mortgage unite state year small appendage broad u.s. home mortgage market, comprise 7% total origination recently 2002”...that “most loan fixed-rate mortgages, modest amount securitized...” “..,. start late 2003, begin accelerate pool package subprime home mortgage securities...” “subprime mortgage security outstanding 2007 total 900 billion usd, six-fold rise since end 2001”. c. “a classic euphoric global bubble take hold”, “that 2007, yield spread overall debt market hаd narrow point little room price risk”. ... “that bubble reach size partly due fact dot-com bubble burst little footprint global gdp”...that late april, 2007 imf note “global economic risk declined, overall u.s. economy hold well”; “many quantitative firm whose number crunch seek expose profitable market trade principle successful long risk aversion move incrementally (which much time)”; “the risk management paradigm nonetheless, harbor fatal flaw” i.e. “in grow state high euphoria, risk managers, federal reserve, regulator fail fully comprehend underlie size, length, impact negative tail distribution risk outcome reveal post-lehman” “for decades, little, data, analysts, experience, conjecture far limit tail risk” “this arguably major source critical risk management system failures”. “in despair, say greenspan, inordinately large part investment management subcontract ‘safe harbor’ risk designation credit rat agencies.” but bi review 90/2010 3 analyst credit rat agency prove adept proficient anticipate onset crisis investment community large. (4) oliver blanchard authors, paper “rethinking macroeconomic policy” stated: “with neglect financial intermediation central macroeconomic feature, financial regulation supervision focus individual institution market largely ignore macroeconomic implications. little think give use regulatory ratios, capital ratios, loan-to-value ratios, cyclical policy tools.” by analyze reason come many lessons, deliver moment. for question already global consensus. for others, still constructed. for question general consensus, devil detail therefore confront opinion demand time adjustment become operative applicable. what lesson could be, moment, relevant? i. there agreement global crisis highly interdependent world need global response. a global response need global institutions, global economic financial architecture. current institution prove insufficient inefficient. generally, structure global architecture already draw shape move good direction.  the g20 group constitute early crisis, main forum international discussion global economic stability;  under patronage g20 financial stability board, previously financial stability forum, increase number member state 12 24, area competence well. now secure unprecedented degree international coordination field regulatory questions, addition old mandate financial stability forum. fsb empower additional assignments, including: (i) undertake joint strategic review policy development international standard set bodies; (ii) set guideline for, supporting, establishment supervisory colleges; (iii) support contingency plan cross-border crisis management.  the international monetary fund refocus activity monitor international financial system, identify threat global financial stability;  in europe, base current draft legislation, financial supervision characterize two-pillar structure. the european systemic risk board (esrb) responsible macro-prudent supervision european financial system whole, european system financial supervisor (esfs) focus micro-prudent supervision. esrb especially focus potential thread financial stability arise macro-economic developments, well development financial system whole. it issue general warn warn specific aspect (e.g. country level specific industry level, every case risk seem significant). when necessary, give recommendation action deal risk monitor compliance give recommendations. esfs maintain dialog esrb deliver recommendation national supervisors, adhere principle “act explain”. 4 bi review 90/2010 ii. after crisis strong consensus concern weakness prudential policy imperative fundamental improvement. nobody dispute fact prudential policy characterize two dimensions: micro-prudential, design limit instability individual banks; macro-prudential, design limit risk financial stability whole, meaning, limit so-called systemic risk. the macro-prudential dimension become increasingly important. the bank international settlement define macro-prudential policy “the use prudential tool explicit objective promote stability financial system whole, necessarily individual institution within it”. (bis quarterly review, мarch 2010) “the objective macro-prudential policy reduce systemic risk explicitly address interlinkages between, common exposure of, financial institutions, procyclicality financial system. that is, systemic risk reduce cross-sectional dimension time dimension, respectively.” (jaime caruana, 2010) the recent bi papers, design create operate macroprudential approach, suggest several lead principle design macroprudential tools. firstly, need calibrate accord contribution individual institution potential systemic risk, regardless institution’s legal form, mean every important company must include perimeter regulation. secondly, way find reduce procyclicality financial system. thirdly, thorough study various available (macroprudential) tool conducted, potential usefulness empirical evidence impact effectiveness. the bi analysis register many tool use asian countries: (i) countercyclical capital buff link credit growth (china); countercyclical provision (china, india); (ii) loan-to-value (ltv) ratio (china, hong kong sar, the republic korea, singapore); (iii) direct control lend specific sector (the republic korea, malaysia, philippines, singapore) orient toward manage aggregate risk throughout business cycle (i.e. procyclicality); furthermore, (iv) capital surcharge systemically important bank (china, india, philippines, singapore); (v) liquidity requirement fund (india, the republic korea, philippines, singapore ; (vi) limit currency mismatch (india, malaysia, philippines); (vii) loan deposit requirement (china, the republic korea), tool manage aggregate risk every point time (systemic oversight). these example show macroprudential tool could effect vulnerability increase financial sector resilience. the basel committee already propose follow tools: - countercyclical capital framework. this require financial institution build capital good times, draw upon period stress; - forward look provisioning. bank encourage allocate provision base expect losses, oppose allocate provision basis incur loss. this approach le procyclical so-called “incurred loss” provision model. bi review 90/2010 5 - capital conservation measures. this measure include activity aim restrict oversized payment dividends, share buy back generous compensation payment financial institutions. capital requirement undoubtedly foundation microprudential regulation, also macroprudent dimension relate procyclicality financial sector. capital buff confront procyclicality meet two objectives: first, help bank system handle risk could materialize period crisis, second, mitigate reduction economic activity situation downward movement economy. nevertheless, several key issue remain open discussion. should discretionary intervention buff reduce minimum, order prevent regulatory capture? on geographical level aggregation adopt order calibrate buffers? ”for example (giovanni carosio, june, 2010) says, euro area link area-wide variable (credit growth), address level play field concerns, leave door open disaggregated measures, i argue below? and would market pressure allow bank run buff downturn?” a systemic risk arise liquidity dry-ups, carosio write uncontroversial solution find yet. the basel committee propose new standard (for example, the liquidity coverage ratio net stable fund ratio). it seems, carosio says, powerful instruments, still micro-prudential nature necessarily address “fallacy composition” typically liquidity...in principle (he continues) systemic dimension liquidity risk could address design countercyclical liquidity buffer, similar capital buff ..., possibly without raise overall liquidity requirements. an important advantage option would eliminate procyclicality micro-prudential liquidity regulation current formulation; disadvantage would add layer complexity.” (tobias adrian markus brunnermeier) accord carosio, another solution would one propose perotti, enrico javier suarez (2009) “to levy charge bank fund maturity, proxy systemic liquidity risk” one propose tobias adrian markus brunnermeier, “to tie levy measure systemic risk” one propose nicoletti alltimari, sergio salleo (2010), “to devise market instrument make liquidity available contingent basis, systemic trigger activated”. undoubtedly, issue require additional analysis work. in area microprudential regulation, basel committee, know, december last year propose impressive collection reform aim increase resilience individual financial institution case panic stress. without elaboration, i would mention following: first, increase quality quantity capital; second, increase capital charge basis trade portfolio; third, introduce leverage ratio financial institutions. fourth, improvement risk management disclosures, crisis reveal weakness so-called “improved” risk management technique basis internal risk models. fifth, special attention pay so-called counter party credit risk otc derivatives. it become evident market bear risk individual financial institution (microprudential) financial system (macroprudential). namely, otc derivative trade bilaterally banks, financial institution 6 bi review 90/2010 corporations. they trade stock exchange, make difficulty discover last risk located, i.e. bear last risk. another set tool find solution systemically important financial institutions, extremely complex question, extremely important systemic stability financial sector. except general agreement need adequate harmonization prudential regulation, systemically important financial institution almost “cross-border” nature, far high consensus solution regard matter reached. in current discussion, basically two distinctive approaches, start three key feature systemically important financial institution (sifis): size, complexity inter-linkedness. accord one approaches, institution big, complicate link fail. in sense, proposal limit size bank separate commercial investment banking, disintegrate conglomerate live wills, etc. some argue “this reason controversial effectiveness measure depend specific feature relatively small number sifis; different country probably come different solutions”. (carosio) although possible, says, reach agreement proposals, particular resolution mechanisms, others (e.g. break institution accord criterion) would require broad international political consensus, seem unlikely stage. the second approach would direct toward seek additional capital requirement, tax, accord measure systemic relevance. taxation seems, accord carosio, adequate burden-sharing perspective. “the solution, judgment”, say greenspan “that least reasonable chance reverse extraordinarily large ‘moral hazard’ arise past year require bank possibly financial intermediary hold contingent capital bonds, is, debt automatically convert equity equity capital fall certain threshold”. “however, contingent capital bond prove insufficient, allow large institution fail, assess regulator interconnect liquidate quickly, take special bankruptcy facility”. so, support second approach, light late legislation usa adopted, well proposal europe envisage measure kind. namely, “restoring american financial stability act”, pass u senate may 20, would impose significant new obligation restriction sifis, envisage possibility feed introduce rise strict rule capital, leverage liquidity. on hand, may 26, european commission propose member state establish national funds, finance tax impose financial sector, order assist close reorganize unsuccessful banks. the macroprudent tool mention far, mean exhaust list suggestions. explore adequate instrument continues, wait see deliver form idea form operational tools. iii. the crisis prove price stability sufficient achieve financial stability. bi review 90/2010 7 basically, small exception impact adoption political decisions, dangerous influence grow imbalance financial system conceived. the central bank happy register low inflation rates, seem sidetrack rapid credit growth; low risk aversion; increase asset prices, consequently, mount vulnerability financial market. that why, o. blanchard others, (2010) say that: “the crisis make clear policymakers watch many targets, include composition output, behavior asset prices, leverage different agents. it also make clear potentially many instrument disposal use crisis. the challenge learn use instrument best way.” recently, petra m. geraats (mаy 2010), conclude direction: “recent financial crisis reveal ‘nice’ (non-inflationary, continuously expanding) economy mask build toxic imbalance threaten financial system. so vital policymakers proactively pursue price also financial stability. although pursuit objective could give rise uncomfortable trade-offs, bypass supplement main instrument monetary policy, tool prudential policy, line tinbergen rule.” accordingly, ask whether central bank double mandate answer affirmatively, (petra m. geraats) says: “although twin goal sometimes give rise duel demands, appropriate policy framework central bank accomplish achieve dual mandate price financial stability”. definitely, consensus point view mounting, since large number author basically line. тhis highlight importance ongoing effort strengthen macro-prudential supervision role central bank (de larosiere, 2009). macro-prudential policy could aim contain build financial imbalance ensure financial system sufficiently resistant withstand disorderly unwind (papademos, 2009). consider important informational synergy micro-prudential supervision systemic risk analysis, bring micro-supervision roof central bank function seem attractive proposition. central bank benefit from, rely on, extend access supervisory information intelligence, especially systemically relevant intermediaries, order good ass risk vulnerability financial system whole (a. orphanides, may 2010). it necessary say, obvious, i share opinion. iv. the crisis also show financial stability pursue profligate fiscal policy. the late development europe whet issue. the decision governments, one basic economic actors, enormous influence aggregate demand. therefore, fiscal policy key role shock absorber, contribute maintenance financial stability. however, witness many government ignorant that. why so, hard guess, watch “sobering” europe, obvious crisis help firm follow perspectives: 1) the fiscal policy countercyclical. it cyclically adjust balance budget rule adopted; 2) the fiscal policy must source shocks. if look fiscal deficit certain countries, perceive that, there, far that; 8 bi review 90/2010 that old idea need establish independent fiscal agency minimal framework guarantee independence statistical agency competent national accounts, resurrected. it impressive germany commenced. to incorporate fiscal stability high act country, constitution. v. a usual, establishment new action framework one thing, whether framework become operational, functional, extent, another thing. it obvious bunch new ideas, new tool talk force crisis, focus establish concept manage systemic risk. therefore, question whether function, result depend most, logical. 1) first, systemic risk hard define. it hard provide operative contents, different dimensions: procyclicality; contagion risk; spillover effect single institution’s distress rest financial system; correlation risk; concentration risk; then, due fact risk originate several sources, etc. 2) even source identified, history show action all, action delayed, seriousness threat underestimated. for example, false report greek government real fiscal deficit unknown. and theirs. it untrue federal reserve treasury propose congress gradual reduction possible extinction g portfolio (fannie mac и freddy mac), quite 2004 asset several time small u dollar 3.2 trillion end 2007. i would like say matter always crucially depend competence, potential positive political represent manifest people’s sovereignty. it future, well. 3) in globalize world, become apparent systemic crisis exceed border one national jurisdiction easily, issue global financial architecture issue coordination, gain extremely high significance. the new regulatory architecture i speak beginning, example cooperation concern government central bank crisis truly encouraging. however, path full scylla haribdas. many obstacle need overcome. the paradigm “think globally, act locally” still much manipulate local leader need vote local voter like it. this mentality guarantee financial stability. this path need lot work. vi. where republic macedonia respect trends? our general policy adhere suggestion recommendation basle committee. regard modification define core capital, current methodology determine banks’ capital adequacy already contain approach propose basle committee regard deductable items. the requirement make analysis follow period need modification element funds, capital quality, qualify risk coverage, well introduction countercyclical capital protection mechanism remains. also, proposal introduce leverage ratio process analysis. the basle committee international board account standard msfi 9 proposal support creation impairment base anticipate loss principle, incur loss principle, current international account standard envisage. in regulation pertain credit risk management apply anticipate loss principle. bi review 90/2010 9 despite intention accept international account standards, valid methodology classify credit risk exposure contain prudent filter, require bank primarily know debtor’s characteristics, credit history expectation regard payment liabilities. such solution regulation line basle recommendations, enable bank relatively sufficient amount impairment cover incur credit loss entire turbulent period, prevent serious pressure capital base. the crisis show even well capitalize bank seriously affected, fail adequate level liquidity. the basle committee develop two minimal liquidity ratios, short-term liquidity 30 day second ratio long term character represent structural liquidity ratio. a supplement propose minimal liquidity ratios, basle committee publish revise version principle safe management supervision liquidity risk. we proactive role also regard measure. last year prepare adopt regulation require bank adhere two liquidity ratios: (1) 30 day (2) 180 days, denars foreign exchange, individually. in way, encompass both, short-term long-term aspect liquidity. the result application measure good. at end 2009, register following: volume liquid asset significantly level register end 2008; liquidity indicator improved; gap asset liability aspect contractual maturity high percentage stable deposit decreased. the history show financial stability precious represent public good society. let u try learn true lesson late crisis. i wish successful work pleasant stay

* * first all, i would like express sincere gratitude host invite lujiazui forum especially panel financial reforms. i particularly delight give opportunity discus press issue financial reform, shape future landscape global economy. in short presentation, i would like argue follow two points: firstly, financial innovation past quarter century blur divide line bank non-banks. these development make possible shift risk back forth bank system capital markets. it become difficult locate exactly ultimate risk lies, bank system find often vulnerable volatility capital markets. the volcker rule relate financial reform proposal design rectify problems. secondly, however, recognize significant regional difference banks’ business model along bank/non-bank spectrum. financial reform thus follow carefully-timed well-balanced approach, take explicit account regional functional heterogeneity. bank like non-banks non-banks like banks: rationale volcker rule it may sound bite farfetched, global financial crisis last year might bring partly bank become like non-banks non-banks become like banks. some bank non-bank-like, exemplify current financial jargon use describe banks’ business

hildebrand: europe’s fiscal challenge speech mr philipp m hildebrand, chairman govern board swiss national bank, annual general meet swiss-american chamber commerce, rüschlikon, switzerland, 21 june 2010. * * * i would like thank rita kobel rohr valuable support draft speech. i also want thank matthias lutz helpful comments. i want thank swiss american chamber commerce kind invitation. it privilege speak even annual general meeting. the last time i – nearly two year ago –, i pay homage albert gallatin, legendary swiss-american secretary treasury unite state begin 19th century. on occasion, i choose honour gallatin i felt incorporate fundamental value long share swiss american alike. a turn out, recent development europe elsewhere demonstrate compellingly one important lesson gallatin’s outstanding career remain particularly relevant today. he teach u public debt reduction require unwavering political commitment fiscal discipline. in remark evening, i attempt put fiscal challenge europe currently face broad context. the handle challenge europe’s government citizen implication switzerland, also unite state ultimately world. in attempt understand currently happen europe, go back 1950’s. european integration know begin 60 year ago, recently, success. the sign treaty establish european coal steel community 18 april 1951 first genuine step towards economic political integration. the six signatory – germany, france, italy, netherlands, belgium luxembourg –, agree run coal steel industry common management. the override goal secure last peace european continent. the introduction euro 1999 one – albeit major – step long-standing integration process. throughout decades, world benefit economic prosperity peace european continent; continent, previously tear apart two world war within span forty years. from swiss perspective, regardless one’s political ideological leanings, doubt swiss economy situate heart europe remain outside european union (eu) benefit continue process european integration. there host example illustrate this. the bilateral agreement switzerland conclude eu 1999 2004 would difficult reach 27 individual nations. among things, lead great immigration eu. despite initial fear switzerland, open integrate labor market eu switzerland clearly give swiss economy welcome boost recent years. indeed, private swiss firm even semi-public sector like health care reap substantial benefit draw supply large number highly skilled immigrant eu member state particular germany. moreover, come 2 bi review 87/2010 expense swiss workers. recent research actually suggest immigration eu last couple year narrow wage differential.1 immigrant also important source demand financial crisis. they clearly one reason switzerland’s economy weather financial crisis relatively well. indeed, switzerland one develop country private consumption remain steady source growth virtually throughout entire financial crisis.2 a particularly relevant benefit directly link introduction euro pertain exchange rate volatility. after introduction euro peak financial crisis 2008, average euro – swiss franc volatility roughly 30% low prevail deutsche mark – swiss franc volatility 1990. the compression exchange rate volatility significantly large one take lira peseta peripheral european currency reference point. with mount concern financial market ability several, mainly peripheral european country handle public debt level, situation evolve significantly. exchange rate development become challenge swiss national bank (snb). with interest rate zero limit mean expand monetary policy quantitative ease channels, exchange rate intervention necessary unconventional monetary policy tool. the snb make clear would fight “safe haven” flow euro accordance objective prevent deflationary risk materialize way excessive appreciation swiss franc. this strategy fight deflation risk yield intend results. the deflationary risk switzerland largely disappear swiss economy able benefit ongoing recovery global economy. while weaken euro respect swiss franc dampen export activity, export support growth foreign demand. overall, today outlook swiss economy remain favourable one. admittedly, adopt strategy without risk come primarily form increase currency concentration risk snb’s balance sheet. this risk reflect burden snb assume order protect swiss economy threat deflation. the snb sufficient equity capital withstand even large losses. when consider favourable economic outlook switzerland, must lose sight fact late tension financial market increase downside risks. should downside risk materialise and, via appreciation swiss franc, lead renew threat deflation, snb would take measure necessary ensure price stability. in words, snb would whatever take fight deflation safeguard price stability medium- longer-term. switzerland obvious enormous interest europe’s ability manage public debt crisis decisively ultimately successfully. europe’s ability navigate current crisis also much interest unite state indeed world. when i say this, i don’t mean refer solely potential economic strain result europe’s public debt concerns. what ultimately stake vision found father eu; vision continent live peace prosperity thereby contribute stable world order. 1 see gerfin, michael boris kaiser (2010), “auswirkungen d immigration d jahre 2002 bi 2008 auf die löhne d schweiz”, in: die volkswirtschaft, no. 6. 2 in 2009, annual growth private consumption amount 1.2% switzerland, euro area, contract 1.2%. bi review 87/2010 3 merely uphold vision not, however, resolve debt situation. but explain bold decisive step take european governments, together international monetary fund (imf), begin address market concerns. it also explain rapid deterioration public finance europe, collective monitor fiscal discipline peer pressure experience revival. arguably, importantly, several country embark path entail much need structural reforms. this public debt crisis multi-layered. it clearly crisis market confidence liquidity crisis. the trigger classic fiscal crisis combine severe competitiveness problem periphery eu. however, also institutional crisis. the institutional mechanism ensure fiscal discipline inside eurosystem clearly insufficient. obviously, part fiscal imbalance result build-up public debt directly relate financial crisis aftermath. one part fiscal expansion explain direct fiscal effect measure take stabilize financial system. another part explain drop revenue increase social benefit payment response post-crisis recession. accord recent imf calculations, account fifty percent increase debt level globally since outbreak crisis. the roughly fifty percent unrelated financial crisis effect broad economy.3 to put differently, country simply live beyond mean well financial crisis erupt 2007. the reaction financial market wakeup call country sooner late government finance must put sustainable path. the main measure implement far eu level mainly short-term orient fight liquidity crisis associate contagion risks. a large assistance package establish jointly eu imf greece. to ward risk contagion, eu put place european financial stabilization facility (efsf) imf commit provide significant bilateral funding. overall, fund secure amount 750 bn euros. this significant amount justify high risk international spillover effects. additional support ward contagion risk give european central bank decide intervene euro area public private debt market order restore appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism.4 these measure provide essential backstops. by adopt them, government eu member state european authority unequivocally state intention safeguard euro. while crucial first step, initial market reaction suggest persistent scepticism. the uncertainty regard health balance sheet european bank high keep tension financial market elevated. it exposure european bank towards mainly peripheral eu country concern market participants. market also question overall solidity bank balance sheet aftermath financial crisis. therefore, last thursday head government eu member state agree result stress test respective bank publish second half july. this decision play important role foster market confidence. in event stress test reveal case additional capital necessary, recapitalization effort undertake swiftly. institutional investor appear underweight exposure european banks. this prove helpful lend support potential capital raise effort follow credible transparent stress test exercise. indeed, one reason investor currently appear underweight european bank stock may well 3 see imf (2010): world economic outlook, april, chapter 1, p. 9. 4 ecb press release, 10 may 2010. 4 bi review 87/2010 relate fact insufficient transparency bank balance sheet condition europe. credible stress test remedy problem. contrary commentator suggest, financial market also look beyond short-term. a result, europe’s authority recognize decisive comprehensive longer-term fiscal program need put eu whole sound fiscal basis. equally, individual country can’t forever live beyond means. under pressure market, number country therefore initiate far reach multi-year programs, least partly address structural problems. moreover, way eu institution deal public finance change. a many european official point out, 2004, greece portugal germany – together france – undermine fiscal discipline successfully avert sanction foresee stability growth pact. now, eu particular big country openly advocate measure amend significantly strengthen institutional mechanism order enforce fiscal discipline.5 in context, member state eu face fundamental issue. the public debt crisis show interdependence member state monetary union strong.6 go forward reform institutional set eu, core question degree eu member state ready relinquish sovereignty. how centralise federal eu be? this discussion bear remarkable resemblance early year unite states. at time, intense debate take place around full assumption revolutionary war debt state

hamilton saw unique opportunity pursue agenda create powerful national government. he consider assumption way assure new country solid credit stand home abroad. this would allow unite state take full advantage emerge global commercial financial opportunities. in end, hamilton prevail thank classic political compromise involve future permanent site capital unite states.7 with history mind, let end optimistic note: a detail emerge efsf european authority proceed stress tests, i confident market strain begin ease. while efsf provide financial backstop, importance publish credible bank stress test

87/2010 1 erkki liikanen: some observation today’s international financial situation occasion 150th anniversary bank russia remark mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, occasion 150th anniversary bank russia, moscow, 18 june 2010. * * * it great pleasure bring greet bank finland 150th anniversary bank russia. our central bank actually kind relatives. emperor alexander ii found central bank russian empire exactly 150 year ago. the bank finland, part, establish uncle, alexander i, 1811. so clear many common roots. i return common root moment, let first make observation today’s international financial situation. * * * no country escape effect current economic crisis. in many way expected: the past decade witness unprecedented rise volume international trade financial flows. not even first golden age globalization, last decade 19th century first decade 20th, many country trade much other. during present, second era globalization, many country previously largely outside international division labour, able enjoy benefit international trade specialization. the side largely beneficial coin globalization interdependence course high vulnerability countries’ economic misfortunes. if negative shock decrease demand large economy, negative effect ripple world economy. in current crisis, sudden large disruption function global bank system make problem even worse. after collapse lehman brother september 2008, one third volume world trade disappear almost overnight. the increase integration world’s financial system allow negative liquidity shock spread extremely fast. very country immune. while global scope recent crisis unique, many way crisis similar one it. it precede economic boom, accompany high indebtedness, increase vulnerabilities. asset price rose, include house prices. when negative shock occurred, expectation revise downwards, cause asset price drop. banks’ loan loss increased, economic recession make banks’ situation even difficult. loan loss reduce bank capital, lead bank crisis many countries. problem bank sector lead problem real sector economy. crisis financial real sector adverse effect public finances, tax revenue plummet public expenditure risen. this mean many case financial economic crisis follow crisis public finances, see europe. the nature crisis remind u basic fact, perhaps overlook previous years. liquidity extremely important. this mean task central bank liquidity creator provider come focus. this happen everywhere, russia included. for part, bank russia act quickly ensure liquidity russian bank sector, central bank economies. in fact, remind old lesson economic policy-making. already 1873 walter bagehot tell u central bank lend freely illiquid solvent bank adequate collateral offer. 2 bi review 87/2010 what broad lesson policy-makers? how economic policy design new era globalization? it clear even country become dependent other, economic policy still matter. moreover, national economic policy international dimension international repercussions. during current, difficult crisis, central bank able ensure function bank systems. for sure, problem many private financial institutions, failed, function whole financial system preserved. actually, successful liquidity policy possible broad international cooperation. if anything positive crisis, prove capacity central bank act cooperation other. fiscal policy loosen significantly, globally, support level overall demand although private sector turn consolidate balance sheets. the country enter crisis sound public finance much good position. i glad note upswing years, russia able save rainy day stabilization fund pay debts. this make react crisis much easier. also finland, pre-crisis year witness large public surpluses, allow fiscal policy loosen crisis hit. however, come year even great need responsible fiscal policies. and benefit fiscal responsibility limit country separately, share globally. in design future economic policies, need remember least three things. first, need mechanism prevent over-borrowing, private public sector. second, risk need price correctly. too low risk premia lead over-borrowing. last, resolve modern financial economic crisis demand international regional cooperation. achieve require new approach new attitude public private sector, – course – hard. however, failure achieve goal would increase risk crisis future, unacceptable. * * * we celebrate anniversary one world’s great central banks, bank long tradition turbulent past. i think jubilee especially significant u finns. this russian finnish monetary system share lot common history, particular 19th century, grand duchy finland establish part russian empire. 1860, birth-year central bank russia, important turn point also monetary history finland. in march 23, 1860 (old style), emperor alexander ii issue decree give finland monetary unit own, finnish markka. before that, bank finland issue banknote denominate ruble kopecks. in june, time central bank russian empire established, first markka banknote circulated. both bank russia national monetary system finland bear result crisis hit rouble latter half 1850’s. in 1860, imperial government finland seek way stabilize currency aim link silver, even ahead russia, necessary. this background creation national monetary unit finland. at time, russian government carry comprehensive institutional reform found new central bank replace old state banks. this also make step towards stable market-based financial system. circumstance completely different now, course, one thing remain least: financial monetary stability still main objective today’s central bank policies, reform 1860’s. we face challenge even setback time time, must still fulfil responsibility crisis management work towards even strong resilient financial system future. this bi review 87/2010 3 national task, global effort good cooperation necessary condition success. a circumstance change, necessary tool may also change, ultimate goal remain same. i congratulate central bank russian federation anniversary wish success important tasks, service country, partner

but bright side story. remember illustration give business strategy courses. a business executive shoe company send large develop country ass market potential there. what saw million people go without

number shoe sell. ultimately, question mindset, change mindset concern stakeholder make financial inclusion reality. be financial inclusion viable business model? 9. how make financial inclusion workable? contrary common perception, financial inclusion potentially viable business proposition. take success story dharavi, bustle industrial-slum mumbai. wikipedia report dharavi export good worth $500 – $650 million every year. ironically, even though dharavi situate right heart mumbai, bank city country, adjoin bandra-kurla bi review 87/2010 3 complex, mumbai’s financial district, commercial bank branch long time, notwithstanding celebrate entrepreneurial spirit export performance. the first commercial bank branch open february 2007. in three years, bank register business excess rs. 44 crore. enthuse success, one bank open branch dharavi many eager so. there 9 atm dharavi, actively used. how half live? 10. the reality money management well-understood part everyday life poor, therefore key factor determine cop strategies. some may come across recent, think provoke book, “portfolios poor: how world’s poor live $2 day” daryl collins et al. most book poverty development, know, “big picture” book tend take aggregate view base anecdotal evidence best statistical work. this book strike refreshingly distinct path. what author do zoom basic daily poverty explore poor people manage money. let cite paragraph review book new yorker: ten year ago, author unusual study begin collect detail yearlong “financial diaries” household bangladesh, india, south africa, focus live le two dollar day per person. they found, surprise, none family live hand mouth; even poor rely complex combination financial strategies, include join save clubs, buy funeral insurance, act “money guards” neighbors. these people thing might seem irrational – borrow order save; pay interest save – make sense give unpredictable income limit options. 11. the dharavi example i cite early illustration bank unbanked win-win opportunity. this book evidence sophistication poor people think finances. it also demonstrate bring within fold formal bank “make difference” cop strategies. financial inclusion – effort far 12. in order financial inclusion, government reserve bank pursue several initiatives. let recount briefly. 13. first, improve bank penetration north-east, reserve bank ask state government bank identify centre need set branch full-fledged, offer forex facilities, handle government business meet currency needs. rbi fund capital run cost five years, provide state government concern will make available premise put place appropriate security arrangements. 14. second, government india set-up two fund – financial inclusion fund meet cost developmental promotional intervention towards financial inclusion, financial inclusion technology fund meet cost technology adoption. each fund overall corpus rs. 500 crore. 15. third, finance minister announce late budget every village country 2000 population must access bank service march 2012. even brick mortar branch presence expand, big driver go forward branchless bank base business correspondent (bc) model leverage technology. in order facilitate this, reserve bank also enlarge type entity engage bcs. 4 bi review 87/2010 16. we aware aadhar (‚¸š¸¸£), unique identification number (uid) project government india, head nandan nilekani. although main aim uid provide unique id number everyone country, aadhar (‚¸š¸¸£) powerful instrumentality help poor establish identity meet banks’ kyc norms. this reduce cash non-cash transaction cost bank potential customers. the uid another powerful illustration harness technology benefit poor. 17. fourth, ask every domestic commercial bank – public private sector – prepare financial inclusion plan (fip) approve board. our aim respect two fold. first, bank ownership fip. second, want bank build comparative advantage. we want bank innovative entrepreneurial try model experiment consistent business models. 18. the fips mean roll next three year require include indicator performance evaluation. rbi hold meet chairman bank review fips prepare them. these meetings, chair deputy governor dr. chakrabarty, enable clear understand issue financial inclusion. the discussion reveal main challenge ensure no-frill account actually become operational. because dire poverty, account branch service rarely minimally used. bank agree that, fips succeed:  scalable technology solution place;  rrbs also core-banking enabled;  business correspondent model couple biometric technology need deployed;  performance criterion staff include achievement financial inclusion targets;  connectivity issue need sort service providers. role technology 19. let revert role importance technology financial inclusion. financial inclusion effort date drive two distinct channels: smart card mobile phones. one issue often come debate regard need ensure interoperability technological solutions. i tell effort afoot achieve this. it is, however, important miss wood trees. the priority clearly facilitate “inclusion” first. “interoperability” doubt important follow. clearly inclusion cannot wait interoperability happen. 20. the second issue relate choice model mobile banking. world over, two distinct model – “bank-led” model “mobile operator-led” model. the reserve bank clear preference bank-led model. this least two important reasons. first, want financial inclusion remittance facility; want customer get minimum service like deposit insurance, access affordable credit payment system bank offer. second, give grow concern money launder finance terrorism, bank lead model decidedly safe sustainable. we recognize mobile telephony important role value chain keen mobile service provider collaborate bank provide value add services. bi review 87/2010 5 technology bank – way forward 21. let look ahead flag important issue use technology bank aid value creation. 22. the deepen use technology bank require accompany good “it governance” sub-set good corporate governance. bank must put place robust risk management system encompass effective infrastructure, security policies, incident report business continuity management. also, management system must subject regular review monitoring. needle say, business expand, risk failure it system expand disproportionately faster, reinforce need good it governance. there instance bank could participate day neft/rtgs product offer several reason – problem internet channel interface go unnoticed, data clean-up database get adequate attention, ignore hardware size aspects, delay decision move back-up site, like. great management attention easily fix flaws. that it governance important. 23. the second priority issue way forward quality control data use improve bank efficiency. the hierarchy transition data information knowledge wisdom. technology enable bank collect voluminous data pertain customer transactions. a bank branches, include rrbs, come core bank platform, important swamp deluge process data useful information management robust mi decision support systems. this become particularly relevant context internal rat model fraud detection technique extraction pattern data sine-qua-non. the reserve bank attache lot importance ensure quality data, process useful information flow information appropriate level. to streamline this, reserve bank form group comprise expert banks, idrbt, iba rbi study information report system bank suggest approach automate data flow straight-through manner source system bank reserve bank. 24. the next priority issue list protection information customer confidentiality. there grow concern increase cyber crimes, phishing relate frauds, identify fraud misuse customer information like. threat skimming, sniffing, spamming, spoofing, etc., increasing. some may aware recent instance several people get defraud call prize win scheme name prominent institution use lure remittance large amount money promise million return. i inform monies often pay banks’ account gullible people siphon out. even account open follow kyc norms, unusual pattern transaction easily discern bank use appropriate technology purpose. it context monetary policy statement 2010–11, propose set work group information security, electronic banking, technology risk management, tackle cyber frauds. 25. next list several way it model use improve efficiency bank – example, credit appraisal use score card model, determination provision make loan handle million low value account without compromise underwrite supervisory standards. 26. last, possibly important list priority issue need guard call “technology barrier” bank customer. a recognize, technology great enabler provide u huge opportunity make bank efficient inclusive. at time, also faceless, absence “human touch” quite intimidating, threatening, enter bank network. bank should, therefore, take extra care ensure 6 bi review 87/2010 poor drive away bank technology interface unfriendly. this require train banks’ frontline staff manager well business correspondent human side banking. idrbt facilitator 27. before i close, i amiss i acknowledge impressive contribution idrbt “techno-banking”, i may use phrase now. idrbt’s initiative develop infinet, contribution establishment message platform (sfms) share atm-network (nfs) add immense value bank sector. idrbt’s performance certification authority, r&d centre institution train education mark great advance indian financial sector. 28. the rangarajan committee go issue reposition idrbt next decade since make valuable recommendations. these relate to:  need thrust research development activity clear focus area research take next 3 5 year time;  revamp education train activity aim develop technically competent in-house expertise bank efficiently supervise manage technology-intensive resource like data centres, data recovery centres, corporate network, etc.;  become member global technology standard set body active area banking;  develop cadre faculty focus technology requirement bank industry. 29. we work implement recommendations. 30. a i note earlier, indian bank come long way use technology improve reach efficiency banking. what do laudable adapt best international technology practice indian situation. i want compliment achieve effort towards address challenge way forward. task idrbt 31. we gather today recognize outstanding performance use technology banking. hearty congratulation winner today. i hope award encourage innovation competition towards improve efficiency. i also wonder benchmark banks’ performance use adoption technology international standards, especially area financial inclusion. i would urge idrbt work this. 32. finally, i want compliment shri sambamurthy dedicate team faculty staff idrbt important contribution financial sector. my thank also member govern council institute whose expertise guidance backbone idrbt’s performance achievements. bi review 87/2010 1 muhammad bin ibrahim: evolve next frontier islamic finance development

2010. * * * lady gentlemen, the presentation annual report 2009 take place particularly complex juncture europe and, especially, spanish economy. what begin isolate ﬁscal crisis episode euro area member state turn event systemic scope oblige european authority national government adopt measure unprecedented scale defend stability area. at time, spread heighten tension ﬁrmly focus analysts’ markets’ attention situation economic policy response country which, like spain, face comparatively demand challenge are, consequently, perceive potentially vulnerable. this demand conjunctural situation, difﬁcult ﬁnd point reference recent past. and ever before, important diagnose accurately true scale challenge economy faces, prepare promptly tool need meet challenge use decisively forcefully situation requires. we must, moreover, act urgency demand responsibility active member common european project defence stability success project. the report i present today speciﬁcally gear contribute task. from spring last year, economic indicator offer sign world economy emerge critical phase grave real ﬁnancial crisis since great depression. progress since along path recovery much evident emerge economies, late projection indicate growth rate 6% 2010. by contrast, develop countries’ economy recover considerably le dynamic rate, around 2%. this turnaround conﬁrms rapid energetic economic policy action support ﬁnancial systems, stimulate demand sustain conﬁdence pivotal halt spiral recession ﬁnancial instability which, continued, would undoubtedly disastrous consequence world economy. halt recessionary spiral crucial place world economy path sustain output employment growth. but incipient recovery – still subject considerable uncertainty risk – take root, measure various front needed. the bulk measure adopt check accelerate economic ﬁnancial downturn exceptional. accordingly, withdrawn. the proper time withdrawal impulse seek progressively restore economies’ capacity generate growth autonomously challenge ﬁrst order national economic policy management. and challenge heighten adverse effect crisis economies’ growth potential, call measure structural reform enable potential restore increased. complicate matters, moreover, press need tackle effect sharp economic contraction emergency measure apply public ﬁnances. this mean ambitious credible ﬁscal consolidation process set train which, need prevent unprecedented practically irreversible deterioration public ﬁnances, tend slow recovery. 2 bi review 86/2010 unfortunately, sequence begin ﬁnancial crisis evolve real crisis ultimately prompt ﬁscal crisis fairly common recurrent pattern behaviour past crises. tension like witness recent month european sovereign debt market wake doubt sustainability greek public ﬁnances sufﬁciently illustrative scale risk may arise sequence. in particular, euro area face crisis unexpected proportions. a regions, mean large-scale emergency solution activate check downturn economy curb expectation deepen recession outbreak ﬁnancial instability. the euro area bad phase recession, ambitious supply-side policy pursued, recovery prove particularly slow. all say need revitalise potential growth structural reform prevent ﬁscal crisis credible ﬁscal consolidation programme particularly press concern euro area. the emergence fateful “ﬁnancial crisis-real crisis-ﬁscal crisis” sequence one member states, namely greece, particularly serious important development. it effect spread country also euro area whole, thus turn new epicentre global ﬁnancial instability. this episode highlight weakness economic governance arrangement euro, force work mechanism reconsidered, view set sound foundation place. event trigger greek ﬁscal crisis ultimately exacerbate signiﬁcantly complex framework spanish economy operates. allow depart traditional structure address tackle important issue raise greek crisis term consequence spanish economy exceptional situation, pose welter challenge spain’s medium- long-term growth possibilities. the shockwave greek ﬁscal crisis hit spanish economy face consequence deterioration labour market public ﬁnances need complete bank restructure process way. to understand implications, start point must sufﬁciently broad-sighted diagnosis current situation spanish economy. an idea central annual report i present today exit recession spain involve need absorb overcome imbalance build long expansionary phase. that prerequisite new growth path underpin model capable generate employment efﬁcient use productive resource past. this process successful economic policy adopt active ambitious role remove obstacle emerge restore conﬁdence spanish economy’s capacity negotiate critical juncture. this message, i attempt convey recent years, matter utmost urgency. indeed, government’s late ﬁscal, labour market pension measure keep urgency. let begin summarise aspect recession spain key understand scale challenge face. in 2009, abrupt decline spanish economic activity, big recent decades. further fall activity begin second half 2008, place level gdp open month 2010 4.6% peak second quarter 2008. on basis ﬁgure, scale recession spain appear line global trends. however, take consideration magnitude decline domestic spend (8% period), intensity job destruction (over 2 million job lose since employment peak) rise number unemployed (over 4.5 million start year), clear singular factor involve contraction spain. these mirror major imbalance build expansionary phase – particular, excessive concentration resource real estate sector bi review 86/2010 3 high private-sector debt – persistence serious structural deﬁciencies function labour market. this series factor prompt reduction household spending, drive slowdown income loss wealth accumulate since start crisis, further deterioration conﬁdence expectation future income, tighten lend standard households’ perception need restore health ﬁnancial position. that explain rapid increase household save rate, reach alltime high 2009 close 19%. the fall-off household spend compound contraction external demand highly adverse condition business investment, namely high uncertainty, rise cost availability ﬁnancing, fall proﬁts. the upshot unprecedented reduction investment, signiﬁcant effect economy’s level capitalisation. nonetheless, late 2009 early 2010 improvement, especially household consumption, begin respond major stimulus package adopted. the slight rise consumption combine positive contribution external sector enable spain join recovery already way develop countries. the sign recovery still mute largely sustain temporary factor tend peter come months. the recovery foreseeably gradual take time gather momentum sufﬁcient generate employment. accompany incipient stabilisation economy certain development which, may interpret counterpoint contraction domestic demand, contribute create condition conducive return growth. the sharp fall domestic spend contribute signiﬁcantly alter dynamic inﬂation, pace clearly slow extent post negative differential euro area last year, something unprecedented since start emu. the disinﬂationary process continue 2010 date, even fall core inﬂation set slowdown service price continue intensify. it early yet know extent development response great sensitivity cost price-setting cyclical conditions. but would signiﬁcant step towards improve competitive foundation spanish economy, vital ingredient sustain recovery scenario. this essential see liberalisation process way sector recent legislative initiative and, particular, transposition community directive services. diminish domestic demand also exert inﬂuence reduction external deﬁcit, scale difﬁcult imagine two year back. a explain annual report, correction largely due reduction trade deﬁcit import grind halt and, standpoint, appear chieﬂy attributable cyclical factors. it stressed, however, good export show strong capacity recovery recent months, trade services. both development promise need ﬁrm future nation’s net borrow permanently reduce growth pivot export sector strong le reliant imports. despite progress, substantial adjustment still made, promptly possible, act drag recovery. i refer particular need complete absorption excess capacity residential construction sector, continue ﬁnancial restructure private sector improve spanish economy’s competitive position. and must do tandem tackle problem arise economic crisis unfolded: decline employment deterioration public ﬁnances. the severity job destruction due persistence serious structural deﬁciencies labour market correct previous upturn, amid far-reaching change demographic composition labour supply. a explain detail 2009 annual report, shortcoming mean labour market 4 bi review 86/2010 adjustment fall disproportionately employment. this result, all, prevalence collective bargain industry territorial level which, naturally, sufﬁciently tailor different environment different company face. an institutional characteristic particularly harmful situation like spanish economy undergo past two years, crisis unevenly impact ﬁrms industries. indeed, crisis ultimately drive large number company worker market, cause last damage productive capacity human capital. the bargain system tend aggravate cyclical oscillation contractionary spend trends, consistent harmonious integration euro area. the event recent month highlight problem posed, regard exit crisis, rapid ﬁscal deterioration take place recession exacerbate contagion greek ﬁscal credibility crisis potentially vulnerable economies, include spain. to put scale challenge context, i shall review factor lead spanish general government deﬁcit level 11.2% gdp, surplus position 1.9% gdp two year earlier, increase public debt ratio around 17 pp gdp period. an initial factor, important one, stem economic contraction accelerate expenditure unemployment beneﬁts item link cycle, dent tax bases, cause sharp reduction revenue certain tax link labour corporate activity spending. add impact exceptional support measure adopt government face depth recession, line agree global action, country exceed develop countries. but prove great importance loss tax revenue consequence sharp adjustment real estate sector which, unfortunately, high permanent component. all development combine rise trajectory public spend systematically high economy’s trend growth. accordingly, much burgeon ﬁscal deﬁcit emerge crisis eminently structural. and correct mean unavoidable adoption far-reaching budgetary consolidation process bear precisely permanent inertial component public spending. this process urgent give seriousness repercussion greek ﬁscal crisis press need halt deterioration perception spanish public ﬁnances. indeed, worsen ﬁscal crisis greece substantially alter condition govern design execution ﬁscal consolidation programme. systematic substantive non-compliance commitment acquire greek authority respect public ﬁnances, add repeat lack informative transparency, result strong loss conﬁdence market greek government’s capacity meet payment commitments. that give rise completely new situation and, ﬁnally prove telling, one foresee institutional arrangement underpin euro area: perception potential risk insolvency one members. this lack foresight translate difﬁculties promptly set sufﬁciently forceful institutional response. these difﬁculties clearly identiﬁed market mean speciﬁc risk insolvency member state rapidly turn systemic risk whole area. evidently, spread ﬁscal difﬁculties one speciﬁc country member state run many channels, may include exposure ﬁnancial institution sovereign debt, correlation risk premia market effect associate change trade ﬂows. the importance mechanism unquestionable. but speed tension spread case initial sharp impact member state whose public ﬁnances deteriorate suggest weakness bi review 86/2010 5 perceive institutional arrangement governance euro area may play central role. a bring home u months, rapid spread tension mean difﬁcult far-reaching decision adopt two fronts: common european front domestic front member state. on european front, head state government ecoﬁn outline powerful programme ﬁnancial support greek authorities. implementation programme conditional upon greek economic policy redress regard ﬁscal consolidation strategy, strengthen accelerated, need undertake ambitious structural reform move back onto path sustain growth. subsequently, agreement create european stabilisation mechanism strengthen ﬁrm commitment member state maintain stability euro area. although detail programme still work out, volume fund involved, include imf contribution could amount much €750 billion, seem sufﬁciently illustrative determination government defend common european project. naturally, case initial support package greece, possible ﬁnancial support always subject strict principle conditionality, indispensable factor ensure underlie problem address sufﬁcient ambition determination, avoid possible situation moral hazard could degenerate accumulation new risk future. the european commission european central bank also contribute decisively task strengthen common pillar area. in respect important step take establish sound framework policy preserve smooth function euro area. i refer particular commission’s recent proposal strengthen various way stability growth pact extend area mutual oversight consultation within eu. the ultimate aim proposal early detection redress imbalance which, become clear u last months, put stability euro area risk allow continue accumulate. in respect, european central bank also react emergency situation. it do adjust schedule withdraw extraordinary crisis-combating measure put place, attune develop ﬁnancial market tensions. it thus re-established six-month liquidity-providing operations, resume ﬁxed-rate full-allotment tender system three-month tender recommence dollar-denominated liquidity-providing operations. furthermore, ecb start public private asset purchase programme view remedy dysfunction certain ﬁnancial market segment endanger normal operation monetary policy transmission mechanism essential ensure price stability. along action common european front, essential component response emergency situation reaction national government ensure sustainability ﬁnances undertake reform need restore vigorous stable growth output employment. in regard, sequence content ﬁscal consolidation package adopt spanish government naturally inﬂuenced recent developments. the spanish government take ﬁrst step towards ﬁscal consolidation deﬁned state budget 2010 and, later, present update stability programme january year, follow recommendation ecofin. in programme commit reduce budget deﬁcit 3% gdp 2013, mean sharp cut public spending, although programme base relatively benign macroeconomic scenario, thereby 6 bi review 86/2010 raise question need additional effort budget deviation arise, eventuality express ecofin council recommendation programme. the scale ﬁscal crisis greece lead spanish government strengthen accelerate ﬁscal consolidation programme order prevent market deterioration attendant serious consequence economy stability euro area. the package measure approve 20 may bring forward signiﬁcant portion effort make reduce deﬁcit 2011, stand 6% gdp, act directly structural component, project fall somewhat half respect estimate 2009 levels. the government’s unprecedented austerity drive reﬂects exceptional nature situation resolve set public ﬁnances right track thereby dispel doubt foment contagion instability. the unquestionable cost entail society compensate enhance protection instability sound position base recovery. it thus absolutely essential meet new target set, even macroeconomic scenario ultimately prof le dynamic envisage government. in current circumstance deviation projection could serious consequence credibility ﬁscal consolidation efforts. to ensure strict compliance targets, monitor supervision procedure strengthen contingency plan design ensure target meet certain expenditure item behave adequately. the cooperation local regional government essential ambitious process ﬁscal consolidation face u tackle successfully. the ﬁscal effort make spanish economy, situation available projection point moderate growth, considerable, may become even nothing do correct upward path interest rate trigger greek ﬁscal credibility crisis contagion spread vulnerable economies. to make effort feasible, ﬁscal consolidation programme accompany structural measure design strengthen potential growth economy, since largely determine sustainability public ﬁnances. in respect, vital correct inefﬁciencies grow labour market, since require reform largely determine spain’s ability become competitive generate employment. nor overlook relatively signiﬁcant part increase budget deﬁcit last two year directly indirectly relate rise unemployment. the priority labour market reform way detract importance push ahead reform product markets, particularly service sector, aim ensure ﬂexible efﬁcient overall function economy permit continue productivity growth. this ﬁeld numerous initiative adopt policy follow recent year earn good reputation. the main challenge lie timely rigorous implementation measure announce maintain pace reform. a part measure need successfully exit crisis overcome problem credibility spread contagion, orderly restructure ﬁnancial system vital order complete adjustment accumulate imbalance pave way recovery economic growth, competitiveness job creation. i therefore devote last part address challenge pose restructure ﬁnancial system, process set restructure regulatory supervisory framework international ﬁnancial markets. in presentation 2008 annual report, i explain detail in-depth revision regulatory framework necessary, i limit key change propose work currently way. two main area change distinguished: supranational organisational framework new regulatory system. bi review 86/2010 7 with regard supranational institution competent area reorganised, special mention make political impetus new extend g20, since without contribution reform international regulation would unlikely advance strongly. also, recently create financial stability board (fsb), replace financial stability forum spain become full member, play central role process change. the fsb charge identify vulnerability international ﬁnancial system coordinate response national authority international fora. in addition, oversee international application regulatory supervisory standards, promote development college supervisor prepare contingency plan require manage international ﬁnancial crises. sweep change also afoot within european union micro-prudential macro-prudential supervision. in ﬁrst, although ultimate responsibility continue lie national supervisors, european system financial supervisor charge improve quality consistency supervision, strengthen cross-border group establish single set rule applicable european ﬁnancial institutions. in macro-prudential area, deﬁned concisely entrust identify systemic risks, responsibility lie european systemic risk board, also make recommendation propose corrective measure consider appropriate. noteworthy area regulation proposal make basel committee bank supervision, directly address need increase amount quality capital hold institution absorb potential losses, advisability introduce minimum liquidity standards, usefulness create capital cushion help moderate credit cycles. speciﬁcally regard aim dampen tendency market amplify economic cycles, headway make design provision system which, essence, similar place spain since mid-2000 (the dynamic countercyclical provision). international account regulators, particularly iasb, also seem converge towards systems. also aim mitigate excessively procyclical behaviour ﬁnancial markets, management compensation guideline draw discourage excessively risky strategies. also pipeline major regulatory change mitigate moral hazard problem pose institution various way ultimately acquire come know systemic signiﬁcance. naturally, regulatory adjustment signiﬁcant impact ﬁnancial institutions. that mean that, irrespective long transition period deem appropriate, ﬁnancial intermediary set motion adjustment process, ensure least possible upheaval. spain’s ﬁnancial institution understand notably strengthen level quality capital. the restructure process spanish bank system run alongside reform global ﬁnancial system. a part essential restructuring, institutions, accord individual characteristic circumstances, must strengthen solvency, resize improve efﬁciency medium term. in short, challenge consist adapt new reality ﬁnancial sector operate future. the spanish bank system generally sound position approach restructure process. but present situation complicated. on one hand, need loan loss provision continue dent proﬁt loss accounts, default persist continue weak economic backdrop. and other, competition secure retail fund push cost borrow drive margins. strain wholesale fund market add pressure. they also entail high risk premia and, persist intensify, could make access wholesale market difﬁcult. 8 bi review 86/2010 moreover, sector must absorb internal imbalance build year strong growth economy bank activity. these imbalances, great spanish deposit institution others, essentially threefold. the ﬁrst imbalance derive over-reliance wholesale market funding. although term structure spain’s ﬁnancial institutions’ debt mostly medium long-term, severity crisis investor ﬂight view widespread loss conﬁdence put pressure institutions, respond step effort attract deposits. but change deposit structure lengthy process. the second imbalance spanish bank sector must overcome derive continue high exposure construction real estate sector, lengthy period excessive growth undergo severe adjustment. the banco de españa’s late financial stability report lay bare potential scale exposure sector activity coverage exist meet associate risks. in respect, banco de españa published, public consultation, amendment ﬁnancial report standards, particular relate estimation necessary credit risk coverage. without go detail here, sufﬁce say reform deal transparency establishment minimum criterion institutions; criterion simpliﬁed make consistent primarily respond lesson learn crisis. moreover, although respect need regulatory reform, change clearly reafﬁrm understand certain bank practices, asset foreclosures, despite legitimate problem management tools, cannot circumstance warrant delay recognition losses. the third imbalance connect spanish bank industry’s excess capacity. during growth years, bank sector activity rise signiﬁcantly. in retail bank model base proximity customers, continue upsurge activity prompt sharp growth organisational structure new branch openings. moreover, highly competitive environment, many institution whose customer base typically link speciﬁc region respond look new markets, open branch beyond traditional geographical area. clearly sense maintain organisational structure dense branch network, associate costs, time future outlook bank activity considerably le favourable previous summer 2007, consider also impact possible margin squeezes. restructure clearly responsibility bank themselves. but authority design frob (fund orderly restructure bank sector) mechanism process way would minimise burden taxpayer. a result, bank sector overall healthy position, spain spar voluminous widespread recapitalisations, commitment restructuring, see elsewhere. the frob envisage action two fronts. on one hand, give banco de españa broad power take control institution fail. and other, could call preventive side, allow ﬁnancial support provide restructure viable institution management teams, help digest process; said, institution themselves, especially experience management failures, would bear attendant cost. this mean private sector solution prioritised, see process unfold past months. today, fair say restructure recapitalisation spain’s ﬁnancial institution well way. it case formalise implement agreement reached. a result, spain’s deposit institution already sufﬁcient capital secure it, either market frob. the banco bi review 86/2010 9 de españa conduct stress test verify institution – banks, save bank credit co-operatives – actually sufﬁcient capital available, would currently seem reasonable scenarios, also complex growth scenario near future. accordingly, end-june, banco de españa take step necessary formalise process already agree ensure correctly implemented. if, month-end, process failed, institution leave behind, bank act, use mechanism envisage purpose frob legislation. moreover, bank intend publish result stress tests, reveal deterioration estimated, consequent capital requirement capital fund committed, provide market perfectly clear idea situation spanish bank system. thus, summer, restructure bank system complete, save legal reform allow save bank obtain high-quality capital market, meet new basel standards. the government agreement spain’s main opposition party successful passage legal reform parliament. the restructure reform ﬁnancial system, along budgetary adjustment, public pension reform labour market reform, urgent measure need restore conﬁdence spanish economy, and, such, pass summer recess. but process must stop there, measure need stimulate recovery growth modernisation spanish economy. vital task remain, as: educational reform; modernisation general government removal overlap different tier government; guide investment infrastructure towards project enhance competitiveness spanish ﬁrms;

good morning thank invite speak future fiji’s economy. it go without saying, lady gentlemen, daunt task governor central bank speak give central bank much narrow role economy. the role central bank first foremost maintain price stability. this challenge role. on top this, fiji’s case, also equally important task ensure balance payment sustainable. in words, ensure foreign reserve keep adequate levels. i sure audience closely follow development regard fiji number year importantly, last three years, onset global economic financial crisis. lady gentlemen, herein lie reason muster courage talk today fiji’s economy i see future. in respects, speech “hardtalk on fiji’s economy”. to get good idea future, important look past, learn lesson chart way forward country. in this, must also understand domestic external factor impact economy. lady gentlemen, i first look performance global economy, particularly performance trade partner countries. i discus domestic economy, i touch fiji’s macroeconomic performance challenges, must ensure secure good future all. 1. global economic condition outlook let begin summarize condition global economy. accord international monetary fund (imf), global economy expect grow 4.2 percent year, follow contraction 0.6% 2009. further growth 4.3 percent expect 2011. the contraction last year regard bad since great depression 1930s. however, well behind us. lady gentlemen, except australia, trade partner economy contract last year result global financial crisis. this significantly affect export tourism last year. however, country expect post modest growth year continue 2011. this good news fiji, demand export tourism increase. in fact, already see effect these, especially tourism industry, see strong recovery visitor arrivals. overall, global economy perform good expected. among advance countries, u economy good europe japan, emerge develop economies, asia drive recovery. 2 bi review 86/2010 china india record high growth rate 2009 expect record similar growth 2010. china’s growth quicken around 12 percent first quarter year, fast pace almost three years, drive stimulus spend credit boom. have say that, also witness countries, especially euro area, experience great economic difficulty due debt service problem arise run several year large fiscal deficits. and compound global crisis. for reason, growth euro area uncertain. and uncertainty cause significant risk international capital market well prospect growth worldwide. once demonstrate great risk sustain global growth. 2. macroeconomic performance challenge lady gentlemen, let share view fiji economy. this go easy task. why? this current state economy result recent global domestic development due long-term fundamental problem economy, go back ten, twenty years. these issue compound various governance issue national organizational and/or industry levels. for now, let begin say fiji huge potential. i think anyone audience disagree me. we huge potential tourism, agriculture, forestry, fishing, sports, itc etc. fiji endow rich natural resource land, huge marine environment, mineral gold, copper minerals. fiji’s tropical climate pristine environment huge advantage attract thousand tourist shores. fiji’s relatively develop status place financial trade hub south pacific. our people well educate great asset progress development nation. however, despite richness resource huge potential, fiji’s economic situation past two decade characterise low economic growth, low investments, deteriorate balance payment (bop). why growth low past? on one hand, prone factor control include natural disasters, adverse global development recent financial crisis, erosion preferential market access. on hand, within control, sluggish growth past year largely due slow progress economic structural reform decline term trade, essential support balance economic growth path. a result slow growth, unemployment level risen. let talk performance challenge fiji’s major sectors, begin overall economy. over past 10 year (2000–2009), fiji’s economy grown, average, 0.7 percent per year. look past trends, growth rate anything stable last decade. furthermore, economic growth able match population growth rate, mean per caput income growth fiji slow last two decades. our economy contract last 3 years. last year economy decline 2.2 percent. however, expect see slight growth 1.8 percent year. we expect similar growth rate 2011 2012 around 1.5–2.0 percent. lady gentlemen, number factor contribute 3-year contraction economy. of course, know significant impact global crisis economy. in addition that, several natural disaster contend with. bi review 86/2010 3 we also saw period, large project get financial difficulty domestic issue difficulty foreign developer financier offshore. and number construction project affect way significant negative effect economy. for year, expect sector show positive growth except agriculture & forestry health & social work sectors, project declines. the agriculture sector badly hit cyclone tomas, result downward revision overall growth rate year. next year, growth also expect broad-based, apart expect decline build construction sector. the tourism industry expect lead growth assist growth agriculture. let move performance challenge major sectors. i begin sugar. sugar traditionally backbone fiji’s economy. apart direct benefits, industry also significant benefit economy. however, sugar industry plague on-going problem number year unable solve decisively problem threaten viability industry. the cane sugar industry’s contribution real gross domestic product (gdp) fall years. this industry contribute around 3.0 percent real gdp, significant fall contribution compare around 11–12 percent contribution 10–15 year ago. follow peak around 500,000 tonne sugar produce 1994, production steadily declined. last year, sugarcane output low since 1961. the total sugar output last season 168,000 tonnes. the significant fall sugar output last year due largely inefficiency sugar mills, affect sugar production. the sugar industry today face major challenges. these challenge address urgently. area reform need sugar industry are:  the fsc’s financial problem quickly fixed. it cashflow situation dire say least.  factory problem must fix soon possible. the mill-upgrade programme way last year deliver expectation result huge loss millers, farmer country whole. the fsc go huge debt mill upgrade programme. the substandard work do contractor result huge loss last year. it disaster say least. however, board management fsc confident year’s crush season go well;  the industry need put strategy increase cane production two three time current production next 24 months. for need land financial support. they re-habilitate large number cane farm produce well industry norm due neglect farm long ratooning rather plant new cane every three four years. productivity must improve farm rationalization plus good farm husbandry practices;  large scale commercial cane farm must explore developed. the garment industry another sector output fall years. the garment industry fiji begin 1988, follow introduction tax free scheme 1987. over past ten years, garment industry contribute average, 3.4 percent fiji’s real gdp garment production peak 2001 production value around $188 million. however, expiry trade agreement strong competition asian economy see production dwindle. in 2004, government withdraw tax free factory status give exporter comply wto requirement (world trade organisation). in addition, 4 bi review 86/2010 since 2005, industry suffer loss quota system garment export unite states, saw closure major garment manufacturer, generate approximately 50% total garment production. moreover, implementation minimum wage regulation effective july 2009, increase cost produce garments. on average, industry contract 6.5 percent 2006 2009. these development weaken garment production. strategy need revive garment industry see fiji’s garment industry able produce high quality garments. what forestry sector? over last 15 years, timber production fall notably. in 1995, timber output reach total 600,000 cubic meters. to reach similar level now, would need increase output 150,000 cubic meter per year. support implement necessary infrastructure value-adding must considered. there need explore develop strategic partner work enhance capacity resource owners. improve road access indigenous timber resource also necessary. certification timber imperative u market fiji timber premium price world market. in light changes, recent move government restructure mahogany industry encouraging. with promulgation mahogany industry development decree 2010, march year, hopeful open access mahogany timber generate much need export earn fiji time come. the decree seek ensure mahogany industry able provide suitable sustainable return betterment economy people fiji create distinct brand fijian mahogany. it facilitate sustainable harvest reforestation program view create liberalise mahogany industry maximum return fiji. in addition, encouragement government, kadavu provincial council allow fiji pine limit (fpl) harvest pine plantation island kadavu. kadavu close 92,000 cubic metre pine ready harvest. the fpl agree harvest, weigh pay resource owner value tree straight harvest. the fpl mention every tree harvested, company would re-plant three more. this form sustainable operation boost foreign income short term provide platform long term gains. we need initiative maritime area right soil climate pine mahogany forests. sandalwood also, i believe, great potential. there special effort make plant forests. let turn fish industry. fish industry output fall potential level around 30,000 tonne reach 2005 around 13,000 tonne 2009. this do stakeholder come together develop well articulate plan fish industry drive growth increase value exports. how mine sector? the re-start emperor gold mine encourage mine gradually increase production. we need raise gold production current level around 35,000 ounce potential 150,000 ounce per annum. we achieve level past. we must explore possibility new gold mine metal minerals. recent information wainivesi gold project tailevu show mine commence quarter three 2009, progress well due power mill problems. in addition, bauxite mine project nawailevu, bua expect start soon may bring much need foreign exchange. moreover, copper exploration namosi gold prospect tuvatu progress well. the ongoing review mine legislation, expect complete end june year, encouraging. lady gentlemen, agriculture hold great promise country. at recent agriculture symposium sponsor government, number good initiative bi review 86/2010 5 agree various stakeholder attend symposium. we hope initiative take board timely progress made. we encourage energy vigour see recently ministry agriculture. in june year, first batch potato seedling plant navai nadarivatu. we tell flour mill fiji (fmf) work closely farmer earmark potato cultivation year. i understand fmf currently buy 400,000 kilogram potato annually produce potato chip new venture, fmf able lessen import bill potatoes. we would like type activity agricultural livestock product consume large amounts, self-sufficient in. these include rice, dairy, lamb beef name few. our export sector perform potential years. this attribute narrow export base structural impediment hind growth key potential sector i mention before. the average growth export last 15 year 4 percent. in 2009, export fell around 16.4 percent drive re-exports, sugar, mineral water, timber garment coconut oil. however increase earn note molasses, sweet biscuits, gold fish. in 2010 total export project grow 9.5 percent. further growth envisage 2011 2012. some export commodity show consistent growth trend, mineral water perform exceptionally well past decade. this trend need maintain improved. lady gentlemen, u lift gdp growth current low level around 5 percent, need nearly f$500 f$600m, additional foreign exchange receipt every year. if bop constraint face solve policy cannot relax allow easy business conditions. why bop constraint? this export keep pace imports. import continue escalate. fuel import around one third total import bill, high country size. total import grow average rate 6 percent past 15 years. in next 3 years, must reduce fuel import $300 million need put strategy place happen immediately. some initiative place include renewable energy project well encourage energy conservation practices. government offer attractive incentive renewable energy producers. these include tax-holidays, tax rebates, low duties. the fiji electricity authority renewable energy development program aim provide 90 percent energy renewable source 2011. currently, around 60 70 percent fea’s annual electricity output generate renewable energy sources. the ongoing nadarivatu hydro project, completed, add 41.7 mega watt power national power grid produce around 100 million unit electricity yearly basis. on part, rbf recently introduce import substitution facility try assist large scale commercial agricultural business obtain credit concessional rate interest. the rbf also offer scholarship chef train malaysia encourage use local food preparation hotel menus. this target reduce import bill improve balance payment position, well encourage local value adding. i wish repeat message hotel industry. please everything power reduce consumption imports. this go long way assist bop. i wish congratulate hotel take effort start grow fruit vegetables. this encourage indeed. 6 bi review 86/2010 a result trend decline export rise imports, country face deteriorate trade deficit associate current account deficit reach new high recently. the current account deficit estimate around 9 percent gdp 2009. a 9 percent current account deficit unsustainable. therefore, everything power increase export earn reduce imports. tourism pick well follow global downturn. in view, current circumstances, tourism hold great potential lift fiji’s growth rate. the tourism development plan set target 1 million visitor 2016. we aim raise visitor arrival threefold next three years. the industry government develop clear strategy make happen. it encourage see three new airline start operation fiji since december 2009, air pacific add hong kong list destinations. this link fiji new market boost future visitor arrivals. let touch briefly government finances. fiji experience chronic budget deficit past two decades. the proportion capital expenditure total government expenditure low. on hand, operate expenditure continue balloon years. in 2009, proportion operate expenditure total government expenditure 80 percent. the major driver rise operate expenditure personnel costs. personnel cost percent operate expenditure quite high 43.5 percent 1990–1999 period rise 49.5 percent 2000–2009 period. it encourage see government take number initiative reduce size civil service thus reduce government’s operate expenditure. a result continuous fiscal deficits, government debt rise last two decades. currently, stand around 52 percent gdp. for fiji estimate sustainable level around 45 percent gdp. lady gentlemen, fiscal discipline critical sustainable economic growth. if government continue run large deficit debt level increase, crowd private sector statutory body borrow domestic market thus put pressure interest rates. chronic fiscal deficit also tend seriously undermine bop case fiji last two decade so. it therefore important government budget deficit keep check reign well 3 percent medium term. i would suggest future government consider legislate fiscal responsibility act future government squander government finance run irresponsible fiscal policies. we please see despite enormous pressure government revenue recent years, due contract economy, government keep reasonably tight reign government expenditure. this discipline must continue do reign non-essential expenditures. lady gentlemen, i wish highlight importance keep contingent liability government control. the government’s contingent liability grow substantially past several years. total contingent liability government 2009 around $1.7 billion, equivalent 26.5 percent gdp. this level contingent liability extremely high give weak revenue base government. this trend must stop without government really know really go institution whose debt government guaranteed, suddenly government face contingent liability come government’s book thus, seriously compromise government’s finances. bi review 86/2010 7 there number instance past government step bail guarantees. one well know case national bank fiji (nbf). the collapse nbf cost taxpayer country around $372 million total. in recent times, government convert nearly $40 million house authority debt equity house authority position meet debt commitments. there sign institution whose debt government guarantee may position meet obligations. this situation must allow continue. government must carry proper due diligence statutory corporation seek government guarantees. if organisation properly manage run, government must put condition guarantee give future proper reform do make institution financially viable borrow strength market. there huge moral hazard problem here. the board management statutory body take grant government bail get difficulties. so, fail take timely corrective action reform institution charge of. lady gentlemen, number people comment us$150 million bond issue government september 2006 due repayment september 2011. their concern, rightly so, whether capability repay loan. i would like reassure government rbf actively explore possibility meet repayment fiji usual meet foreign obligation whatever takes. lady gentlemen, economic challenge face, raise growth? basically, need raise investment exports, improve business conditions, accelerate reforms, raise productivity diversify economy. we need raise investment fiji 25 percent gdp current level 13 percent. while local investment, sufficient. hence need attract foreign investment shore entail improve investor environment. we need implement policy improve state infrastructure, improve productivity level low cost business fiji. improve infrastructure extremely important facilitate economic growth. fiji’s infrastructure suffer neglect investment past. government take step address infrastructure issues. recently, government successfully secure exim bank (malaysia) loan $40 million road upgrade project. in addition, government allocate around $60 million water sewerage scheme various district suva/nausori water sewerage scheme worth $30 million alone. another $9.5 million set aside maintenance government properties/buildings, include hospitals, police station government quarters. government also actively work chinese government loan improve road infrastructure projects. the loan house authority chinese government timely provide much need low cost housing. lady gentlemen, reliance preferential access thing past, must stand feet. we live world competition many country low cost structure high productivity. therefore, unless raise productivity business smart way, able compete successfully rest world. the main test industry improve productivity compete global scene – easy way them. in regard, let touch important reform critically need unlock growth potential fiji. for one reason other, much need reform 8 bi review 86/2010 successfully implement past. government recently announce major reform agenda, know economic reform programme 2010–2014. these reform include:  good governance (constitutional, parliamentary electoral reforms)  civil service  public sector (fsc, fea, fhcl, lta, govt shipping, national road safety council, etc.)  financial sector (fnpf)  availability utilisation land  price control i confident successful completion reform create efficiencies, improve productivity competitiveness improve business investor confidence fiji. hopefully various reforms, cost ease business greatly improve. also, structural reform critical ensure fiscal sustainability, stimulate growth help reduce poverty levels. specifically, government’s plan right-sizing well corporatizing, privatize outsource non-core service area vital end. price liberalization also critical ensure right price signal given, support process structural adjustment. 3. summary in summary, current economic condition show recover global economy, although uneven rate amongst advance economies. strong growth asian economy drive global growth. against background, domestic economy expect pick up, albeit weakly. while foreign reserve stable inflation peaked, concern risk remain. on external front, high oil price would place downside risk inflation outlook balance payments. ensure macroeconomic stability vital achieve sustainable growth target 5 percent. a consistent set policy need ensure stage set economy grow sustainably future. essentially, need supportive fiscal monetary policy ensure stable macroeconomic environment, structural adjustment successful. a aware, reserve bank continue implement policy change ensure sufficient liquidity bank system times, foreign reserve inflation target threatened. this entail recent change interest rate implementation new monetary policy framework. however, consider limit scope monetary policy has, extremely critical fiscal policy forefront meet challenge i outlined. the government show great commitment towards fiscal consolidation; however, need speed progress structural reforms, specifically key sector drive economic growth. with measures, lady gentlemen, i believe set place framework would allow economy grow sustainable basis future. thank much. bi review 86/2010 1 k c chakrabarty:

initiative bring financial inclusion. what require business model delivery model. with view, rbi advise bank formulate board approve financial inclusion plan next three years. all bank draw financial inclusion plan engage active discussion bank plans. through approach, put financial inclusion campaign mission mode. base assessment learning, advise review revise plans. our broad approach achieve planned, sustain structure financial inclusion under: technology: seamless integration front-end back-end 7. first, transformational role technology need emphasised. financial deepen take bank people. we speak last four decade post nationalization; fail see current coverage barely 32,000 rural commercial bank branches. scalable financial inclusion cannot happen without stable reliable information communication technology (ict). not bank branch also branch regional rural bank’s must also core bank solution (cbs), without would possible scale financial inclusion efforts. the transaction hand hold front end-devices seamlessly integrate banks’ main server. these device must capable transact four minimum product mention subsequent paragraph. there provision smart card integration uid number aadhaar project. bank services: need increase bouquet product 8. second, enough open no frill account (nfa) maintain bank service available. de minimus, four bank product need provide qualify availability bank services. these are: a. a save cum overdraft account b. a pure save product ideally recur variable recur deposit c. a remittance product ebt remittance d. entrepreneurial credit gcc,

emergency, weddings, funerals, etc. press need immediate gratification. they need make aware meet emergency credit needs, overdraft facility exist avail require. this would bring bank transact enable bank sell product apart make entire exercise viable. for those, wish save, pure save product like recur variable recur deposit product could offered. a remittance product facilitate ebt remittance also offered. for entrepreneurial credit, product gcc, kcc, etc. could offered. this minimum set product need offered. beyond this, bank free provide product insurance, mutual funds, etc. per assessment capability. bi review 86/2010 3 coverage: need transparency 9. third, issue coverage. so far, even customer remote village come open account bank branch city, city branch include remote

population le 2000 population. the plan need cover integrate manner category villages. the name bc/branch cover particular village need indicate bank website. financial inclusion plan: integrate banks’ business plan 10. fourth, financial inclusion plan must integrate normal business plan banks. we believe bank poor viable business opportunity cost benefit exercise need attempt bank make financial inclusion congruent business models. bank must view financial inclusion huge business opportunity perfect delivery models. operational issues: need intermediate structure 11. fifth, bank need examine operational issue relate bc model cash handling. they need evaluate whether intermediate brick mortar structure require base bank branch bcs effective supervision bcs. this structure, man banks’ skeletal staff safe bcs deposit cash, cbs terminal passbook print facility. over period time, morph full fledge satellite branch bank urban financial inclusion: lose sight 12. sixth, financial inclusion sometimes erroneously treat synonymous rural poverty. concern urban poverty also need factor need various group rickshaw pullers, construction workers, migrant workers, etc. must factor product service craft per need bank system address urban financial inclusion. monitoring: need structure approach 13. seventh, would closely monitor progress make bank per financial inclusion plans. a structure report format make available meaningful compilation analysis data. the bank need similar structure data compilation exercise state/district level facilitate monitor district/state/bank level. a structure approach ensure time outcome financial inclusion effort different meet fate previous ones. other issue 14. let reiterate financial inclusion mere state benefit transfers. loan must extend save borrow habit need inculcate among poor. poor require cheap credit prompt credit. it anomaly press pay exorbitant rate interest money lender, mainstream financial institution still shy lend them. in ultimate analysis, financial inclusion driver economic growth poverty alleviation. 4 bi review 86/2010 15. inclusive financial sector development make two complementary contribution poverty alleviation: financial sector development driver economic growth indirectly reduce poverty inequality; appropriate, affordable, financial service poor people. critical effort secure sustain economic growth expansion last mile access finance. thus financial inclusion long policy choice policy compulsion. in bank base model, customer direct contractual relationship bank similar prudentially regulate supervise financial institution – basic bank account, save account, save cum overdraft account, transaction account, loan, combination – even though customer may deal exclusively staff one retail agent hire conduct transaction bank’s behalf. in non-bank base model contractual relationship non-bank service provider mobile network operator issuer stored-value payment instruments. customer exchange cash retail agent return electronic record value. this virtual account store service provider’s server. nevertheless, although contractual relationship directly bank customer, bank always involved, example potentially safe liquid place nonbank provider hold float .our model india bank lead model way able address consumer protection issue paramount concern give nature vulnerable clientele deal with. here, financial capability build financial literacy education also assume great importance. we mandate set financial literacy credit counsel centre expect go long way ameliorate lot customer although understand first provide financial access. 16. finally, let stress currently market paradigm financial inclusion bank-led model. it thus bank rise challenge meet full measure. what mean access finance exclude access formal financial system; word necessary caution banks; paradigm financial inclusion ultimately one continue relevance bank sector actor wait anxiously wing wait go ahead. 17. india good it talent also financial sector talent hence experiment bring ict base financial inclusion relevant india entire globe success experiment replicate elsewhere. entire world look development keen interest. we need meet expectations. 18. we broad base government-central bank commitment financial inclusion help alleviate poverty. our aim help create enable policy regulatory

thomas jordan, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 17 june 2010. * * * introduction a year ago, financial system still extremely fragile state. crisis management centre efforts. yet even then, emphasise urgent need alleviate “too big fail” issue. much happen since time. the financial sector, hit hard crisis, recover considerably, national international level, politicians, supervisory authority central bank work intensively ease “too big fail” issue. the goal clear: future, public taxpayer shoulder responsibility rescue banks. base late financial stability report, i would like review first situation bank sector, second, next step resolve “too big fail” issue. condition swiss bank sector condition swiss bank sector improved. follow catastrophic 2008, situation ubs stabilise course last year. with regard credit suisse, even possible speak return normal. large-scale support measure deploy government central bank play essential role ensure global economy, financial market thus also bank recover sooner vigorously anticipate year ago. for bank sector alone, major industrial nation commit fund amount almost 20% gross domestic product. a result different measure support economy bank sector, considerable rise indebtedness many countries, also, countries, sovereign credit risk. the international big bank – include swiss big bank – benefit substantially support measures, able increase profitability 2009. at time, swiss big bank reduce balance sheet approximately quarter. compare previous year, capital situation improve substantially. their risk-weighted capital ratios, particular, increase markedly, high also international standards. this positive development. however, allow conceal fact leverage big bank still high – per se compare bank countries. the big bank still long way meet leverage target apply switzerland 2013. with mind, strengthen capital situation – conjunction – realignment business model order achieve sustainable profitability, still central challenge face big banks. the profitability capital situation bank domestic business focus – cantonal, regional raiffeisen bank – significantly high 2009 long-term average. the dip gdp mid-2008 mid-2009 far barely effect banks, result provision requirement credit risk continue low level 2009. nevertheless, estimation, position bank category le comfortable may appear first glance. first all, capital situation raiffeisen bank state-guaranteed cantonal bank need put perspective: raiffeisen bank count additional fund obligation require member 2 bi review 85/2010 cooperative capital end 2011, cantonal bank entitle reduction require capital due state guarantee. in absence concessions, capital ratio – particularly raiffeisen bank – would markedly lower. second, accord assessment, risk exposure domestically focus bank high 2009. for one thing, interest rate risk cantonal raiffeisen bank historically high levels. for another, sharp increase loan volume – especially mortgage – backdrop persistent economic uncertainty substantial rise real estate price point high credit risk. in addition, first mortgage residential properties, bank require le capital back basel ii basel i – 2007 (i.e. basel i), mortgage back 4.0% capital; since (i.e. basel ii), figure 2.8%. this give bank incentive grant mortgages, also enable reduce capital buff use absorb loan losses. in view increase interest rate credit risk, urge domestically focus bank prudent. they must prepare interest rate rise. besides direct effect interest rate margin, particular attention also need give indirect effect interest rate increase, namely loan grant without sufficient attention pay borrowers’ financial situations, rise interest rate inevitably result high loan losses. a i mentioned, domestically focus bank well capitalise historical standards. but view risk uncertainty, also need maintain large capital buffer. the jump domestic mortgage lend property price environment historically low interest rate prompt u first quarter year conduct survey among major bank swiss mortgage industry. we must forget lesson learn previous crises. the property bubble 1990s, dire consequence swiss bank sector, also recent example – sub-prime crisis – serve remind u adverse development mortgage market threaten stability bank system, thus deserve swiss national bank’s (snb) full attention. the result survey give cause sound all-clear. these may show relaxation internal lend standard bank 2005 2009, bank significant overall market share standard lack conservatism. more banks, instance, determine affordability mortgage loan base interest rate historically low level. in addition, base statement make survey participants, practice, deviation internal lend standard occur frequently: bank market share almost 25% report “exceptions policy” 20% new mortgage loan grant 2009. furthermore, bank provide incomplete data actual lend practices. this could sign bank inadequately inform risk mortgage portfolios. the snb treat issue high priority, continue monitor mortgage market carefully. we analyse risk great detail – close cooperation finma bank – examine whether need action. in case, caution exercise lending. when assess affordability, must take account interest rate are, historical standards, exceptionally low. it essential loan-to-value ratio set conservatively, especially region property type see price rise sharply recent years. outlook we expect global economy continue recover year. this recovery, however, fragile, base largely support measure deploy government central banks. uncertainty still above-average level. downside risk go recent month due finance difficulty face bi review 85/2010 3 european countries. urgently need cost-cutting measure rise risk premia could jeopardise recovery trigger another lengthy period high credit default rates, even renew turbulence financial markets. a development kind would present swiss bank sector serious challenge: besides economic slowdown slump financial markets, destabilise influence could spread problem throughout global bank system. thus indirect risk pose serious threat swiss banks, even direct risk – measure direct claim country particularly affect – moderate. in climate, seem inappropriate u bank increase appetite risk. reform regulatory framework / “too big fail” a year ago, emphasise urgency alleviate “too big fail” issue. where stand today? allow state clearly right now: “too big fail” issue resolve itself. last year, big bank significantly reduce balance sheet – move explicitly welcome snb. the “too big rescued” issue thus also recede somewhat. however, hardly alleviation “too big fail” issue. big bank liabilities, end 2008 still almost six time swiss gdp, reduce end 2009 four time gdp. nevertheless, big banks’ share market relevant swiss economy – hence systemic importance – remain high before: big bank grant third domestic loan hold third domestic deposits. in words, switzerland still vulnerable, need action remain great. this opinion share commission expert appoint federal council “limiting economic risk pose large companies”, i vice chairman. it commission’s assessment current form size, big bank clearly systemically important. the commission expert publish interim report end april. the “too big fail” issue address package key measure encompass special requirement systemically important bank area capital, liquidity organisational structure. these key measure compatible approach discuss financial stability board. besides propose commission experts, measure consider international level include breaking-up big banks, prohibition certain activity proprietary trading, taxation balance sheet transactions. the snb fully support proposal put forward commission expert date. the overall direction correct. what important detail measures. our position clear. it essential capital requirement significantly increase rise line degree systemic importance bank. this way ensure bank internalise risk which, now, able pas general public, extent. moreover, progressive capital requirement create incentive bank reduce systemic

considerable complexity cross-border activity big banks. it must credible robust – operationally legally. an unworkable approach area could fatal consequence next crisis. the snb continue push hard genuine alleviation “too big fail” issue. we confident bank commission expert continue cooperate constructively achieve solution. we aware that, big banks, regulatory measure discuss associate costs. however, first all, cost primarily reflection fact subsidy form de facto “too big fail” guarantee reduced. yet since cost taxpayer reduce extent, constitute cost economy whole. and second, alternative measures, prohibition business activities, would associate considerably high cost banks. in addition, convince that, long term, big bank also benefit stringent regulatory requirements. the recent crisis show stable financial system basic prerequisite long-term competitiveness financial centre. this particularly true wealth management, important line business swiss banks. consequently, appropriate solution “too big fail” issue switzerland could strengthen bank system long term ensure well place strategically. bi review 85/2010 1 njuguna ndung’u: nakuru financial actor upcoming currency centre keynote speech prof njuguna ndung’u, governor central bank kenya, nakuru business association, nakuru, 11 june 2010. * * * hon. lee kinyanjui, assistant minister road mp nakuru town;

business association meeting. i today i extremely impress area interest businessmen woman nakuru i ask address. this quite timely support business community give minister finance budget presentation yesterday. nakuru centrally locate kenya potential achieve high growth rate town base locational advantage. i ask talk today broadly two topical issues; nakuru financial actor upcoming currency centre nakuru, contribute ease business. but i want pick important addition budget policy read yesterday. lady gentlemen: under vision 2030, kenya aspire become international financial hub. in regard, i aware effort currently underway towards realisation objective. on note, may high time consider establish small financial enclave within kenya build towards aspire international status. we know expand city town increase productivity growth overall hinterland growth. a result, think nakuru business association make nakuru financially vibrant town misplaced. what need concretize idea plan course draw vision 2030, expand city provide diversify economy. to assist line, necessary know prerequisite strong financial town are; several factor cite prerequisites, however, paramount prerequisite include:  financial infrastructure: banks, insurance, brokerage firms, outlets, agent etc;  adequate human resource skill flexible labour market;  a transparent effective regulatory framework;  a critical mass vertically integrate financial institution one location operate conducive business environment;  observe rule game. a nakuru aspire become vibrant financial town, need ass whether prerequisite indicate exist step need take put place. all prerequisite put place unity purpose among stakeholders. 2 bi review 85/2010 lady gentlemen: the linkage form business bank need overemphasized. business bank complement other. the banks’ role financial intermediation take place various forms. a bank allocate resource (mainly deposits), focus productive sector economy whose potential default minimal. this demonstrate fact economic growth achieve efficient resource mobilization allocation economy. bank bestow ability undertake function. they collate save deposit micro-savers investors. they allow access finance customer accumulate capital save affordable credit. however, resource mobilization allocation end themselves. economic growth realise business efficiently utilise resource towards desire results. the financial sector therefore place encourage cycle save investment. credit risk decline witness decline non-performing loan banks. we need take advantage this. over last ten years, trend drastically change continue drop level non-performing loan high 38 percent gross advance 2002 7 percent march 2010. this indication improve resource management kenyan business perhaps efficiency screen monitor role bank invest in. lady gentlemen: over last 5 years, kenya witness significant growth outreach kenyan banks. the number bank branch increase 534 2005 996 2009; growth 87 percent. the increase mainly attribute intense competition among bank desire venture new territory deem unsaturated. bank also see benefit bank unbanked remove barrier entry. nakuru greatly benefit expansion. over period, number bank branch nakuru increase 18 2006 27 2009 even hinterland. this increase explain prevail business potential nakuru town environs. the increase number bank nakuru line central bank’s desire promote financial inclusion. a per financial access survey june 2009, 23 percent kenyan population age 18 year banked. this state affair acceptable expect level increase significantly year 2012 give various effort central bank partner put in. these include:  the license deposit take microfinance institutions, whose focus low end market, concentrate rural peri-urban areas.  the license credit reference bureaus, provide opportunity individual business rely information capital alternative form collateral unlike traditional physical collateral, secure credit facility banks.  approval bank engage third party provide certain bank services. we believe increase outreach bank corner country.  flexible space bank roll incentivised product use available technological platforms.  currency centre reduce cost business. lady gentlemen: the increase number bank nakuru indication town process develop requisite infrastructure necessary support activity banks. bank probably attract nakuru uniqueness agricultural, tourism industrial town. institution high learn also leave behind realize potential nakuru create adequate employment bi review 85/2010 3 opportunity graduates. partnership business institution learn one sure way develop relevant professional contribute town’s growth. nakuru thus ready vibrant business centre serve hinterland. lady gentlemen: allow move second point upcoming currency centre nakuru. the cash base nature economy cannot overemphasized. the central bank therefore review currency management mechanism ensure availability “clean money” reasonable cost kenyans. the bank, conjunction kenya banker association (kba) embark establishment currency centres. these centre expect reduce operational cost incur bank move cash exist central bank branches. this move also expect support provision “clean” note coin kenyan across country. in conjunction kba, cbk identify nyeri, meru nakuru appropriate town pilot currency centres. the nyeri currency centre already operational progress towards establish nakuru currency centre advance stages. we expect nakuru currency centre commence operation end july 2010. this centre house kcb. besides benefit nakuru resident get clean note coins, expect cost save bank low transportation cost translate better, cost effective efficient service customers. i must emphasize centre joint partnership central bank commercial bank via kba. the centre therefore confuse central bank’s operate branches. in case currency centers, commercial bank provide physical infrastructure cbk provide necessary human technical support necessary. in long run, cbk leave currency distribution handle commercial banks. finally, let touch three issue feature budget i think critical discussion today:  the revamp investment infrastructure – complement private investment – public investment reduce cost business – residue binge constraint  empower youth secure future  sme support revolve fund operate bank 1 5 basis: is, minimum revolve fund operate “for 1 shill government brings, bank contribute 5 shillings” lady gentlemen: a i wind remarks, i urge business nakuru take advantage current trend fall interest rate fully exploit potential businesses. the capacity kenyan bank extend credit type business increase follow increase statutory minimum core capital ksh.250 million ksh.1 billion. the increase take effect 1st january 2009 progressively increase ksh.1 billion 31st december 2012. the increase inform increase demand fund bank beyond could accommodate base capital levels. i also take opportunity urge exercise right engage banks. you must demand charge fair interest rate commensurate business risk profile investment proposals. this way succeed 4 bi review 85/2010 reduce cost credit also grow business. there opportune moment business include bank realise success sweet player prosper success beget success. with remarks, lady gentlemen, remain wish businessmen woman nakuru success endeavour towards prosperity businesses. success business directly contribute towards desire economic growth become middle income country envisage vision 2030. thank god bless all. bi review 85/2010 1 benny

guinea fully utilize papua new guinean use opportunity development liquefy natural gas (lng) project offering. today, presentation on: 1. the lesson learn history economic management; 2. current state economy; 3. what development prospect construction operation lng project?; 4. what do ensure time around achieve development objectives? 1. the lesson learn history economic management a know, history good teacher will learn it. the government’s expansionary fiscal policy reliance monetary policy debt management, period outbreak bougainville conflict 1989 1999 result best define “lost decade”. instead take full advantage substantial income flow mineral development invest improve social area health, education, physical infrastructure maintenance construction roads, airstrips, sea river port open rural area markets, law order resource squander wasted. in early 90’s misguide policy government day reduce tax increase recurrent expenditure, time country major, costly arm conflict, result loss public confidence, run kina state insolvency loose foreign exchange reserves. 2 bi review 85/2010 in june 1995 organic law provincial local level government passed, shift fiscal operation government centralize decentralize model. while well-intended, change place demand strain resource national government. the transfer fund national government provincial local level government aim fund transfer functions, health, education, law order infrastructure. while fund transfer function stay national government leave unfunded. not surprise result social indicator worsen infrastructure country deteriorated. in part country become unusable. look number “lost decade” strong growth 1991 1993 period, rest period 1999 annual decline growth negative 1.1% per annum. the result whole period 1989 1999, period papua new guinea’s large mineral development take place, per caput growth gdp negative 1.6%. the period 2000 2006 define period consolidation restoration responsible macroeconomic management. fiscal responsibility reestablished. the understand increase public debt place unsustainable burden national purse accept policy makers. even so, need close cooperation coordination fiscal operation government level monetary policy management, sole responsibility independent central bank clearly state prime objective price stability, necessary condition long term broad base economic development growth. the annual growth gdp 2.62% annual population growth rate 2.83%, per caput growth gdp negative 0.0021% per annum. it within range statistical error, therefore zero. this still poor performance improvement 1990s. it last three years, 2007 2009, overall growth gdp 21.5% per annum growth 6.6% per caput growth rate 3.77% per annum. the conclusion clear. in thirty four year independence, fail overall objective increase standard live well-being great majority people. the statistical information show whole period per caput income decline around 4% social indicator indicate dismal performance, two period strong gdp growth, first mineral boom 1991 1993 drive construction increase volume export misima, porgera kutubu second 2006 2009 drive unprecedented price increase oil, copper gold. 2. current state economy papua new guinea has, last 7 years, blip 2009, benefit significantly export commodity price boom result fiscal surpluses, record international reserve levels, reduce total public debt sustain real gdp growth. the financial sector reform, commence 2000, contribute sound prudently manage financial system aid economic growth. the sound prudent management financial institution reflect high capital adequacy ratios, liquid bank system, low level non-performing loans, fund loan bank system deposit rather borrow overseas. the central bank authorize financial institution also remain highly profitable. a testament sound financial system economy withstand global financial crisis. through good management financial institution le exposure trouble market institution abroad. prudent monetary fiscal policy 2003 2009, exception 2008, coordinate approach management also contribute stable exchange rate bi review 85/2010 3 price stability (low inflation single digits) improve confidence domestic economy. together low interest rate environment, lead significant increase lend private sector, growth 30–40 percent period. the removal foreign exchange controls, particularly lend non resident company also support strong growth. we still second boom blip 2008, result global financial crisis follow depression develop country that, lead economic problem around world. price stability achieve maintain 2004 2009, exception 2008 first half 2009, due high international food fuel prices, beyond png’s control. there also prudent fiscal management period, except 2008. while early judge outcome, point toward improvement mainly formal structures. the government medium term development strategy document 2005–2010, yet updated, medium term fiscal strategy document 2008–2012, enact fiscal responsibility act 2006, formulate development strategic plan 2010–2030, papua new guinea vision 2050. these serve framework clearly define objective, assume be, broad base economic growth measure gdp, underpin great participation benefit rural people. 3. what development prospect construction operation lng project? the development prospect lng project look upon two stage – construction operation (production). a. the construction stage the construction stage last three four years, end 2013 even 2014. the size project total expenditure us$ 15 us$ 16 billion huge standards. just give general measures, expenditure 1.8 time estimate nominal gdp papua new guinea. it far beyond country experience past mineral development magnitude least i don’t know precedent country. if assume construction last four years, every year developer spend equivalent 45% 2009 nominal gdp. a large portion expenditure import good services, pay fund hold shore while, good service purchase shore, fund bring shore. the size project couple strong impact domestic economic activity facilitate activity sector economy food production agriculture, manufacturing, build construction, transportation. those act lng project pay developer convert foreign exchange kina, effect appreciate kina. the increase import accommodate increase economic activity sector effect depreciate kina. these opposite effect could balance result stable kina exchange rate. but depend magnitude flow side. even reserve might decline result import sector project development, marginal. the bank papua new guinea sufficient reserve ensure minimal impact exchange rate inflation. while expect strong growth economic activity construction phase, high demand good service inflationary effect. to ensure economic growth inflation high, government follow clearly design policies. 4 bi review 85/2010 the developer construct huge infrastructure corridor southern highland port moresby. they construct roads, pipeline, bring electricity, telecommunication, meet social-community commitment village corridor pass through. the country’s production capacity use far beyond availability. the government therefore advise undertake major infrastructure development project construction year project increase general expenditure. it instead concentrate effort maintain improve exist infrastructure deteriorate area unusable state. the add advantage resource government concentrate priority area education, health, conservation environment law order. in three four year government undertake full detail review development agenda. all sacred cow slaughtered. 1. it visit decentralization government responsibility review organic law provincial local level government streamline channel fund mechanism rural areas; 2. it clearly define government do. what fully privatized, do public, private partnership, function role abolish enhancement efficiency service delivery; 3. it set clearly define target social indicator health, education, law order conservation environment; 4. it prioritize infrastructure project implement resource use developer become available construction phase ends. the government work detail plan highly skilled local contractor work lng infrastructure, follow completion construction stage, use resource elsewhere. this ensure crowd private sector benefit use highly qualify contractor workforce, implement long term infrastructure development framework become reality. we bank papua new guinea also work several matter construction phase project. these are: 1. the development implementation national payment system gear toward deal instrument fully develop country payment mechanism use today’s world; 2. ensure financial service available people “unbanked population” wherever are, develop microfinance industry rural bank facility bank financial institution operate country, telephone, include mobile phone internet banking; 3. enhance competition bank finance industry license new foreign exchange dealer fifl, license micro bank two new one recently license post png international remittances; 4. expand bank service product offer bank domestic foreign exchange markets; 5. create competitive environment ensure people enjoy best low cost services, stable prudently manage bank system offer. i move last part address. bi review 85/2010 5 4. what do ensure time around achieve development objectives? b. the production operation stage lng project a i already say three year 2006 2009 papua new guinea enjoy second mineral boom drive high gold, copper oil prices. the government learn lesson failure first boom 1990’s take measure repeat mistakes. it decide use excess revenue repay domestic shore debt. this equivalent future generation fund. reduce debt today reduce burden future generation debt become due. it also decide place excess revenue trust account use stabilization fund. this decision flaws, first use fund tightly control regulate law. the second fund deposit commercial bank low interest rate, bank papua new guinea defuse ensure excess liquidity result high inflation, use central bank bill (cbb’s), much high interest rate cost benefit commercial banks. just give indication magnitude cost government people, interest rate pay trust account commercial bank bellow 1%, cbb’s place 5% higher, year come 4%. the amount large, peak trust account reach close k4.6 billion cbb’s issue k4 billion. every one u see costly government people papua new guinea. the third problem trust account aim spend development project still limit implementation capacity, result non-efficient use fund case fund misused. the fourth last issue i want point trust account offer stabilization potential. they could draw revenue decline. when come test sharp decline commodity price 2008, work. the government incur relatively large deficit k 479 million, expect inflationary impact result two digit level inflation 11.2%. the generally accept paradigm government bank papua new guinea that, responsible fiscal management, aim balance budget, bad case low deficit, complementary monetary management main objective price stability, define low inflation levels, necessary condition long term, sustainable economic growth. if properly done, benefit great majority population, live rural areas. for bank’s part, realize first lng project likelihood lng projects, economy enter new era economic growth. in formulation conduct monetary policy bank carefully ass evaluate trade-off high economic growth inflation discourage domestic economic activity ensure inflation spiral control. it encourage national executive council (nec) decide set joint work group senior staff department treasury bank papua new guinea ass evaluate applicability sovereign wealth fund model, prepare country toward time lng project move operation stage production export. all expectation lng project move operation stage, country benefit large taxation, dividend, royalty incomes. it outmost importance mistake late 1980’s 1990’s repeated. the work group consult stake holder get best available advice, domestic international experts, come best structure know present deal large foreign exchange inflows. 6 bi review 85/2010 the last thing preempt work group’s deliberation recommendations. the whole nation strong interest lot stake want ensure come best possible solution two subject deal with; stabilization fiscal operation government save future generations, project immense size importance future wellbeing nation. the government close cooperation consultation economic sector civil society, time carefully formulate, design implementation tool mechanism development strategy plans, ensure commence era high economic activity growth nation’s future generations. thank you. bi review 84/2010 1 christian noyer: sovereign crisis, risk contagion response central bank speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france chairman board director bank international settlements, global interdependence centre (gic) conferences, paris, 17 june 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, i much honor open second session conference paris i would like thank global interdependence centre banque de france partner full week conference. i give point view central banker recent event sovereign markets, major imply risk challenge financial stability recovery process. finally, i briefly touch late action central bank public authority contain renew tensions. i confident open address give rise valuable discussion panel distinguish speaker express view different perspectives: central banks, rat agencies, investor academia. sovereign crisis: origin dynamic the sovereign debt turmoil recent episode crisis start two year ago yet. some european state late actor protract debt crisis i) u subprime mortgage borrowers, ii) financial institution weak fund situation iii) non financial company household unable finance capital needs. it remind us, need be, crisis management always difficult potentially long last task. time key dimension fix economic financial systems, turn create condition self sustain recoveries. in couple weeks, greece epicenter phenomenon doubt ability government honor billion debt mature 2010 become widespread. the lack market confidence translate spectacular increase government bond yields. while extreme situation largely limit one member state, magnitude price movement sign contagion sovereign lead market participant fully reassess global sovereign risks. in global reassessment process even le vulnerable country broadly suddenly impact spread widen rapidly reach sometimes unprecedented levels. the issue stake certainly refute weakness certain fiscal positions. in fact i, many ecb govern council member alike regularly call policy maker pay due attention debt dynamics. what peculiar intensity contagion member state segment financial markets. some observer voice concern specific mechanism play, highlight potential destabilize role speculation call decisive policy action curb consequences. i come back issue late on. look root country weaknesses, financial crisis play pivotal role. of course, structural fiscal deficit certain country already sizeable crisis occur crisis trigger huge deterioration public finance situations: first via mechanism automatic stabilizer result rapidly decline fiscal receipt due global synchronize recession; second imbalance public account aggravate great public spend via unprecedented fiscal stimulus 2 bi review 84/2010 plan also large public financial commitments, particular via capital injection bank sector debt guarantee schemes. public intervention massive contain scale turmoil return imply cost lead transfer risk bank sector onto public sector balance sheet. for instance, intervention european government amount 1800 billion eur 14% european gdp. the potential contagion channel april-may european crisis what reason behind strong unambiguous public authorities’ response april-may crisis? a already show previous stage financial crisis, strong prompt public action need prevent contagion undesirable second round effects. in respect, properly handle sovereign debt crisis absolutely necessary, l shock sovereign debt market profoundly affect financial markets, bank system thus, real economy. let elaborate contagion channels. 1) consider theoretically risk-free securities, government bond usually consider floor rate constitute benchmark price almost securities. thus, rise sovereign yield mechanically shift fund cost upwards private agents. interest rate government bond usually include small premia compensate liquidity credit risk. for proper monetary policy transmission, risk premia reach level volatility signal key policy rate long perceivable long reach real economy. in recent months, tension rapidly spread market point jeopardize transmission monetary policy, european government bond market become largely dysfunctional. 2) the second contagion mechanism go bank system. on liability side, bank already suffer increase government debt issuance crowd effect contribute steepen yield curve; real issue bank debt mature next three year significant government support central bank facility expect gradually removed. in tense context, sovereign debt crisis trigger increase fund tension european bank owe contagion sovereign bank spreads. it reflect traditional belief domestic financial institution cannot le risky sovereign suppose back case need. over past seven months, fact confirm increasingly strong correlation bank cd country located. it area concern bank especially case rapid abrupt evolution. a surge cost fund therefore damage bank profitability ability grant credits. short-term fund may also cause concern bank multiple sovereign downgrade lower, either decrease market price increase haircuts, value government security use collateralize refinancing. on asset side, bank expose abrupt drop sovereign debt price mark-to-market loss sometimes large trade portfolio government bond detain liquidity buffer. in addition, bank active cd net protection seller also expose mark-to-market loss real loss case debt restructuration constitute credit event trigger cds. these loss could erode capital base bank time risk weight assets, base credit rat levels, increases. the two factor push capital ratio reduce potential lend economy. it bring u third contagion channel. bi review 84/2010 3 3) lastly, economic channel likely play significant role via fiscal adjustment necessary repair public finance restore credibility country financial markets. the increase public investment spend mainly contribute economic growth last semesters; drop could weigh recovery even calibration path fiscal adjustment suppose fine-tune allow sustainable fiscal consolidation without challenge long-lasting economic recovery. strong unambiguous response european government eurosystem in context, role central bank public authority crucial restore confidence ensure proper function financial markets. draw lesson learn financial crisis 2008–09, european government eurosystem therefore rapidly resort strong, unprecedented sizeable action contain tension prevent spill real economy. we could briefly mention action head state central banks. government action help contain pressure 1) i first welcome commitment many european country strengthen fiscal position necessary step restore credibility government normalization sovereign bond markets. a recently point g20 finance minister central bank governors, recent event highlight importance sustainable public finance : country serious fiscal challenge need accelerate pace fiscal consolidation; 2) secondly, announcement eur 110 billion financial aid package greece, agree european commission imf condition package substantial fiscal consolidation measure greece contribute alleviate concern markets. 3) thirdly, restore confidence whole euro area contain contagion, plan broad scope adopt euro area level, european financial stabilization facility, global amount 750 billion euro financial participation imf. one key feature facility possibility use short notice without involve national parliaments. finally, let focus recent action european central bank essential response challenge circumstances. central bank complement action specific innovate measure 1) after careful consideration implication option base positive assessment greek consolidation package , eurosystem decide suspend reference credit rat current market price collateral requirement marketable debt instrument issue guarantee greek government. this decision prove flexibility operational framework contribute maintain normal function monetary policy transmission mechanism mitigate strain interbank markets. it allow avoid strong potentially pro-cyclical threshold effect credit rat agency unilateral decisions. 2) then, launch security market programme (smp) 10th may mark new step eurosystem’s response financial crisis. this measure consist intervene euro area’s public private security secondary market ensure depth liquidity market affect severe disruptions. the objective program address malfunction 4 bi review 84/2010 security market restore appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. these intervention sterilize liquidity inject exactly drained, thus fully neutralize effect bank system. this historical exceptional type intervention stem spillover increase financial market volatility, liquidity risk market dislocations. 3) additionally, ecb reactivated, coordination central banks, temporary liquidity swap line feed resume u dollar liquidity provide operation order alleviate pressure fund dollar. the reactivation measure follow revival strain foreign exchange market highlight central role cooperation central bank take recent year order preserve cross-border operation financial stability global level. however measure remove near-term uncertainty, could prove insufficient provide last change negative sentiment investor medium-term budget deficit debt situation considerably improved. in context, european authority show strong level cooperation commitment global common solutions. any unilateral uncoordinated decision may notably prove le efficient may amplify market volatility. finally, removal vulnerability bank sector desirable alleviate uncertainties. effective risk management, transparency robust business model essential strengthen banks’ resilience shock ensure adequate fund real economy underpin sustainable growth financial stability. the effective timely implementation g20 policy orientation necessary build new international system solid stable ground. this notably case g 20 provision cd market credit rat agencies. one cannot deny certain otc derivative (cds instance) certain type transaction (short sales) likely exacerbate price movement create instability detrimental issuer investors. one may thus find tempt ban drastically limit type operation indeed observe national proposal go direction, include bank naked cds, naked short sale mandatory short time horizon settle transactions. i view measure may efficient and, worse, may counterproductive. they may efficient since security price form national context global markets. what would possible paris frankfurt could still allow london new york instance. they may also counterproductive since could deter activity away market onto others could significantly alter liquidity security aim restriction since foreign investor may shy away turn opportunities. let clear, though, mean nothing done. on contrary, i believe instead ban create incentive relocate certain activity elsewhere circumvent rules, preferable attract good supervise. this done: - first integrate otc market regulate supervise market infrastructure trade platforms, trade repository ccps. in case sovereign cd mean cd write euro area sovereign compensate ccp locate euro area. incidentally, require fair amount standardization single name cds. - second, enhance transparency, ex ante ex post improve understand price discovery mechanism knowledge actual net position financial institutions. bi review 84/2010 5 - finally, improve risk management agent active market ensure practice compatible risk profile. in case sovereign cds, issue necessarily buyer ultimately carry limit risk sellers. in fact probably need specific supervision credit protection sellers. regard credit rat agencies, agreement strengthen regulatory oversight become reality implementation agree european framework, give pivotal role european security market authority. at time need reduce dependency credit rat agency regulatory purposes, prudential regulation eligibility criterion central bank refinancing. ******************************** let conclude briefly. we still go challenge times. the european bank system seem recover partly thank central bank government policy support bank sector. this return profitability use comfort capital position firms, view various risk i rapidly discussed. recent renew strain financial market especially sovereign market subsequent impact bank sector show u crisis fully behind u central bank action necessary accompany redefinition bank sector, well-functioning market return self-sustainable recovery. so far, measure take eurosystem stabilize market restore functioning, well establishment european financial stabilization facility, low tail contagion risks. but seed recent event address preserve financial stability long run. indeed, sizeable fiscal imbalance remain government accelerate fiscal consolidation ensure sustainability public finance meet condition conducive durable economic growth. in parallel, vulnerable financial institution remain over-reliant enhance credit government support tackle decisively. thank much attention. bi review 84/2010 1 josé de gregorio: macroeconomics, policymaking crisis keynote speech mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, bank finland bank italy conference challenge global crisis macroeconomic theory international finance, honour pentti kouri, helsinki, 11 june 2010. * * * i grateful useful discussion comment mariana garcía pablo garcía. it honor participate tribute pentti kouri. i pleasure close him, i know well work, also share thing common. we study mit international finance. we close rudi dornbusch. there group economist world, chile finland example, privilege work close him, student colleagues, enjoy unconditional friendship intellectual influence. in conference fortunate group. kouri dornbusch pathbreaking work explain exchange rate fluctuation movement asset prices. kouri’s paper always important reference course’s work. by time i student, late 80s, read kouri’s papers, successful investor live connecticut. i remember couple time rudi tell would visit great friend, economist successful investor get fund department. he succeeded, proof department pentti j.k. kouri career development associate professor economics. today, rather attempt elaborate kouri’s contribution, i think good opportunity address issue state macroeconomics policymaking, purpose conference, two aspect rudi pentti contribute lot. if u today, deep insight provocative ideas, regardless whether agree not, would certainly make u think. change world economy, macroeconomics, policymaking more 30 year kouri’s influential work, world change dramatically, economic theory policymaking, especially emerge market economies. there grow role market determination prices, particular interest rate exchange rates. there much great trade financial integration, source great interdependence cross economies, also source much great opportunity develop countries. finally, financial market much sophisticated, also source vulnerability opportunities. there also profound evolution macroeconomics. developments, rational expectation dynamic inconsistency, change view macroeconomic policy could achieve. they also basis discussion rule versus discretion, general preference conduct policy flexible rules, constrain discretion. the possibility expectational inefficiency also become important insight policies. contagion, self-fulfilling prophecies, coordination failure multiple equilibria, phenomenon market inefficiency arise, many example real world. however, one careful failure bad policy attribute phenomenon outside control authorities. many crisis may want classify bad-expectational equilibrium simply result bad policies. indeed, crisis strike country without associate fundamental problem. what 2 bi review 84/2010 expectational inefficiency amplify probability occurrence cost crises. other important development understand policymaking, particular monetary policy, rule rather change policy variable without reason. thus, rather think change policy variables, realistic think change determinant policies. finally, learn credibility central effectiveness policies. all development also lead change way monetary policy conducted. however, important caveat made. there two-way relationship theory policy developments. it would presumptuous argue theory change policies. indeed, development inflation target come seriously discuss academic circles. new zealand implement inflation target regime early 1990s, main analytical development take place. along line, taylor rule was, obviously, use john taylor estimate it. regardless causality, monetary policy central bank change significantly. the movement toward grant central bank independence around world positive one. of course, come challenge central banker demonstrate really good thing, something certainly question country recent crisis. although central bank create address problem bank sector, time, objective move general aspect economic development growth. then, since 1980s, success great moderation, central bank increasingly, rightly so, focus price stability. unfortunately, financial stability, another issue core central banking, overlooked. monetary policy abandon money supply exchange rate nominal anchors, target directly inflation anchor nominal variable via inflationary expectations. to reinforce credibility gain legitimacy, communication become central conduct monetary policy. many challenge remain; particular incorporate financial stability goal policy making, evolution policy make enormous, particular emerge economies. however, progress economics completely successful, many challenge remain make economic analysis helpful guide policies, issue i want discus next.1 on model theory macroeconomics increasingly move towards model rigorously specified, sound micro-foundations, general equilibrium interactions, explicit informational constraints. however, always tension rigor, realism flexibility. there many tradeoffs. the cost tradeoff often subtle. the tendency base model ever rigorous grounds, although logical trend, undesired effects. the incentive young academic – one suppose push border knowledge, must publish perish – limit capability innovation. the require rigor end necessarily threaten realism. nobody expect model explain complexity real world, problem overlook element crucial understand prevent economic disaster like one face year ago. it 1 for discussion issues, see de gregorio (2009). bi review 84/2010 3 may reward academic standpoint write equilibrium model explain particular phenomenon, try formulate model properly represent distortion say phenomenon. it hard le reward academic formulate distortion – real world plenty – use elegant general equilibrium competitive model explain important stylize fact minimum number new ingredients. only handful academic able think rigorously box, kouri one them. complexity also jeopardize capacity move scientific research economic policy proposals. for academic idea useful economic policy making,

policymakers without scrutiny – late label orthodox – therefore, capacity intuitively explain result essential. model part reality allow u organize idea diagnose prescribing. the arguments’ logic good

central banks, unable consider manageable explicit way intricacy associate financial markets’ distortion imperfect arbitrage, let alone existence default credit losses. this bring theory finance. if ever one discipline anticipate vulnerability build financial markets, finance. have origin problem inflationary, problem would macroeconomics, origin financial.2 the origin crisis closely relate

panic markets. it paradoxical asset price theories, application real world, base existence full arbitrage (consider, example, capm), corporate finance theory essentially dominate information asymmetry plague friction principal-agent problems. this dichotomy correct time ensure realistic model financial market work become available, model shed light economic policy recommendations. on crisis prevention management a pervasive question past current crisis whether could anticipated. on one hand, tautological say crisis unpredictable, else 2 it scope presentation discus role monetary policy cause crisis. a i argue elsewhere (de gregorio, 2010), cause crisis mainly financial fragility, lax monetary policy play secondary role. many countries, chile canada, example, expansionary policy crisis, suffer financial collapse. 4 bi review 84/2010 would never occur. history plague crises. moreover, crisis become frequent recent decade compare bretton-woods period, although severity duration change significantly (bordo et al., 2001). crisis must avoided, way make sure happen eliminate financial innovation development altogether, know good prescription. therefore, crisis still occur, role policy cause them, increase resilience financial system minimize cost.3 of course, element absent global financial crisis reason need devote think reforms. although crisis continue happen, must conclude since crisis unavoidable, nothing them. instead, proper way act strengthen financial system macroeconomic policies, order minimize probability occurrence consequences, set proper crisis-management strategy hit. a case natural disasters, accidents, fact crisis continue happen mean must allow regulation economic activity (such build codes, drive standards). country good build code good face earthquakes. in case financial crises, reasonable improve regulatory mechanisms, particularly allow financial innovation keep vulnerability bay. meanwhile, necessary continue devote effort detection early alerts, although unambiguous indicator impossible find. but symptom fragility, common emerge economies. high persistent current-account deficits, misalign exchange rates, currency mismatch financial corporate sectors, excessive increase price asset credit, signal potential problem, although necessarily result crisis. therefore, look indicator enough; important put together detect fragilities. this precisely try financial stability reports, allow u gain overall vision vulnerabilities, although, again, provide final verdict. final remark the world go bad crisis since great depression. the initial shock global economy differ much one hit 1930s. there many similarity great depression great recession. worth note initial fall manufacture output trade, collapse stock price credit, increase bond spread (see eichengreen o’rourke, 2010). these remarkable similarity first month crisis alarming. the question profession also worrisome. however, subsequent evolution global economy quite different great depression, certainly result good macroeconomic management. there failure crisis prevention, policy response good far. more remarkable response emerge market economies. in particular, latin america, region historically magnify global cycle, time perform good world economy’s average. the world still many macroeconomic problem solve declare victory. indeed policy avert collapse require careful review avoid plant seed next crisis. 3 on issue, rancière et al. (2008) find “countries experience occasional financial crisis average grow fast country stable financial systems”. bi review 84/2010 5 first, need think seriously moral hazard. it true crisis second order problem. but, gestation asset price bubble commitment bubble burst, feed would take care mess. this exactly build currency mismatch emerge market authority promise ensure exchange rate stability. in addition, witness messy bail banks, recently, worrisome, bail country weak public finances. the issue sustainability become relevant, particular fiscal sphere. economy cannot live forever beyond means, serious effort fiscal consolidation must made, particular fragile industrial economies. it ironic go complex financial crisis, worry traditional crisis, cause fiscal imbalance context fix exchange rate regime, potentially serious financial ramifications. the type crisis analyze model international finance intellectually prolific time pentti kouri. he would certainly lot say this. reference bordo, m., b. eichengreen, d. klingebiel m.s. martinez-peria (2001), “is crisis problem grow more severe?” economic policy 16(32): 51–82. de gregorio, j.

h.e. governor rasheed mohammed al maraj, central bank bahrain, h.e. governor sultan bin nasser al suwaidi, central bank unite arab emirates, distinguish guests, lady gentleman introduction 1. good morning warm welcome overseas guests. first all, let thank governor rasheed governor sultan join u inaugural world islamic bank conference: asia summit (wibc asia). your presence today testimony strong long-standing tie singapore enjoy gulf cooperation council (gcc) country warm relationship ma respective central banks. 2. the world islamic bank conference hold successfully bahrain past sixteen years. we honour wibc asia anchor singapore. we hope summit become important event islamic finance calendar time catalyse even great engagement middle east asia. hence, theme: “seeking new growth horizons” highly appropriate inaugural summit. strengthen asia-middle east engagement 3. uncertainty fear financial crisis abate somewhat, risk still remain. global economic output begin pick second quarter 2009. the pace recovery however vary across regions. though global condition improved, recent development europe unsettle financial market doubt arise fiscal sustainability several country euro zone. these episodic concern serve broad reminder world economy still face serious challenge governments, financial institution corporation adjust new reality great prudence, tight market condition low tolerance weak governance excessive leverage. 4. in asia, economic growth rebound strongly pre-crisis level become broad-based. fundamental asia continue strong, boost robust domestic demand, healthy balance sheet strong resurgence intra-regional trade. accord international monetary fund (imf), asia expect grow average 7.1% 2010 2011, 3.4% 2009. have reform restructure economy

integrate single market 2015. with improve trade link two asian giant – china india, asean become even dynamic vibrant region within asia. 5. the gcc country enjoy solid growth prospects, look set achieve around 5% gdp growth 2010 2011, accord imf. they implement broad-based development strategy diversify economy away hydrocarbon harness new growth drivers. while energy-related sector remain important 2 bi review 84/2010 pillar asia-middle east relations, develop complementarity two region financial business services, infocomm technology media, infrastructure development, tourism well

ministerial meeting, hold singapore recently. growth trade asean gcc resume post-crisis expect receive boost asean-gcc trade investment framework agreement fta. i therefore urge party work swiftly towards mutually-beneficial conclusion. reform finance sustain growth 8. the financial sector encounter major turbulence headwind result financial crisis de-leveraged extensively response risk-sensitive environment. significant change financial regulation underway. global regulator auspex financial stability board, basel committee bank supervision, work put fracture financial market back sound footing. these change include increase quality quantity risk-based capital, introduce new global liquidity requirements, develop fresh regulatory approach towards systemically important financial institutions. such reform bring great stability global financial system. 9. these change dramatic singapore-based financial institution mas’ regulation supervision sound, prudent effective. this help financial system remain resilient crisis. last week, ma communicate long-standing approach late monograph – “tenets effective regulation” reiterate approach regulatory development outcome-focused, risk appropriate impact sensitive. mas’ policy action need clear consistent well responsive industry market change economic cycles. we believe stable dynamic financial system serf need economy public cannot build regulation alone. responsible competent board senior management manage risk financial institution well also critical. grow interest islamic finance 10. the general outlook islamic finance remain positive despite negative spillover financial crisis. a basic tenet, islamic finance emphasize finance activity underpin real commercial activities. due widen acceptance appeal mean ethical investment, industry expect continue grow twice pace conventional counterpart. a such, survey estimate industry soon cross us$1 trillion mark total assets. bi review 84/2010 3 11. but similar conventional banks, islamic financial institution impact economic slowdown result weak asset prices. some financial institution badly affect over-concentration illiquid asset overly-optimistic business plans. the islamic industry therefore need take heed lesson learn current crisis pay great attention issue relate capital adequacy, market liquidity risk management. overcome challenge require strong cooperation within industry across different jurisdictions. mas, full council member islamic financial service board (ifsb) since 2005, continue advocate support multi-national initiative would bring improvements. singapore global city business finance 12. a see recent times, financial centre important node ensure world economy continue function well. they need responsive dynamic market place order perform critical role sustain growth ensure capital channel productive uses. 13. singapore vibrant cosmopolitan global city well-positioned business connect

awareness adoption financial centres, islamic finance poise play big central role global finance. we look forward wibc asia key platform buttress development islamic finance take root region. the industry, open participants, reach great height commitment support. i therefore wish productive conference seek excite new horizon islamic finance. ben s bernanke: remark the squam lake report – fix financial system speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, squam lake conference, new york, 16 june 2010. * * * the squam lake report – centerpiece conference – valuable contribution ongoing analysis cause financial crisis appropriate policy responses.1 i commend organizer bring together impressive group scholar produce report continue discussion important policy issue meeting. i think agree key question face financial regulators: how strengthen financial system oversight minimize risk replay recent financial crisis? and crisis occur, limit economic costs? the report identify two core principle among guide u answer questions. first, financial policymakers supervisor must consider safety soundness individual financial institutions, important is; also consider factors, include interaction institution markets, affect stability financial system whole. in jargon economist regulators, supervisor need macroprudential well microprudential perspective. the second core principle put forth report stakeholder financial firm – include shareholders, managers, creditors, counterparties – must bear cost excessive risk-taking poor business decisions, public. the perception institution “too big fail” – implication that, firms, profit privatize loss socialize – must ended. the federal reserve strongly agree principles, important shape view regulatory reform. we also broadly agree narrative crisis offer report, discusses, among things, role subprime lend house boom bust; structural weakness shadow bank system, include insufficient transparency investor overreliance rat agencies; inadequate risk management many financial institutions; flaw regulatory framework allow large financial firm escape strong consolidate supervision give regulator mandate power need effectively evaluate respond risk financial system whole. weakness private sector public sector, framework regulation, supervisory execution contribute crisis. the crisis turn lead severe tighten credit, collapse confidence, sharp global economic downturn. the squam lake recommendation what, then, done? the squam lake report provide substantial set recommendations. among adoption systemic approach supervision regulation financial firm markets; enhance capital liquidity regulation financial firms, particularly systemically important institutions; improve 1

shiller, hyun song shin, matthew j. slaughter, jeremy c. stein, rené m. stulz (forthcoming), the squam lake report: fix financial system (princeton, new jersey: princeton university press). bi review 83/2010 1 information collection regulator and, possible, public release information; development resolution regime would allow authority manage failure systemically important financial firm orderly manner impose loss shareholder creditors; significant strengthen financial infrastructure, particularly derivative contracts. the federal reserve support legislative change areas, and, possible current law, initiate change along line within operations. in remainder remark i elaborate briefly recommendations, particular attention currently help shape regulatory reform fed’s regulatory supervisory activities. the systemic approach supervision the report correctly note financial regulatory system throughout world design primarily ensure soundness individual institutions. while important mission, agree author report sufficient. the failure large, complex, interconnect financial firm disrupt broad financial system overall economy, firm regulate fact mind. likewise, cost failure critical financial infrastructures, payment settlement systems, likely much great widely felt cost impose directly owner participant systems. regulatory agency must thus supervise financial institution critical infrastructure eye toward overall financial stability well safety soundness individual institution system. indeed, crisis demonstrate too-narrow focus safety soundness individual institution system result failure detect thwart emerge threat financial stability cut across many firm markets. a critical build block successful systemic, macroprudential, approach supervision requirement systemically important financial firm subject consolidate supervision. that is, one regulator must responsible able review full range activity firms. before recent financial crisis, many major financial firm – include investment bank like bear stearns lehman brother large insurance company like american international group – able avoid robust comprehensive supervision. in future, firm present systemic risk – regardless whether happen insure depository institution – must subject common, comprehensive framework supervision regulation. the financial reform bill pass house senate would expand strengthen consolidate supervision firm whose failure would pose risk financial system. the report recommend single systemic regulator assign responsibility oversee health overall financial system and, particular, duty assign central bank. we agree central bank – unite states, federal reserve – extensively involve collective effort promote financial stability. the reason involvement include central bank’s breadth expertise traditional role promote financial stability serve backstop liquidity provider financial system. however, give macroprudential responsibility single agency risk create regulatory blind spots, – unite states, least – skill experience need oversee many part complex financial system distribute across number regulatory agencies. rather concentrate macroprudential authority single agency, prefer regulator require routinely factor macroprudential consideration supervision, thus help ensure risk financial stability address wherever arise. for similar reasons, support creation systemic risk council make financial supervisors. such council would provide forum agency differ responsibility perspective share information approaches, would facilitate 2 bi review 83/2010 identification mitigation emerge threat financial stability. at time, consistent report’s recommendation line accountability systemic oversight clearly drawn, believe council directly involve rule-writing supervision. rather, function remain relevant supervisors, council coordinate role. even legislative process move forward, federal reserve already take number step reorient strengthen supervision largest, complex financial firm oversee broaden field vision incorporate macroprudential concerns. for example, view critical feature successful systemic approach supervision multidisciplinary perspective. our experience year ago supervisory capital assessment program, scap (popularly know bank stress tests), demonstrate feasibility benefit employ perspective. we work ensure supervision large bank organization financial market utility make use wide range skill federal reserve staff, include economists, financial market specialists, payment system experts, accountants, others, well bank supervisors. the scap also show much learn simultaneous evaluation comparison practice portfolio different firms, rather focus one firm time, supervisory approach often take past. thus, increase use cross-firm, horizontal examinations. and implement quantitative surveillance mechanism enhance data collection strengthen supervision systemic firms. enhance capital liquidity regulation a report notes, minimize risk future financial crisis require tough prudential standard financial firms, especially systemically important financial firms, well intensive supervision. strong capital liquidity standard more-stringent risk-management requirement large interconnect firm necessary reduce probability systemic firm experience financial distress harm financial system economy. enhance prudential standard large firm also reduce incentive firm grow otherwise expand systemic footprint order become perceive big fail. at federal reserve, already work domestically internationally increase quantity quality regulatory capital bank require hold, good link capital standard risk bank face, reduce pro-cyclicality regulatory capital account frameworks. all change enable firm good withstand adverse systemwide shocks. to sure, reasonable transition period necessary allow bank meet demand standard without unduly constrict credit endanger recovery. in addition enhance capital standards, also work domestic international colleague toughen liquidity requirements. a prominent feature crisis inadequate liquidity risk-management practice major financial firms. some firms, notably independent investment banks, rely excessively volatile, wholesale, short-term fund source overly expose fund market disrupted. to good prevent excessive level liquidity risk, major financial firm subject explicit, internationally consistent liquidity standards. systemically important firm also subject strong risk-management standards, support high-quality management information systems. in addition, supervisor require major financial firm structure incentive compensation program promote long-term financial performance avoid excessive risk-taking. bi review 83/2010 3 an improve information infrastructure both regulation market discipline important role play constrain risk-taking financial markets; best outcome achieve two form oversight work effectively together. the report recommend good system data collection aggregation enhance partnership. good data collection would enable regulator accurately ass compare risk across firms, markets, products. a regulatory requirement track report timely, consistent, fully aggregate data risk exposure could also promote good risk management firm themselves. and increase public disclosure data would provide investor analyst complete picture individual firms’ strength vulnerabilities, well potential risk system whole, thereby facilitate effective market discipline. consistent recommendation, preparation possible change regulatory framework, federal reserve expand already-extensive commitment collection analysis financial data. for example, effort way construct good measure counterparty credit risk interconnectedness among systemically critical firms. in particular, good identify potential channel financial contagion, supervisor work improve understand banks’ large exposure banks, nonbank financial institutions, corporate borrowers. we also collect data banks’ trade securitization exposures, well liquidity risks, part internationally coordinate effort improve regulatory standard areas. importantly, attention pay risk individual firms, also potential systemic risk arise firms’ common exposure sensitivity common shocks. resolution regime a clear lesson event past year – recommendation report strongly agree – government must force choose unattractive alternative bail systemically important firm fail disorderly disruptive manner. the government instead must tool resolve fail firm manner preserve market discipline – ensure shareholder creditor incur loss culpable manager replace – time cushion broad financial system possibly destabilize effect firm’s collapse. have method resolve fail firm safely necessary commitment allow failure credible, turn essential reverse perception firm big fail. the financial reform legislation house senate would provide resolution regime. in versions, federal deposit insurance corporation would give authority manage resolution systemically important nonbank financial institution manner broadly similar authority us bank current law. a note report, key challenge would foster international cooperation need manage cross-border aspect resolution regime. to help ensure efficacy resolution authority, financial reform legislation consideration congress usefully require systemically important financial firm prepare “living will” set plan wind firm’s operation orderly manner – another recommendation report. the creation supervisory review plan would require firm regulator confront difficulty pose complex legal structure well advance firm’s financial distress, case could lead firm simplify internal structures. while contingency plan might actually serve template resolution firm reach brink failure, preparation periodic review plan could valuable supervisory tool prepare firm withstand distress. 4 bi review 83/2010 bi review 83/2010 5 financial infrastructure the report also address importance strong financial market infrastructure include well-functioning appropriately regulate central counterparties. strong infrastructure help reduce systemic risk guard contagion time stress; contrast, weak infrastructure increase risk spawn contagion. the federal reserve long support effort improve infrastructure clear settlement derivatives. for example, federal reserve bank new york leader improve documentation, settlement, transparency credit default swaps. the federal reserve also encourage development industry warehouse utility collection trade information derivatives. although individually customize derivative still important place financial marketplace, believe systemic risk reduce derivative market increase standardization contract require standardize derivative clear well-regulated central counterparties. in addition, also critical relevant financial regulator access detail information derivative market – include standardize customize transaction – ass extent derivative trade might concentrate risk transmit localize regional shock throughout financial system. the market repurchase agreements, repos, also play prominent role transmit risk crisis. the federal reserve work improve infrastructure arrangement triparty repo market explore step take improve stability key fund market. give important role play financial market infrastructures, support current legislative provision would help ensure payment, clearing, settlement system – include central counterparties – subject robust consistent risk-management standard pose danger financial system whole. status legislation the congress make significant progress substantive area i discuss today well many others. indeed, appear final legislation address way great majority recommendation the squam lake report could enact next weeks. like you, follow legislative development closely continue plan implement reform. once again, i appreciate valuable contribution group make articulate intellectual framework transform lesson recent financial crisis practical recommendations. i look forward discuss issue many future. bi

occur again. indeed, one key lesson financial crisis financial stability highly interconnect financial system achieve globally consistent concert efforts. leadership public private decision-makers sustain intense international dialogue therefore essential. today’s visit u financial service roundtable welcome initiative leader financial service industry end. the extraordinary nature consequence global financial crisis demonstrate need reform financial system. various weakness detect aegis g20 comprehensive set measure agree upon. it envisage strengthen macro- micro-prudential supervision well enhance use market infrastructure. these measure need complementary supplementary one another order desire effect. for intense international dialogue key. the global agenda strengthen financial system broad i able cover area comprehensively today. i therefore limit speech area reform particular importance. i highlight important area regard regulatory reform, touch briefly upon supervisory reform elaborate reform priority area market infrastructures. regulatory reform the crisis show importance contain excessive build-up leverage good time enhance overall quality capital view strengthen resilience financial sector. the package prepare basel committee cover capital liquidity reform proposal comprehensive address issue improve quality, consistency transparency capital credit institutions, well develop framework liquidity risk. [the main element proposal are: first, improve quality capital, especially tier-1 capital improve loss-absorption go concern basis. second, introduction non-risk-based leverage ratio supplementary measure basel ii risk control framework aim curb excessive balance sheet growth witnessed. third, introduction range measures, intend mitigate inherent pro-cyclicality financial system. and lastly, introduction capital buff forward-looking provision ensure 2 bi review 90/2010 financial system absorb shock thus even volatility financial real economic cycles.] a know, quantitative impact assessment conduct order ass cumulative impact reform financial institution real economy. a preliminary result discuss july meet basel committee, would premature take position matter desirable calibration. but let make two points. firstly, conceptual point view ecb support propose measures, particularly light lesson learn crisis. secondly, ecb view notwithstanding outcome impact assessments, weaken standards. it would preferable relevant long transition period agree upon, balance need enhance bank stability maintain stable provision credit economy. the crisis also highlight particular importance so-called systemically important financial institution (sifis). therefore another important part regulatory reform need reduce moral hazard associate systemically important financial institutions. it key find way sifis internalise potential cost pose financial system. this could achieve introduction additional prudential measures, instance capital surcharge contingent capital instruments, liquidity surcharges, intrusive supervision, and/or introduction bank levies. although work still underway financial stability board expect provide recommendation g20 summit november seoul, european council recently agree eu member state introduce system levy tax financial institution ensure fair burden-sharing set incentive contain systemic risk. a regard initiatives, i would like underline ecb always supportive explore feasibility measures. however, measure desire effect, important internationally coordinate solution ensured. i also view contribution financial institution complementary coherent supervisory regulatory regimes. sequence implementation measure thus utmost importance. finally, important high overall cost fund pass customers, instance form high lend rates/fees low remuneration deposits. another important area regulatory reform effort underway achieve single set high-quality global independent account standard june 2011. in order sound regulatory framework high-quality convergent account standard crucial. we ensure current gap ifrs u gaap narrow rather widen. it seem current fasb proposal classification measurement financial instrument would result financial instrument measure fair value, lead overall expansion fair value accounting. accept would address key lesson financial crisis, namely fair value account always provide decision-useful information may exacerbate pro-cyclical effects. in addition, expansion fair value account would direct contradiction “mixed measurement model” endorse iasb, therefore represent major setback achieve account convergence. supervisory reform let turn briefly touch progress supervisory reform. if one uncontested lesson crisis need develop capacity authority conduct macroprudential supervision. the ultimate aim macro-prudential policy contain build financial vulnerability ensure financial bi review 90/2010 3 system able withstand unwinding, minimise potential spill-overs real economy. an effective macro-prudential framework aim deliver thorough analysis systemic risks, well formulation appropriate policy address risk identifying, timely fashion, emergence build critical vulnerabilities, decide effective (pre-emptive) intervention. in europe new body set up: european systemic risk board (esrb). it responsible macro-prudential supervision eu financial system. the key task esrb identify ass risk stability eu financial system issue risk warn identify risk appear significant policy recommendation remedial action. i happy involvement esrb, ecb continue play active role safeguard financial stability europe. financial market infrastructure let turn priority regard financial market infrastructures. financial market infrastructure underpin stability financial system. by apply highly sophisticate standardise risk management procedure enable multilateral net risk-sharing, infrastructure provide resilient efficient risk management service users. market infrastructure also act centralise source information authority public, thereby enhance market transparency facilitate early detection financial imbalances. furthermore, interpose trade counterparties, infrastructure reduce interconnectedness major financial institution associate contagion risks. therefore, might surprise market infrastructure soundly withstand storm financial crisis. still, i would like draw attention three main policy priority regard financial infrastructure light lesson financial crisis. the first priority relate development financial infrastructure market yet sufficiently use available, notably otc derivative markets. the crisis show market adequate infrastructure hence proper risk management risk provision prove resilient market without infrastructures, otc derivative markets. therefore, expand use central counterparties (ccps) increasingly systemically relevant market key measure reduce counterparty operational risk. another important step mandatory report trade centralise trade registries, so-called trade repositories, order enhance market transparency. in view, ccps trade repository credit default swap available lehman default, lehman’s cd exposure could manage much transparent resilient way could mitigate negative chain reaction cd market follow demise lehman. ccps trade repository otc derivative ultimately beneficial stakeholders. still, well-known challenge effective collective action context provision public goods. hence, private sector effort alone may suffice foster sufficient progress towards use ccps trade repository otc derivatives. it therefore important adopt implement regulatory requirement mandatory central clear eligible product report trade trade repository timely manner. given, however, global nature otc derivative markets, clear regulatory tool successful apply coordinate manner around globe. i strongly support recently launch work financial stability board develop common approach foster central clear eligible otc derivative well expand range potentially clearable product enhance standardisation. 4 bi review 90/2010 the second priority relate need update globally consistent requirement ensure safety soundness financial infrastructures. by nature business, financial infrastructure concentrate systemic risk, owe large size, limit degree substitutability strong web mutual interdependency across infrastructures, e.g. arise exposure large participants. increase reliance market infrastructure across financial market underline importance effectively address risk. therefore, crucial ensure ccps able manage specific risk relate clear otc derivatives. furthermore, trade repository need designed, operate oversee adequate manner, give novelty infrastructure reliance market infrastructures, public authority market participant accuracy availability respective data. two complementary strand work underway fields. first, legislation otc derivative ccps trade repository develop several countries. and second, international standard financial market infrastructure currently review cps iosco. in respect i believe give importance globally consistent framework market infrastructures, critical ensure relevant national regional legislation draft sufficiently flexible way allow effective accommodation work standard-setters. the final priority i would like stress relate measure directly target market infrastructure themselves, closely relate work: need improve bilateral post-trading process line requirement market infrastructures. it clear without adequate bilateral risk management disclosure, comprehensive mitigation systemic risk arise post-trading could achieved. moreover, uneven regulatory level play field could create scope regulatory arbitrage provide disincentive use market infrastructure. a concrete example necessary regulatory attention, let mention risk management standard bilateral clear otc derivatives. while – mention – principle otc derivative centrally clear extent possible, product suitable central clearing, instance owe insufficient product standardisation, lack market liquidity limit availability robust prices. at time, trade suitable central clear pose particular risk management challenge give bespeak opaque nature. therefore, view, capital charge collateralisation requirement bilaterally clear trade must least stringent requirement ccps ensure sufficiently robust buff adverse market developments, operational counterparty risks. i welcome bank supervisor around world develop strengthen framework regard, work step revision global prudential standard currently development basel committee. conclusion lady gentlemen, allow conclude. the regulatory reform, new emphasis place macro-prudential supervision measure strengthen financial market infrastructures, key element path towards great financial stability important complement strengthen risk management disclosure level financial institutions. more specifically, key importance propose legislation concern enhancement eu institutional framework particular establishment esrb finally agreed, allow start – plan – january 2011. give interconnectedness financial institution financial market essential internationally consistent framework created, ensure level play field financial institutions. gather like one today serve good forum enhance bi review 90/2010 5 understand issue face thus contribute reach efficient workable solutions. therefore, i much believe continuous effective transatlantic dialogue fundamental. thank attention. bi review 90/2010 1 prof njuguna ndung’u: grow real estate finance remark prof njuguna ndung’u, governor central bank kenya, forum grow real estate finance, kenya school monetary studies,

interactive forum “growing real estate finance”. i thank present accept invitation. in particular, i wish thank counsellor real estate represent join u deliberate growth finance important sector kenyan economy. lady gentlemen: in economy, long-term finance one key driver economic growth. long-term finance allow provision affordable adequate house major thrust kenya’s vision 2030. indeed, line objective forum, one flagship project “housing urbanization” stipulate vision 2030 “mortgage finance initiatives”. at estimate annual demand 150,000 house unit, supply barely 35,000 leave gap 115,000. the sector thus portend enormous opportunity major market; appropriate innovative finance mechanism therefore absolutely essential. this forum bring together bankers, regulators, practitioners, researchers, academic senior government policy maker discus vital agenda – real estate finance kenya, i believe one solution source long-term finance also collateral technology process must improve simplified. the outcome policy conclusion interactive forum are, therefore, important input policy response address bind constraint sector economy. the kenyan financial system intermediation role remain key pillar provide mortgage financing. although evidently enormous opportunity sector, lend build construction real estate sector stand 12.2% (ksh 92.5 billion end 2009) total credit bank

90/2010 1 millison k narh: monetary policy outlook economic growth speech mr millison k narh, second deputy governor bank ghana, databank investor forum, accra, 26 april 2010. * * * 1. introduction [1] distinguish lady gentlemen, i would like thank databank invite forum bring together institutional investor apprise policy initiative ass investment opportunity country. [2] i understand databank celebrate twenty year entrepreneurship year. let take opportunity congratulate significant achievement contribution towards ghana’s financial sector past two decade hope expand activity come years. [3] my address today focus “monetary policy outlook economic growth”. i seek address topic focus three key issues. that is, bank ghana’s monetary policy stance, stabilization role monetary policy ghanaian economy lastly, outlook economic growth 2010 beyond. 2. the monetary policy stance bank ghana [4] the primary objective bank ghana maintain price stability. the objective price stability end itself; rather interest promote balance sustainable growth long-term. indeed, clear focus price stability stipulate bank ghana act 612 reflect consensus various policy dialogue “inflation major obstacle growth process price stability contribute accelerate growth promote enable environment efficient investment save decision-making”. various country experiences, include ghana, show sustain period strong growth always go hand hand low inflation whereas low growth episode occur highly inflationary environments. [5] a may aware, ghanaian economy witness consistent growth period recent past real gdp growth increase steadily 3.7 percent 7.3 percent within spate nine years. to large extent growth phase ghanaian economy largely support policy environment aim macroeconomic stability anchor inflation expectations. this combine structural reforms, particularly financial sector, need increase financial intermediation promote economic growth. [6] although growth achieved, reemergence macro instability underpin external domestic factor considerable credit expansion government private sector dislodge inflationary expectation increase inflationary pressure economy. the combine effect expansionary fiscal monetary policy result severe macroeconomic imbalance characterize rise inflation, exchange rate depreciation loss international reserves. to bring back stability economy, policy framework refocus restrictive monetary policy fiscal prudence, lead tight credit conditions, general slowdown economy, low economic growth 2009. [7] it therefore prudent seek promote economic growth, bank ghana remain commit mission price stability well improve regulatory supervisory framework secure strong financial sector efficient intermediation. in deliver mandate, bank ghana’s operational framework monetary policy involve adjust interest rate achieve target inflation policy horizon. by 2 bi review 90/2010 process, stance monetary policy continuously ass risk growth inflation properly position key policy rate restore balance inflation growth. [8] the mandate strategy bank ghana consistent theoretical argument economic literature regard role monetary policy attain price stability. we also believe monetary policy mindful country’s growth objectives. therefore, commit long-term objective price stability, bank’s monetary policy strategy adopt gradualist policy response approach address shock economy minimize output loss associate pursue inflation objective help anchor inflation expectations. 3. the stabilize role monetary policy [9] it useful u understand monetary policy past year half contribute stabilize ghanaian economy, currently fashion foster growth economy. [10] the ghanaian economy severely challenge first half 2009 rise inflation, depreciate currency, loss international reserve weaken business consumer confidence. the rate inflation increase steadily peak 20.7 percent june, high record four years. there excessive upward surge exchange rate local currency depreciate 17.5 percent u dollar january june. gross international reserve position fell 1.9 month import cover june 2009. clearly, signal economy stress, underlie urgency implement prudent policy restore economic stability. [11] the immediate policy response institute stringent policy framework restrictive monetary policy complement prudent fiscal policy restore stability. these measure also support multilateral bilateral assistance. monetary policy tighten deem necessary support stringent fiscal policy aim steer economy back stability. hence, bank ghana respond economic challenge adjust policy rate upwards 150 basis points. [12] let state macroeconomic outcome stringent policy framework positive. the policy contribute immensely return stability gradually restore business consumer confidence economy. with tight monetary policies, stability local currency restore disinflation process ongoing. year year inflation decline steadily peak july 2009 13.3 percent march 2010. similarly, core measure inflation (excluding energy utility) decline indicate downward inflationary pressure within economy. [13] the late assessment economy bank ghana point improve economic fundamental drive diminish inflationary pressures, exchange rate stability, gradual pick-up economic activity improvement investor consumer confidence. the external position strengthen significant increase reserve level, well improvement trade current account balance spite challenge spillover world economic downturn. overall, economy respond well tight policy responses. [14] these notwithstanding, economic activity 2009 remain subdue line policy tighten stance although indicator economic activity confidence index show sign recovery. real gdp slow 7.3 percent 2008, reflect expansionary policy strong credit expansion provisional forecast 4.7 percent 2009 credit condition tightened. [15] with cognizance successful role play monetary policy shift economy back disinflation path price stability, bank ghana also realize need complement process stimulate economic growth medium-term. bi review 90/2010 3 consequently, policy rate cut cumulative 350 basis point november 2009 march 2010. with reduction, anticipate credit condition gradually ease credit growth restore ensure steady growth output. 4. outlook economic growth [16] the outlook economic growth remain positive. although growth constrain 2009 basis tight policies, improve economic condition pave way monetary policy ease stimulate growth 2010 beyond. there indication rebound business consumer confidence, well increase investor confidence economy. hence, economic stability gain firm hold, private sector must reposition drive growth agenda. [17] a note 2010 budget economic policy statement, government continue fiscal consolidation process start 2009 view stabilize inflation reduce exchange rate volatilities. external sector policy also focus build reserve (which currently 3 month import cover), reduce current account deficit, pursue strategy increase economic growth 2010. the budget optimistic growth prospect 2010 revise real gdp growth 6.5 percent compare initial program target 5.0 percent. [18] start 2011, ghana benefit oil production expect attract additional investment country, boost economic growth. initial production project contribute 17 percent towards ghana’s gdp. accordingly, real gdp growth estimate increase 20 percent 2011. [19] there general consensus contribution monetary policy stabilize economy create enable environment sustainable growth long-run. look forward therefore, bank ghana’s monetary policy stance remain focus steer economy towards price stability whilst deepen financial intermediation process ensure credit flow productive sector economy. [20] despite role monetary policy create enable environment, promote long-term growth complex process require support structural reform seek remove “binding constraints” business environment ensure sustainable growth. clearly, monetary policy limit beyond scope resolve structural bottleneck often constrain growth ghanaian economy. the commitment bank ghana ensure macroeconomic stability ease credit constraint must therefore support policy reform strengthen investment climate, increase productivity innovation, well close infrastructural gap especially energy road sectors. [21] it anticipate increase government revenue oil production create much need fiscal space close country’s infrastructural gap ease growth constraints. additionally, implementation credible fiscal consolidation policy underscore growth-enhancing measure provide need boost private sector accelerate economic growth. 5. conclusion [22] ghana’s economy rebound strongly instability characterize first half 2009. recent trend indicate macroeconomic stability gain grind decline inflation, exchange rate stability, grow reserve well increase investor business confidence. these condition pave way monetary policy ease increase investment spur economic growth. 4 bi review 90/2010 [23] most importantly, central bank remain commit deliver low inflation environment would support overall broad development agenda growth poverty reduction. consistent this, monetary policy regime sustain price stability economic growth. [24] i would like conclude stress monetary policy effectively maintain price stability must accompany structural reform create enable environment accelerate growth long-run. therefore, notwithstanding bank ghana’s monetary policy stance preserve price stability create enable environment foster growth, structural reform ease bind constraint economy must implement make ghana competitive important investment destination within sub-region. bi review 88/2010 1 sada s reddy: fijian business – edge presentation mr sada s reddy, governor reserve bank fiji, fiji indigenous business council, suva, fiji, 23 june 2010. * * * the chairman fiji indigenous business council, distinguish guests, lady gentleman good morning i honour invite speak morning. i request speak theme: “fijian business: on edge.” well, i look topic, number thing come mind. first all, fijian business mean instance; secondly “on edge”. let first deal “fijian business” mean me. i presume mean business venture indigenous people fiji operate distinct business venture own operate rest people fiji, include foreign investors. if understand correct i need ask wish distinguish fijian business rest fiji businesses. i guess challenge comes. for council form association represent indigenous business show see need body address opportunity challenge collectively feel need addressed. so challenge needs? i confess i opportunity today discus anyone really find exactly aim objective fiji indigenous business council. but i closely followed, various media, activity various business association include association, year therefore idea associations’ aim objective are. i guess one key issue member deal grow compete exist businesses. this difficult complex issue. when look successful fiji businesses, find humble small beginnings. some start corner grocery shop say two three generation hard work, personal family sacrifices, enormous discipline manage money, build save make prudent business decisions, manage business risks, develop strategic business alliances, importantly passionate vision work day night achieve vision. there short cut. most successful business see today get government help initial years. it sheer hard work, discipline, personal family level. business acumen inculcate parent child young age. in modern business world, well, short cut. but days, well educated, also smart rest. knowledge business world critically important. at juncture, let make one important point relation indigenous business. i opportunity diagnose failure number indigenous business long career reserve bank fiji. one challenge thing i notice lack financial discipline, lack budget anticipate manage business personal risks. 2 bi review 88/2010 lady gentlemen, message i wish leave today nobody owe anyone live modern world. you survivor learn survive world business. if successful, limit growth well-being you, family, employee community. the second element conference theme “on edge”. be indigenous business “on edge”? i know respond question. however, i analyse benefit business environment face move forward. the business sector work manage remain grow business give business environment face with. let turn business environment face with. lady gentlemen, fact, happen global economy result late global financial crisis, many business fail world over. direct indirect effect crisis also pass fijian economy. a result, number local business affected. while may several indigenous business list affect companies, i sure ones. indeed, number company large small seriously affect global financial crisis. since i touch global financial crisis, let begin give overview global economic conditions. in line today’s theme, i’m sure u remember long ago global economy “on edge”. however, much concert effort policy support, global economy manage turn situation around. the world economy improve accord international monetary fund (imf), global economy expect grow 4.2 percent year, follow contraction 0.6% 2009. last year’s performance global economy actually regard bad since great depression 1930s. on positive note though, growth 4.3 percent expect 2011. lady gentlemen, except australia, trade partner economy contract last year result global financial crisis. this significantly affect export tourism last year. however, bad country expect post modest growth year continue 2011. this good news fiji, mean increase demand export tourism. in fact, already see effect these, especially tourism industry, see strong recovery visitor arrivals. amongst advance countries, u economy good europe japan, emerge develop economies, asia drive recovery. in particular, china india record high growth rate 2009 expect record similar growth 2010. a case develop develop economy worldwide, business/private sector drive growth prospects. have say that, indigenous business play important crucial role development economies. all businesses, whether big small, role play development economy. before i return subject detail, let share expectation domestic economic outlook. economic condition lady gentlemen, let touch fiji’s current economic condition prospects. our economy contract last 3 years. last year economy contract 2.2 percent. however, economy expect regain strength 2010 continue performance next two years. for year, expect sector show positive growth except agriculture & forestry health & social work sectors, project decline. the agriculture sector badly hit cyclone bi review 88/2010 3 tomas, result downward revision overall growth rate year, stand 1.8 percent. look ahead next two years, growth also expect broad-based. apart expect decline build construction sector, tourism industry expect lead growth assist growth agriculture. a growth rate around 1.7 1.9 percent expect 2011 2012, respectively. while encourage turnaround economy, still number fundamental issue economy fix allow u fully realise growth potential. we say many occasion past external position, fiji’s balance payment (bop), remain vulnerable. the poor performance export sector, couple ever grow need imports, continue produce widen trade current account deficit. a long current account deficit, continue put pressure fiji’s foreign reserves. the challenge remain raise export minimise import help reduce imbalance ease pressure foreign reserves. unless bring current account deficit 5 percent gdp, macroeconomic policy need remain relatively tight. in light this, government consolidate fiscal position aim reduce fiscal budget. this expect support relatively tight monetary conditions. now mean fijian businesses? in short-term, business condition fiji may easy. a tight fiscal policy mean few tax break handout businesses. tight monetary policy mean loan expensive. therefore, business brace survive challenge times. so, manage environment? i think i give serious advice regard. but, i suppose i make general comment here. business consider adjustment operations. you need work smart limit resource give maximum returns. you consider product diversification – look new perhaps, niche, business opportunities. consider move value chain add value current products. if currently provide tour tourists, explore go budget accommodation. if produce timber, consider convert furniture finish products. if local market saturated, consider export good services. in addition these, business also consider staff capacity build various train institution have, tpaf instance, improve productivity dynamism workforce. most importantly, i mention before, important rule business operate accord certain principle – principle must follow business people. there shortcut success separate rule different ethnic groups. give government tighten belt would mean little support government give business short medium term. lady gentlemen, economy expect recover slowly medium term. the structural reform plan government expect provide positive business environment future. reduce government expenditure expect provide space private investment take place business condition expect improve. now challenge find you, fijian entrepreneur, contribute economic development nation build process. by strengthen consolidate business base now, fijian business good position contribute growth process. i mention recent conference would like reiterate here, live world competition many country 4 bi review 88/2010 low cost structure high productivity. therefore, unless raise productivity business smart way, able compete successfully rest world. reliance preferential access thing past, must learn stand feet. and remember, small business remain small vision get bigger. i encourage form vision – want business 5 year 10 year now. and follow path take there. like you, i concern press need open way advancement indigenous businesses. i understand something previous government attempt do, may ask question – policy deliver expected. what rbf assist fijian businesses? the rise balance payment deficit call concert decisive effort stakeholders. at reserve bank, embark various initiative help cushion economic deficiency remain focus proactively intervene appropriate monetary policy action face external shock macro economy. the rbf also play wide proactive role work closely government various reform initiatives, particularly reform export sector, import substitution fiscal consolidation. reform sector slow move great action still needed. now let briefly highlight work reserve bank area small micro enterprise development. most work regard tie council’s role develop fijian businesses. in april 2009, make institutional reform within reserve bank result establishment group call financial system development compliance (fsdc) group. one major role group (amongst others) ensure development provision microfinance service great fijian community. after little year establishment, witness lot excite developments. from 1st january 2010, issue new microfinance policy require commercial bank establish internal microfinance division unit serve cater smes underserved. most commercial bank comply policy begin offer affordable product service target

offer scholarship chef train malaysia encourage use local food preparation hotel menus. this target reduce import bill improve balance payment position, well encourage local value adding. local business try seize opportunity arise initiative i mentioned. the reserve bank also embark develop effective all-encompassing framework guide community village development. no doubt, abundant natural resource manpower capacity rural areas. however, continue notice lack progress successive authority develop rural dweller become economically active. the rural area home 52 percent fiji’s population. more importantly, fiji’s key export rural based, provide great potential future development prosperity, particularly tourism, agriculture, forestry fishery sectors. it therefore important suitable development scheme framework put place rural village communities. our policy discriminate nationality businesses. all benefit policy business fiji. you must seek opportunity out. conclude remark in summary, lady gentlemen, see global economy recovering. this good news u – expect export services, tourism, pick up. a i mentioned, need u maintain healthy bop position mean expect relatively tight fiscal monetary policy near-term. i also take time highlight area reserve bank work promote small micro enterprise development, line fibc’s role develop fijian businesses. it council’s interest ensure indigenous business aware initiative benefit them. i wish underscore importance financial discipline culture hard work personal discipline ensure success business. in conclusion lady gentlemen, i

governor bank canada, winnipeg cfa society, winnipeg, manitoba, 22 june 2010. * * * good afternoon. it’s pleasure here. the recent past underscore fact that, finance economy, thing interconnect global scale. throughout history, canada powerfully affect event elsewhere. manitobans particular well aware reality. wave immigration, rapid change commodity prices, great depression, two world wars, technological advance – enormous impact here. more recently, global financial crisis stark reminder everyone – even citizen country sound “fundamentals” – affect major shocks, regardless shock originate. global reality impact domestic financial system inform much bank canada’s recent issue financial system review (fsr), publish yesterday. in fsr, bank identify evaluate risk vulnerability financial system. our goal contribute long-term resiliency canadian financial system promote inform discussion various relevant issue developments. in remark today, i’d like discus two issue discuss fsr, which, directly indirectly, pose risk financial stability. these issue sovereign debt global macroeconomic imbalances. both “global” issues, manage national, well international, level. a such, core ongoing g20 discussions, include take place week toronto. i’ll start take brief look canadian economy – now, appear headed. then, i’ll elaborate two issue i’ve identified. i’ll welcome comment question end. the canadian economy the global economic recovery way, uneven one. in emerging-market economies, growth vigorous – indeed strong expect month ago. at time, advance economies, recovery subdue heavily dependent exceptional stimulus provide monetary fiscal policies. in recent months, concern european sovereign debt dampen prospect recovery europe. so far, concern limit effect canada – mainly, modest fall commodity price tighten financial condition – important risk recovery. in canada, economic recovery proceed somewhat rapidly expected. growth strong past two quarters, although expect moderate, start quarter. several factor support recovery: fiscal monetary stimulus, improve financial conditions, rebound global economic growth, favourable term trade, increase business household confidence. at time, persistent strength canadian dollar, poor relative productivity performance, low absolute level demand unite state act drag recovery. the bank project gdp growth 3.7 per cent 2010, gradual slow 3.1 per cent 2011 1.9 per cent 2012. inflation expect remain close 2 percent target period. 2 bi review 88/2010 in view outlook, bank canada indicate late april need extraordinary monetary policy stimulus – provide since begin financial crisis recession – passing. on 1 june, increase policy interest rate ¼ per cent ½ per cent. of course, still leaf interest rate stimulative level. but uncertainty – particularly emanate europe – we’ve careful emphasize extent time additional withdrawal monetary stimulus would depend outlook economic activity inflation evolves. in make decisions, always stay focus achieve 2 per cent inflation target. in monetary policy decisions, mindful risk economic outlook, upside downside. in assess financial stability, downside risk main focus. so let turn discussion two area risk may bear health stability financial system, abroad. first, i’ll look issue sovereign debt. sovereign debt sovereign debt – unsustainable fiscal deficit – front centre recent global economic events. concern sovereign debt flare recent month number european countries. but come years, many advance country face major challenge achieve maintain sustainable fiscal positions. in canada, fortunate task manageable elsewhere, continue resolve required. the current sovereign debt problem exacerbate bring head global financial crisis recession. of course, number country enter crisis weak fiscal positions, situation deteriorate substantially. in part, reflect direct support many government provide keep trouble financial institution afloat. although final bill support yet known, could large. another important element massive fiscal stimulus government major country deliver mitigate recession. and, course, reduce tax revenues, associate recession, add substantially problem. both financial system support fiscal stimulus necessary, since alternative would much worse. when private sector spend long sufficient support growth, government step fill gap. but result shift debt build-up private sector public sector. grow sovereign debt source risk two main reasons. first, high level public debt tend constrain economic growth.1 second, concern sovereign debt become acute – even limit country – pervasive effect financial system. these effect stem fundamental importance government liability financial system. government debt instrument typically view risk-free highly liquid asset hold financial institution individual investors, use benchmark price financial assets. what happens, then, asset perceive risky – become increasingly illiquid (as saw early may, european sovereign debt market seize up)? 1 see carmen m. rienhart kenneth s. rogoff, “growth time debt,” available http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/rogoff/files/growth_in_time_debt.pdf: “...whereas link growth debt seem relatively weak ‘normal’ debt levels, median growth rate country public debt 90 percent gdp roughly one percent low otherwise; average (mean) growth rate several percent lower. surprisingly, relationship public debt growth remarkably similar across emerge market advance economies” (page 2). bi review 88/2010 3 first, consider chain exposure credit risk – holder government securities, creditors, creditors’ creditors, on. and since many exposure uncharted, uncertainty exposure lie may cause spike perceive counterparty risk, thereby affect short-term finance decisions. a result, fund market become increasingly illiquid, widen spread diminish access financing. finally, general retrenchment risk-taking, result decline price risky asset – include currency commodities. we saw transmission channel europe early may. if situation deteriorate further, impact canada’s financial conditions, financial condition generally, could substantial. the market turmoil europe meet forceful policy response. in affect country – happen sovereign debt crisis – two dimension problem: short-term challenge roll debt, medium-term challenge attain sustainable fiscal position. of course, two challenge mutually reinforcing: markets’ skepticism medium-term fiscal position make difficult roll debt, high debt-refinancing cost make difficult balance budget. thus, problem address credible manner. the fund problem currently address massive finance package provide european government international monetary fund. the medium-term fiscal challenge require hard decisions, painful adjustment, perseverance. the fiscal austerity require situation involve painful dilemma. such adjustment impede economic recovery. on hand, i’ve stressed, country sovereign debt concern become paramount, fail adjust adverse financial effect – also harm recovery. in theory, dilemma could sidestep commit undertake serious adjustment later, economy stronger; promise future action rarely enough convince markets. the solution typically involve take bull horns: make bold start serious structural measure last effect fiscal position. the pension reform undertake european country good example. but problem global economy. for past several months, concern risk associate “hand-off” public demand private demand. the concern fiscal stimulus run private sector gather sufficient momentum, global economic recovery could falter. this point need pace fiscal austerity consistent continue recovery. so far, i focus two channel excessive sovereign debt global level create risk financial system canada – difficult liquidity fund conditions, weak global economic outlook. these two five area risk examine current fsr. i would like focus third, related, area risk: global macroeconomic imbalances. global imbalance an important backdrop global financial crisis ensue recession configuration large current account imbalance major economies. these global imbalance evident high level savings, persistent current account surplus china many asian countries, counterbalance credit-fuelled spend household governments, large persistent current account deficit unite state western economies. these imbalance proximate cause crisis, contribute scope intensity. in year lead crisis, high save rate surplus countries, together inflexible exchange rates, help keep global interest rate low, encourage 4 bi review 88/2010 consumer government advance economy take debt wise. the low interest rate also lead “search yield”, mean investor financial institution acquire risky assets. at time, debt repackaged various way – sometimes hard-to-understand, often illiquid, product – distribute throughout financial system. many product unravel – devastate consequence – crisis. global imbalance engender financial fragility also underlie weakness financial system many country – include deficiency supervision regulation inadequate risk management within financial institutions. address underlie weakness one principal objective g20 agenda. global imbalance narrow significantly past couple years. however, largely temporary effect recession policy adopt counter it. in unite state particular, save rate increase household try recuperate loss house equity wealth. in china, substantial stimulus measure boost domestic demand – include consumer spend infrastructure. and sizable drop commodity price 2008 peak contribute importantly narrow global imbalances. what worrying, however, global imbalance appear grow recovery advances, nature changing. whereas crisis, imbalance primarily correspond unsustainable household spend unite states, increasingly reflect unsustainable government deficit number countries. it clear need “rotation demand”: surplus country need increase domestic spending, deficit country need decrease theirs. together adjustment spending, exchange rate need adjust – depreciation u.s. dollar asian currency – support correspond adjustment external current accounts. in regard, china’s recent decision enhance flexibility exchange rate important step forward; full implementation contribute strong, sustainable, balance global economic growth. in absence necessary policy changes, three main risk global financial system global economy. one status quo become increasingly untenable. if surplus country increase domestic demand, unite state deficit country trouble wean economy fiscal stimulus. the result could buildup public debt relative size economies, could continue indefinitely. these high debt level would tend drive long-term interest rates, increase demand available fund feed concern ever-increasing debt burden would resolved. recently, bank canada look implication status quo scenario global economic growth. follow short-term boost, global economic growth would fall steadily 4 per cent average 2002–07 3 per cent 2013. in addition, macroeconomic imbalance would continue grow, possibly set stage another crisis. a second risk adjustment may lopsided. even surplus country expand demand, deficit country may force market reduce fiscal deficits. in case, would deficiency demand worldwide. with monetary policy constrain zero low bound, deflation could emerge. a result, real interest rate would increase, fiscal consolidation would difficult, growth would stall. a third risk exchange rate may adjust, disorderly way. if increase concern u.s. current account trigger portfolio shift away u.s. dollar, result exchange rate adjustment could overshoot level require bring current account sustainable levels. if occurred, would likely send shock wave throughout global financial system, adversely affect world economy. such adjustment happen recent financial crisis; contrary, retrenchment risk-taking bi review 88/2010 5 occur lead shift u.s.-dollar-denominated assets, result appreciation currency. but disorderly exchange rate adjustment remain one important risk associate global imbalances. it risk g20 place much emphasis policy achieve strong, sustainable, balance growth, tandem measure build robust global financial system. the rotation demand require achieve balance global growth require policy change deficit surplus countries. it also involve adopt great flexibility exchange rates, would facilitate adjustment current imbalance future economic shocks. how adjustment come about? an important step g20 mutual assessment process, way, g20 member strive ensure “policies pursue individual g20 country collectively consistent sustainable balance trajectory global economy.”2 each member country submit policy g20 assessment members, view promote coherence among macroeconomic policies. detail process work out, important thing require policy change implemented, timely manner. fail that, leave unsustainable, risky, path. allow conclude. conclusion the financial system make vital contribution welfare. a sound financial system, one stable, efficient, resilient shocks, crucial well-functioning economy. while world’s financial system strong crisis, risk vulnerability remain. the g20 agenda financial macroeconomic reform sound far-reaching. it provide blueprint build sound foundation. but time action arrived. we cannot afford complacent. although canada fare relatively well crisis, immune risk. we must continue make financial system resilient. together partners, bank canada work that. the bank also continue work international forum reduce systemic risk global financial system. the issue i discuss – sovereign debt global imbalance – important, must resolve effectively, timely fashion. our future well-being stake. 2 see “leaders’ statement: the pittsburgh summit,” available at:

would like spend next minute discuss share views. economic outlook at point, u.s. economy appear path recovery. subject risk i discus bite later, general outlook good. gdp grow nearly 4 percent pace second half last year, bottom last summer. i anticipate growth slow year, come 3 3½ percent. what perhaps encourage change composition growth seeing. last fall, good portion gdp growth could trace temporary factor relate fiscal stimulus inventory adjustment firm scale back bad recession. at time, considerable uncertainty might happen temporary factor subsided. however, recent data suggest recovery broad-based self-sustaining, perhaps even strong anticipated. consumer spending, make 70 percent gdp, expand solid pace. while consumer cautious big-ticket purchases, we’re start 2 bi review 88/2010 see sign change consumer confidence improves. manufacture activity continue sharp rebound, nonmanufacturing activity expand well. with business see recovery demand, business purchase equipment

credit last fall spring, give overhang unsold homes, build activity remain subdue year longer. nonresidential construction likely continue contract year, due high vacancy rate sector. these important negative derail recovery. look economy broadly, inflation drift low recent months, typical follow recession. while energy price keep consumer price inflation around 2 percent, inflation non-food non-energy price – core inflation – run rate around 1 percent. these inflation rate likely continue next year so. however, economic recovery continue pick momentum, i expect inflation drift higher. a

require deft handling. but certainly, first step toward normal policy move policy rate zero, back toward neutral. in say this, i illusion challenge move away zero. but judgment, process begin sooner avoid danger compensate later, often happen policy. i would begin normalization policy outline public two-step process: first, federal reserve would continue unwind extraordinary policy action implement response financial turmoil begin fall 2008. the market’s need facility ease close them, return bi review 88/2010 3 discount window normal operations. a part first step, fomc would also eliminate commitment maintain “exceptionally low level federal fund rate extend period.” second, step taken, improvement market condition liquidity, improve outlook, fomc would prepare raise fund rate target 1 percent end summer. this would continue current highly accommodative policy, would move nominal rate away zero real rate le negative level. we would pause, maintain fund rate 1 percent ass economic outlook emerge financial conditions. this would provide time judge whether degree policy adjustment warrant assure long-run financial equilibrium stability. base current outlook consensus, seem reasonable economy would well-positioned accept modest increase fund rate. a reminder, fund rate target remain 1 2 percent even intensification crisis fall 2008. it reduce current target range zero ¼ percent mid-december 2008. relative depth crisis, condition today much improve 18 month ago. financial stress clearly reduce sustainable economic recovery appear way. it also important emphasize 1 percent feed fund rate target, couple federal reserve’s large balance sheet, provide extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy environment one would ensure economy’s continue progress recovery. set plan would orderly move toward unwind early extraordinary action would serve reduce likelihood buildup new financial imbalances. let turn subsequent step might take fully restore policy long-run equilibrium policy level. give relatively modest expect trajectory growth inflation, add move involve quarter complete. but direction firmly establish time dependent performance combination financial, inflation growth variables. experience tell clear commitment action would mitigate likely need late tighten beyond estimate neutral often come delay. more specifically, next step involve raise fund rate 1 3 percent reasonably quickly gain confidence gdp employment steady path toward potential. the final step would take rate 3.5 4.5 percent economic growth approach long-run potential. if achieve steady rate environment, also important federal reserve’s balance sheet restore pre-crisis size composition. obviously require careful process sell federal reserve’s $1.3 trillion portfolio mortgage-backed securities. various approach identify agree do process time horizon clearly set see. i also would suggest begin least feed fund rate rise 1 percent sooner condition provide opportunity. monetary policy unemployment finally, i want spend minute suggest important move federal fund rate zero even though unemployment rate remain 9 percent. it argued, support evidence, federal reserve’s commitment low interest rate 2003 2004 low long contribute house credit boom subsequent busts. between august 2002 january 2005 – two-and-a-half year – federal fund rate rate core inflation. such low interest rate encourage borrow buildup 4 bi review 88/2010 debt, sometimes way fully appreciate much late benefit hindsight. in addition, low interest rate – especially commitment keep low – lead bank investor feel “safe” search yield, involve invest less-liquid risky assets. in addition, financial institution often search yield increase amount asset support dollar net worth – leverage. for example, leverage security broke dealer rise dramatically. after average 13-1/4 1970 2000, leverage climb high 40 third quarter 2007 – start financial crisis. it period too-low interest rates, much credit, much leverage collapse house bubble, rapid deleveraging ensue financial crisis occurred. and event unemployment rise 10 percent unite state lose 8.4 million jobs. in 2010, gain back 573,000 jobs. in another period, mid-1970s early 1980s, low interest rate also trigger extreme swing economic cycle. the real feed fund rate keep negative span nearly three years, november 1974 september 1977. the low interest rate environment lead initially drop unemployment rate. but rise inflation asset bubble eventually dictate restrictive monetary policy implement feed chairman paul volcker fomc colleagues. in end, nation pay high price low rate 1970s, unemployment reach 10.8 percent recession early 1980s. in drive achieve price stability stable growth, monetary policy powerful tool. certainly low interest rate appropriate monetary policy response onset economic recession rise unemployment. but also blunt instrument wide set intend also unintended consequence worsen economic outcome include misallocation precious resources, inflation long-term unemployment. that want return sustainable long-term equilibrium policy rate, start soon. the economy improve policy reflect fact, carefully confidently. although find unique environment, history offer u important lessons. if learn past mistakes, find repeat yet again. bi review 87/2010 1 jean-claude trichet: hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, hear economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 21 june 2010. * * * dear madam chair, dear honourable members, since last meet 22 march, euro area face one challenge period since begin economic monetary union. to address unprecedented pressure financial markets, public authority european union, include european central bank, take bold courageous steps. die wichtigen entscheidungen, die jüngster zeit getroffen wurden, erfordern fundierte erklärungen und antworten auf fragen, die sicherlich auch diesem hohen hause gestellt werden. daher begrüße ich die möglichkeit zum austausch anläßlich d heutigen anhörung ganz besonders. je commencerai donc mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique. je reviendrai ensuite sur la décision annoncée le 10 mai dernier de procéder à de intervention sur le marchés obligataires de la zone euro. dans une troisième partie, je pencherai sur le mécanismes de coordination économique de la zone euro et le changements que la situation actuelle appelle. i. economic monetary development since previous hear march, incoming data confirm continue recovery euro area first half 2010. accord late estimates, economy grow 0.2% quarter quarter first three month year. look ahead, early expectation euro area economy would expand moderate rate year next confirmed. the late projection eurosystem staff broadly line assessment. in view, risk outlook broadly balanced. nevertheless, recovery likely remain uneven time across economy sectors, environment continue uncertainty tension segment financial markets. the annual rate inflation euro area stand 1.6% may, slightly 1.5% april, mostly high energy prices. we may see slight increase inflation second half year. look ahead, continue expect price development remain moderate policy relevant medium-term horizon. our monetary analysis confirm inflationary pressure medium term well contained. this reflect particular overall weak growth money credit. the annual growth rate loan household continue strengthen, growth rate loan enterprise remain negative, expect current phase cycle. suggestion inflation might unanchored entirely unfounded. on contrary, euro area inflation expectation appear remarkably well anchored, line definition price stability. give outlook price stability solid anchor longer-term inflation expectations, govern council regard monetary policy stance current level key ecb interest rate appropriate. in order cope tension money 2 bi review 87/2010 markets, govern council decide reintroduce previous non-standard measures. in particular, go back full allotment 3-month 6-month operations, facilitate liquidity plan banks. and reactivate operation provide liquidity u dollars, coordination federal reserve number central banks, prevent possible liquidity tensions. ii. the ecb’s security market programme let turn govern council’s decision intervene euro area debt security markets, announce 10 may follow abrupt severe increase financial market tension throughout world, especially europe. those tension spread wide range financial market segments, include stock market, interbank market foreign exchange market. it observe epicentre tension lay european debt markets, particular government debt. although composition shock trigger intensification tension different observe october 2008 collapse lehman brother unite states, situation comparable term suddenness change sentiment abruptness flight safety international investors. overall volatility market increase sharply liquidity condition deteriorate significantly, sovereign bond markets, also critical degree money markets. transaction within interbank market decline rapidly uncertainty among bank counterparties’ creditworthiness increased. there therefore risk normal function market first link transmission mechanism monetary policy central bank credit institution could become impaired. this would mean ability banks, primary source finance euro area, provide credit real economy could seriously harmed. it background ecb announce 10 may reactivation previous non-standard measures, well reactivation swap agreement federal reserve, also intervention debt market launch security market programme. the single reason act crucial effective conduct monetary policy government bond market function properly possible. the government bond market important three reasons. 1. first, interest rate government bond usually set floor interest rate firm bank pay issue bonds. in circumstance highly disrupt bond markets, short-term interest rate central bank would long pass household firms, thereby prices, appropriate degree. this call price channel. 2. second, sharply low bond price imply much high interest rate associate disrupt bond market would cause significant loss portfolio financial non-financial sectors; banks, would reduce ability provide loan economy. this call balance sheet channel. 3. third, abnormally low liquidity government bond would reduce role collateral refinance operations, thereby also hind banks’ supply loans. this call liquidity channel. the decision start intervene bond market therefore take order help maintain appropriate transmission monetary policy real economy euro area address malfunction segment security markets. bi review 87/2010 3 a aim programme inject additional liquidity bank system, fully neutralise bond purchase mean specific reabsorption operations. a result, prevail level liquidity money market rate affect programme. in words, monetary policy stance affected, inflationary risk relate programme. let emphasise take decision introduce security market programme fully line provision treaty, operate secondary market government bonds. we also take decision complete independence. we aware commitment make euro area government prior weekend, even friday 7 may. in particular, govern council take note statement euro area government “will take measure need meet [their] fiscal target year year ahead line excessive deficit procedures” “precise additional commitment take euro area government accelerate fiscal consolidation ensure sustainability public finances”. (quotes statement euro area head state government, brussels, 7 may 2010) this bring third issue i would like discuss. iii. economic governance crossroad you ask speak enhance economic coordination surveillance euro area. the ecb belief true quantum leap need framework surveillance adjustment fiscal policies, well broad macroeconomic policy concern europe’s competitiveness. “la solidarité de fait ” robert schuman call 60 year ago reflect degree economic integration interdependence already achieve monetary union. but solidarity two-way street. the benefit protection derive membership monetary union bring responsibility obligations. this fundamental contract form basis currency. we turn effective structure fiscal macroeconomic surveillance adjustment. in line topic address task force chair european council president van rompuy, let focus two main area reform. a third area, crisis management framework, still examine level task force. first, essence surveillance budgetary policy strengthened. i please note european council confirm assessment meet last thursday. at level eu27, particular within euro area, must effective instrument prevent – and, necessary, correct – excessive deficit debt levels. a stringent implementation rule procedure essential, among thing increase automaticity speed procedural steps. the initiation sanction also need quasi-automatic. fiscal surveillance must direct effective. it must also base independent monitor assessment. we may need differentiate approach surveillance depend fiscal performance countries. the commission great responsibility make proposals, modify unanimity council, rather mere recommendation stability growth pact. in event non-compliance, sanction need apply much early broad scope. they address excessive debt ratios, also apply country make sufficient progress towards medium-term budgetary objectives. a wide spectrum financial sanction need considered, along non-financial 4 bi review 87/2010 procedural sanctions, stringent report requirement even limitation suspension vote rights. the second area may appear novel, level european union level euro area, ecb fact stress eurogroup since least 2005: surveillance policy maintain europe’s internal external competitiveness – policy raise productivity, enhance people’s skill improve firms’ competitiveness. these policy go well beyond tradable sector. they must also encompass non-tradable sector, include public sector, since decisive competitiveness economy whole. conscious management wage cost order maintain healthy position economy within competitive environment – core focus broad macroeconomic surveillance. the reason competitiveness main focus country pursue export-oriented policy boost international market share. the reason within monetary union, relative competitiveness economy capture well sustainability price cost developments. i please last thursday’s european council confirm need effective surveillance framework area. experience show persistent divergence regard detrimental member state monetary union whole. a fiscal surveillance, framework need allow target differentiate surveillance follow-up measures. for country experience significant loss competitiveness, surveillance become increasingly deep detailed. more ad hoc report dedicate country missions, policy recommendations, compliance requirements, public peer pressure gradual financial step encourage compliance could part process. for work, need transparent effective trigger mechanism determine intensity vulnerability surveillance. this base close monitor report commission ecb. expert currently develop way best capture complexity issue, well procedure indicator could use surveillance adjustment framework. if put place effective surveillance adjustment framework fiscal competitiveness policy – ensure appropriate regulation financial system serf real economy way around – european union economic monetary union exit crisis much strong well place global economy. iv. conclusion honourable members, let conclude say steer course difficult times, must clearly work hard, must also maintain ambition. this mean decision need proportional importance union. a single market 500 million citizen economic monetary union 330 million citizen – among large advance economy world build solid foundation term human social capital – cannot measure accord strength weakness individual component alone. particularly regard economic monetary union, policy-makers need internalise mean part monetary union, word deeds. i therefore much welcome call parliament ambitious reforms. the reaction europe time crisis always strengthen european cohesion. i bi review 87/2010 5 would like urge you, member european parliament, representative europe’s citizens, continue give support course action. thank attention. bi review 87/2010 1 george a provopoulos: the greek economic crisis euro speech mr george a provopoulos, governor bank greece, scholar association alexander s onassis public benefit foundation international conference, athens, 21 june 2010. * * * it great pleasure take part conference “financial economic crisis” organise scholar association onassis foundation. aristotle onassis, originator foundation, was, among things, creative thinker philanthropist. he arrive greece early 1920s refugee and, wise decision-making hard work, become internationally-prominent entrepreneur. however, never forget origin and, exemplify foundation, pass future generation ability advance scientific artistic knowledge. my presentation deal origin present crisis europe lesson crisis europe’s single currency, euro. greece epicentre crisis; presentation will, therefore, highlight greek root crisis. the origin to provide perspective present situation, let u look back year. at time, conference hold throughout europe celebrate tenth anniversary euro. academic economist write article speculate euro poise challenge u.s. dollar lead international currency. what difference year makes! today, analyst write possible break-up euro zone, notion that, i explain, absurd. meanwhile, euro fall sharply dollar since begin year, speculation euro soon replace dollar lead international currency subsided. how come far fast? how could greece, country 2 ½ per cent euro-area gdp, cause tremor magnitude shake foundation europe’s single currency? to answer questions, need consider basis upon monetary union europe built. the inception euro zone january 1, 1999 mark world premiere. for first time history, sovereign state – eleven time – abandon national currency favor common currency, euro, surrender monetary-policy sovereignty newly-created, supranational institution, european central bank. all previous monetary union among sovereign state involve least element coercion. for example, fifteen country comprise former soviet union choice use rouble currency. in case euro zone, contrast, member willingly give national currency euro. the euro adopt monetary union confer number important advantage participate countries.  for country history high inflation, greece, low inflation expectation and, therefore, nominal interest rates. with low nominal interest rates, cost service public-sector debt reduced, facilitate fiscal adjustment free resource uses.  with low inflation, economic horizon lengthen, encourage borrow lend long maturities. the lengthen horizon reduction interest rate stimulate private investment risk-taking, foster economic growth. 2 bi review 87/2010  for participate countries, away possibility competitive devaluations, thus boost intra-area trade.  it introduce common measure value across countries, increase price transparency and, therefore, competition.  it eliminate cost convert currencies, thereby facilitate trade investment.  it eliminate exchange-rate fluctuation among participate countries, thereby reduce risk premia.  it eliminate need foreign-exchange reserve intra-area transactions, thereby reduce cost conduct business. these advantage common currency exist long central bank monetary union deliver price stability credible. in case euro zone, ecb quickly establish anti-inflation credential become credible. so much benefit euro. what costs? in join euro area, country give two potential tool adjust domestic economy event country-specific shock. first, lose ability set domestic monetary policy. second, lose ability change nominal exchange rate currency. to compensate loss two potential tools, country posse following:  relatively-low fiscal imbalances, fiscal policy use counter-cyclically case country-specific shock occurs,  flexible labour product markets, country competitive without rely change exchange rate domestic currency achieve and/or maintain competitiveness. the need low fiscal imbalance flexible labour product market especially important euro area. unlike unite states, example, euro area central fiscal authority redistribute fiscal resource low-unemployment region high-unemployment region reduce effect asymmetric shocks. moreover, language cultural difference among european countries, labour le mobile among euro-area country among region unite states. for reasons, all-the-more important adjustment mechanism place national level euro zone. low fiscal imbalance flexible product labour market provide mechanism smooth adjustment shocks. against backdrop advantage constraint common currency, let describe salient feature greek economy since become twelfth member euro area january 1, 2001. the greek economy: 2001–2009 entry euro area provide greece improved, stability-oriented environment. the ecb – – guardian monetary stability. the stability growth pact suppose help ensure fiscal discipline. these change economic environment crucial benefit country experience persistent budget deficits, inflation rate double-digit level early-1980s mid-1990s. not surprisingly, new environment, especially low interest rates, contribute robust real growth rates. from 2001 2008, real gdp rise average 3.9 per cent per year – second-highest growth rate (after ireland) euro zone – underpin household spend consumption, house investment, business investment. inflation, average almost ten per cent decade prior euro area entry, average 3.4 per cent period 2001 2008. bi review 87/2010 3 on surface, therefore, greek economy appear enter new era mark robust growth low inflation. beneath surface, however, long-standing problem continuing.  fiscal policy pro-cyclical throughout period 2001 2009, deficit consistently exceed stability pact’s limit 3 per cent wide margin durable progress low public debt-to-gdp ratio.  expansionary fiscal policy mainly expenditure-driven, lead rise share government spending; three years, 2006 2009, share government spend increase 43 per cent gdp 50 per cent.  although inflation greece 2001 2009 low country’s historical standards, inflation relatively-high euro-area standards. inflation was, average, one percentage point high per year rest euro area. wage increases, adjust productivity changes, also exceed average increase rest euro area.  with price wage grow relatively high rates, competitiveness declined. in period 2001 2009, competitiveness, measure consumer prices, decline almost twenty per cent; measure unit labour costs, competitiveness decline 25 per cent.  with relatively high real growth rate decline competitiveness, current-account deficit, already top 7 per cent gdp 2001, rise 14 ½ per cent gdp 2007 2008. the large grow fiscal external imbalance sustainable. on various occasions, include publication annual report bi-annual monetary policy reports, past several year bank greece stress unsustainability imbalance need urgent policy adjustments. unfortunately, call action heeded. the present financial crisis outcome lack policy response imbalances. the crisis greek economy the present financial crisis mark third stage crisis erupt august 2007, follow collapse u subprime mortgage market, escalate demise lehman’s brother thirteen month later. yet, first two year global financial crisis, greek economy escape relatively unscathed. there few, any, forewarn greek economy would become object speculators’ attention. the spread greek german sovereign ten-year bonds, key indicator relative risk perceive credit markets, hover around 130 basis point period august october 2009. early year, height lehman’s phase crisis, spread climb 300 basis points. that early widen spread occur despite fact market expect fiscal deficit le 4 per cent gdp debt-to-gdp level 96 per cent gdp, figure would repeatedly revise upward remainder year. in fall 2009, two development combine disrupt relative tranquility greek financial markets. first, october newly-elected greek government announce 2009 fiscal deficit would 12.7 per cent gdp, double previous government’s projection. in turn, 12.7 per cent figure would undergo upward revisions, bring 13.6 per cent gdp. second, november 2009 dubai world, conglomerate own government gulf emirate, ask creditor six-month debt standstill. that news rattle financial market around world lead sharp increase risk aversion. 4 bi review 87/2010 in light rapid sharp worsen fiscal situation greece, financial market rat agency turn attention sustainability greece’s fiscal external imbalances. the previously-held notion membership euro area would provide impenetrable barrier risk shaken. it become clear that, membership provide protection exchange-rate risk, cannot provide protection credit risk. the subsequent course event make global headlines, i need dwell details. allow me, however, highlight following.  first, contrast origin initial stage global crisis august 2007, involve crisis u.s. bank sector spill real economy, greece problem pose fiscal external imbalance spill real economy. the greek bank sector sound fundamental reflected, example, high capital-adequacy tier 1 ratios.  second, crisis greece contribute widen spread euro-area country judge large fiscal and/or external imbalances. the spread crisis part geographical area represent continuation process observe recent crises, include latin america 1994/95 asia 1997/98.  third, commitment greek government reduce fiscal deficit last year’s 13.6 per cent gdp 8 per cent year 3 per cent 2013, 110-billion euro support package agree greek government european commission, ecb, imf, unprecedented term magnitudes. i doubt government take whatever measure need attain fiscal objective ensure fiscal sustainability. it will, however, take time convince market government’s determination achieve goals. decade fiscal mismanagement faulty fiscal report cause market adopt saint thomas’s dictum: see believe.  fourth, i also confident government implement structural reform privatisation part support package. these need reduce excessive bureaucracy rigidity labour, product service market discourage investment high-value add sectors. allow say word greece’s debt situation. some market analyst opinion greece’s debt dynamic unsustainable. they wrong. they overlook fact crucial element underlie evolution debt-to-gdp ratio denominator ratio, include growth real output. in connection, combination factor comprise support program – is, fiscal discipline, liberalisation markets, privatisations, measure increase efficiency bureaucracy – contribute confidence, decrease size public sector, reduce interest-rate spreads, boost competitiveness economic growth. in turn, high growth, along decline fiscal deficits, cause reversal rise debt-to-gdp ratio observe recent years. moreover, fiscal discipline add saving, thereby support private investment growth potential. these effect may visible immediately, materialize revitalise greek economy. some lesson what, then, lesson draw crisis? in view, key lesson concern limit use fiscal policy follows.  first, view fiscal policy use flexible way smooth effect shock monetary union show overly simplistic. a case greece illustrates, systematic use fiscal policy past lead bi review 87/2010 5 problem debt-sustainability, constrain current use fiscal policy. i need mention fiscal expansion many country relatively-low debt level immediate aftermath lehman crisis successful lessen impact dislocation real economies. even countries, however, need decisive action achieve last credible consolidation public finances.  second, rather smooth adjustment shocks, greece pro-cyclical fiscal policy major source shocks. it lead increase size government sector economy, increase bureaucratic inefficiency crowding-out traded-goods sector economy.  third, fiscal transfer face permanent shock perverse effect lock resource place, and, thereby, prevent necessary adjustment. the remedy non-competitive area economy channel even-larger amount government spend area rather introduce structural reform improve overall competitiveness allow transfer resource more-dynamic sector economy.  fourth, seen, country large fiscal imbalance monetary union create negative spillover effects, raise interest rate increase cost debt service member union. the credibility ecb provide potential low interest-rate environment, foster high growth employment throughout euro area. however, recent event underlined, monetary policy need complement responsible fiscal policy maintain low-interest-rate environment. conclusion a i mention outset, euro area capacity deliver enormous advantage members. to benefit fully advantage require fiscal responsibility open flexible markets. it also require governance structure ensure stability growth pact fulfill role key pillar euro area. the support package agree greek government european commission, ecb imf provide government unique opportunity adjust economy. the package provide blueprint sharply reduce fiscal imbalance undertake structural reforms. it set-off positive growth dynamic will, among things, low debt-to-gdp ratio. the growth potential greek economy enormous. it firm belief present crisis prove catalyst reshape economy, make greece competitive prosperous member euro zone. it also firm belief long article start talk euro’s strong position international currency. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 87/2010 1 josé manuel gonzález-páramo: reform architecture financial system speech mr josé manuel gonzález-páramo, member executive board european central bank, universidad del país vasco, campus de leioa, bilbao, 21 june 2010. * * * i grateful frank dierick contribution speech inês cabral balázs zsamboki inputs. lady gentlemen, i. introduction it pleasure city bilbao, host one fine modern art museum spain europe: guggenheim museum. with distinct architecture, museum city’s world-famous hallmark. much i love design building, however, i talk today another type architecture, namely financial system. and like guggenheim building, current reform financial system stir lot emotions. we deal broad topic i approach like tourist visit guggenheim museum. i start give broad overview, describe landscape were. i briefly review cause financial crisis run main initiative plate policy maker prevent crisis magnitude severity ever recur again. then i turn four eye-catching initiatives:  first, establishment european systemic risk board esrb, new body first time become responsible macro-prudential supervision eu;  second, policy maker deal systemically important institutions;  third, issue procyclicality dynamic interplay financial sector real economy;  fourth last topic i pay attention mandate central bank area financial stability. let u embark architectural walk! ii. cause current crisis much say root cause current crisis past three years. i expand topic i mention specific factor – macro- others micro-economic nature – view key run crisis. in two three year crisis erupted, constellation factors, include favourable macro-financial condition combine strong growth, low inflation, ample liquidity, exceptionally low volatility across virtually financial market extraordinarily low risk premia, effect cover build significant imbalances. significant financial imbalance making, various level global economy financial system. among exuberant real estate prices, flourish 2 bi review 87/2010 securitisation business, facilitate excessive credit growth. a group country – include china, japan, oil-exporting economy – save much, others – u – heavily borrow finance consumption investment. these development unsustainable long-run. at time, environment characterise low interest rates, global search yield may lead investor take much risk. on micro side, become apparent market participants’ incentive align risk taking, investor fully aware extent exposures, contribute under-pricing risk. in bank sector particular, deficiency design prudential framework banks, supervisory review banks’ risk management procedure rule compensation pay microeconomic factor lead important vulnerabilities. iii. regulatory supervisory initiative currently discussion after witness first global bank crisis since great depression, become clear absolutely crucial get bank sector sound foot again. policy maker respond rather quickly forcefully crisis, result wide-encompassing reform agenda. this reform agenda ambitious time-wise rather tight, describe measure discussion, let first briefly introduce main actor area. the g20 provide political strategic impetus reforms, financial stability board (fsb) play important role policy coordination. various committee work groups, prominent basel committee bank supervision, charge review specific international standards. a regard reform agenda, important issue following:  adoption high-quality capital liquidity standard banks,  measure reduce financial system’s procyclicality,  introduction regulatory framework systemically important financial institutions,  regulation credit rat agency hedge funds, improve otc derivative markets,  finally, sound compensation practice support financial stability. these issue comprehensively address basel committee’s reform package aim strengthen bank sector’s resilience represent cornerstone response crisis. the package, release end last year consultation, aim improve quality consistency bank capital. it also consider introduction non-risk-based leverage ratio supplementary capital measure. this leverage ratio expect curb excessive balance sheet growth set floor basel ii capital requirements. in order mitigate inherent pro-cyclical nature financial activities, i return later, basel committee’s proposal also contain capital buff forward-looking provisioning. finally, proposal include global minimum liquidity risk requirement enable credit institution withstand short-term liquidity stress aim ensure longer-term stability fund requirements. the objective comprehensive package enable financial institution good withstand adverse effect economic shocks. in order ass cumulative impact proposals, quantitative impact assessment underway. the outcome available come weeks, assist decision-makers properly calibrate measures. at stage, therefore, premature say anything desirable bi review 87/2010 3 calibration measures. nevertheless, i view measure warrant conceptual point view, though cumulative impact need carefully assessed. indeed, important right balance strike enhance bank stability maintain stable provision credit economy. iv. what done? the main strand reform agenda i come paint various stage development. it therefore useful briefly run already achieved, particular europe. start prudential framework banks, fsb members, include eu member states, fully implement risk-sensitive basel ii framework. amendment trade book due implement late end 2011 address problem excessively low capital charge trade activity pre-crisis period. in eu, appropriate measure include amendment capital requirement directive, so-called crd3 package. the fsb finish peer review member implement agree principle sound compensation practices. in eu, crd3 specifically include banks’ remuneration policy supervisory review. an eu regulation credit rat agency – come effect end 2010 – adopt last year. the european commission recently propose amendment regulation aim introduce centralise framework supervision agency eu level. under new supervisory framework, european security market authority oversight supervisory power credit rat agency established. effort field aim address shortcoming credit rat sector reveal crisis, conflict interest, poor rat quality insufficient transparency method use evaluation procedure rat decisions. a legislative proposal establish regulatory supervisory standard hedge fund also consideration eu. finally two major account standard setters, iasb fasb, continue effort achieve convergence account standards, though might possible keep initially agree time table. i turn important response europe crisis, particular interest ecb: establishment european systemic risk board esrb. this new body responsible macro-prudential supervision whole eu. in contrast micro-prudential supervision, focus financial soundness individual institutions, macro-prudential supervision look financial system whole. up late 1990s, predominant view policy maker individual institution financially sound, financial system whole would also fine. unfortunately, always case. through various channels, institution inter-linked problem emerge one may spill rest financial sector, set motion adverse dynamic affect them. a macro-prudential perspective, look beyond condition institution isolation, help detect prevent system-wide potential problems. of course, already place mechanism monitor assessment financial stability well financial crisis erupted, evidence financial stability report publish various central banks. but financial crisis also demonstrate fundamental weakness practices: 4 bi review 87/2010  first, various central bank engage financial stability analysis really comprehensive analysis cover whole eu element financial system.  second, many analysis express serious concerns, persistence global imbalance investors’ hunt high yields, concern sufficiently followed-up concrete action. there therefore need improve interplay micro- macro-prudential supervision since many tool correct possible risk micro-prudential realm. to aim, esrb able issue risk warn and, appropriate, recommendation follow-up implementation. the legislative proposal establishment esrb currently discuss among relevant european institution foresee important role ecb esrb stand ready take role. we support member european system central bank (escb), constellation national central bank european union. the ecb support esrb provide analytical, logistical administrative support esrb well esrb secretariat. preparatory work ecb underway esrb take work right formal establishment, expect early next year. the ecb also process enhance capability monitor assess financial stability risks, least provide high-quality analytical input esrb. in pursuit objective, also try draw much possible synergy exist work resource within ecb escb, well supervisory authorities. i conclude point establishment esrb watershed event develop macro-prudential framework europe. have say that, i also say esrb easy mission certainly face many challenges. macro-prudential supervision relatively new, imply well-established framework clear operational objective, know monetary policy, must yet set place. the esrb therefore develop think strategy, probably advance pragmatic way. the interplay micro-prudential function crucial, esrb rely large extent micro-prudential supervisor information data, also number tool expect address potential weakness financial system micro-prudential nature. in respect, i recall esrb bind power rely moral suasion peer pressure follow-up risk warn recommendations. and finally esrb strive effectiveness efficiency pursuit tasks, give relatively wide composition (over 60 members). v. a look future take forward-looking perspective, i sure one important topic esrb’s agenda systemically important financial institution (sifis). these institution major contributor financial jargon know “systemic risk” are, therefore, great interest macro-prudential supervisors. how gauge contribution financial institution systemic risk, word identify sifi, difficult task, least data limitations. nevertheless, number factor seem particularly relevant, size institution, interconnectedness rest financial system degree substitutability event failure critical service provide. it clear assessment cannot exclusively base quantitative approach. rather, inform judgment bi review 87/2010 5 relevant authorities, guide internationally agree principles, play important role. indeed, concept systemic risk fuzzy still debate, but, certain degree simplification, define risk impairment financial system potentially serious negative consequence real economy. for example, actual default major bank may seriously affect depositors’ save (though reimbursement insure level retail deposit provide deposit insurance schemes) finance otherwise profitable investment projects. but even case actual default, sifis may pose serious challenges. because potentially high damage financial system real economy case default, expectation government supervisor would let sifi fail. this implicit support may provide incentive institution engage profitable risky activities, give rise “moral hazard”. it also mean sifi finance low cost compare similar institutions, deem systemically important. in short, incentive misalign play field distorted. these problem probably increase wake financial crisis follow voluntary, less-voluntary, marriage among institution create even big complex financial groups. reflect concerns, g20 summit april last year london, decide sifis subject appropriate degree regulation oversight. at time, g20 entrust fsb task oversee concrete regulatory step monitor implementation. the fsb consider various policy option address concern i mentioned. in general terms, two way address ex ante problem sifis pose: restrict scope activity force internalise cost pose system. the clear illustration first approach discussion “volcker rule” unite states. under rule, bank receive deposit would prevent engage proprietary trading, invest sponsor hedge fund private equity funds. i believe fruitful way pursue europe, give traditional strength universal bank model number member states. also, may challenge associate define borderline proprietary trade service clients. but importantly, activity see deserve special attention may move outside intensively regulate supervise bank business, stay within group. one could argue effect control risk stem trade business reach impose high capital requirement banks’ trade book activities, seem way pursue internationally. the basel committee already increase capital requirement number trade book activities, fundamental review trade book plan

topic g20 summit late 6 bi review 87/2010 month toronto. in view discussion properly frame overall reform prudential framework, include quantitative impact assessment various initiative i mention earlier. such careful assessment warranted, inter alia, avoid impose undue burden bank sector and, ultimately, hamper flow credit real economy. another important element basel reform package introduction range measure design mitigate inherent pro-cyclicality financial system. in context, mechanism enhance prudent forward-looking provision bank well build sufficient capital buff year economic expansion draw time stress, consideration. overall, measure aim ensure financial system function absorber, rather amplifier shocks, thus smooth volatility financial real economic cycles. in set forward-looking provision framework, basel committee work closely together account standard setter view develop sound operational framework expect loss provisioning. in context, let mention important collaborative effort way basel committee iasb develop revise expect loss model prof operational. concern measure capital buffers, basel committee set forth proposal capital conservation buff

hildebrand, chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 17 june 2010. * * * the swiss national bank (snb) maintain expansionary monetary policy. consequently, leave target range three-month libor unchanged 0.00–0.75% intend hold libor low part target range, around 0.25%. the recovery global economy continue swiss economy benefit it. although weaken euro respect swiss franc dampen export activity, activity support growth foreign demand. the domestic sector still perform favourably. for 2010, snb expect real gdp growth 2.0%. in view please developments, deflationary risk switzerland largely disappeared. at time, uncertainty increase since last monetary policy assessment. the late tension financial markets, particularly regard public finance individual countries, increase downside risks. should downside risk materialise and, via appreciation swiss franc, lead renew threat deflation, snb would take measure necessary ensure price stability. the snb’s conditional inflation forecast 2010 2011 increase slightly since march. it remain unchanged 2012. assume unchanged three-month libor 0.25%, average inflation 2010 expect amount 0.9%, 2011 1.0% 2012 2.2%. this forecast show short-term price stability guaranteed. it also show current expansionary monetary policy cannot maintain entire forecast horizon without compromise medium long-term price stability. the forecast still associate considerable uncertainties. global economic outlook i would like take close look economic situation monetary conditions. the upturn global economy continues, support economic policy remain accommodating. the emerge economies, particular, record high gdp growth rates. the u see recovery domestic demand labour market. in europe, restrain expenditure part household company mean economic activity remain subdued. however, positive movement new order index european manufacture suggest strong economic growth. global growth forecast 2010 2011 revise upwards. the small revision european economy. on one hand, restrictive fiscal policy likely hold back growth europe. on hand, however, growth support depreciation euro low capital market interest rate major eu economies. however, development associate considerable uncertainties. the big risk global economy continue increase tension financial markets, particularly due public finance individual countries. this could affect real economy via loss confidence part household company well additional burden banks. at time, upside risk global economy. domestic demand emerge economy u could, 2 bi review 85/2010 again, prove surprisingly robust. in europe, export activity could increase strongly expected. swiss economic outlook in switzerland, economic recovery continued. in first quarter 2010, real gdp rise 1.6% annualised basis, 2.2% year-back quarter. economic activity mainly drive household demand export good services. the firm economic recovery lead renew rise demand labour, short-time work fell significantly. since begin year, seasonally adjust unemployment also fall slightly. lead indicator labour demand point upwards. the snb anticipate gradual improvement labour market. despite uncertainty connection public finance many countries, global economic activity still supportive effect. consequently, capacity export sector likely increasingly good utilised. consumption construction investment support improve labour market outlook expansionary monetary policy. the snb expect real gdp increase approximately 2% 2010 whole. monetary financial condition the expansionary monetary policy reflect monetary conditions. since last november, three-month libor hold desire level 0.25%. however, mid-may begin sink rapidly currently well level. the fall rate sign bank system currently hold large amount liquidity. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, talk great detail. interest rate capital market also fallen. in june, yield 10-year swiss confederation bond fell record level. the low capital market interest rate reflect high demand swiss government bonds. in addition, long-term inflation expectation continue firmly anchored. private company also benefit low interest rate capital markets. credit risk premia fall rate interest bank loan also low level. since last monetary policy assessment, swiss franc appreciate euro. it simultaneously depreciate u dollar. a result, trade-weighted external value swiss franc slightly increased. the expansionary monetary policy also reflect monetary aggregates. thus, monetary base rise record chf 128.6 billion may, growth monetary aggregate continue high level. for example, m2 grow 10.2% may m3 7.1%. credit growth also increase further. after slow 2.7% september 2009, rate growth increase 4.1% april. this acceleration attributable loan secure mortgages, grow since april. mortgage loan grow rate 5% april. there still sign credit crunch survey bank lend condition conduct regularly snb. the survey even provide initial indication possible trend reversal. during financial crisis, number bank report slight tighten loan conditions. however, first quarter 2010, bank (for first time) report easing. we continue observe considerable increase loan volume residential mortgages. this increase, along movement real estate prices, represent risk demand full attention snb. my colleague, thomas jordan, discus topic great depth. bi review 85/2010 3 development snb’s balance sheet consequence monetary policy in follow remarks, let focus extraordinary development snb’s balance sheet. a case central banks, balance sheet undergo considerable expansion change composition since begin financial crisis. by may 2010, nearly triple size chf 300 billion. this extraordinary development balance sheet direct consequence monetary policy. the snb low interest rate sharply financial crisis, spring 2009, traditional interest rate instrument practically exhausted. consequently – incipient threat deflation – snb adopt unconventional measure loosen monetary condition further. by carry long-term repo transaction foreign exchange swaps, acquire swiss franc bond issue private sector borrower purchase foreign currency, bank system supply large amount liquidity. in past months, foreign exchange purchases, particular, effective instrument avert deflationary risks. while liquidity create purchase foreign exchange swiss franc bond permanent nature, liquidity result repos currency swap temporary. it flow back automatically transaction renewed. this occur large extent meantime. the considerable expansion snb’s balance sheet therefore primarily attributable increase foreign exchange reserves. these quadruple chf 230 billion result intervention since begin financial crisis. from today, snb also publish information current foreign exchange reserve website (www.snb.ch) begin month. the high level foreign exchange reserve inevitably increase currency risk mean debtor concentrate major countries. these risk ultimately represent burden snb assume order protect swiss economy threat deflation, line mandate. balance sheet risk rise overall. the snb reap benefit continuously increase allocation provision previous years. this give room manoeuvre need measure time crisis. the high allocation provision decide recently strengthen snb’s capital base. the snb sufficient equity capital withstand even large losses. in long term, large part liquidity create excess liquidity. a colleague, jean-pierre danthine, explain, snb necessary instrument disposal withdraw liquidity. inflation forecast chart i would like comment new, conditional inflation forecast detail. the (dashed) red curve chart represent new, conditional inflation forecast. it cover period second quarter 2010 first quarter 2013 show future inflation development assumption three-month libor remain constant 0.25% entire forecast horizon. for purpose comparison, (dash-dotted) green curve show inflation outlook publish march, also base assumption three-month libor 0.25%. the new forecast show unchanged inflation prospects. however, new data lead slight upward revision inflation forecast short term, inflation arrive nearly 1% second quarter 2010. since oil price first half 2009 low 2010, level due base effect attributable oil prices. thereafter, inflation project remain 1% second quarter 2011. on one hand, base effect attributable oil price weakens. on hand, production remain potential. the forecast show – libor remain level target today – inflation accelerate third quarter 2011 onwards. at 2.2%, inflation forecast 4 bi review 85/2010 2012 march forecast. the forecast show current expansionary monetary policy cannot maintain entire forecast horizon without compromise medium long-term price stability. the forecast still associate considerable uncertainties. bi review 85/2010 1 jean-pierre danthine: signal financial market development implementation swiss monetary policy introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, geneva, 17 june 2010. * * * a point speech two colleagues, report economy quite positive indicate fast economic recovery anticipated. the signal financial markets, however, le favourable i talk first part remarks. i devote second part comment today development implementation monetary policy last months. these development result unconventional monetary policy measure adopt swiss national bank (snb) combat financial crisis ensure price stability line mandate. international financial market experience uncertain period the period calm prevail international market spring 2009 onwards give way new phase uncertainty second quarter 2010. since april 2010, climate financial market deteriorate again. share price fallen, credit risk rise instability increase major foreign exchange markets. a philipp hildebrand already stated, return uncertainty chiefly reflect investors’ doubt capacity certain country service debt. these doubt reflect significant increase risk premia sovereign debt countries, prompt establish major cost-cutting programmes. this situation weigh financial markets, despite relatively favourable report economic recovery global level. indeed, current market uncertainty reach high level, although remain low observe recent crisis. to give example, vix index (which measure uncertainty equity market) cdx index (which measure credit risk) rise again. however, still significantly low end 2008, i.e. peak subprime crisis (cf. chart 1). the uncertainty associate fiscal situation certain european country also trigger another rise tension interbank market u dollars. to counter this, several central banks, include snb, reactivate swap facility cooperation federal reserve order provide dollar liquidity may require smooth function markets. in switzerland, interbank market remain calm. indeed, ample supply liquidity reduce swiss franc interbank rates. a see chart 2, risk premia swiss franc interbank market also declined. they fell half may while, period, u dollar risk premia interbank market u rise again. alongside uncertainty, investor risk aversion grow last months. a result, movement capital direction investment consider secure (flight quality). this reflected, example, rise gold price since february 2010. in may 2010, gold price swiss franc reach new heights. the flight quality also consequence switzerland, since country traditionally regard safe investors. this situation reinforce fact that, now, swiss economy withstand crisis good develop countries. this result upward pressure swiss franc, lead repeat intervention foreign exchange market. the liquidity inject market course intervention reduce swiss franc interest rates, 2 bi review 85/2010 particular short term maturities. in addition, yield 10-year swiss confederation bond fell 1.50% may 2010. for sake completeness, point swiss franc currency appreciate. the yen, u dollar currency nordic country also strengthen euro. invest foreign exchange reserve a already mention philipp hildebrand, snb implement unconventional monetary policy order combat financial crisis avert deflation risks. this result expansion snb balance sheet, take place two stages. in first stage, crisis, snb make use eur/chf swaps, second stage, confront appreciation swiss franc, intervene foreign exchange market. a part unconventional measures, snb purchase swiss franc bond issue private sector swiss borrower temporarily extend term repo operations. today i go focus impact snb’s intervention balance sheet. in interventions, snb purchase euro well as, less extent, u dollars. these acquisition lead significant increase currency reserves, rise chf 95 billion december 2009 chf 230 billion end may 2010. the foreign exchange acquire snb intervention place securities. the snb’s investment policy found criterion security liquidity, also return. in order satisfy requirement security liquidity, snb focus purchase liquid instrument first-class quality. all investment activity carry accord strategy base upon diversification, also take account potentially major low-probability events. a aim strategy ensure maximum resilience snb balance sheet. for sake completeness, let add that, give accumulation additional dollar reserves, issuance snb bill initiate february 2009 finance snb stabilisation fund long necessary. consequently, snb suspend issuance snb usd bills. the last auction hold 21 june 2010. a already mention philipp hildebrand, extent foreign exchange intervention lead high risk concentration snb. however, monetary policy consideration remain paramount. furthermore, need keep overall picture mind. thus, since portfolio well diversified, loss record overall since begin year. this due, particular, investment foreign currency euro well gold investments, also constitute one main source risk. what more, important time period long term horizon potential exchange rate loss offset (at least part) return foreign exchange investments. finally, must bear mind snb set aside substantial provision absorb possible future losses. transition liquidity deficit excess liquidity financial system the unconventional measure take snb combat impact crisis avert deflation risk lead ample supply liquidity financial system. therefore, witness gradual shift liquidity deficit situation characterise excess liquidity. in fact, crisis, bank obtain liquidity snb order satisfy minimum reserve requirements. today, sufficient liquidity function without finance via snb. this situation excess liquidity permanent nature. the transition liquidity shortage excess liquidity not, however, change snb’s monetary policy strategy, still aim stabilise three-month libor within target range set snb. the implementation strategy nevertheless bi review 85/2010 3 adjust reflect new liquidity conditions. in time liquidity shortage, snb must supply market liquidity keep libor target level. if excess liquidity, must drain liquidity market order keep libor desire level (cf. chart 3). this situation compare driver go mountain pass. drive hill, push gas pedal order keep vehicle drive certain speed. on way down, however, must step brake continue travel pace. monetary policy snb bill reverse repos the snb central bank find situation excess liquidity. the majority central bank take unconventional monetary policy measure position. central bank range measure disposal reduce excess liquidity. after analyse different alternatives, snb decide use combination snb bill reverse repos. these instrument perfectly line monetary policy strategy. there is, however, still range alternative instrument available, need them. let explain briefly method choose snb works. a i already mentioned, snb aim keep three-month libor within certain target range. this rate depend level liquidity financial markets. if excess liquidity, snb must withdraw certain amount influence level libor. in doing, us two-pronged approach: one hand, issue snb bill different terms. bank investor purchase bill pay snb liquid funds, thus drain financial system. on hand, snb also make use reverse repos order complete withdrawal liquidity achieve use snb bills. in reverse repo, snb deliver security bank exchange liquid funds, thereby absorb liquidity financial system. reverse repos term of, general, one week use manage short-term liquidity. snb bills, hand, use manage liquidity long term (one month more). by combine two instruments, snb able determine volume liquidity want drain system, thereby influence three-month libor. the snb continue use three-month libor target range reference band monetary policy. the use snb bill reverse repos the snb issue snb bill since october 2008. at begin month, secondary market buy sell short-term debt certificate established. this secondary market improve market liquidity. snb bill advantages. first, flexible term adapt monetary policy objectives. second, permit great flexibility issue high volumes. the snb step issuance snb bill since march 2010. it currently offer snb bill term range one week three months. the total amount snb bill outstanding last week amount chf 80 billion. this make possible reduce sight deposit around chf 70 billion. snb bill reverse repos characterise extraordinary flexibility, allow efficient implementation monetary strategy fully compatible monetary policy concept prove test several year now. in employ instruments, snb continue operate environment familiar stable different partners. it nevertheless ready adjust monetary policy instrument quickly, require development financial markets. 4 bi review 85/2010 bi review 85/2010 5 bi review 85/2010 1 barbro wickman-parak: the repo rate path – experience three year speech m barbro wickman-parak, deputy governor sverige riksbank, danske bank, stockholm, 17 june 2010. * * * around three year ago riksbank begin publish forecast repo rate, many reason this. it make forecast consistent easy evaluate riksbank’s forecast relation analysts. we also give opportunity describe alternative path economic developments, good educational tool contribute increase transparency. publish whole path repo rate also one step towards become open clear. it also improve chance steer long term expectation . experience far show work repo rate publication function well. the monetary policy discussion focus long-term issues, concern whole repo rate path rather individual decision. this good. today repo rate path natural part monetary policy. moreover, repo rate path serve u well crisis, could clearly signal interest rate expect remain low long period time. market participants’ expectation repo rate rarely exactly riksbank’s expectations. my assessment far deviation problem. it reasonable believe market participant always reach conclusions. inflation expectation well-anchored around target, important indication market confidence monetary policy. why publish repo rate forecast? to put plainly: forecast growth inflation require assumption interest rate. the inflation target introduce 1995, assume forecast repo rate would unchanged forecast period. this advantage term clarification; forecast inflation would overshoot target (be high 2 per cent) couple year ahead, repo rate would raised, vice versa. however, unchanged repo rate throughout forecast period unrealistic assumption. the realisation come gradually forecast need base realistic view future repo rate. it decide bank would use market expectations, reflect imply forward rates, base.1 from autumn 2005 riksbank begin work new assumption forecasts. once “second step” introduced, question arose. although future repo rate line forward rate realistic assumption constant repo rate, situation could arise forward rate path agree riksbank consider “best” forecast repo rate. moreover, difficult communicate “appropriate” forward rate path interest rate forecast, logical consequence quite simply go publish interest rate forecast. the period imply forward rate forecast assumption therefore 1 see irma rosenberg’s speech “the riksbank monetary policy” september 2005, reason change imply forward rate forecasts. 2 bi review 85/2010 regard learn process road towards publish interest rate forecasts, several advantage compare use forward rates.2 when begin publish repo rate path, start learn process u riksbank, also market participants. i believe make lot progress direction. monetary policy “management expectations” the establish view today large part monetary policy effect influence expectation among participant economy. by publish repo rate forecast improve opportunity influence rate long maturity influence general public’s expectation future repo rate (“management expectations”), something prove useful financial crisis. figure 1 show development repo rate market rate different maturities. we see riksbank considerable influence development market rate maturity six months. the repo rate path also significance development long-term rates, although factor expect repo rates, international events, may significance development long-term interest rates. figure 1 interest rate different maturity sweden per cent note. the interest rate refer treasury bill government bonds. sources: reuters ecowin riksbank. great openness clarity riksbank create good condition govern expectation corporate household sectors. the publication repo rate path regard contribution this. any forecast swedish economy make reasonable type model also generate forecast repo rate. so one 2 see, example, michael woodford (2005): “central bank communication policy effectiveness”, paper present conference inflation targeting: implementation, communication effectiveness, sverige riksbank. bi review 85/2010 3 “hide central forecast variable”, executive board colleague lars svensson put it.3 a particular advantage publish one’s repo rate path opportunity describe alternative scenario future economic development consequence would monetary policy. this make easy market participant household judge executive board member act regard repo rate depend different alternative path growth inflation. the monetary policy report show alternative scenarios, merely economic developments, also repo rate. the alternative scenario repo rate show different monetary policy alternatives. what would happen economy riksbank follow repo rate path high low main scenario? the consequence various monetary policy alternative thus compared. this systematically justify repo rate path choose riksbank. introduction repo rate path entirely uncontroversial many people welcome riksbank’s decision introduce repo rate path. however, also misgivings. for example, fear confidence riksbank might harm actual repo rate future deviate early forecast. this also type misgive express riksbank begin publish forecast inflation growth. in addition, concern riksbank might hesitate change repo rate forecast reason prestige, even circumstance indicate necessary. if fear riksbank might unwilling change repo rate path situation required, fear come nought. autumn 2008 good example this. now, three year introduction, i believe i dare say repo rate path regard natural part riksbank’s policy. i also believe discussion outside riksbank characterise long-term discussion monetary policy individual decisions. i shall go briefly describe repo rate forecast produced. how repo rate path determined? the publication repo rate forecast make great demand previously internal preparation work. the new method work require great interaction staff executive board, board member involve early stage process. this make easy member executive board full-time employee merely call together monetary policy meetings. so practical work lead publish repo rate path actually entail? the monetary policy decision-making process normally follow establish preparatory process.4 during number week employee monetary policy department prepare draft forecast economic developments, include repo rate. after meet together executive board riksbank, main scenario economic developments, include repo rate, draw up. of course, main scenario base combination model-based forecast assessments. 3 see lars e.o. svensson, “policy expectation policy evaluations: role transparency communication”, economic review 2010:1, sverige riksbank. 4 for detail description preparatory work prior monetary policy decisions, see kerstin hallsten sara tägtström (2009): “the decision-making process – executive board riksbank decide repo rate,” economic review 2009:1, sverige riksbank. 4 bi review 85/2010 during forecast process, main scenario present monetary policy meet practice become scenario support majority executive board members. if reservation main scenario monetary policy decision, make clear monetary policy meeting. thus, monetary policy decision precede long process. a decision also include board’s view future repo rate, in-depth long-term discussion require merely question whether alter repo rate. the repo rate path entail fruitful change. the role repo rate path financial crisis when begin make repo rate forecast year ago, i believe anyone expect situation like one gdp fell 5 per cent 2009. during financial crisis several central bank force cut policy rate close zero. this entail restriction future decisions, nominal interest rate low bound. the classical argument favour low bind nominal interest rate cash zero, negative interest rate would mean economic agent would hoard banknotes. there many discussion academic world whether low bind lie zero slightly below.5 i go here, merely note majority u executive board regard current repo rate practice low bound. this zero interest rate problem receive much attention academic world connection japanese central bank cut policy rate zero result economic stagnation 1990s. one possible solution central bank cut policy rate low bound, want cut further, promise policy rate around zero long time come. over time would similar effect cut interest rate zero raise zero. the repo rate path facilitate communication during financial crisis, lesson research become surprisingly topical number country addition japan. the repo rate path fulfil central role here, enable riksbank make clear intention monetary policy uncertain situation. when riksbank cut repo rate 0.25 per cent july last year, repo rate path signal low repo rate long period ahead. i believe give u advantage many central banks, try use purely verbal method signal policy rate would low long time. credibility play important role monetary policy. one central issue context inflation target. if central bank “promises” low inflation, economic agent find credible, desire effect. it possible inspire confidence inflation target central bank politically independent. what zero interest rate problem repo rate path? what i mean existence repo rate path connection cut repo rate 0.25 per cent, provide credible evidence low interest rate long period time need attain 5 one argument favour bind possibly zero handle cost cash. this would mean one accept negative interest rate refrain cash invest interest-bearing assets. see, example, meredith beechey, heidi elmér (2009), “the low limit riksbank’s repo rate”, economic commentary 11, 2009, sverige riksbank. bi review 85/2010 5 riksbank’s monetary policy objective inflation rate close target, stabilise resource utilisation. one could say put card table.6 figure 2

line forward rates. although forward rate adjust publication repo rate path, price still show expectation set first repo rate increase end 2009. where riksbank’s forecast indicate first repo rate increase, forward rate already around 1.5 per cent. this large deviation cause considerable discussion, partly concern current situation monetary policy, partly general whether problem market expectation deviate riksbank’s forecast. a show figure 2, however, market expectation low riksbank’s repo rate forecast end forecast period. see across entire forecast period, therefore, average

publish repo rate path influence expectation among participant economy. the establish view present monetary policy main impact influence expectation future interest rates. a natural question riksbank’s repo rate path differ agents’ expectation repo rate, large deviation been. what role difference market expectation riksbank’s forecast play? how large deviations… a seen, riksbank, market economic agent different view repo rate develop. sometimes difference small, sometimes large. figure 3 show two summarise measure deviation market expectation accord forward rate riksbank’s repo rate forecast time 18 publications.7 we see deviation become large since financial crisis erupted, natural uncertainty increases. look whole period since 2007, however, appear systematic deviation direction (the average deviation approximately zero whole period). it important point out. one question may nevertheless arise market expectation deviate riksbank’s forecast. figure 3 deviation forecast horizon repo rate path market expectation accord forward rate percentage point note. for description calculations, see footnote 7. sources: reuters ecowin riksbank. 7 the measure show following: time give forecast difference market expectation riksbank’s forecast repo rate 1 12 quarter ahead measured. this thus give 12 different deviation time publication. one measure give average 12 deviations. the measure show “standard deviation”, sign deviation unimportant. bi review 85/2010 7 …and due to? to begin with, i would like make reservation market expectation cannot observed, estimated. some deviation may thus due fact succeed adjust forward rate various type premium. in addition this, number possible explanation deviations. in one sense may natural market expectation deviate riksbank’s repo rate forecast. market agent may different picture future inflation economic development whole, would motivate different repo rate future. even market agent share riksbank’s view economic developments, may well deviation regard future interest rates. this due different view regard transmission mechanism, is, effect repo rate economy. be deviation problem? a i mention earlier, one reason publish repo rate path opportunity effectively steer market expectations. we see market expectation sometimes deviate riksbank’s publish path. one reason uncertainty future

different assessment would lost. however, case. there also concern would avoid change repo rate path, even motivate change conditions. this happen either. “the repo rate path forecast, promise”, message riksbank communicate along. experience far show work repo rate path publication path function well. to crown all, gain monetary policy discussion aim long-term issue merely whether interest rate alter stage. my view repo rate path quite clearly preferable two alternative tested. i believe also predominant view outside bank, now, three year later. the repo rate path serve u well crisis. we able clearly signal repo rate low long period time alleviate effect fall demand attain inflation target. there slight difference opinion among u executive board member regard time increase repo rate begin. but slight, large move clear. it necessary low repo rate long period time. in context, change repo rate amount 0.25 percentage point slightly sooner late make significant difference. accord repo rate forecast april, real repo rate zero two years, remain low throughout forecast period. there difference market agents’ expect repo rate repo rate path. however, also difficulty measure market expectation forward rates. this apply normal case even time financial crisis. even case, probably note difference rather rule exception. there systematic deviation one direction. all all, i think aid repo rate path succeed relatively well steer expectations. in connection introduction repo rate path, discussion whether would confidence crisis market “buy” repo rate path. but, shown, need expression mistrust. and talk confidence, view final proof household company confidence riksbank’s monetary policy inflation expectation anchor close target two per cent. survey indicate clearly inflation expectation long run well anchor around inflation target. i interpret mean general public confidence riksbank adapt monetary policy attain inflation target. bi review 85/2010 1 lorenzo bini smaghi: the role regulator market fail speech mr lorenzo bini smaghi, member executive board european central bank, conference squam lake report “fixing financial system”, new york city, 16 june 2010. * * * i wish thank marco protopapa, olya ranguelova, fabio recine contribution speech. i remain solely responsible opinion contain herein. introduction lady gentlemen, it pleasure discus squam lake report front distinguish audience. the report offer valuable insight improve financial regulatory supervisory architecture, aim achieve resilient financial system. in comment today, i would like highlight three important point area: i) reform capital requirements, ii) role proper supervision regulation, focus change need achieve great effectiveness, iii) regulation executive compensation financial services. 1. capital requirement role supervision let start main pillar bank regulation, i.e. capital requirements. the squam lake report make three recommendations. capital requirement should: i) high large banks; ii) depend liquidity asset hold bank; iii) increase proportion bank’s short-term debt. the recommendation examine three prominent element characterise crisis: build-up systemic risk, exacerbate behaviour large complex financial institutions; price spiral trigger fire sale illiquid asset distress market conditions; fragility business model base widespread recourse short-term financing. the main thrust recommendation high post-crisis regulatory agenda. allow briefly recount relevant feature ongoing reform financial sector international level. first, financial stability board (fsb) investigate option introduce regulation cover specific risk relate large complex systemic financial institutions. systemic institutions, definition, entail high interconnectedness. they increase complexity fragility system; end amplify inherent pro-cyclicality financial system lead materialisation systemic risk. in downswing, intensity deleveraging, liquidity hoard asset fire sale proportional size institution’s balance sheet, squam lake report notes, also interconnectedness opacity. against background, regulator work devise measure systemic importance base combination factor size, substitutability interconnectedness, could draw calibrate additional prudential requirements, instance surcharge. 2 bi review 85/2010 turn core prudential regulation, december 2009, basel committee bank supervision (bcbs), aegis g20, propose major overhaul1 micro-prudential framework. there consensus year prior crisis financial institution operate little capital, excessive leverage insufficient recognition risk undertake – include liquidity risk. the basel committee’s proposal envisage: raise quality quantity capital2, strengthen risk coverage3, introduce non-risk-based leverage ratio4 well regime countercyclical capital buffers. importantly, new rule comprise novel, harmonise treatment liquidity risk. rather impose capital requirement base liquidity assets, committee opt specific quantitative provision (outright liquidity ratios) directly promote strong liquidity buffers. in particular, bank require hold sufficient high-quality liquid asset withstand episode financial stress well shift towards stable source fund liability side. a substantive advantage liquidity framework propose basel committee ability improve management liquidity risk, inherently cash flow risk cannot fully address via liquidity-based capital requirement only. the choose option directly gear asset liability mix towards, respectively, high liquidity structural (longer-term) composition, also provide observable verifiable metric purpose rigorous monitoring. by so, explicitly promote prudent liquidity risk management, thus minimise likelihood unexpected liquidity shortages, may cover prohibitively high cost time distress. agreement reach g20 level new standard phase financial condition improve economic recovery firm up, implementation envisage end-2012. the basel committee also consider appropriate transition grandfathering arrangements. give scope reform, i wish emphasise regulator central banker fully aware importance thorough assessment overall impact, include interaction different rule potential consequence financial intermediation real economy. in context, basel committee fsb carry bottom-up (focused impact institutions’ balance sheets) top-down macroeconomic impact assessment5. the first result exercise expect available next month. the bcbs issue end year fully calibrated, comprehensive set measure base outcome work . the bottom-up impact assessment provide policy-makers guidance proper calibration propose measure well form basis establish credible minimum cumulate effect changes, take account interactions. the top-down assessment inform decision overall level minimum capital requirement system hold, also gauge long-term benefit safe financial system. it also deliver insight impact new capital standard 1 the reform package comprise two consultative document entitled: “strengthening resilience bank sector” “international framework liquidity risk measurement, standard monitoring”. 2 the new rule recognise common equity high quality component capital. 3 the introduction capital requirement counterparty risk exposure arise derivative security finance activity proposed, incentive central clear over-the-counter derivatives. these measure complement high capital charge trade book exposure securitisations adopt july 2009. 4 the leverage ratio, cover also off-balance sheet items, envisage act backstop measure curb excessive balance sheet growth. 5 the ecb key contributor top-down macroeconomic impact, focus euro area. bi review 85/2010 3 credit availability, ensure introduction propose measure hamper credit extension affect economic growth. estimate macroeconomic impact still progress thus early draw solid conclusions. but – i add – recently suggested6 impact basel committee reform growth may limited, especially compare figure circulate industry, tend base somewhat extreme assumptions. in particular, observe reason expect relatively smooth balance sheet adjustment bank system therefore le pronounce macroeconomic impact. first, impact new liquidity rule may significantly mitigate adjustment composition maturity balance sheet: instance, lengthen maturity liability good match asset would likely result low riskiness overall thus low fund costs. second, investors’ require rate return banks’ equity source funding, long-term bonds, expect decline, reflect low risk share bondholder result enhance resilience safety banks, hence decrease cost banks. nevertheless, macroeconomic condition health banks’ balance sheet would still relevant factor decide proper implementation arrangements. with regard latter, i would also like comment crucial role international coordination cooperation success regulatory effort shape good prudential framework. large complex financial institution global player thus require global response. in context, international collaboration authority strong commitment enforce timely harmonise implementation essence promote level play field prevent international regulatory arbitrage. strengthen cooperation already take place level policy-making body financial stability board basel committee bank supervision context implementation g20 regulatory reform agenda. this foster convergence, side atlantic, approach bolster national frameworks. in respect, worth mention outset crisis, eu legislation already reflect amendment refer basel accord, u commit 2011. i confident u authority live commitment take necessary step enrich national framework take account late proposal formulate basel committee. i would also point europe currently work strengthen legislative framework respect issue bank levy broaden scope regulation hedge fund credit rat agencies. although similar initiative way us, i would like point that, contrast, approach aim limit size systemically important financial institutions, rather strengthen supervisory framework implementation internationally agree principles. 2. effective comprehensive supervision regulation the final result reform international regulatory architecture financial system better-quality capital, enforce appropriate micro-prudential standards. yet there’s question cannot avoid: would strong micro-prudential framework enough prevent repetition event experience financial crisis? i don’t think so. high good capital liquidity requirement essential condition improve stability financial sector. but sufficient condition per se, accompany sweep change orientation practice micro-prudential 6 see “bankers’ ‘doomsday scenarios’ fire”, financial times, 30 may 2010. 4 bi review 85/2010 oversight. i believe one crucial lesson draw crisis concern twin failure of: i) light-touch regulation, ii) narrow perimeter regulation supervision, excessively focus bank system legal status supervise entities. we observe many instance supervisory failure supervisor fully understand business model institution oversee nature, scope location underlie risks. this largely due light-touch model regulation supervision, prove ineffective fail keep pace financial innovation financial sector’s capacity dynamically alter profile location risk exposures. i convince main fail light-touch regulation supervision lie overwhelm reliance rules. too much emphasis place monitor mostly formal compliance rules. in words, light-touch approach supervision ineffective fail recognise powerful incentive financial institution game surface appear well-intentioned granular requirements. historical experience demonstrate supervisory emphasis mechanical rule capital requirement may encourage perverse behaviour ultimately lead excessive risk-taking. why this? in absence adequate supervision, bank incentive opportunity game rule develop financial innovation allow shift risk beyond perimeter regulate sector devise novel strategy increase exposure risk which, surface, appear compliant rules. since introduction basel accord 1988, supervisory authority equip tool risk-based supervision, underpin capital rules. over time, many respect attempt arbitrage away prudential requirement gain capital relief, financial institution begin package exposures, shift off-balance sheet entity distribute across financial system. a consequence, aid development financial derivative structure products, seamless transition “originate distribute” business model take place, alongside growth shadow bank system. it would correct say fundamental shift go ignore supervisors. in fact, even regarded7 – often approval academic central banker – highly positive improvement risk-transfer capacity system, system-wide effect produce risk-taking, lend standard risk management go unheeded. overall, danger associate migration risk le regulate thus le capitalise part financial sector – shadow bank system – largely neglected. the receive wisdom mistakenly saw shadow bank system club sophisticate market participants, principle detach core traditional bank system free operate without appropriate rule oversight. now know perception incorrect, shadow bank system turn trigger far-reaching systemic effects, also fostered, herd pressure behaviour, widespread adoption dangerous financial strategy activities. indeed, even traditionally regulate financial institution take advantage regulators’ passivity, perhaps best exemplify lack regulation burgeon credit derivative market, take risk regulator dimly aware of. the recourse leverage trade exposures8, already incentivised preferential regulatory treatment 7 for prescient contrarian view, see rajan, r. (2005), “has financial development make world riskier?”, keynote address 2005 european financial management association (efma) meetings, milan, italy, 1 july 2005. 8 call leverage “game”, acharya v. m. richardson (2009), editors, “restoring financial stability: how repair fail system”, new york university stern school business, john wiley & sons, march. bi review 85/2010 5 trade book compare bank book, ultimately foster retention large large senior tranche asset-backed security cdos proliferation vehicle abcp conduit sivs. in respect, fail light-touch regulation short-sighted focus bank system appear overwhelmingly clear. on one hand, tail risk hide payoff profile highly rat securitisations understand financial supervisors. on hand, migration risk outside traditional bank sector thinly capitalise shadow bank system lack appropriate oversight. this process result weaken prudential rules, sharp deterioration bank capital, overall decline lend standards, unsustainable growth leverage, persistent under-appreciation risk and, ultimately, unprecedented degree fragility interdependence financial system. look ahead, supervision move towards take proactive forward-looking approach. likewise, regulatory net need cast wide enough encompass financial institution activity capable generate systemic effects. finally, assessment must make supervisory authority apply tool available whether decision take basis independent judgement somehow influence external factors. historical experience offer ample evidence inadequate arrangement regard independence supervisory authority contribute emergence financial instability. the east asian crisis 1997–1998 frequently quote example weak regulation forbearance, result political interference supervisory activity lead financial crisis. institutional arrangement ensure supervisor independent political authority risk regulatory capture supervise institutions. in case desire enhance competitiveness domestic financial institution may influence decision allow institution behave le prudent manner. these important issues, part international debate enforce effective supervision strengthen capacity mitigate future financial crises. 3. compensation top executive let turn topic executive compensation. remuneration top executive recently attract special attention, notably financial sector, distribution sizeable severance payments, entirely disconnect institutions’ performance, cause public outcry. moreover, financial crisis reveal inappropriately design compensation mechanism could lead excessive risk-taking therefore subject policy intervention. the principle sound compensation practice elaborate fsb crucial step forward regard. input academia essential refine framework. in respect, emphasis squam lake report executive compensation interest, especially concern area yet fully address international level9. i broadly agree report’s first idea, namely government regulate absolute level executive compensation financial institutions. on point, i would like make follow remarks. 9 at present juncture, principle standard sound compensation practice mainly design apply relatively large range employees, i.e. “categories staff whose professional activity material impact bank’s risk profile” (see “compensation principle standard – assessment methodology”, january 2010, bcbs). these category include senior manager others; material risk-takers (e.g. traders) staff perform important risk management control function also target framework. 6 bi review 85/2010 first, matter fact, average level executive remuneration substantially increased10 recent years. while trend perceive stakeholder problem, necessarily evidence economic inefficiency. however, financial economic crisis highlight high level executive pay, also mismatch executive pay performance. the payment high salaries, bonus severance payment executive company underperform bank bail taxpayers’ money could see evidence inadequately design compensation schemes. second, i would like comment idea report “market price typically best way allocate resources”. in view, precise scope statement carefully specified. indeed, recently point importance factor one usually associate “free” market condition (productivity, competition, initiative, talent), executives’ bargain power tactic influence pay levels, overlooked. this seem particularly true case large lump-sum payment “golden parachutes”. in context, although i believe direct intervention government absolute level executive compensation desirable, national authority policy-makers monitor evolution. furthermore, indirect public intervention may, cases, justified. the set limit severance pay respect fix component remuneration ban severance pay case failure two example respect. the european commission11 take approach recommendation issue april 200912. overall, boundary change structure level executive pay rather blurred. the squam lake report also argue structure – form – executive compensation aim eliminate excessive risk-taking also reduce possibility taxpayers’ bailouts. in short, address anomaly gain privatise loss socialise financial crisis. withhold fraction executive’s compensation number year pay firm go bankrupt receive significant government support help align incentive manager taxpayer reduce excessive risk-taking. such approach relatively new comparison measure develop far international level (e.g. deferral arrangements, clawback/malus provisions), essentially seek align individual incentive institutions’ shareholders. the bcbs proposal13 introduce framework give supervisor strong tool promote capital conservation bank sector payout restrictions. measure defer compensation important, least one major drawback. it difficult compute “right” time span peak trough cycle. for instance, report propose defer (a part the) compensation five years. although period long minimum deferral period three year target 10 for evidence remuneration financial sector, see philippon t. a. reshef (2009), “wages human capital u.s. financial industry: 1909–2006”, nber work paper no. 14644, january. 11 note underlie logic european commission approach align fsb’s implementation standard 12, accord “existing contractual payment relate termination employment re-examine […]; prospectively, payment relate performance achieve time design way reward failure”. 12 see commission recommendation 30 april 2009, complement recommendation 2004/913/ec 2005/162/ec regard regime remuneration director list companies. accord recommendation, termination payment limit certain amount duration beforehand, which, general, two years’ annual remuneration (on basis non-variable component annual remuneration). 13 “strengthening resilience bank sector”, december 2009, bcbs. bi review 85/2010 7 fsb implementation standards, group responsible package structure product cause billion loss financial system earn substantial fee five years. it therefore essential deferral arrangements, function first risk adjustment mechanism, incorporate measure link deferral payment future performance within reasonable time horizon. from general perspective, important recall agency cost excessive risk-taking behaviour trace back unsatisfactory corporate governance regulatory framework well shortcoming design compensation plans. in regard, use stock stock option remuneration package alleviate agency cost impose shareholder market turmoil. this circumstance highlight need policy-makers promote long stock hold period strict forfeiture rule make instrument capable provide incentive long-term value creation. in addition, rather maximise return equity, compensation structure encourage maximisation return assets, i.e. total value firm, would help curb excessive risk-taking leverage. profit centre also provide long-term incentive order avoid create “fake alpha”. to end14, financial institution place independent risk management function sufficient authority lean decision-making process. it essential risk manager isolate business line oversee access necessary information. their analysis communicate board top executive comprehensive comprehensible manner (with forward-looking view risk taken). shareholder board member also sufficient knowledge expertise relevant financial activity institution pursue permit effective governance. transparency compensation package perhaps also encouraged. conclusion the financial crisis expose major shortcoming micro-prudential regulation supervision. a sweep reform rules, particular capital adequacy liquidity requirements, making. it’s needed, it’s enough. the supervisory orientation shift light-touch approach one proactive, forward-looking time necessarily intrusive, indispensable complement rules. supervisor need look closely business strategic risk systemic institutions, gain full knowledge strategy pursue source excess returns. supervisor also able gain access part group, regardless legal status supervise entity. furthermore, regulator supervisor alert fact financial innovation, add layer leverage, complexity opacity, transform risk profile even traditionally safe assets. at time, regulatory net must extend whole range leverage institution trigger systemic risk, include shadow bank system firm pose potential systemic risk hedge funds. any change regulatory framework must carefully scrutinise minimise risk regulatory arbitrage provide incentive transfer certain type systemically relevant risk beyond perimeter regulate sector. high prudential requirements, whether inside outside bank system, impose risky activities, regardless location. 14 the follow development line bcbs “principles enhance corporate governance”, issue march 2010. 8 bi review 85/2010 furthermore, change prevail practice executive compensation needed. an effective – stringent – executive compensation framework design ensure managers, play key role define institutions’ risk strategies, reward artificial excess returns, stem position whose risk yet materialised. in addition, enhance supervisory cooperation, especially major financial centres, well extension coverage international framework, financial service institutions, notwithstanding legal status, essential. bi review 84/2010 1 mervyn king: monetary policy development speech mr mervyn king, governor bank england, lord mayor’s banquet banker merchant city london, london, 16 june 2010. * * * my lord mayor, mr chancellor, my lords, lady gentlemen, may i join lord mayor welcome you, chancellor, first mansion house dinner? you set rapid pace first month office, least announcement evening. in previous year i sometimes set gather quiz question. tonight i want reverse process provide answer ask question. the answer 23, late i shall ask – question 23 answer? over past year, slacken pace economic political upheaval. the financial crisis begin 2007 yet over. much recent market volatility reflect concern ability government service debt provide assistance necessary weaken bank systems, especially euro area. such risk potential derail recovery cannot ignore them. at home face challenge ensure recovery rebalancing economy, reduce fiscal deficit, reshape structure regulation bank system. in play part meet challenge, bank england two priorities. our first priority must maintain low stable inflation. of late doubt ability willingness meet inflation target. in may, cpi inflation 3.4%, much past three year 2% target. over period rise price excess imply target around 3%. that account direct impact price level fall sterling’s effective exchange rate, 25%, support rebalancing uk economy. inflation high previous decade; also volatile. our ability keep measure inflation close target hind movement world oil commodity prices, well temporary reduction vat. oil prices, example, gyrate $40 $150 barrel. although price change clearly lead high low cpi inflation period, generate continuous rise price monetary policy respond. a continuous rise price would ordinarily associate strong money growth, wage inflation, rapid increase money spend excess demand supply capacity economy. the uk economy exhibit none trait – annual broad money growth around 1%, growth regular pay close 2% money spend growth around 3%; significantly low average growth rate record crisis. and range indicator point spare capacity economy rather excess demand. perhaps obviously, unemployment around 8%, three percentage point average level crisis – million few people work. the monetary policy committee judge likely, though certain, spare capacity press inflation. that seem happen unite state euro area underlie inflation falling. no one take sign complacency. the mpc conscious always risk upside, apparent rise inflation expectation one concern us. we always explicitly recognise significant chance inflation may turn target. a forecast single number; assessment risks. in may forecast, mpc judge that, prevail market interest rates, odds favour inflation remain target next year, 2 bi review 84/2010 whereas, look two three year ahead, odds inflation target. there always risk outlook – side – ignore either direction would foolish. what mpc must continually update assessment risks, set policy order that, balance, inflation remain track meet target medium term. no one doubt determination meet target. the inflation target introduce 1992, new regime monetary policy decision-making introduce 1997, show beyond doubt monetary policy unite kingdom dedicate maintain low stable inflation. indeed, ten years, i was, frustration, regularly describe hawk. but i neither hawk dove. everyone committee vote accord judgement outlook economy. i changed. the committee changed. circumstance changed. when confidence, output trade around world collapse autumn 2008, balance threat inflation outlook shift rapidly downside. so bank england central bank industrialise country respond reduce official interest rate nearly zero inject money directly economy. there come time task manage exit abnormal degree monetary stimulus. the mpc hesitate begin withdraw current degree stimulus judge necessary. when comes, likely rise bank rate asset sale conduct late orderly programme period time, leave bank rate active instrument. but monetary policy must set light fiscal tighten come years, continue fragility financial market state bank system. i know worry rapid fiscal consolidation endanger recovery. but steady reduction large structural deficit period parliament cannot credibly postpone indefinitely. if prospect growth weaken, outlook inflation would probably low monetary policy could respond. i do, therefore, chancellor welcome commitment put uk’s public finance sound footing. it important that, medium term, national debt proportion gdp return decline path. at time, important, however, work partner overseas reduce global imbalance promote adequate level world growth. country large current account budget deficit need pursue fiscal consolidation policy improve competitiveness. and country current account surpluses, understandably want avoid unsustainable fiscal path own, responsibility expand domestic demand imbalance reduced. only two set policy work tandem growth prove sustainable. our second priority accept challenge new responsibility you, chancellor, ask bank take respect micro prudential regulation macro prudential control balance sheet financial system whole. i welcome new responsibilities. monetary stability financial stability two side coin. during crisis former threaten failure secure latter. the experience financial crisis teach u two important lessons. the first that, whatever theoretical attraction – certainly – put prudential regulation organisation oversight consumer protection market conduct didn’t work practice. the two type regulation require different skill different approach. separate – so-called “twin peaks” model financial regulation – right direction reform. that conclusion reflection people work fsa. they able group work hard improve prudential regulation past three years. i look forward work future. nor follow first lesson prudential regulation necessarily go central bank. bi review 84/2010 3 but second lesson bank hit trouble central bank need fully involve resolve problems. the bank england cannot effectively perform role lender last resort without first-hand knowledge health bank might provide support. in peacetime, regulation conduct outside central bank. but crisis, decision must make quickly decisively central bank, work government always responsible use public money, need charge. that one painful lessons. in approach new responsibility shall build real improvement regime prudential regulation make past three year fsa. but bank bring central bank culture. the focus regulation need maintain stability bank system whole. we shall look aspect bank make look unsafe comparison institutions, even whether common feature threaten stability system, dangerously high leverage prior 2007. we shall aim avoid overly legalistic culture associate compliance-driven style regulation. that important reason separation consumer protection market conduct prudential regulation. we need exercise discretion set capital liquidity ratio individual banks. and properly require change current legislation rule book. we must reverse seemingly inexorable trend towards regulation regulators. that work past right response now. i absolutely delight hector sants agree remain fsa move bank become first chief executive new prudential regulator. in difficult circumstances, hector engineer major improvement fsa’s prudential regulation. andrew bailey head bank’s transition team first deputy chief executive prudential authority. together, hector andrew form perfect partnership make transition work create new organisation. in new regime, regulation reflect two different, though complementary, perspectives. the first, now, bottom-up perspective, focus set institution-specific capital requirements. those would fix requirement bank could breach. the second overall perspective set system-wide capital requirement vary economic cycle. judgement level capital buff part remit new financial policy committee. the prudential regulator, micro prudential responsibilities, financial policy committee, macro prudential responsibilities, need work closely together, one reason sensible central bank. it difficult see role macro prudential regime might play run-up crisis. a progressive tighten capital standards, example, would help rein near-tripling uk bank balance sheet 2002 2007. the bank’s sermon storm ahead would influence time collection plate pass round congregation money available event church roof replaced. but macro prudential regime also key role play downswing phase cycle. since 2008, credit condition tightened, jeopardise recovery and, turn, threaten renew loss banks. by allow bank draw macro prudential capital buffers, credit condition remain tight, system counter-cyclical. in words, credible macro prudential regime could help forestall excessive exuberance unnecessary caution. by alter pressure financial brake accord circumstances, regulation, far inflexible foe, would become flexible friend. this type regulatory regime, objective tools, largely untried untested. but reason try testing. the financial policy committee first. over next year put place framework financial stability 4 bi review 84/2010

conference: asia summit 2010, singapore, 14 june 2010. * * * your excellencies, lady gentlemen: i like thank his excellency minister lim kind word introduction his excellency heng swee keat, manage director monetary authority singapore kind invitation participate landmark event. the world islamic bank conference become establish part calendar bahrain. last year’s conference 16th hold kingdom. 2009 also saw wibc broaden scope first european summit hold london. the present summit, first kind hold asia, evidence grow geographical scope islamic finance emerge niche industry one move financial mainstream. the choice singapore host wibc’s first asian summit mark step globalization islamic finance. singapore’s historical role bridge trade route link arabia, south asia south east asia make appropriate venue summit. moreover, strong infrastructure reputation sound transparent regulation i sure singapore increasingly important role play future development islamic finance. the theme session next phase growth islamic bank finance. the current phase certainly impressive. from begin little 30 year ago, islamic finance grow become industry – accord estimate – amount one trillion dollar assets. retail bank particularly strong driver industry’s growth. interest islamic finance spread middle east south east asia europe, russia, central asian republics, china, africa. islamic finance genuinely global phenomenon. in bahrain see similar pattern strong growth. since first license bahrain islamic bank 1978 sector grow dramatically. by year 2000 asset islamic bank reach two billion dollars. last year stand 26 billion dollars. the market share islamic bank increase 1.8 percent total bank asset 11 percent period. the story shari’a compliant insurance asset management sector similar one strong growth. the question industry need consider ensure strong growth continue future. although great upsurge interest islamic finance since global financial crisis erupt two year ago, room complacency industry. both ensure continue grow strongly future, avoid sort reputational damage conventional industry suffer result crisis, islamic financial industry need examine foundation carefully. the foundation must strong enough ensure support much large industry rest upon them. three issue particular stand out. the first concern achieve certainty islamic financial contracts. second, industry’s ability manage risk need enhanced. third, regulatory framework need keep pace rapid growth industry, also 2 bi review 84/2010 reflect lesson learn global financial crisis. let address turn. the certainty islamic financial contract two dimensions. the first, best known, fact still way develop standard documentation recognise shari’a compliant scholar different jurisdiction different school islamic jurisprudence. a long risk contract recognise shari’a compliant scholar recognise others, exist lack legal certainty industry. it might argue lack certainty inhibit industry’s growth to-date. nonetheless make much hard islamic financial institution operate cross-border basis. the result islamic financial institution predominantly domestic focus able achieve scale economy might make viable competitor conventional institution enjoy benefits. the lack economy scale also increase cost islamic financial product thus ultimately cost consumer. the international islamic financial market (iiffm), base bahrain, forefront attempt develop standardise islamic financial contracts. work closely international swap derivative association, iifm recently draft tahawwut master agreement provide standardise documentation islamic derivatives. the master agreement endorse iifm board shari’a scholar include industry’s prominent widely respect scholars. while iifm documentation bring rigorous robust architecture development islamic derivatives, see merely begin process. much work require ensure standardise contract islamic financial product develop support great majority shari’a scholars. within past 12 months, new dimension legal uncertainty islamic financial contract arisen. since global financial crisis began, see first default sukuk. these default raise number difficult legal question currently courts. in particular, raise question right sukuk holder event default issuer particular whether claim underlie asset. it important case resolve rapidly create clear precedent mechanism handle default future otherwise lack legal certainty act drag development sukuk market. the second set issue relate risk management. this number different dimensions, two particular worth highlighting. the first relate liquidity risk. the conventional financial industry receive wake-up call crisis concern importance understanding, monitor control liquidity risks. the islamic financial industry must recognise need good liquidity risk management. how islamic financial institution manage liquidity risk give relative absence short-term money market instrument problem industry time. however, event recent year give great sense urgency resolve problem need redouble effort find solution. a second area risk management islamic institution need give attention problem limit concentration risk particular economic sector asset types. the industry’s preference real asset back financial transaction has, unfortunately, result relatively high concentration risk real estate. a result, many islamic financial institution asset portfolio concentrate potentially volatile sector. the performance real estate market north america, europe, certain part middle east recent year highlight risk excessive concentration lend sector. it important future islamic bi review 84/2010 3 financial industry find way diversify risk reduce reliance real estate back assets. finally, subject regulation, important fully incorporate lesson global financial crisis regulatory framework apply islamic financial institutions. although people industry believe escape relatively unscathed global financial crisis, therefore nothing learn recent experience conventional industry, i share point view. although islamic financial industry relatively insulate first round effect crisis invest “toxic” structure financial products, able avoid second round effects. these include sharply reduce liquidity markets, effect global economic downturn credit-worthiness borrowers, include customer islamic financial institutions. the principle sound finance – concentrate risk, rely collateral unrealistic valuation – apply equally islamic institution conventional ones. the current prudential framework apply islamic financial institution base closely develop conventional ones. although adjustment make reflect special nature islamic financial institutions, basic framework similar basel ii capital adequacy standard prudential rule basel committee develop years. in consequence, international standard set body develop new prudential standard reflect lesson crisis need ready revise prudential framework islamic financial institution accordingly. we need adapt new capital adequacy liquidity standard conventional institution reflect specific circumstance islamic financial industry. in conclusion, clear great deal work do ensure foundation islamic financial industry sufficiently strong support much big structure stand upon them. even so, i strongly believe ensure foundation sufficiently robust, islamic financial industry great profitable future ahead it. thank attention. bi review 84/2010 1 josé manuel gonzález-páramo: re-start securitisation keynote speech mr josé manuel gonzález-páramo, member executive board european central bank, association financial market europe/european science foundation (esf) information management network global ab (asset-backed securities) 2010 conference, london, 16 june 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, i. introduction i please london participate afme/esf imn global ab conference. today, i would like share think restart ab markets, light important role play macro-financial point view. more precisely, i shall first outline role securitisation play financial system role important. then, i shall ass detail current situation securitisation markets. finally, i would like make consideration way forward restart ab markets. in so, i shall ass do still need do reach sustain rebound securitisation markets. ii. current financial market condition to set stage, i shall refer ecb’s late financial stability review, publish 4 june, analysis detail so-called large complex bank group (lcbgs), find may, caution, extend euro area bank sector whole. thus, note late financial stability review many lcbgs euro area return modest profitability course 2009, financial performance strengthen first quarter 2010. at time, de-leveraging continued, bank reduce reliance wholesale fund favour increase share stable fund sources, retail customer deposit equity. notwithstanding slightly positive note, next year euro area bank sector face large fund needs, aware of. in particular, 20 large euro area bank group eur 800 billion long-term debt outstanding need refinance may 2010 end-2012. this figure represent almost half outstanding debt maturity one year. in addition, need bank issue medium long-term debt likely increase result new regulatory requirement stable fund ratio would come force end 2012. against background, securitisation potentially play vital role, thereby strongly support finance economy, two main respects:  first, order mitigate potential fund challenge i mentioned, securitisation may contribute broaden fund base – inter-temporally geographically –, transform illiquid asset negotiable long-term security (even may necessarily liquid). it may thus help unblock credit supply constraint environment continue de-leveraging 2 bi review 84/2010 take regionally sectorally concentrate credit risk bank balance sheet distribute wide investor base.  second, proper use financial engineer techniques, securitisation, may provide good match preference borrower investor term cash flow structure, type interest rate, degree risk currency denomination. this particularly relevant securitisation pool compose loan borrower cannot access capital market own, i.e. household small medium size enterprise (smes). in words, securitisation may function bridge type borrower investor cannot easily access type exposure otherwise. to summarise, ab market work satisfactorily, may contribute completeness financial system distribute risk return associate large range non-marketable financial asset diversify set holders, least equal good capacity bear risks. this contribute enhance efficiency economic system. this i believe rebound securitisation market sound footing, include stable issuance activity marketable asset remain crucial macro-financial point view. iii. what current state securitisation markets? of course, state securitisation market connect general situation financial markets, know current financial environment remain challenging. financial market experience sort improvement 2009 early part 2010. however, early may adverse market dynamic take hold across broad range financial markets, include several debt security market euro area, environment diminish market liquidity. a result, fund market deteriorate rapidly. a know, help restore normal market function again, govern council ecb decide take additional non-standard measure 9 may 2010, include conduct purchase euro area public private debt security secondary markets, reactivation fixed-rate full-allotment long-term refinance operation (ltros), resumption u dollar liquidity-providing operations. nevertheless, even abstract impact adverse development financial markets, securitisation market satisfactorily develop last years, term broaden investors’ base achieve stable issuance volumes. in 2008 2009, share new issuance distribute market account 1 2 percent new issuance. this course sharp contrast percentage observe year precede crisis. for instance, late 2006 first half 2007 1 2 percent share retain (as oppose distributed) issuance. since securitisation technique nevertheless still use substantially 2007 2008 despite lack market participant able will absorb newly-issued securities, paper end use collateral central banks. in case euro area, process start indeed already 2007 increase significantly 2008 ab constitute 28 percent asset use collateral eurosystem. this share decrease moderately 23 percent 2009. these development reflect important switch business model securitisation, “originate-to-distribute” model summer 2007 form “originate-to-repo” model. to make thing worse, “originate-to-repo” transaction take turmoil start july 2007 often little common “originate-to-distribute” asset bi review 84/2010 3 market mid-2007. thus, “originate-to-repo” security aim attractive investors, serve different purpose, namely generate collateral buff central bank. so, significantly large volume retain issuance effective indicator scale continue dislocation ab market vanish private markets. however, obvious everyone issuance ab serve collateral central bank cannot sustainable strategy ab market. in normal time central bank operation intrinsically short-term nature limit size, design implement stance monetary policy. by contrast, ab transaction back residential commercial property loan much long maturity must cover sizeable market. in words, normal time central bank tend limit involvement financial intermediation private investor capacity need offer long-term fund originators. what recent trends? some development last month may interpret show tentative sign recovery new ab issue distribute place private investor . moreover, volume place asset first five month 2010 outpace combine place volume 2008 2009. these tentative positive signal confirm european ab investor confidence index jp morgan, remain positive territory last nine months. our bank lend survey indicate first quarter 2010, bank generally report access wholesale fund become easier.1 in addition, broadly neutral evaluation true-sale securitisation access corporate house loan fourth quarter 2009, bank assess situation significantly positive, particular securitisation house loans. it noted, however, survey conduct outbreak sovereign debt crisis. while indication may suggest demand abs re-emerging, still need confirmation data next months. moreover, latter development represent improvement still far normal market conditions, even suggest may move towards conditions. iv. how bring back investors’ confidence? take stock late information, one recognise euro area securitisation market remain dysfunctional, mainly demand-side relate reasons. and, course, malfunction market implication also supply-side.  on demand side, investor base remain severely erode many early active investors, sivs money market funds, expect return market anytime soon. europe particular suffer lack significant real-money investor base could step in.  on supply side, concomitantly, profit generate potential securitisation remain insufficient, since spread various ab still exceed break-even level issuer’s perspective. at current level spreads, securitisation make economic sense originator cases. at time, would appear current yields, exceptions, attractive compensate perceive risk view many investors. therefore, although sign improvement, current situation structure finance continue impose market fund constraint bank hamper bank 1 see “the euro area bank lend survey”, april 2010, ecb. 4 bi review 84/2010 provide credit economy. in sense, securitisation still certainly unable fulfil objective i highlight begin speech. go forward, key question therefore: bring back investor securitisation markets? this tantamount asking: investor confidence securitisation restored? i believe development transparent, comparable simple securitisation structures, base high quality standard underlie assets, least market segment characterise high liquidity, sine qua non condition return self-sustaining securitisation markets. indeed, investor need able exercise require due diligence ass asset offer, support credit rat agencies, turn information analytical capacity require purpose. this, turn, call careful definition information share among market participants. the issue liquidity even complex cumulative nature condition underpin it. enhance secondary market liquidity make entrance new investor likely. a liquid market may come result good price disclosure, standardisation le complex structures. however, without institutional investors, liquidity reappear. there circularity problem since time, likely institutional investor return market market liquidity prove strongly expect back. finally, le sophisticate specialise investor may also enter market, would require even material increase simplicity, standardisation transparency securitisation markets. v. the eurosystem’s contribution restore ab market let dwell requirement enhance transparency underlie asset pools. i would like elaborate eurosystem’s contribution enhance disclosure initiative make loan-by-loan level data ab transaction widely available. let say start initiative alone suffice re-open market, would become important build block along path towards standardisation, simple structures, good post trade price transparency. a remember, december 2009 ecb launch public consultation order gather market public feedback proposal introduce requirement loan level data ab transaction make explicit eligibility criterion, ab use collateral eurosystem. this initiative may trigger structural change way different market participant interact within securitisation markets. by increase transparency, availability quality information underlie assets, ensure regular update information, market participant sound base build valuation, risk surveillance models. the public consultation include six question general advisability initiative well technical detail implementation. at end consultation period 26 february 2010, 53 response different investors, market data vendors, credit rat agencies, financial service providers, audit firms, stock exchanges, law firms, public authorities, central security depositaries, received. the response reveal strong support market participants, mainly potential contribution increase transparency, see essential ingredient inform risk assessment restore weaken confidence ab markets. in addition, respondent bi review 84/2010 5 issue number recommendation eurosystem regard specific implementation aspect contribute smooth introduction loan loan level data. from time perspective, govern council ecb ass autumn result final technical preparatory phase already started, also take account recommendation put forward public consultation, decide whether proceed final phase introduction ab loan loan data requirements. this decision envisage take place fall 2010. in case decide proceed, twelve-month phasing-in period – line feedback receive public consultation – would sufficient originator issuer adapt system provide require data. it note eurosystem’s initiative loan level data line certain amendment introduce second capital requirement directive (“crd ii”) enter effect 1 january 2011. amongst things, crd ii provide sponsor originator must ensure investor prospective investor readily available access materially relevant data credit quality performance individual underlie exposures. thus, crd ii view information individual underlie exposure (i.e. loan-level data) necessary investor able make reason investment decisions. however, i want also make clear that, along policy initiatives, structure finance industry essential role restart european securitization market set sound footing. the industry cannot realistically expect return investors’ confidence question time implement regulatory action. likewise, certainly confidence restore introduce minor change instrument function markets. on contrary, confidence securitization return among private well public stakeholder market participant association able materially enhance market standard practices. let stress also industry cannot expect public authority accept merely cosmetic change instrument markets. this, example, apply eurosystem’s collateral framework. in context outstanding ab represent almost 25% total collateral deposit counterparties eurosystem, imperative eurosystem prepare perform proper assessment risk whenever needed. in context, loan-level information enable rat agency produce meaningful surveillance reports, could turn help eurosystem diligently ass risk imply collateral accept refinance operations. industry-led initiative aim revitalise european securitisation market inspire high level principles, typically meet immediate consensus. however, principle transpose specific provision market convention, consensus become le easy reach. in fact, align stakeholders’ incentive often prof difficult risk reach low minimum common denominator. certainly, would sufficient win back confidence public private player securitization. i therefore invite industry continue strengthen effort vital area work. vi. conclude remark let conclude say that, manage good order, securitisation welfare-improving tool, value create secure fund correctly structure allow adequately distribute finance funding, relate risk among households, enterprises, bank investors. when work properly, securitisation may represent significant step towards complete credit markets, thereby contribute enhance efficiency economic system. the revival securitisation market 6 bi review 84/2010 need many country support provision credit real economy, particularly household small business. while essential define new market standard term simplicity transparency, action may need re-start securitisation market. there seem one single simple solution unlock securitisation market. this natural since structure finance combination manifold feature different asset types, variety interest rate product diverse maturity profile structures, variety legal regime market arrangements. thus, restore securitisation market require combination initiatives, private public sector. the eurosystem contributing, first all, accept structure finance asset collateral. this prove still prof great support market segment crisis, help continue help avoid sudden disruptive unavailability fund originator abs. second, mention earlier, introduce loan level data requirement set eligibility criteria, may contribute increase disclosure standard market large. however, need done, many require steps, example enhance secondary market liquidity, go beyond scope direct action eurosystem. look ahead, self-sustained revival ab market require fundamental changes. it high time raise challenge transparency, standardisation product simplicity. this industry step effort order help decisively restore confidence securitisation markets. thank attention. mark carney: fortune favour bold remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, great charlottetown area chamber commerce, charlottetown, prince edward island, 16 june 2010. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * it pleasure here. in birthplace confederation, courageous decision make find great nation. similar boldness, canada globally, required. to explain why, i would like touch upon recent past, present outlook, challenge future. the recent past: recession context from end 2008 middle last year, canada experience short, sharp recession. with exception government spending, major component aggregate demand declined, industrial production drop 15 per cent. canadian exporter suffer particularly, owe sharp fall component u.s. economic activity matter canada. for example, u.s. demand motor vehicle fell half house start two-thirds. partly result, several major canadian industry undergo deep restructurings. the recession considerable impact employment. some 400,000 canadian lose jobs, unemployment rate spike almost 3 percentage point high level decade. although labour market clearly improving, three-quarters job lose recovered, many canadian want work still job, many still employ work few hour would like (see appendix chart 1). a painful recession was, canada suffer le advance economies. consumption, housing, employment canada hold substantially good unite states. the cumulative fall canadian real gdp 3.3 per cent compare decline 3.6 unite states, 5 per cent euro area, 8 per cent japan. canada’s good performance explain two factors. first, highly credible monetary policy strong fiscal position g-7, canadian policy-makers able respond swiftly effectively extraordinarily accommodative measures. the bank canada begin cut interest rate december 2007 pursue aggressive series reduction policy rate reach one-quarter one per cent april last year, low effectively go. the bank provide exceptional guidance likely path interest rate necessary achieve inflation target order maximize monetary stimulus actions. second, canada enter recession notable advantages, include well-functioning financial system, strong corporate balance sheets, relatively healthy household finances. we draw advantage recovery. while global downturn synchronous, economic performance across market sector likely increasingly uneven. for canadian businesses, recovery may prove challenge downturn. do misled. this great recession. to claim otherwise simplistic comparison prior downturn ignore rapidity scale policy bi review 83/2010 1 response, well likelihood aftershock crisis persist years.1 in particular, bank expect that:  pace, composition, variability global growth substantially different across economies;  level volatility commodity price higher;  nature global financial system radically altered;  openness global market good capital long assured. canada bystander global upheaval. we influence policy focus reforms. our business anticipate take advantage emerge trends. but effort require u heroic, hesitation costly. for policy-makers business juncture, virgil’s adage applies: fortune favour bold. the present the current economic outlook neither robust recent data indicate dire current headline scream. the global economic recovery proceeding, increasingly uneven across countries. there strong momentum emerging-market economies; consolidation recovery unite states, japan, industrialize economies; possibility renew weakness europe. global growth project average slightly 4 per cent year 2012. few, apart bank canada, think possible time last year. the bank continue hold view that, lead domestic demand, canadian growth likely strong among g-7 nation next two years. recent activity canada unfold largely expected. the economy grow robust 6.1 per cent first quarter, lead house consumer spending. employment growth resumed. household spend expect decelerate pace consistent income growth. the anticipate pickup business investment important balance recovery. this outlook subject considerable uncertainties. in advance economies, recovery remain heavily dependent monetary fiscal stimulus. the require rebalancing global growth yet materialized. in general, broad force household, bank, sovereign deleveraging barely begin add variability, temper pace, global growth proceed. recent tension europe likely result high borrow cost rapid tighten fiscal policy advance economies. a i discus shortly, without countervail policies, could lead protract recovery. nothing easy the reality policy-led, multi-speed recovery

situation. the canary coal mine, greece, face one large primary adjustment ever undertaken. moreover, european countries, greece cannot expect benefit low interest rates, depreciation, export growth facilitate adjustment. it require significant wage reduction productivity enhancement restore competitiveness growth. the possible response country situation denial conviction. in former case, grow public debt push global interest rates, crowd private investment low potential growth.2 give scale fiscal challenge, perhaps surprise eminent economist look “easier” way out. this form denial allow

of course, temporary inflation become build expectations, real rate may well increase, rather fall, thereby exacerbate debt dynamics. moreover, past, prove devilishly hard keep inflation high

chairman board governor federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 30 september 2010. * * * chairman dodd, rank member shelby, member committee, thank opportunity testify federal reserve’s implementation dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act 2010 (dodd-frank act). in year lead recent financial crisis, global regulatory framework effectively keep pace profound change financial system. the dodd-frank act address critical gap weakness u.s. regulatory framework, many reveal crisis. the federal reserve commit work financial regulatory agency effectively implement execute act, also develop complementary improvement financial regulatory framework. the act give federal reserve several crucial new responsibilities. these responsibility include part new financial stability oversight council, supervision nonbank financial firm designate systemically important council, supervision thrift hold companies, development enhance prudential standard large bank hold company systemically important nonbank financial firm designate council (including capital, liquidity, stress test, live requirements). in addition, federal reserve share important rulemaking authority implement so-called volcker rule restriction proprietary trade private fund activity bank firms, credit risk retention requirement securitizations, restriction interchange fee debit cards, among provisions. all told, act require federal reserve complete 50 rulemakings set formal guidelines, well number study reports, many within relatively short period. we also assign formal responsibility consult collaborate agency substantial number additional rules, provisions, studies. overall, identify approximately 250 project associate implement act. to ensure meet obligation timely manner, draw expertise resource across federal reserve system area bank supervision, economic research, financial markets, consumer protection, payments, legal

linah k mohohlo, governor bank botswana, association certify charter accountants, gaborone, 17 september 2010. * * * i would like begin thank country manager botswana’s association certify charter accountants, m gwen sabarwal, invite part association’s gala dinner 2010. i inform association’s tradition occasion invite notable person community speak issue topical interest. it humble me, therefore, i consider worthy platform year’s event. you agree time round, me, topical issue bind colour by, relate to, recent global financial meltdown relate deep economic recession since great depression 1930s. the cause difficult economic episode common knowledge, source private public sector individual collective levels, area public policy, corporate strategy business operations. in words, professions, include accountancy, contribute directly indirectly economic meltdown. now, everyone look rear view mirror time focus road ahead. before delve issues, i would like commend association (ms sabarwal) commitment train accountant botswana years. it encourage learn that, since 1990, two year follow enactment relevant legislation, membership association certify charter accountant botswana grow 350, student in-take continue increase. it also encourage observe 96 percent membership retention level far achieve fairly comparable internationally. this provide confidence reach 2010/2011 retention target 98 percent relative ease. however, i happen know big deficit supply accountant botswana. apparently demand market 3 000, supply 1 000, lion’s share expatriates. i doubt association share concern, give fact shortage professional account relate discipline raise cost and, therefore, unaffordable many small medium size enterprises. it could constrain business performance deprive economy generally need guidance business governance, ethics, strategy planning, possible adverse consequence sustenance economic diversification relatively high growth rate economy. it hope, therefore, step take redress situation, could include deliberate public policy intervention. distinguish lady gentlemen, theme i request address accountant business. i believe broad theme currently guide exchange view profession and, matter fact, address world congress accountant tenable malaysia next month. for evening, i choose put slant topic speak the post-recession role accountant business. in case, word “business” broadly loosely intend mean institution (corporate non-corporate, private public) engage production good and/or services. although global economic recession, slowly emerging, was, large, result wide-ranging system failure, i confine remark lapse account profession contribute economic meltdown. i also highlight lesson learn on-going remedial measure prevent recurrence. i raise issue need increase supply quality bi review 124/2010 1 accountant botswana urge actively engage area account principle reporting. this main message, end remarks, i digress little share issue public interest fall within purview mandate bank, accountant undoubtedly interested. it clear financial crisis economic recession result cumulative lapse good corporate governance, particularly respect transparency management, policy formulation operational procedures. this include clear hierarchy institutional structure boards, management stakeholders, well define functional responsibility ensure accountability organisations. there lapse enforce check balances, prevention conflict interest adherence fiduciary responsibility. above all, many instances, lack honesty, selflessness, integrity, openness, ethical conduct responsible corporate citizenry. by large, accountant professional various level responsibility, good number financial non-financial businesses, disregard cardinal guide principle good corporate governance conveniently forget legal necessarily ethical. in end, financial economic structure could bear weight accumulate lapses; so, collapsed. while water bridge, recognise quarter international account standard contribute fair share financial crisis. it point one new standard abandon traditional prudent principle historical asset valuation replace highly subjective pro-cyclical “fair value” concept. a result, brokers, analyst investment banker abuse standard. the upward movement stock price immediately inflate balance sheet which, turn, inflate asset price and, economic downturn set in, bubble eventually burst. it know paper profit result inflate asset book value could realised; yet bank non-bank institution take inordinate debt issuance risks. in addition, “fair-value” principle much understand market, transparent. in event, balance sheet hardly useful basis decision-making economic agents. the far reach economic social consequence account practice matter record. distinguish lady gentlemen, say war serious business leave general only. likewise, widely recognise account important profession leave accountant only. indeed unite state america european union recently take measure “soften” dilute, were, deleterious effect “fair-value” account practice financial institutions. another emerge change call disclosure account standard u outside profession grappling, obviously help hand accountants. long go day accountant confine bore ivory tower “number crunching” or, time pejoratively refer to, “bean counting”. in fact, say account enter golden age; age change role accountant; age wide-ranging role include professional business advice, planning, reporting, identification value driver risk mitigation. in particular, increasingly desirable international account standard incorporate disclosure payment government company extraction natural resources, especially oil, gas timber sectors. this need do public private sector ensure maximum revenue benefit accrue society company operate. more generally, account profession cross-cutting socio-economic responsibility variety way include governance, business ethics, bank regulation supervision, well financial stability. in respect, climate change effect open new horizon accountant involve wide range socio-economic issues. it hope 2 bi review 124/2010 accountant develop country take lead put place necessary account report standard cost finance mitigation adverse socio-economic effect climate change. these agree last year’s unite nation climate change conference copenhagen. you agree multi-disciplinary area which, i believe, involve close consultation profession accountant disciplines. here home, financial report bill pass parliament recently, await presidential approval, contribute considerably widen scope responsibility account profession. similarly, botswana account oversight authority put place, strengthen professional accountability ethical conduct accountants. a relate matter, lady gentlemen, know that, bid circumvent possible repeat recent financial crisis, basel committee bank supervision reach landmark decision september 12, 2010. this know basel iii, translate double common equity component capital global banks, current 2 percent 4.5 percent, plus new buff 2.5 percent, reach floor 7 percent. the effective implementation new capital adequacy requirement period 2013–2019, mean make bank resilient financial shock ensure healthy bank sector worldwide. any bank capital fall within buff zone face restriction pay dividend discretionary bonuses. we await proclamation transformation go forward basel committee bank supervision continue hard work. a matter fact, basel committee catch botswana’s regulatory framework matter. it interest bank botswana has, 10 year now, insist domestic bank maintain capital adequacy ratio 15 percent, double new basel committee’s minimum requirement. it come surprise, therefore, that, throughout financial crisis, domestic bank sector remain well capitalised, sound profitable. while subject domestic bank sector, let digress bite example bank botswana’s accountability stakeholder delivery mandates, include monetary policy, objective maintain low, predictable sustainable level inflation. in meet inflation objective bank absorb bank system’s excess fund issue bank botswana certificates, thus contain undesirable credit growth determine appropriate level bank rate. there doubt issue central bank paper form bank botswana certificate absorb excess liquidity bank system would inflationary destabilise economy. and yet view quarter cost absorb excess liquidity high, bank would right thing leave themselves; somehow, bank enrich commercial banks. the bank course disagree views. in fact, “leave-banks-and-their-excess-funds-alone” view run counter experience world-wide. on contrary, bank cannot leave accumulate excess money expect right thing. in fact, would height irresponsibility bank intervene face continue excess liquidity exclusively bank system. indeed accountants, yourselves, would concern unhealthy balance sheet result from, among others, vagary would doubt runaway inflation, case several year bobcs introduce 1991. with respect banks’ responsibility reign inflation manage bank system liquidity credit expansion, relate need bank encourage financial saving. it well know bank lend investment basis country’s development cannot increase without attract fast rate accumulate savings. the bank concern household voluntary save rate low, borrow level high compare country similar level development. commercial bank must, bi review 124/2010 3 4 bi review 124/2010 therefore, seriously consider develop save product offer attractive deposit interest rates, long-term interest, rather concentrate short-term gain maintain wide spread lend deposit interest rate and, time, charge exorbitantly service rendered. rest assured, relate matter receive bank’s active attention. distinguish lady gentlemen, await next course meal served, i want frustrate appetite further. this, therefore, conclude submissions. please accept best wish pleasant relax evening. i thank attention. josé de gregorio: macroprudential regulation, financial stability capital flow presentation mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, 13th annual international bank conference, chicago, 24 september 2010. * * * i grateful gabriel aparici, herman bennett, kevin cowan pablo garcia useful discussion comments. i grateful chicago feed invite participate important policy panel. most recent conference macro financial policy deal causes, consequence implication financial crisis late 2008 early 2009, great recession ensued. this panel persuasively entitle where here? i would like focus two issues: capital inflows, relevant issue emerge market economies, recent agreement basel committee bank regulation. for purpose i start brief review fact regard capital inflows. then i discus policy toolkit deal them. i take look macro perspective point view financial stability. finally i make comment basel agreements, focus chilean bank system financial regulation framework. some evidence factor behind resumption inflow there concern emerge market economy resume capital inflow challenge impose monetary policy. i first refer stylize fact factor behind recent surge capital inflows, policy challenges. monetary policy develop world take burden cyclical stimulus. hence, policy interest rate main high-income economic zone keep low long expect end last year, several central bank actually reinforce traditional monetary policy unconventional measures. the discussion exit strategy morph balance-sheet stimulus, market pricing-in monetary accommodation continue well 2011. in contrast situation large develop economies, emerge market financially-stable develop country transit quick recovery phase, case lead above-trend growth fast closure output slack. macroeconomic policy respond accordingly, first normalization extraordinary liquidity financial stability measures, moderate fiscal monetary impulses. interest rate emerge economy have, therefore, start increase are, accord expectations, slat continue increase course next years. these monetary policy trend naturally lead discussion regard implication capital flows, current accounts, economic growth, real exchange rates. in particular, concern voice risk return situation much like one observe mid 2000s, low interest rate develop world boost capital flow emerge economies. with purpose increase liquidity safeguard stabilize real exchange rates, official reserve emerge economies, accumulate sterilize interventions, preclude current account adjustment, artificially boost tradable sector growth. this lead global imbalance and, argument goes, facilitate (or even caused) global financial unrest. bi review 124/2010 1 the argument depend whether capital inflow emerge economies, indeed substantial 2006–2008 (see figure 1), drive primarily interest rate differential medium term growth prospects. it noteworthy see interest rate differential evolve time. figure 2 plot (simple) average monetary policy rate group develop emerge economies, well chile. it strike that, whereas average stand 440 basis point (bp) january 2006 july 2008, barely 50 bp low (390 bp). intriguingly, market expectation interest rate differential hover 400 bp 450 bp next year. it would require substantial sensitiveness interest rate differential make argument main driver capital inflows. moreover, decade 1996 2005 witness average differential 1000 bp, affect course risk premia, still indicate crude short-term interest rate differential suggestive substantial capital inflows. in term growth prospects, picture markedly different. figure 3 present imf’s past data forecast economic growth develop emerge economies. it clear that, 2000 2010, growth differential develop emerge economy widen significantly, reach around 5.5% 2007 2010. hence, great recession affect significantly growth differential, prospect near term also indicate growth emerge economy outpace growth develop economies, rate (4%–4.5%) different average 2003 2005. a simple observation data therefore suggest growth differential important drive capital inflow interest rate differentials. the latter remain quite stable several years, main stylize fact past decade half significant shrinkage short term interest rate emerge economies. a suggestive interpretation broad medium-term trend high growth emerge economy attract capital inflows. prudent macroeconomic management emerge economy (especially compare previous decades), allow improvement external fiscal solvency, alongside appreciation pressures. these factor help implement low interest rates. this different macroeconomic backdrop also imply today current account balance emerge economy display significant deficit observe run-up crisis 1980s 1990s (figure 4). the lack significant widen current account deficit also indicate current concern (net) capital flow emerge economy could premature, although specific economy could pose immediate policy challenges. deal capital inflow traditionally, primary concern emerge market economy large capital inflow may finance unsustainable current account deficit could derive sudden stop capital inflows. a sudden stop scenario particularly costly since involve painful restructure economy non-tradables tradables large correction exchange rate potentially large balance sheet effects, could result high volatility output losses. this view regard large capital inflow largely shape current account crisis like one mexico east asia 1990s. a evidence i showed, current account emerge market economy still displays, average, surplus. therefore, currently present serious threat, necessary explore policy implication large capital inflows.1 1 here i discus briefly main tool macro point view. for discussion policy options, see de gregorio (2010a). 2 bi review 124/2010 in many experience capital inflow exacerbate policy actions. most noteworthy attempt authority defend artificially weak currency. the expectation appreciation generate policy create incentive capital inflows. for reason flexible exchange rate first line defense. this also consistent provide monetary authority independence use monetary policy. however, i discus below, may enough ensure macroeconomic stability. monetary policy context inflation target regime also contribute stability lean wind. capital inflow lead appreciation currency reduce inflationary pressure allow interest rate cut. this, turn, reduce incentive capital inflow take pressure currency. this phenomenon recently experience chile. in recent weeks, peso appreciate significantly. at time economy show rapid expansion: despite earthquake suffer year growth expect 5% 5.5% year 5.5% 6.5% next year. although late monetary policy report say bank keep withdraw significant monetary stimulus, without strengthen currency withdrawal would certainly faster. however, macro policy action may enough, particular capital inflow may source bubble domestic asset prices. indeed, emerge market bubble normally take form exchange rate appreciation. in way, asset become overpriced, necessarily high price domestic currency, may also happening, increase value currency. a much debate issue industrial country whether tighten monetary policy could help burst bubble asset prices. although, general, i think monetary policy target asset prices, use instrument deal asset prices, problem acute regard capital inflows. if capital inflow fuel bubble exchange rate, tighten monetary policy actually induce capital inflows. paradoxically, monetary policy loosen may help stabilize economy lead slowdown rise asset prices.2 misalignment exchange rate, particular context massive inflows, may prelude problems, extreme currency financial meltdown. for reason tool cannot rule out, particular exchange rate intervention. to avoid peril introduce rigidity exchange rate regime, intervention truly exceptional target particular exchange rate value. hence, volatility exchange rate artificially lowered, appreciation expectation introduced. if currency misalign fundamentals, intervention may successful realign currency. if not, sterilize intervention likely ineffective, reason important strong presumption currency move away fundamental intervening.3 in addition, foreign exchange intervention allow authority increase international liquidity position economy insure future curtailment capital inflows. naturally, boom economy, widen current account deficit, persistent appreciation low inflation may need stabilization expansion deem unsustainable. fiscal policy could help, unfortunately always available, especially country weak fiscal history. another tool, weak evidence support 2 for discussion use monetary policy affect asset prices, particular context inflation target open economies, see de gregorio (2010b). 3 in economy follow inflation target important intervention coherent inflation outlook avoid undermine credibility. intervention also part unconventional policy reach inflation target interest rate close zero low bound. bi review 124/2010 3 effectiveness, capital controls.4 regardless whether effective not, may hide policy distortions. for example, policymakers think capital control effective insulate economy capital inflows, may tighten monetary policy slowdown expansion, instead induce inflow look loophole avoid controls. for reason i think promise avenue look impact capital inflow financial stability. indeed, many boom asset price activity come capital inflow cause amplify financial system. capital inflow financial stability from macro point view, i emphasize currency risk associate capital inflows. a flexible exchange rate help mitigate risk. in addition, development foreign exchange derivative market allow private agent hedge currency risk. in addition, capital inflow may behind development bubble domestic asset prices, also macro tool deal them. however, risk must considered, implication macro prudential regulation. note risk may relevant even net capital flow limited. therefore, standpoint financial stability, gross flow become relevant determinant fragilities. these risk associate capital inflow are: fund credit risks. regard fund risk, large capital inflow form short-term loan local bank tend increase banks’ dependence external fund source, show volatile source funding. from point view central banks, accumulation reserve may help mitigate economy-wide consequence risk, soundness bank system must safeguard proper regulation. a credit risk, large capital inflow form loan local bank portfolio debt security may translate increase credit supply local intermediary corporation access elastic often cheap source fund (beside currency risk). this increase supply credit local economy could fuel credit boom, turn could translate excessive leverage economy increase banks’ credit risk. furthermore, screen external lender may imperfect local screening, lead over-indebtedness domestic corporation increase credit risk local intermediary already lend corporations. to address risks, prudential regulation needed. in regard, overall liquidity requirements, particular associate foreign short-term funding, provision policy address credit risk associate large capital inflows, currency mismatch restriction key area authority focus attention. to extent bank primary source local financial intermediation, prudential regulation virtue target problem directly – i.e., target financial intermediary credit fund risk incubating. however, design regulation must consider focus prudential regulation bank system foster bank disintermediation favor le regulate financial intermediaries, certainly go spirit macroprudential measures. indeed, global financial crisis teach u danger generate parallel unregulated bank system step must take limit risky behavior must taken, enlarge scope regulation limit extent bank activities. 4 the exist evidence case chile show significant effect inflow real exchange rate, limit effect composition inflow (cowan de gregorio, 2007). see ostry et al. (2010) discussion capital control condition used. 4 bi review 124/2010 an important aspect regulation whether adjust accord availability capital inflows, whether time invariant. let share think issue. first all, macro-prudential regulation aim reduce risk build-up could lead episode systemic financial instability. it counter-cyclical macroeconomic tool. interest rate policy main counter-cyclical tool central banks. this said, regulation introduce additional procyclicality financial system. in chile, example, provision do basis expect loss life credit. this stop short spanish dynamic provision rule, reduce procyclical impact regulation, particular compare method constitute provision accord actual losses. second, although desirable several aspects, seem financial stability (and build-up risks) multidimensional concept either hind possibility rule base macro-prudential policy limit certain aspect (for example, dynamic provisions), must supplement additional discretionary measures. this imply central bank (or whoever responsible systemic stability) must either regulatory tool disposal, must adequate channel convey risk institution regulatory discretion. in chile, example, although separate bank superintendency (sbif), central bank regulatory authority several aspect relate systemic financial stability. for banks, relate authorization use derivatives, regulation regard market liquidity risk, others. in areas, central bank also say “systemic” regulation overall limit pension funds. this scheme accommodate recent policy concerns, since avoid conflict interest arise mix micro supervisor monetary authority, preserve institution provide broad look stability financial system. this said, however, need continue strengthen coordination instance regulators. in sense i think establishment financial stability committee, much line one establish unite states, promise avenue take. “basel iii” chilean bank system when discuss financial stability day one cannot help think recent agreement basel committee bank regulation, positive step forward strengthen bank system. however, i would like highlight many emerge market economy already fulfill requirement agree upon early 2019. this important factor explain why, contrary many experience international crises, financial system emerge market economy extremely resilient global financial crisis, expansionary monetary policy effective well function financial systems. i illustrate point case chile. even though capital requirement chilean bank industry still follow basel i (only credit risk-weighted assets), possible infer new bi capital requirement appear restrictive. in fact, consider estimate capital charge due market operational risk, tier 1 total capital indicator considerably bi minimum 2019 (table 1). this capital loosen allow coverage conservation buff also countercyclical buffer. a common equity, precision needed. in acid definition, common equity correspond “paid-in capital”, represent approximately 65% tier 1 capital. in somewhat loose definitions, retain earn may account common equity, case may capture much 70% tier 1 capital. either way, implement limit common equity risk-weighted asset (rwa) ratio represent severe restrictions. additionally, tier 1 leverage ratio chilean bank system bi review 124/2010 5 approximately 7%, twice bi preliminary suggestion. the healthy capital condition industry average reflect individual bank level (figure 5). no liquidity indicator specified, introduction minimum standard 2015 agree upon. regardless, chilean regulatory framework bank liquidity consider quantitative limit maturity mismatch 30- 90-day period local foreign currencies, provide reasonable start point application bi requirement medium term. despite promise start, clear still many aspect reform still needed. address risk pose systemically important institution one area. it seem clear stage systemic institution subject strict supervision regulation. moreover, lot recent work determine institution truly “systemic.”5 what i miss, however, discussion regulation directly limit size institutions. in chile, example, severe financial crisis 1983 close 15% fall output, strong bank law enacted, improve years. there several legal regulation design prevent reduce impact financial distress large financial institutions. in field, one important measure consider relate operation transaction may lead bank obtain significant market share. these operation require authorization sbif may also impose condition authorizations.6 for example, sbif may require effective net worth bank bank involve 8% 14% risk-weighted assets; demand limit loan grant bank another financial institution reduce 20% effective net worth (section 35, bank law). conclude remark the challenge face emerge market economy different industrial countries. while latter struggle ensure sustain recovery great recession, former manage healthy vigorous process growth, exempt tensions. the need world rebalance saving-investment across country counterpart capital flow adjustments. exchange rate flexibility, avoid serious misalignments, help smooth process. it tempt think emerge economy suffer financial crisis good regulatory framework industrial ones. however, issue somewhat complicated. in way, emerge market enjoy also le complexity small size financial systems. for current level development size financial system, regulation appear work fine. but, challenge allow continue financial development context solid financial system. for reason important learn mistake mature markets, participate analyze come change global financial landscape. 5 see imf (2010), chapter 2, reference contain it, discussion balance sheet asset co-movement approach determine systemic institutions. 6 actually, sbif may deny authorization bank merger, acquisition asset bank another bank entity, take control two exist bank person group, increase substantially exist control acquire bank perform say merger, acquisition result group bank reach significant market share. in order deny authorization, sbif need prior approval central bank board, issue majority board members. 6 bi review 124/2010 figure 1 net flow investment fund emerge economies(billions dollar accumulate twelve move months, weekly data)(1) global emerge market (gem).(2) middle east, emerge europe africa.source: emerge portfolio fund research.total flowsequity flows-80-40040801200607080910emerging (1)asia ex-japan latin americaother emerge (2)total equity-80-40040801200607080910totaltotal fix incometotal equity figure 2 monetary policy rate world (1)(percent)(1) the solid line show simple average reference rate group countries. dot average response analyst survey bloomberg july 2010,regarding expectation september december 2010, march june 2011.(2) include canada, eurozone, japan, norway, sweden, switzerland, u.k. u.s.(3) include brazil, colombia, china, czech rep., hungary, mexico, poland, peru, south africa, south korea turkey.(4) data nominalization reference rate (august 2001),consider actual inflation. subsequently, consider effective policy rate. sources: central bank chile bloomberg.05101520253035979899000102030405060708091011developed economy (2)emerging economy (3)chile (4)survey develop ec.survey emerge ec.survey chile bi review 124/2010 7 figure 3 economic growth(annual change, percent)(f) forecast.source: international monetary fund (weo, april 2010).-15-10-50510158083868992959801040710(f)13(f)developed economiesemerging economieschiledeveloped economiesemerging economieschile figure 4 current account balance(percent gdp)(f) forecast.source: international monetary fund (weo, april 2010).-6-4-202468083868992959801040710(f)13(f)-15-10-5051015developed economiesemerging economiesemerging economy 8 bi review 124/2010 figure 5 225412024681012149 -10%10 -11%11 -12%12 -13%> 13%1%23%26%42%8%above bar: percentage total assets.source: sbif, bcch. june 2010total capital rwacapital adequacy distributionchilean bank system-basel ii estimate table 1 current capital stand chilean bank industry bi review 124/2010 9 10 bi review 124/2010 reference cowan, k. j. de gregorio (2007), “international borrowing, capital control exchange rate: lesson chile”, s. edward (ed.), capital control capital flow emerge economies: policies, practice consequences, nber the university chicago press. de gregorio, j.

kansai region. i would like take opportunity express deep gratitude cooperation bank japan’s branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. at present, great concern time business leader must recent appreciation yen impact japan’s economy. before exchange views, i first outline development global economy associate trend foreign exchange markets. i speak japan’s economic situation bank’s think monetary policy. i. development global economy i start development global economy. since spring 2009, global economy, drive particularly emerge economies, continue grow 5 percent annual basis. while natural high growth rate global economy recover plunge follow lehman shock, growth rate figure substantially exceed average annual growth rate 3.9 percent 10 year prior lehman shock. however, pace growth slow somewhat recently, partly effect various demand-boosting policy measure introduce response financial crisis advance economy unite state europe start recede emerge economy shift away accommodative monetary policies. in unite states, production continue increase back buoyant exports, concern increase possible slowdown u.s. economy many indicator relate domestic demand, especially indicator private consumption housing, point since second half july slow economic recovery. economic activity euro area recover moderately whole, economic disparity area widened: export production main economies, especially germany, boost depreciation euro, economic growth peripheral country greece sluggish public private sector mire excessive debt. meanwhile, emerge economy grow robustly. in situation, many emerge country move away accommodative monetary policy seek contain economic overheat follow sustainable economic growth paths. although rate global economic growth still high level, slowing. nevertheless, global economy’s recovery trend appear remain intact. the international monetary fund forecast global economy continue achieve growth rate 4 percent come years, project growth 4.6 percent 2010 4.3 percent 2011. nevertheless, bank consider that, regard outlook, downside risk u.s. european economy potential impact warrant attention. the u.s. economy burden balance-sheet adjustment similar experience japan follow collapse bubble. therefore, become difficult grow easy deteriorate. federal reserve board chairman ben s. bernanke also express view u.s. economy would continue expand second half 2010, albeit relatively modest pace, reasonable bi review 123/2010 1 expect pickup growth 2011. he also state macroeconomic projection inherently uncertain, u.s. economy remain vulnerable unexpected developments. ii. development foreign exchange market bear global economic development mind, turn recent development foreign exchange markets. look back movement u.s. dollar-yen exchange rate, yen trade around 90 yen u.s. dollar middle 2010, appreciate since august temporarily reach range 82–83 yen. the key factor behind appreciation appear heighten uncertainty outlook global economy, particularly u.s. economy. until around spring 2010, discussion unite state make shift away accommodative monetary policy put place financial crisis. however, indicator suggest weakness u.s. economy release successively since summer, i mention earlier, discussion monetary policy exit strategy put hold. in circumstance heighten uncertainty global economy, investor worldwide increasingly avoid risk purchase currency consider relatively safe. for example, since july, yen rise 3 percent, swiss franc 8 percent, u.s. dollar. moreover, yen appreciate u.s. dollar euro also fellow east asian currencies: example, trade level close record high korean won. needle say, appreciation yen weigh directly profit profitability export firms. and current situation, also significantly affect business sentiment consequently outlook japan’s economy, increase uncertainty global economy. in circumstances, intervention conduct currency market first time six half years. the japanese government make clear continue pay due attention development foreign exchange markets, take decisive actions, include interventions, deem necessary. likewise, bank also great interest pay close attention development foreign exchange market impact. iii. development medium- long-term challenge japan’s economy development japan’s economy i move economic activity price japan. the bank ass japan’s economy show sign moderate recovery. export production continue increase trend, albeit slow pace compare pace increase 20 percent per year see since spring 2009. a domestic private demand, business fix investment show sign pick up, albeit low level, corporate profit continue steadily improve. the employment income situation remain severe, degree severity ease somewhat number employee wage increase slightly. private consumption pick up. particularly, buoy effect extremely hot summer year, sale convenience stores, especially beverages, increase recently, sale air conditioner support eco-point system. and know, also last-minute increase demand automobile ahead expiration subsidy purchase energy-efficient cars. 2 bi review 123/2010 a outlook, pace economic improvement likely slow time due end boost extremely hot summer absence go forward recent last-minute increase demand durable consumer goods. look back, partly japan experience sharp economic downturn among advance economy follow financial crisis fall 2008, japan’s economy subsequently recover fast pace. in event, factor forecast present outlook economic activity price release april, bank fully aware pace economic recovery likely slow second half fiscal 2010 inventory restock run course effect policy measure wane. however, note japan, unlike unite state europe, balance-sheet adjustment weigh economy financial market financial system stable. this suggest accommodative financial environment place support economic activity firm households. give this, assume overseas economy maintain moderate recovery, trend recovery japan likely interrupted. on price front, year-on-year decline consumer price index (cpi) reach record level 2.4 percent summer 2009 moderate gradually thereafter. the decline recently slow around 0.6 percent, effect subsidy high school tuition excluded. the pace decline expect continue slow economy follow recovery path aggregate supply demand balance improves. the outlook i describe bank’s baseline scenario economic activity prices, bank fully recognize scenario contain high degree uncertainty. there increase uncertainty outlook global economy, especially u.s. economy, foreign exchange stock market unstable. there also possibility private consumption production could decline substantially effect end boost extremely hot summer absence go forward recent last-minute increase demand durable consumer good automobile large expected. base points, bank deem necessary pay attention downside risk japan’s economic activity prices. medium- long-term challenge confront japan’s economy i outline current situation japan’s economy. at present, show sign moderate recovery. but put aside short-term economic developments, many people see great problem japan’s economy confidence japan’s medium- long-term growth potential, words, find difficult envisage blueprint growth. in fact, japan’s economic growth rate decline trend. aside high-growth era average annual rate economic growth slightly 10 percent, 1980s average annual growth rate around 4.5 percent, exceed growth rate advance economies. however, follow collapse bubble, japan’s annual growth rate decline significantly around 1.5 percent 1990s. it increase somewhat since turn millennium, trend decline growth rate continues. in situation, people low expectation concern future income growth spend investment restrained, turn lead price declines. the deflation japan understand manifestation fundamental problem face economy, namely decline growth expectations. even though japan’s economic growth rate trend downward, gdp growth rate per worker, or, words, productivity growth rate, 1.6 percent per year average past decade. the rate decline early level exceed 0.8 percent level european country still comparable 1.8 percent level unite states. at present, percentage population age 15 old bi review 123/2010 3 employment, is, employment rate, 60 percent. if rate decline age population, raise productivity become even critical challenge. in attempt raise productivity, important recognize that, give fierce global competition, cost reduction improvement cost structure alone limit economy whole. for example, 90 percent cpi inflation differential japan unite state past 10 year attributable difference rate decline service prices. this appear reflect fact that, japan, nominal wage adjust flexibly. of course, cost reduction important part firms’ strategy enhance competitiveness, japanese firm achieve productivity rise drastic effort cut costs. however, situation population decline exist domestic market start shrink, essential create new market enable firm enjoy high profits, order raise productivity japan’s economy whole. on point, one view explore new area create new add value part firms’ growth strategies. these strategy explore new, uncontested market place know “blue ocean” strategies. the search “blue oceans” essential sustainable productivity growth. this achieve private firms’ innovative effort financial institutions’ support form provide fund efforts. the policy authority also play important role create environment. the japanese government make effort achieve growth strategy japan’s economy i expect implement steadily future. at time, bank consider way contribute raise japan’s growth potential make use central bank’s functions. a result, june 2010 bank decide introduce new fund-provisioning measure support effort strengthen foundation economic growth. iv. think behind monetary policy let explain bank’s think behind conduct monetary policy. a i mention earlier, japan’s economy face cyclical challenge return sustainable growth path price stability medium- long-term challenge overcome trend decline growth rate. the bank, keep mind two challenges, conduct monetary policy focus follow three points. first, pursue powerful monetary easing. the bank low policy interest rate 0.1 percent, virtually zero. it also introduce new funds-supplying operation, call “fixed-rate operation,” substantially increase amount fund provide operation, encourage decline market interest rate enhance spread accommodative monetary conditions. second, ensure financial market stability. if financial institution face difficulty smoothly raise fund markets, excessively restrain lend financial activities, turn seriously affect economic activity. the bank continue fulfill critical role ensure financial market stability. and third, support effort strengthen foundation economic growth. a i mention before, june 2010 bank introduce new fund-provisioning measure provide long-term fund low interest rate private financial institution make effort term lend investment strengthen foundation economic growth. at begin september, bank conduct first loan disbursement measure, provide 47 financial institution total 462.5 billion yen. the bank anticipate measure act catalyst stimulate private firms’ effort strengthen foundation economic growth. the number financial institution intend participate fund-provisioning measure make effort strengthen foundation economic growth exceed 100. in 4 bi review 123/2010 bi review 123/2010 5 addition, introduction measure, considerable number financial institution establish new dedicate fund well investment lend schemes. the bank recognize japan’s economy face critical challenge overcome deflation return sustainable growth path price stability. to end, bank continue consistently make utmost contribution central bank focus three point i mentioned: pursue powerful monetary easing, ensure financial market stability, support effort strengthen foundation economic growth. from second half 2009 first half 2010, time global economy post relatively high growth, base experience collapse bubble japan bank make conservative judgment that, balance-sheet adjustment weigh u.s. european economies, pace recovery global economy likely remain moderate downside risk prone increase. a such, bank central bank among advance economy enhance monetary ease since december 2009. the bank also introduce new measure support effort strengthen foundation economic growth. a initiative suggest, bank actively introduce various new measure support japan’s economy financial side, aim overcome deflation return sustainable growth path price stability. the bank continue carefully consider outlook economic activity prices, and, deem necessary, take policy action timely appropriate manner upon consider effect side-effects various policy measures. elizabeth a duke: open remark public hear

bi review 122/2010 1 axel a weber: macroeconomic imbalance european monetary union – cause policy challenge speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, kangaroo-group/epic lunch, strasbourg, 22 september 2010. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman first, i would like thank invitation. it pleasure here, i look forward discuss problem macroeconomic imbalance european monetary union (emu) you. intra-emu divergency result imbalance current account position new phenomenon. in fact, exist since begin monetary union. however, pre-crisis year associate problem partly mask strong global economic expansion continue integration within euro area. it financial crisis reveal structural nature divergencies, prominent controversial issue public debate. in speech, i would like provide brief overview cause intra-emu divergency imbalances. have lay groundwork, i would like discus policy option deal imbalances. 2. cause macroeconomic imbalance emu 2.1 diverge current account per se problem … the public debate divergency within emu focus current account position member states; let u take look first. some member state germany, austria netherlands persistent current account surpluses. other country portugal, spain, greece ireland show persistent current account deficits. in principle, current account surplus deficit reflect save borrow national level. and, individuals, reason economy whole save borrow. consequently, reason current account balance equilibrium. a current account surplus deficit reflect discrepancy domestic save investment. such discrepancy necessarily bad thing. consider follow examples: country age population usually save invest face decline domestic investment opportunities. hence, temporary current account surpluses. at time, country catch economic development usually invest save ample investment opportunity usually short capital. a consequence, run temporary current account deficits. the common feature case current account serf smooth consumption time, thereby raise welfare. thus, inherent intertemporal dimension. a result relationship i sketched, capital flow country relatively large save country relatively high investment. in emu flow capital increase introduction euro. there two reason this. first, exchange rate risk eliminated, make cross-border investment le risky. second, country default risk increasingly perceive converge towards relatively low level. accord theory, intra-emu capital flow reverse investment deficit country start pay off. however, reality, diverge current account position might also reflect underlie distortion – case emu. 2 bi review 122/2010 2.2 … prove problematic emu the main problem member state current account deficit inflow capital always allocate efficiently. in spain ireland go boom real estate markets, greece fund high government deficit portugal support private consumption. this allocation spur internal demand and, owe inflexible labour markets, wage increase productivity. this, turn, reduce competitiveness country question. a consequence, import increased, export dwindle current account deficit grow further. although imbalance domestic roots, associate problem confine national level. give spill-over effect closely integrate euro-area financial markets, also problem member state monetary union whole. the debt crisis first half year case point. it external effect mean problem divergency imbalance emu solved. what policy options? 3. policy option a major dispute regard policy option question group country adjust. in asymmetrical approach deficit country would act symmetrical approach would require economic policy deficit surplus country adjust. a i argued, deep cause imbalance domestic factor within deficit countries. hence, mainly incumbent act. a number structural reform necessary enhance competitiveness domestic company increase productivity keep cost check. at time, deficit country increase labour market flexibility consolidate government budgets. in end, domestic absorption return sustainable level. proponent symmetrical approach say surplus country must also act. they claim country boost domestic demand and, consequently, import use fiscal policy stimulus. it also argue surplus country raise wages, would increase domestic demand time reduce competitiveness. however, take close look proposals, become apparent base invalid assumptions. to demand measure would boost import neglect fact trade flow highly diversified. give current trade structure, increase german import 10% would improve current account balance spain, portugal greece mere 0.25 percentage point. the current account balance ireland would improve 1 percentage point. the proposal raise wage support domestic demand reduce competitiveness neglect wage political control variable. moreover, simulation study show effect would confine almost entirely home economy form change employment. finally, argument fiscal policy use stimulate internal demand import overlook fact public finance surplus country also strain ambitious consolidation effort require economy well restore sustainability public budgets. when look international discussion, must also bear mind current account surplus china and, instance, germany different nature – germany manage exchange rate impose capital controls. nevertheless, i say imply need reform surplus countries. germany, example, would benefit flexible labour market deregulate service product markets. improvement education system would also raise economic potential. but measure ease need adjustment deficit countries. bi review 122/2010 3 4. conclusion lady gentlemen, let summarise speech. the large current account imbalance emu mainly due structural domestic imbalance deficit countries. give spillover effect integrate euro-area financial markets, imbalance serious strain monetary union whole. they must therefore corrected. the relevant reform agenda centre deficit countries. they align demand potential output closely and, time, consolidate government budgets. compensatory measure surplus country would neither adequately address problem would bring notable relief deficit economies. what european policymakers contribute? in long run, procedure ensure fiscal policy commitment strengthened, example enhance stability growth pact. more effective macroeconomic surveillance development crisis resolution mechanism would, least medium term, also helpful. thank attention. bi review 122/2010 1 ilmārs rimšēvičs: structural reform pave way prosperity future speech mr ilmārs rimšēvičs, governor bank latvia, baltic economic forum 2010, riga, 23 september 2010. * * * lady gentlemen! i think would miss baltic attract lot international attention recent years. i would even venture say three small country locate baltic sea – latvia – stretch boundary considerably occupy increasingly large part globe: suddenly become noticeable ever before. obviously must something unique country make stand recent crisis. it might flexibility baltic tigers: show capable make great leap direction – forward backward. the real uniqueness obviously lie way economy adjust crisis magnitude economic swing experienced. just short year ago amongst strong performer entire world clearly fast grow economy within eu. with latvia lead race, gdp grow double digit average four consecutive year eu accession. other baltic neighbour follow suite. blow massive inflow foreign fund breathtaking lend growth, expansionary fiscal policy remittance repatriate wage – domestic demand balloon bring along accelerate inflation widen current account deficit. latvia unique record current account deficit high 27% gdp peak quarters, stun world sustain 20% two year row. inflation peak 18%, real estate price double years. similar, somewhat le extreme development observe lithuania estonia, inflation current account deficit stay double digit boom years. 2 bi review 122/2010 the boom economy reward citizen generous income flows. labour market soon become catch vice massive demand pressure limit supply worker significantly constrain labour outflow eu accession. this give rise uncontrolled wage development far outstrip productivity. conventional wisdom tell u lead dead end. however, temptation reach prosperity western europe overnight prevailed, vicious circle wage price keep tightening. economy keep go wage increase 20–30% year become fact life. in latvia, salary double 2004 2008 open wide wage-productivity gap. similar development record estonia, somewhat le pronounce still significant departure wage productivity observe lithuania. consequently three country suffer significant deterioration cost competitiveness. bi review 122/2010 3 all development weaken economy make extremely vulnerable sudden change investor sentiment global woes. initially seem baltic country ease soft landing. this support bank cut lend control way outset global financial crisis. however, collapse lehman brother uncover real weakness – flush away wealth create unsustainable way. throughout 2009, gdp fell close 14% estonia lithuania, even shatter 18% latvia. 4 bi review 122/2010 many suggest devaluation best solution support economy solve old problems. however, clearly option baltic country give openness, flexibility, large foreign-currency-denominated debt long history fix exchange rate regime serve anchor macroeconomic stability baltic states, also bulgaria. already baltic performance reassure many sceptic internal adjustment strategy simply works, make good case country move forward fiscal consolidation much need reforms. i mention internal adjustment strategy – actually strategy: state treasury run fund simply alternative. the reform agenda baltic ambitious. to ensure fiscal sustainability, adjustment burden undertake range estimate 9–10% gdp lithuania estonia 14% gdp latvia throughout 2009–2010 – something world see before. and yet get stick protract recession sceptic predicted. we already reach significant progress regain cost competitiveness, make economy structurally resilient move towards sustainable growth. so far i address baltic region rather individual economy therefore might seem development rather similar. despite many similarities, however, also significant difference extremely important one draw lesson recent crisis. one may also say three tiger – metaphor commonly use describe past exceptionally strong expansion baltic economy – three still – unique – character. one obvious difference among baltic country policy stance run-up crisis. fiscal discipline differ considerably among three country throughout boom year largely shape performance crisis. bi review 122/2010 5 latvia clearly quick-tempered one fiscal front. experience fast economic expansion extremely strong cyclical upturn tax revenue, still manage spend earn record budget deficit every single year boom. while rather moderate nominal terms, deficit extremely large cyclically adjust – amount 7–8% gdp, turn add extra fuel already severely overheat economy. budgetary discipline extremely weak. every single year revenue performance turn good expected, budget law amend boost expenditure. between 2004 2008, expenditure pick 2½ times, structural nature. a many know – really one industry overheat – namely construction nothing do prevent it. this mean accumulation enormous fiscal gap – 20% gdp – temporarily obscure economic boom become obvious burst bubble. a authority rapidly run available liquidity investor ready finance massive fiscal needs, latvia turn international support, become program country imf stand-by arrangement european commission support. lithuania materially good term fiscal management, lucky lag behind term economic cycle, result le overheat economy crisis take off. estonia, however, show much prudence pursue counter-cyclical policy accumulate considerable liquidity cushion support economy downturn. every single year since 2002 estonia run budget surplus increase time economy accelerated. this make significant difference way economy adjust crisis strong implication future growth prospects. while latvia lithuania end skyrocket public debts, estonia’s debt remain contained, allow great fiscal space strong growth potential future. already estonia fast gdp growth future look much brighter. in word – combination prudent fiscal monetary policy behind notable difference baltic states. a by-product estonia’s persistent prudent policy – say – prize top stand last 10 years, also go membership euro area early 2011. 6 bi review 122/2010 the euro solution problem mean automatic welfare gain converge economy like ours, policy keep track, euro help boost growth potential provide vast opportunity future development. while struggle simply stay afloat, estonia strategically move towards aim join euro. i express friendly envy regard pragmatism, strategic mindset ability move unison make use synergy reach common targets. “yes we can!” sound like estonia, i would like wish every success estonian authority future endeavour make country good place live advance. what learn estonia? our northern neighbour good example target reached, require strategy ambition. latvia show brace make hard necessary step forward cornered. however, determination tend fade away situation become le pressing. when afloat start drift downstream instead head towards river bank. i afraid, hear, latvia do good job, leave crisis behind us, could le motivation continue adjustment. hopefully, change recent crisis. latvia gradually heel economic wind and, hopefully, learn lesson county cannot live beyond mean without endanger future prospects. to create stable economy, generate prosperity, clearly target undertake reform agenda country. in case, need another round fiscal consolidation structural reform bring public finance sustainable foot economy back sustainable growth track. at moment, unsustainable public finance significantly hamper lend activity, investment, economic activity new jobs, reduction state debt. in word – deficit hamper future growth problem remain unsolved. bi review 122/2010 7 while economic financial situation latvia improve significantly since onset recent crisis, wood yet. accord estimate another 400 million expenditure cut back structural reform make permanent need bring recently high budget deficit towards comfortable level 2011. the result budget deficit 6% magic number, though! circumstance permitting, deficit could even smaller, provide latvia high rating, low interest rates, new investment new jobs. this would also bring u much close euro introduction 2014 exit international support program. i perfectly aware easy task; however, realistic strategic mindset enough ambition. in conclusion let quote estonian president toomas hendrik ilvess say back april 2009 meet latvian counterpart valdis zatlers: “in estonia know tax revenue low expect additional step required. (..) at time money run out, simple pleasant solution leave – expenditure cut. it illusion think able spend money, actually have. that impossible – individual state alike. therefore – one money spend, expenditure cut. the question naturally – cut. i believe estonia latvia clearly aware fiscally responsible make complicate choice dump complicate choice future generations. thank attention! bi review 122/2010 1 spencer dale: inflation, inflation, inflation speech mr spencer dale, executive director chief economist bank england, cardiff business school, cardiff, 22 september 2010. * * * i would like thank venetia bell, rohan churm łukasz rachel considerable help prepare remarks. the view express necessarily reflect member monetary policy committee. introduction thank invitation speak evening. i study undergraduate degree economics university college cardiff mid 1980s. i three wonderful year cardiff huge pleasure come back tonight see many familiar faces. although i hope familiar face kind speech tonight essay back then. the theme talk tonight inflation. i hope won’t find disappointing. i fear look forward talk excite topic like financial crisis, new responsibility grant bank, speculation concern double dip. but i make apology focus inflation. one cornerstone economy’s stable consistent growth 15 year prior financial crisis period low stable inflation achieve then. and future prosperity depend maintain environment low stable inflation. one worry comment i hear recent month come lunch senior businessmen i attended. one diner suggest uk return old way “of depreciate exchange rate inflate way trouble.” soon after, city circular ask “is mpc turn blind eye inflation?” this dangerous talk. the evil inflation well known. the high volatile rate inflation 1970s 80 stunt economic performance. company household unable budget plan efficiently. resource misallocated. long-term contract avoided. the value hard-earned save eroded. this dangerous talk perhaps partly fuel behaviour inflation recent years. cpi inflation average close 3% past four years, significantly high 2% target part high mpc anticipated. cpi inflation target 41 past 50 months. l forget, long, long way high volatile inflation 1970s 80s. even so, perhaps understandable may start question commitment competence monetary policy committee. ha mpc go soft inflation? be conspiracy government deflate away debt? the answer question emphatically “no”. the mpc remain commit ever meet inflation target. it job achieve target accountable parliament so. to borrow phrase previous prime minister, ask three main priority monetary policy i tell you: inflation, inflation, inflation. maintain low stable inflation best contribution monetary policy make long-term health prosperity economy. but i recognise reassure word good intention enough. we need understand good factor cause inflation target. and need learn 2 bi review 122/2010 upside surprise inflation experience recently. that topic tonight’s talk. i argue difficult explain past strength inflation. in fact surplus explanations. but important lesson learn recent behaviour inflation. and i explain – despite inflation target expect remain end next year monetary policy unprecedented loose level – mpc go soft inflation. what determine inflation? to help structure discussion, i want frame comment term simple model price behaviour, company assume set price mark-up marginal costs. the precise detail model important tonight. many mechanism channel i discus embody within standard price models.1 more importantly, experience speak business since financial crisis begin suggest type framework capture key factor important determine price decisions. in particular, type price model emphasis role four type factors. first, marginal cost produce additional unit output, likely depend degree spare capacity. spare capacity within firm – since tend cheap company increase output employee capital fully utilised. and spare capacity wide economy – slack labour market tend limit wage growth thus cost pressure face companies. but many company face cost pressure relate capacity constraint ease hire staff. these “other” cost second factor. some cost relate input imported, energy commodities, depend movement world price sterling exchange rate. others stem domestic factors, include – importantly current context – change indirect taxes. the third factor emphasise type price model mark-up cost include final sell price govern return firm make capital. a i discus later, evidence suggest movement mark-up different recession previous ones. the final set factor determine price decision expectation future cost prices. most company change price infrequently price decision today base expectation cost competitors’ price likely vary future. similarly, pay award likely affect firms’ employees’ expectation future inflation. i use broad framework consider inflation 2% target much past four year inflation high expect much period. price level shock it difficult find factor push inflation past years. the economy hit series large price level shock – oil commodity prices, vat sterling exchange rate – raise companies’ cost 1 the key intuition model base work marshall (1920), chamberlin (1933), spence (1976) salop (1979), among many others contribute well establish literature. bi review 122/2010 3 put upward pressure prices. together factor account strength inflation. the impact rise oil price change vat discuss quite extensively elsewhere i expand evening.2 however, perhaps worth spend minute consider effect substantial depreciation sterling companies’ cost prices. sterling depreciate close 25% since mid-2007. to get sense potential impact depreciation may inflation, worth recall import good service account around quarter consumer price basket. so simple think experiment import cost increase line fall value sterling increase cost fully passed-through retail price would imply increase price level around 6 percentage points. now many reason simple think experiment likely misleading. but serve emphasise potential size effect associate sterling’s depreciation different judgment concern impact could different implication inflation. it difficult judge advance extent sterling’s depreciation likely fee consumer prices. in part, first example large exchange rate depreciation since uk start inflation targeting. this matter size nature pass-through likely depend monetary policy regime. moreover, pass-through change exchange rate import prices, consumer prices, vary considerably time. a fellow mpc member adam posen point recently, range study suggest exchange rate pass-through decline period great stability (posen 2010). even ex post, impact depreciation consumer price hard assess. the peak impact exchange rate depreciation cpi inflation probably somewhere range 2 3 percentage points. while scale total pass-through retail price inflation appear broadly similar past experience, company seem pass increase import cost quickly recent past.3 that quick pass-through likely help explain inflation past year high mpc anticipated. what evidence base on? the production good (excluding energy) tend import-intensive services, relative trend good service price inflation help ass impact depreciation consumer prices. between 1997 2008, annual non-energy industrial good price inflation average around 6 percentage point low service price inflation. but wedge close 2009, non-energy industrial good price inflation soar service price inflation fell historical average (chart 1). moreover, relatively close co-movement finish manufacture good import price consumer good price (excluding energy food) past two year suggestive relatively high rapid pass-through (chart 2). the fast adjustment price relative imply evidence great stability may partly reflect fact much evidence uk base 2 for example, see section 4 box page 48-49 august 2010 inflation report, fisher (2010) sentance (2009). 3 much recent analysis exchange rate pass-through base evidence take great stability period (see example campa goldberg (2006) ihrig, marazzi rothenberg (2006)). the result study pick average lag structure past, sensitive window exchange rate effect identified. it may lag structure follow sterling’s depreciation quicker. to extent business adjust quickly, pass-through current period might appear large suggest econometric technique use previous studies, fact adjustment faster. 4 bi review 122/2010 behaviour price follow sterling’s appreciation 1996. it quite possible business whose margin squeeze follow recent exchange rate depreciation respond quickly increase margin associate mid-1990s appreciation. my central view peak impact past depreciation inflation probably pass – monthly good price inflation slow recent quarter total adjustment relative price similar previous exchange rate changes. but considerable uncertainty surround judgment quite possible may significant upward pressure price come. the increase price associate combination rise oil prices, change vat, past depreciation sterling sufficient explain strength inflation relative target. moreover, fact factor predictable advance implication inflation – particularly case exchange rate – appear great initially anticipated, also help account upside surprise inflation. but exact contribution price-level shock uncertain possible factor identify price framework also contribute surprise strength inflation. the impact spare capacity cost price consider first impact spare capacity cost prices. there good reason believe substantial margin spare capacity open recession remain today. output fell precipitously second half 2008 2009 and, despite recovery recent quarters, level output remain around 10% imply continuation pre-recession trend. the precise degree spare capacity difficult judge since depend extent recession damage supply potential economy.4 some channel recession past impede supply growth appear, thus far least, le damage initially feared. despite large fall output, fall employment, although substantial, le past recessions. likewise, pickup company liquidation relatively muted. it likely financial crisis reduce availability credit affect supply ways, make hard small entrepreneurial company raise fund investment expansion. but even so, demand probably weaken substantially potential supply, imply large degree slack labour market within companies. consider turn. slack labour market contribute mute growth earn see past 18 month so. annual private sector earn growth average little 1 1/2 % since start recession, around third rate five precede years. but impact weak pay companies’ cost offset business appear hold onto staff warrant low level output. the corollary resilience employment sharp drop labour productivity. a result, growth labour cost per unit output remain relatively firm, although fall back productivity begin recover. company spare capacity within business able use underutilised resource increase output relatively cheaply. a such, spare capacity within 4 see benito et al (2010) discussion impact financial crisis supply. bi review 122/2010 5 company should, margin, push cost prices. but report network agent suggest company respond sharp fall output temporarily decommission capacity order reduce cost base.5 company mothball production lines; cut back capital leases; reduce number shift on. although perhaps natural think mothball behaviour context manufacturing, also apparent within service sector. it relatively commonplace professional service company encourage staff take sabbatical much reduce pay. aircraft take service. shop leave empty. this type adjustment help uk industry withstand effect recession. it reduce companies’ average cost protect profitability period weak demand. a by-product adjustment, however, marginal cost produce additional output higher. although mothball capacity reinstated, likely costly so, especially short-run, resource simply stand idle. assembly line need service restarted; staff need bring back sabbaticals. a result, downward pressure cost price stem latent spare capacity within companies, least near term, likely less.6 development margin consider next mark-up cost company include sell price. in past, margin uk tend fall back period weak demand vice versa.7 one possible reason company reduce price relative cost demand weak order gain market share hope hold onto demand increases, ie hope able exploit degree price power. if successful, low profit downturn outweigh gain upswing. this pro-cyclicality margin another reason inflation uk tend moderate period weak demand. but margin appear fall le recent recession expect give mark contraction demand. simple measure margins, profit share, relatively resilient. and recent survey bank’s agent suggest margin average little normal, despite mark contraction demand.8 why so? in part, aggregate margin may boost sharp rise sterling export price follow depreciation sterling. the increase exporters’ margin may well mask decline margin earn domestic producers. 5 that consistent survey companies’ capacity utilisation, seem fall much fall output might suggest. 6 an important issue determine evolution supply medium-term quickly mothball capacity either bring back stream eroded. this likely depend pace recovery. 7 strictly, model i discuss talk mark-up marginal cost, whereas margin calculate reference average costs. margin advantage calculate companies’ publish accounts, wheras mark-ups directly observable. but different estimate mark-up unite kingdom appear move similar direction margin across economic cycles. see haskel et al (1995) macallan parker (2008). 8 see box page 5 july 2010 agents’ summary

cash flow increased. company le able trade-off low sell price today future gain market share.9 inflation expectation the final factor emphasise price model inflation expectations. the importance inflation expectation well understood. if wage price setter expect mpc keep inflation close target much time, reflect behaviour which, turn, help keep inflation close target. successful policy anchor inflation expectation self-reinforcing. a significant risk associate recent period above-target inflation cause inflation expectation become le well anchored. the dangerous talk may start believed. if so, temporary deviation inflation would tend give great weight wage price set become persistent. and task monetary policy would become substantially harder. although remain significant risk, read available evidence date inflation expectation remain relatively well anchored. measure households’ short-term expectation pick past year so, mpc’s projection nearterm inflation. indeed, mpc’s revision central inflation projection past year similar imply majority survey measure (chart 3). and measure households’ medium-term inflation expectation remain broadly stable, expectation professional forecasters. indeed, surprise strength inflation recession may partly stem inflation expectation firmly anchor past, help offset downward pressure spare capacity. this may reflect different role play monetary policy recession 1980s 1990s. in early recessions, policy design reduce trend inflation. a such, expectation future policy emerge spare capacity reinforce bear prices. in contrast, aim monetary policy recession work downward pressure inflation excess capacity order avoid prolong period below-target inflation. where leave us? to mind, great puzzle mystery surround period above-target inflation see past years. our economy affect number large shock – energy prices, level vat, value sterling – cause price increase. some shock predictable advance. and even were, try use monetary policy offset short-run movement inflation likely amplify output volatility. 9 another define feature recession deep. if company already core customer base, cut price may generate little additional demand. put formally, output fell, demand curve face company may become increasingly inelastic, thus reduce incentive cut margins. see bils (1989) ravn et al (2006) example price model incorporate customer behaviour. bi review 122/2010 7 but mean learn behaviour inflation. my current assessment change structure economy, nature financial crisis, different role play policy affect behaviour inflation downturn. and important learn development help set policy future. conclusion so implication policy? surely inflation target expect remain time, natural thing begin reduce degree monetary stimulus? monetary policy extraordinarily loose small tighten would still leave policy hugely stimulatory. and good way counter dangerous talk put money mouth begin withdraw policy stimulus. but straightforward – significant risk side inflation outlook. yes: period target inflation; fact inflation high expected; likely remain target end next year contribute risk credibility confidence mpc may start waver. if happen, wage price setter start expect high inflation persist, task face mpc return economy environment low stable inflation would substantially greater. don’t forget repeat costly failure 1970s 80s. we lose credibility peril – genie inflation credibility escape costly put back. the response possible loss credibility clear – monetary policy would need tighten, possibly aggressively so. but i think risk remain – risk. despite dangerous talk, measure inflation expectation still appear broadly consistent hit inflation target medium term. and significant downside risk

central banks? speech mr thomas j jordan, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, welcome event master bank finance, st. gallen, 22 september 2010. * * * i would like thank dr. claudia strub till ebner valuable support draft speech. introduction the economic cost financial crisis enormous. the recent crisis highlight extent systemic risk thus override importance stable financial system. it also demonstrate inadequacy instrument measure use ensure financial stability. more effective measure need check prevent systemic risk. the key question – – achieve future? in talk today i would like address question focus role central banks. specifically, i endeavour answer follow question: to extent lesson learn crisis affect even alter future role task central banks? i intend examine three perspectives: in first part talk, i examine extent central bank need undertake fundamental review instrument objective light recent events. in particular, need analyse effectiveness monetary policy strategy instrument use date, especially period crisis. in view, monetary policy measure instrument alone inadequate task effectively check prevent systemic crises. in second part talk, i shall therefore focus regulatory response deal potential instability within financial system. one possible response inadequacy highlight crisis would strengthen macroprudential supervision regulation. in case, interaction measure monetary policy would bear mind. thirdly, institutional aspect play key role restructure regulatory environment. i outline briefly final part talk. monetary policy crisis let start review objective instrument central bank light recent events. compare today’s world situation decade ago, become evident much changed. deregulation financial market increase globalisation progress extremely fast – real economy well. the brisk level trade make significant contribution long-lasting worldwide upswing recent years. this support credible policy pursue central banks, increasingly prioritise goal price stability, thus contribute global reduction level volatility inflation. the battle high inflation appear won. overall, lead firm expectation low inflation dramatic drop risk premia virtually area financial markets. however, successful battle inflation relate reduction macroeconomic volatility – also know “great moderation” – able prevent serious instability within globalise financial system. alongside evident benefits, “great moderation” thus seem produce number damage by-products. in combination low real interest rates, financial 2 bi review 121/2010 innovation liberalise capital market provide enormous credit-creation potential. together reduce perception risk, foster rapid rise asset price ultimately lead excess imbalance markets. through contagion effects, burst credit asset price bubble bring entire global financial system brink collapse within short period time. in view interaction real economy, also serious implication world economy global growth. this raise number question future role central banks. can monetary policy use actively counter development imbalance financial bubbles? doe make sense use monetary policy instrument this? will new instrument use crisis also play important role monetary policy future? to answer questions, i would like look specifically two aspects. first, i examine measure use central bank crisis briefly outline possibility limitation future use monetary policy. then i consider whether monetary policy step focus goal financial stability. with regard measure take crisis, i say straight away effectiveness monetary policy instrument clearly demonstrated. we able safeguard price stability cushion negative impact real economy. however, vigorous interest rate cut sufficient – neither switzerland countries. the liquidity situation money market initially remain extremely tense. in many cases, interest rate rapidly drop zero. the chief monetary policy instrument could thus long used. central bank around world therefore adopt so-called unconventional measures. these include direct intervention financial market buy assets, long-dated government bonds, debt security issue private borrower foreign exchange. another measure temporary expansion liquidity provision bank beyond “normal” level – example, repo transaction unusually long maturity one year. these measure take two reasons. first, permit monetary ease desire stabilisation price economy cannot achieve cut interest rate alone. second, unconventional measure justify central banks’ role lender last resort. it role, words, provide emergency fund financial institution face short-term liquidity bottlenecks. the aim unconventional measure restore function market force quickly possible ultimately restore market confidence financial system. two main lesson learn vigorous response central banks. it show zero interest rate account mean central bank exhaust set monetary policy instruments. through quantitative credit ease measures, central bank effective instrument use reduce risk premia, alleviate liquidity bottleneck prevent deflation. moreover, role lender last resort take new dimension. previously, role confine provide fund bridge temporary liquidity bottleneck particular bank. at height crisis, however, priority secure liquidity entire markets. the central bank demonstrate fulfil function previously unforeseen extent. in short, demonstrate ability respond systemic crisis. nevertheless, need cautious consider whether measure include central bank’s conventional set instrument future. these unconventional measure prove useful direct crisis management. however, far little practical experience monetary policy management zero interest rates, especially prolong period time. it clear instrument use come price. in long term, instance, could create new instability distortion financial markets. similarly, enormous increase liquidity could lead build-up significant inflationary potential. so early conclusively ass impact measure taken. in general, though, reserve principally crisis management. look beyond reactive crisis management, aftermath bi review 121/2010 3 crisis bring old question back limelight: to extent central bank proactively hind development imbalance financial markets, rather simply adopt ex post “mopping up” role. more specifically: central bank try counter market excess steer interest rate order prevent potential collapse financial system resultant costly implication real economy? this complex issue answer would go well beyond scope talk. however, topical tend recur constantly public policy debate. i would therefore like give view issue. for long time now, central banker economist examine extent change asset price take account monetary policy. for example, could mean central bank would raise interest rate risk emerge credit bubble could destabilise system. the debate fraught difficulties, though start time ago, research still infancy. i therefore merely outline possible problem challenge could arise. to make position clear: i convince strategy gear medium long-term price stability vital effective implementation monetary policy. after all, economic benefit stable price undisputed. high volatile inflation rate detrimental productivity growth. uncertainty future price trend lead inefficient investment consumer spend decisions. that mean, however, financial stability ignore completely monetary policy considerations. nevertheless, take great account financial imbalance present number practical difficulties. an initial problem single instrument – namely interest rate – would expect achieve two objective simultaneously: price stability financial stability. that seem problem first sight, usually two support other, especially take long-term view. credible action ensure price stability foster sense security market confidence, turn play key role ensure financial stability. similarly, stable financial system key prerequisite price stability. the recent financial crisis provide impressive negative evidence confirm rule. the burst financial bubble easily trigger deflationary trend. so far, good. however, second glance reveal potential conflict two objective certain situations. for example, positive supply shock – result technological progress, instance – could keep inflationary pressure low prolong period. expansionary monetary policy condition could therefore maintained. but look financial stability, situation entail risk boom-bust cycle, would require tighten monetary policy. a similar problem conceivable economic outlook poor raise interest rate would inappropriate risk deflation. however, maintain low interest rate would pave way potential imbalances, – point view financial stability – would actually counter raise interest rates. such situation make clear single instrument cannot simultaneously achieve two objectives. a problem bubble easy identify. expect u able tell advance whether damage price imbalance build within certain asset class realistic. first, would require u good market force assess fundamentally justify value specific asset. second, easy clearly identify variable use indicator imbalances. a third problem yet sound knowledge timing, effectiveness require scope monetary policy response would necessary counter financial imbalances. since asset price typically far volatile real economic variable general price levels, substantial change interest rate could require check financial imbalances, could serious side-effects goal maintain price stability. 4 bi review 121/2010 a see, many question yet clarified. the problem i mention make clear central bank would rapidly reach limit simply add goal alongside price stability without new instrument deal it. the objective instrument expect achieve, great risk wrong decision conflict objectives. however, i already said, problem mean financial stability ignore completely monetary policy decisions. asset price variable credit growth must include indicator assess situation outlook inflation. they already include practical implementation today’s monetary policy strategy. yet care must take interpret “instability variables” provide limit information future economic trends. to sum up, monetary policy make important contribution financial stability. however, set monetary policy instrument unsuitable exclude imbalance circumstances. accordingly, instrument direct effect need counter emergence (global) financial instabilities. a key lesson crisis scope strengthen know macroprudential supervision regulation. this see complementary monetary policy, aid attainment twin goal price stability financial stability. allow explain detail. a framework macroprudential supervision regulation put simply, macroprudential supervision regulation concern stability entire financial system, rather individual institutions, domain microprudential supervision regulation. macroprudential supervision regulation involve examine systemic risk arise interaction individual bank risk default single bank – size market share – could jeopardise certain function vital economy, payment transaction lend business. for example, one solution could significantly reduce problem would progressive capital adequacy requirements. in words, great bank’s systemic importance, equity would require hold. if capital adequacy requirement rise step systemic importance, bank incentive stay small thus le systemically important. capital reserve systemically important bank excess minimum level could also act kind “automatic stabiliser”. reserve build “good times” allow bank absorb loss “bad times” without cease normal business operations. another central aspect macroprudential supervision regulation take account build-up systemic risk time, especially procyclical effect financial sector. discretionary action could take cushion growth risk time – instance, impose obligation build additional capital phase excessive credit growth, word countercyclical capital buffer. a key aspect measure help prevent possible imbalance within financial system. another way achieve require countercyclical effect is, example, impose direct restriction loan-to-value ratio sign bubble could form certain markets, mortgage market. the difficulty apply macroprudential supervision regulation underestimated, however. first foremost, experience discretionary instrument still fairly limited. for example, yet conclusive research show indicator could use reliably identify systemic risks. moreover, easy ass point beyond credit growth regard excessive. furthermore, interaction macroprudential monetary policy instrument could make implementation difficult. in particular, monetary policy transmission channel could affected. the impact change interest rate lend could vary depend level bank’s capital buffer. therefore, order develop reliable indicator systemic risk, analyse bi review 121/2010 5 interaction feedback macroprudential monetary policy instruments, carefully evaluate effective measures, need clear mandates, enough time additional expertise. so role central bank establish macroprudential framework? generally speaking, traditional task central bank closely link various aspect systemic stability. a stable financial system important effective implementation monetary policy. but also active crisis management, central bank bear major responsibility, recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated. the contribution central bank therefore great relevance analysis regulation systemic risk. in particular, central bank key role play macroprudential supervision regulation follow reasons: develop structure macroprudential measure require reliable analytical forecast skill – instance, regard overall economy specific market segments, real estate. central bank extensive soundly base knowledge fields. moreover – i already point – macroprudential policy interact closely monetary policy. this imply information advantage central bank could important shape macroprudential measures. central bank therefore almost certainly play major role implement instruments. at time, risk involve overemphasise role central bank connection supervision regulation also bear mind. central bank could find face increase political pressure could jeopardise independence. if credibility regard maintain price stability undermined, could devastate implication effective implementation monetary policy. institutional aspect and now, final part speech, i would like look institutional aspects. to allow detail analysis systemic risk keep check, need macroprudential framework various instrument combine optimal effect. what best way achieve this? firstly, essential recognise ensure financial stability whole generally dependent decision make range different bodies. these need act together order ensure financial stability. to create necessary basis function macroprudential framework, exact institutional set-up regulatory authority utmost importance. first foremost, objectives, mandate responsibility need clearly defined. in switzerland, instance, finma – financial market supervisory authority – responsible regulation supervision individual banks. the snb, hand, require contribute financial stability. with regard switzerland’s two big banks, clear overlap institutional systemic risks. in context, exact definition responsibility snb finma central importance optimal macroprudential supervision regulation. the revise memorandum understand snb finma important step direction. secondly, ensure institution involve optimally carry role assign them, also important give right tools. in concrete terms, mean snb would, example, need extensive information stability financial institution – regard risk exposure, interdependences, etc. – would require specific instrument enable take right decision implement macroprudential policy. thirdly, crisis make clear close international cooperation regulatory authority vital. function international coordination mechanism require counter future crisis early effectively. international cooperation way check undesirable development globalise financial markets. 6 bi review 121/2010 conclusion lady gentlemen, stable economic growth low inflation last two decade could prevent emergence vast imbalance global financial system, financial economic crisis clearly showed. such massive economic shock bind impact central bank work. nevertheless, ensure price stability remain top priority. the crisis make evident central bank effective set instrument use mitigate negative impact financial crises. the unconventional measure use regard also prove effective. yet despite measures, cost crisis remain enormous. one central conclusion, therefore, attention need pay crisis prevention order improve stability financial systems. however, monetary policy instrument suitable point counter emergence financial imbalances. hence, different approach needed. strengthen macroprudential supervision regulation one plausible option. macroprudential policy take account systemic risk financial sector action gear reduce risks. a yet, however, little experience type supervision regulation. it therefore vital act prudently gradually implement new measures, give adequate time. the first step define clear realistic mandate objective evaluate possible instruments. collaboration various authority involve – nationally internationally – also crucial importance. overall, need create condition allow timely application suitable instrument counter emergent financial instabilities. these instrument would essentially supplement set exist monetary policy instruments. within framework, snb would able make optimum contribution objective – price stability financial stability. bi review 121/2010 1 heng swee keat: achieve good regulatory outcome – way forward welcome speech mr heng swee keat, manage director monetary authority singapore, 16th international conference bank supervisors, singapore, 22 september 2010. * * * 1. good morning. my colleague i monetary authority singapore delight welcome singapore, 16th international conference bank supervisor (icbs). we honour join basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) organiser conference. look back crisis 2. when last meet brussels september 2008, collapse lehman brother trigger tail-spin global financial system. the global economic outlook grim. decisive policy action avert bad scenario crises, overall situation improve significantly. still, financial vulnerability uncertainty pace global economic recovery remain. 3. this year’s icbs come critical juncture. in last two years, us, national financial authorities, undertake extensive review enhance resilience financial systems. globally, fsb imf work forge agreement measure prevent mitigate crisis systemic proportions. in particular, basel committee leadership governor nout wellink forefront devise new regulatory framework underpin foster resilient global bank system. 4. by bring together senior official central bank supervisory agency 100 countries, year’s meet provide platform u move ahead core regulatory changes, chart direction remain area work. 5. the two theme year’s conference – build resilient bank system, create stable financial environment sustain economic growth underscore two key principles. first, financial system need resilient avoid destabilize economy. second, beyond resilience, rebuild nexus financial sector real sector critical support growth development. this particularly important many emerge economy pace financial sector development catch real economy. 6. let share reflection three theme permeate discussion financial resilience – microprudential regulations, macroprudential regulations, supervisory approach. the basel committee’s reform 7. many bank enter crisis much leverage, little capital inadequate liquidity buffers. we need good micro-prudential regulations. bank need reduce leverage, high quality quantity capital absorb losses, maintain high proportion liquid asset withstand shock fund markets. 8. the basel committee agree need standard relate capital, liquidity leverage. these first set parameter core capital carefully calibrate consider condition various economies, well result 2 bi review 121/2010 bottom-up quantitative impact study top-down macroeconomic impact propose changes. the phase-in arrangement new benchmark strike important balance strengthen financial system support economic recovery. singapore support basel committee’s reforms, work done. 9. go forward, key challenge ensure robust implementation new capital standards. in interconnect global system, major problem one part system eventually affect u directly indirectly, various channels. all economies, whether advance emerging, whether direct bank crisis not, therefore share interest strengthen resilience global financial system. 10. however, phase-in measures, need vigilant unintended consequence credit availability economic growth, reduce diversity financial system. 11. in strive towards convergence regulatory standard order preserve level play field across jurisdictions, cognizant start condition future challenge country differ. for many emerge economies, priority lie re-capitalising bank reduce leverage, continue reform bank system develop deep capital market support future economic expansion. moreover, bank emerge market vary size, sophistication systemic significance – small domestically focused, others sizeable regional footprints. most emerge economy also host global banks, rely provide trade project finance, cross border remittances. let emphasise difference detract need high regulatory standards. however, mean calibrate detail rules, take account differences, financial intermediation adversely affected. the macroprudential dimension 12. let say word macroprudential regulations. macroprudential regulation relate use prudential tool promote stability financial system whole, individual institutions. it recognize two source systemic risks. one, point time, interlinkages common exposure across institution multiply aggregate risks. two, time, boom/bust cycle amplify destabilize entire system. in good times, low volatility low risk premia induce excessive credit creation rise asset price process fee itself. when confidence turns, credit excess asset bubble unwind quickly, price overshoot head down, feed downward spiral. 13. while macroprudential regulation new, financial crisis trigger renew interest it. various idea explore – systemic surcharge counter-cyclical capital buffers, viability structure rule-based framework measures. we certainly explore new approach good tools. but let make point this. 14. first, unlike monetary policy, research macroprudential tool structured, rules-based nature early stage. there simple target like inflation target, clear measure success build detail analysis long data series, since tail risk not, definition, materalise frequently. this make task inherently harder. nor many rule-based tool prove efficacy global level. much analytical work needed. 15. second, good understand systemic risk pose bank depend size, interconnectedness substitutability. it come “too-big-to-fail”, though sometimes term use interchangeably. many small bank bi review 121/2010 3 pursue similar business model build large correlate positions. there systemic impact bank unwind position time. 16. in come years, focus new tool countercyclical capital. their effectiveness need assess time, options. we need agree right set policy tool deal systemic risk least unintended consequences. 17. the test resilience bank system lie ability absorb loss shock occur – is, loss absorption capacity. for individual bank, various tools, apart surcharge levies, considered. at system level, adopt similar rule across institution prevent regulatory arbitrage inadvertently reduce diversity global financial system. a variety business model investor different risk appetite liability-matching requirement may make resilient system. 18. in vein, national regulator explore variety approach best suit conditions. indeed, many emerge economy bank systemic local context, national regulator need consider best deal these, even work together global bank systemic significance. 19. third, post financial crisis, understandable distrust market supervisory judgment, preference “hard-wire” measure pillar 1 capital. but must swing far. supervisor need regain confidence prepare exercise supervisory judgment – many economy use macroprudential tool success apply discretion. there also scope great disclosure market discipline pillar 3. indeed, proposal relate contingent capital – whether convertible bond bail-in arrangements, understand market dynamic relate instrument crucial success. 20. fourth, sophisticate approach necessarily superior. several economy use basic tool loan-to-value ratio concentration limit particular sectors. these tool simple understand enforce. while application particular sector appear ad hoc, broad counter-cyclical capital buff reduce credit growth across board might seem appealing, experience approach target towards sector real estate merit reduce credit sector corporate sme sectors. their efficacy probably stem simplicity consistent applications, condition expectation market. 21. fifth, term “macroprudential” suggest essentially prudential tools, “macro-orientation”. indeed, many tool “microprudential” nature also serve macro-needs well. loan-to-value ratio raise buff loss also constrain credit growth economy. similarly, macro-measures tighten interest rate also lean build-up asset price serve microprudential purpose. pursue macroprudential objective therefore mean narrow box tools, dedicate specific purpose. in fact, interaction various tool significant – work opposite directions, cumulative impact may great small anticipate. it probably appropriate u take eclectic holistic approach. 22. finally, corollary above, micro- macro-supervision do silo. in fact, need bring together perspective tool different stakeholder – central bank financial supervisors, well government agency contribute financial stability. the property sector cool measure introduce singapore number asian country recently, involve close cross-agency cooperation coordination amongst financial regulators, fiscal authority land 4 bi review 121/2010 office respective countries. bring together various agency expand policy option deal systemic risks. different country different institutional arrangements, country need decide optimal arrangements. achieve regulatory outcome effective supervision share responsibility industry 23. let say word achieve regulatory outcomes, beyond good rules. perhaps strike area critical need u strengthen supervision. effective supervision unapologetically firm intense, ground good understand nature institution financial system. supervisor must think independently, avoid regulatory capture will enforce out-of-bound marker rigorously. in regard, i welcome effort fsb standard setter develop recommendation effective supervision complex systemic institutions. 24. effective supervision require talented train staff, understand respond constantly new markets, new services, new risks. the need talent particularly acute supervisor emerge economies, bank system grow rapidly. with grow demand risk managers, supervisor face high attrition. we significantly expand talent pool, work international regional body like fsi, world bank imf step efforts. 25. finally, supervisor act alone achieve desire regulatory outcomes. good outcome cannot depend “cat-and-mouse” game supervisor prescribe rule check compliance. the primary responsibility sound bank must rest board senior management bank. they need take ownership responsibility manage risks, requisite knowledge, skill experience discharge responsibility effectively. 26. in regard, ma recently propose number enhancement corporate governance framework locally incorporate banks. we welcome basel committee’s present initiative revisit 2006 corporate governance guidance, address weakness identify crisis. 27. in promote share outcomes, political support crucial various areas. it difficult build strong bank system weak macro-economic foundations. supervisor countries, emerge economies, sometimes political pressure tilt credit growth certain directions, exercise forbearance. while financial system responsive need economy, politicise supervisory process almost certainly bring adverse consequence road. conclusion 28. in conclusion, embark financial reforms, forward looking, ensure resilient global financial system, also one support sustainable economic growth. we need good regulations, good appreciation macro-financial linkages, firm supervision. globally coordinate effort strong cross border cooperation areas, well local effort context-specific need achieve desire regulatory outcomes. 29. singapore honour host 16th icbs common supervisory journey. i wish meaningful fruitful discussion, well pleasant memorable stay singapore. thank you. bi review 120/2010 1 erkki liikanen: the enlargement euro area 2011 – trust future introductory statement mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, euro conference, tallinn, 20 september 2010. * * * estonia make impressive journey past two decades. this journey, rebirth country two decade ago, rapid economic transition, heart europe, always follow keenly northern side gulf finland. in short introductory statement, i would like offer observation journey wish future. i try draw lesson prospective emu members, also eurosystem eu whole. i make observation vantage point close neighbour long-time friend estonia. time my first observation concern choice timing. at time estonia’s emu criterion assess brussels frankfurt, european bond market considerable strain. there sign panic trade floors, financial press predict even breakdown monetary union. the reaction proven, usual, overblown, breakdown prediction badly inform fantasy, create rather curious welcome estonia monetary union. but, way, hectic week eu show many best qualities. it’s institution able take brave decision need show establishment european financial stability facility (efsf). eu also show ability concentrate estonia’s case merits, undisturbed ongoing instability financial markets. convergence criterion my second observation that, although considerable experience apply convergence criteria, still need work fine-tune way interpret them. examination put weight sustainability – rightly so. convergence hit admissible combination economic indicator one point time. but may still concentrate much near term. convergence last commitment sustainable economic policy. it include commitment price stability, sustainable public finances, sustainable private sector development. and, ultimately, require capacity take appropriate political decision thing go wrong. i think last aspect end make estonia’s admittance relatively smooth. estonia show remarkable capacity take difficult political decision needed. 2 bi review 120/2010 this, i believe, widely recognize respected, help pave way estonia join monetary union. it also bode well estonia’s future emu. boom bust my third observation regard another factor also bode well estonia part euro area: recent boom bust episode country. estonia go classical cycle low interest rates, easy credit, unrealistic expectations, eventually build substantial overheat economy, finally spectacular bust 2008–2009. some country experience part monetary union, estonia experience herself. i optimistic experience prove vaccination future financial excesses. the finnish depression early 1990s result suffer economic hardship many, also re-established cautious economic attitude result strong balance sheets, ultimately strong economy. finland receive vaccination financial excess last well decade. i optimistic estonia benefit similar vaccination, emerge recession strong economy. only begin my fourth observation beginning. a lot go inside euro area eurosystem. economic policy coordination give much great traction before. in particular, crisis show group country common currency highly interconnect bank sector great deal interest others’ public finances. how country choose allocate public expenditure remain mostly business. but country finance public expenditure must matter common interest much great degree will acknowledge past. enhance economic governance, include european semester, create framework ensure budgetary policy take account common european interest. i trust estonia like-minded partner u ensure framework work intended. i also look forward work governor eesti pank european systemic risk board establish begin next year. we high expectation new body. the financial crisis show considerable gap microprudential supervision monetary policy. we need strong policy instrument tackle fluctuation credit cycle, price risk systemic risk. i also believe policy instrument must able operate cross-border level since, today’s financial markets, systemic risk propagate quickly across national boundaries. the european systemic risk board (esrb) well place take primary responsibility control systemic risk europe. it expertise, access relevant bi review 120/2010 3 information close cooperation central bank financial supervisors. what may still need effective instrument deal systemic risk. the first couple year critical establish esrb’s precise institutional role operational modalities. the esrb doubt face challenges, risk institutional turf war real – particularly strong national supervisors. but need ambitious provide esrb sufficient power job. again, i hope work together estonia also issue. finland euro finally, remark experience member economic monetary union beginning. a countries, intensive debate finland pro con emu membership final decision take may 1998. not surprisingly, opinion time widely divided. much attention devote possibility “asymmetric shocks”. the finnish economy judge structurally different call core european countries, germany, france benelux countries. the sceptic believe economic stability finland likely suffer economic development “asymmetric” vis-à-vis core countries. there good historical reason early scepticism. the structure finnish economy one-sided. the share forest-based industry industrial production exports, although declining, much large european countries. only one-third finland’s export go prospective euro area countries, imply country likely vulnerable others shock come outside euro area. there also particular concern exchange rate movements. especially, fear movement swedish krona, pound sterling u dollar vis-à-vis euro would undermine competitiveness finnish economy. after 12 year emu possible draw least preliminary conclusion whether fear justify not. firstly, face “asymmetric” shock begin monetary union. however, contrary pre-emu fears, shock turn positive shock, negative one. in 1998–2000, finland surf wave ict boom. in normal circumstance would call real appreciation currency, either form nominal appreciation accelerate inflation. neither happened. in retrospect, seem membership emu, fact, stabilise effect economy face “asymmetric” shock. the current global crisis hit finnish economy severely euro area countries. gdp drop 8% 2009, big decline since 1918. in course two decade finland become increasingly specialize production capital good ict products. when global investment activity collapse together world trade,

increased. none development occurred. 4 bi review 120/2010 consumer confidence hold low interest rates, fear collapse construction activity materialize, rise unemployment prove far le forecast. three additional factor contribute relatively favourable outcome. firstly, government finance initially good shape. a result, risk premia remain low, despite significant deterioration fiscal balance. secondly, bank sector remain strong position throughout cycle. it seem vaccination extravagancy obtain bank crisis early 1990s still effective 15 year later. thirdly, house price increase remain

price bubbles. on side gulf finland, know experience easy task. bi review 120/2010 1 hidetoshi kamezaki: recent economic financial development japan summary speech mr hidetoshi kamezaki, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, sapporo, 28 july 2010. * * * i. the economy price a. the current economic situation follow precipitous deterioration wake lehman shock fall 2008, japan’s economy, since bottom spring 2009, show sign moderate recovery. the main drive force recovery improvement overseas economic conditions, result japan’s export production increasing, business fix investment show sign pick up. moreover, government’s economic stimulus measure favor environment-friendly product contribute significantly pick-up private consumption. overseas economy continue recover moderately, underpin effect stimulus measure adopt around world inventory restocking. look development region, chinese economy continue manifest high growth, support surge fix asset investment spur large stimulus package 4 trillion renminbi, although recently pace growth slow somewhat. the u.s. economy recover moderate pace, support massive stimulus package 780 billion u.s. dollars. european economy overall also pick – although difference across country – lead increase export production partly due decline currencies. recovery euro area, however, weak region stimulus measure adopt region relatively small scale, economic structure lack flexibility, credit uncertainty trigger fiscal problem greece remains. against background, japan’s export region continue increase. this bring production growth, lead business fix investment pick cause household income stop declining. the key element government’s economic stimulus measure favor energy-efficient product eco-point system electrical appliances, well tax reduction subsidy purchase environment-friendly cars. these measures, together greatly improve cost performance products, switchover analogue digital terrestrial broadcasting, extend lifespan automobiles, tap potential replacement demand significant positive effect sale product cover measures. in addition, seem measure provide consumer incentive visit retail store encourage purchase product stimulus measure apply, dvd recorder compatible flat-panel tv late home clean robots. this increase spend durable consumer good positive effect economy increase production. in sum, japan’s economy support two major engine growth, namely, improvement overseas economic condition government’s economic stimulus measure favor environment-friendly products. however, recovery remain weak area directly benefit developments, many people yet feel economy overall recovering. moreover, although japan’s economy enjoy relatively high growth around 5 percent annualized rate end 2009 begin 2010, level economic activity remain low lehman shock. it is, thus, early say self-sustaining upturn domestic private demand fuel robust recovery. 2 bi review 120/2010 b. the economic outlook next, i talk outlook japan’s economy. the effect two factor far engine economic growth likely weaken. specifically, overseas economies, include currently grow rapid pace, seem likely slow steady sustainable rate growth effect inventory restock stimulus measure abate. the uptrend japan’s export expect continue, pace increase likely moderate gradually. durable good consumption expect fall temporarily reaction termination government’s economic stimulus measure favor energy-efficient products: subsidy purchase environment-friendly car expire end september, eco-point system electrical appliance expire end december. new factor take account, however. for example, government’s child allowances, start june, expect help support private consumption. moreover, business fix investment household income likely pick up, reflect improvement capacity utilization rate corporate profits. support factors, japan’s economy assume moderate recovery trend. the outlook i presented, however, subject various upside downside risks. one upside risk growth emerge commodity-exporting economy might accelerate. recently, grow number emerge commodity-exporting economy shift away accommodative monetary policies, china, government implement measure curb overheat real estate market. however, capital industrialize economy – persist accommodative monetary policy – continue flow country thereby exacerbate overheat asset markets, could boost growth. these development could pose upside risk japan’s economy mean increase exports. such development would wholly desirable since overheat emerge commodity-exporting economy would inevitably lead tighten policies, might pose downside risk japan’s economy. when consider downside risks, grow instability global financial market warrant attention. the fiscal problem greece european country lead deterioration domestic demand country result fiscal austerity measures, also exert downward pressure european economy whole number ways. these include fiscal consolidation countries, attempt avoid similar fate; weaken financial intermediary function financial institution sovereign debt issue country stricken crisis; decline propensity consume, result uncertainty surround overall markets. the direct impact japan’s economy likely minimal, lend country region inconsiderable, export europe account 10 percent total. however, china unite state – major destination japanese export – europe account 20 percent export japan could, therefore, indirectly affected. furthermore, necessary aware downside risks, stem effect yen’s appreciation euro, japan’s export competitiveness, well impact financial market instability firms’ fund procurement. c. price development i move prices. commodity prices, major impact price development japan, rise trend, reflect high growth emerge economies. a result, recent import price 10 percent year-ago levels, plunge 30 percent year year summer 2009. in addition, domestic corporate good price index (cgpi), measure fluctuation price good trade firm japan, rise somewhat level period year ago. bi review 120/2010 3 the consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food (the core cpi), measure price good service purchase households, decline year-on-year basis since march 2009, indicate deflation. however, follow large year-on-year decline 2.4 percent august 2009, pace decline moderate trend. meanwhile, pace decline cpi exclude food energy, core-core cpi, usually susceptible commodity price fluctuations, also moderate recently, mark large fall 1.2 percent begin 2010. these developments, apart rise commodity prices, probably occur japanese economy bottom start recover around spring 2009, effect narrow negative output gap begin reflect price lag one year. the year-on-year rate decline core cpi likely continue slowing, reflect rise commodity price narrow negative output gap, rate change cpi may even enter positive territory fiscal 2011. there are, needle say, upside downside risk associate outlook prices, economic activity. the upside risk include upswing commodity price cause stronger-than-expected growth emerge economies. on hand, price development could deviate downward outlook pessimism among public spread due slower-than-expected recovery economy. a decline medium- long-term inflation expectation various economic entity could trigger fall actual inflation rate. thus, risk associate price development require careful monitoring. ii. measure take bank next, i elaborate bank’s policy measure since start recent global financial crisis. a. measure address rapid financial contraction in order address rapid financial contraction trigger failure lehman brothers, bank successively conduct same-day funds-supplying operation introduce u.s. dollar funds-supplying operation emergency measure provide liquidity financial markets. furthermore, bank decide introduce outright purchase cp corporate bonds, base recognition significant decline function markets, serious shortage liquidity cp corporate bond markets, cause tighten overall corporate finance conditions. in addition, bank introduce series temporary emergency measure facilitate corporate financing, include ease rat requirement corporate debt accept eligible collateral special funds-supplying operation facilitate corporate financing, bank provide 3-month fund unlimited amount value corporate debt pledge collateral fix interest rate 0.1 percent. furthermore, order ensure accommodative financial environment, october 31 december 19, 2008, bank reduce target level policy interest rate (the uncollateralized overnight call rate), bring 0.5 percent current 0.1 percent. in order provide ample liquidity maintain policy interest rate low level, bank also introduce complementary deposit facility, whereby interest make payable excess reserve balance hold bank financial institutions. at time, bank introduce temporary measure secure stability financial system, give strain global financial market subsequent fall stock price rise credit cost greatly affect financial institutions’ intermediary function financial soundness. such measure include purchase stock hold financial institution help reduce market risk associate stock hold provision subordinate loan bank help maintain sufficient capital bases. 4 bi review 120/2010 since then, bank gradually bring end temporary measure financial market regain stability. in may 2010, however, order address increase strain global financial market trigger fiscal problem greece european countries, bank re-established u.s. dollar funds-supplying operation wind begin february 2010. b. measure address deflation although financial market gradually regain stability economy show sign moderate recovery, bank recognize japan’s economy still face critical challenge overcome deflation return sustainable growth path price stability. for reason, bank reiterate commitment fight deflation. regard “understanding medium- long-term price stability” (the level inflation policy board member understands, conduct monetary policy, consistent price stability medium long term; hereinafter “understanding”), bank, monetary policy meet hold december 2009, make clear policy board tolerate year-on-year rate change cpi equal 0 percent, midpoint policy board members’ “understanding” around 1 percent. on basis, bank continue maintain policy rate extremely low level 0.1 percent. moreover, order ease monetary condition encourage decline longer-term interest rates, bank december 2009 introduce new fixed-rate funds-supplying operation pool collateral (hereinafter fixed-rate operation), whereby fund maturity three month provide extremely low interest rate 0.1 percent. the total amount loan provide fixed-rate operation first set approximately 10 trillion yen december 2009, increase approximately 20 trillion yen march 2010. c. introduction fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth through measure i mention far, bank provide ample fund financial market financial institutions. however, fund sufficient fee economy bring strong growth. therefore, central bank, bank examine way could support financial institutions, effort term lend investment, way would help strengthen foundation economic growth. a result deliberations, bank june 15, 2010, decide introduce new fund-provisioning measure strengthen foundation economic growth. the measure provide fund financial institutions, reflect effort term lend investment strengthen economic growth loan rate equivalent bank’s policy interest rate, currently 0.1 percent. the duration loan provide bank one year principle, maximum duration loan four years, include rollovers. with measure, bank hope offer broad support possible various effort financial institution make initiative. the bank start provide fund around end august 2010 new loan disburse quarterly. the measure temporary bank set march 31, 2012, deadline new loan applications, financial institution would accelerate implementation lend investment. the bank already start make necessary preparation provide fund measure. on june 25, bank announce select 66 counterparty financial institution fund-provisioning public application. not major banks, also wide range financial institutions, include regional banks, become counterparties. each counterparty submit plan strengthen foundation economic growth bank, currently evaluate counterparty’s eligibility base amount bi review 120/2010 5 lend investment carry plan april-june quarter 2010. base evaluation, bank determine much lend first disbursement. let next explain background bank’s decision introduce fund-provisioning measure. iii. strengthen foundation economic growth a. deflation a i mention earlier, japan experience deflation. price instability, include deflation, various negative effect economy society. for instance, reduce efficiency resource allocation, restrain economic activity make economic outlook uncertain, distort income distribution change real value contracts, asset liabilities, typically nominal terms. in addition, problem particular deflation. for example, point debtor high propensity consume tend restrain spend real value debt rises, weigh economy. in addition, due zero bind nominal interest rates, real interest rate fall level require level economic activity. decline inflation rate trend share major economy around world. it japan, however, price term cpi exclude food energy (the core-core cpi) falling. the main reason large output gap, remain consistently negative since second half 1990s. what more, gap much large major economies. this attributable excess supply capacity adequately adjust relative level domestic demand, stay sluggish since burst economic bubble. weakness domestic demand prolong delay balance-sheet adjustment various economic entity lack forward-looking expenditure since burst economic bubble. in particular, delay disposal impair asset financial institution weaken financial intermediary functions, impair ability provide sufficient fund new area growth. the pressure various economic entity adjust balance sheet le disappear since begin 2000. however, prolong period weak domestic demand compound recent onset population decline, push economic entities’ expectation economic growth forestall forward-looking expenditure. the lehman shock 2008 deal another serious blow demand impact continue day. one reason supply capacity sufficiently adjust despite stagnant demand that, result various regulation protection measures, factor production remain area demand shift away. there possibility inflation expectation lessen expectation future economic growth continue decline output gap narrow steadily. in case, consumer good service may put spending, supplier may cut price stimulate demand. under circumstances, although output gap remain unchanged, price may fall deflation may become even difficult quell. at present, medium- long-term inflation expectation remain stable important make sure decrease. b. overcome deflation in order japan’s economy overcome deflation, necessary narrow negative output gap. to end, demand expanded. the task impossible various area potential demand tapped, sector relate provision healthy safe food, environment, population aging. an example latent demand recent government measure sharply increase demand 6 bi review 120/2010 environment-friendly durable goods. needle say, also important follow development overseas demand. a i mention earlier, economic growth emerge commodity-exporting economy astounding, likely demand japanese good service still much room growth. the issue stake tap demand. the government’s “new growth strategy” “fiscal management strategy,” announce june, may provide pointers. the “new growth strategy” aim create strong japanese economy basis measure demand creation i mentioned, together step overcome constraint supply good circulation fund implement accordance specific timetable. the “fiscal management strategy,” meanwhile, aim restore sound sustainable fiscal structure way consistent “new growth strategy.” in event, vital measure implement swiftly schedule. moreover, private economic entities, addition tap new area demand, need improve productivity new manufacture technology shift capital labor area high productivity. the “new growth strategy” support efforts. it could argue high productivity increase supply, would cause widen output gap. however, point high productivity would raise demand product highly productive firm workers; anticipation increase future demand would raise current demand; that, thus, efficiency resource allocation could improved, turn would expand demand overall. the industrial revolution britain provide evidence pivotal role play increase productivity nation’s growth. during industrial revolution early nineteenth century, luddite movement emerge worker destroy machine deprive jobs. mechanization, however, increase productivity enhance britain’s growth potential, pave way subsequent ascendancy british empire. there doubt enhance productivity indispensable japan give age decline population. while difficult avoid problem arise decline population short term, increase productivity help avoid decline potential growth rate maintain vitality japanese economy. c. measure take bank the fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth introduce bank june 15, 2010, aim support private financial institutions’ effort accord provide fund require private economic entity find new demand enhance productivity. it hop move help increase potential output growth, narrow output gap, eventually bring deflation end. in sense, measure consistent principle stipulate article 2 bank japan act bank aim “achieving price stability, thereby contribute sound development national economy.” instead merely express objective words, bank take action belief policy work catalyst private economic entity join achieve common goal. i constantly aware bank always must ready proactively implement appropriate policies. go forward, bank continue proactive utmost bring japan’s economy back sustainable growth path price stability. bi review 119/2010 1 jean-claude trichet: euro star event raise public awareness facilitate changeover euro estonia speech mr jean-claude

september 2010. * * * thank invitation come shepparton. no one knew, invitation issue almost year ago, would battle floodwaters couple week prior today. it good see recovery already well advanced. in global economy, recovery effect different kind deluge – man-made one – way while. progress quite varied, however, outlook uncertain now. i give update matter today. it also seem fit occasion talk “monetary policy regions”, since question often ask take account differ economic condition across country set monetary policy. i offer perspective issue arise one policy instrument fairly diverse economy. the essential message diversity matters, often pronounce people assume, part economy ultimately connected. thing affect one sector tend spillover effect elsewhere. furthermore, economy certain capacity adjust differ conditions. in australia work reasonably well. current economic condition the global economy continue present mix picture. in asian region, country well truly recover downturn occur late 2008 first month 2009. the main exception japan. in bulk cases, economy much close potential output path year ago policy move le expansionary settings. a result, year ahead growth asian region unlikely rapid year mid 2010, “v-shaped” recovery full swing. similar comment could probably make latin america. in europe, german economy power ahead year, reap benefit many year attention contain cost build productivity. but continental economy strong, grip painful adjustment world constrict private credit limit budgetary flexibility. in unite state expansion way time, seem lately lose bite steam growth recently robust enough reduce high unemployment. in australia, growth quite solid past year, unemployment relatively low, inflation has, moment, declined. in fact, growth trend favourable several year comparison many economies. the chart below, compare trend australia’s real gdp per caput several countries, illustrative. of course cannot match extent growth china – country live standard rapidly increase process “catch up” high level high-income country (graph 1). but clear compare u europe, japan, australia’s per caput output income do pretty well past several year (graph 2). 2 bi review 119/2010 graph 1 graph 2 the task ahead, then, seek far possible continue solid trend like this, various challenge lie ahead. the future course unknowable, economic forecast unfortunately reliable. but option try form view thing probably unfold. bi review 119/2010 3 we think global economy record reasonable growth come year, though strong past year (a strength that, incidentally, surprise observers). we think australia’s term trade, reach 60-year high current quarter, probably decline bit, remain high. we expect high level relative export price add income spending, even stimulative effect early low interest rate budgetary measure continue unwind. we expect, indication business well, resource sector investment rise – experience large mineral energy boom since late 19th century. even continue caution households, probably mean overall growth, trend past year, increase 2011 something trend. we think mean fall inflation past two year won’t go much further. of course central forecast could turn wrong. something could turn – internationally home – produce outcome. we spend fair bite time think thing could be. possible candidate might return economic contraction unite states, big expect slowdown china, resumption financial turmoil abruptly curtail access capital market bank around world damage confidence generally. but downside possibility materialise, task ahead likely one manage fairly robust upswing. part task will, clearly, fall monetary policy. the objective monetary policy what objective monetary policy? put simply, job preserve value money time try, far possible, keep economy near full employment potential. over long run, mutually reinforce goals, conflict ones. for past 17 year way pursue goal operate medium-term target cpi inflation 2–3 per cent, average. the “on average” specification allow u accept short-term fluctuation inflation – long short-term – avoid risk attempt over-control inflation process de-stabilising economy. but specification still require u limit inflation medium term. over 17-year period, cpi inflation average 2.5 per cent (excluding one-time impact gst 2000), economy generally exhibit stability, real gdp mostly little close trend precede couple decades. how monetary policy work? the reserve bank effective control one interest rate – namely rate apply one financial institution lend cash overnight another (hence label “cash rate”). this rate major impact – though exclusion force – range short-term market rates. since bulk finance activity australia contract variable interest rates, axiomatically affect change short-term rates, rate pay borrower usually closely affect cash rate decision – though factor impinge well time time. through device bank affect relative incentive save versus borrowing, impact spend good service financial “real” assets. because relative rate return australian asset compare foreign asset alter change interest rate here, exchange rate also move response monetary policy change (although time move response host factor well). often, expectation happen cash rate future important as, even important than, level cash rate today. for reason bank say – people think say – influential market 4 bi review 119/2010 behaviour. it reason central banker usually guard public comments. the effect monetary policy diverse economy it obvious even highly condense description monetary policy affect different group different ways. for start, change interest rate shift distribution income saver borrowers. the large size one’s balance sheet – either asset debt – likely one affect change rate interest. someone debt save probably feel little impact – feel anything – change interest rates, least directly. in addition, one set interest rate whole australian economy; different interest rate certain region industries. we set policy average australian conditions. a give region industry may fully feel strength weakness overall economy bank respond monetary policy. in fact region industry may exactly “average” experience. it phenomenon people presumably mind refer monetary policy “blunt instrument”. the issue possible different monetary policy region industry within country, least use one currency fund free flow around. either area want interest rate would also currency, would need draconian set regulation prevent save one region flow another loan – sort local regional equivalent pervasive capital control exist international capital movements. quite possibly might need comprehensive tailor interest rate set local conditions. obviously unlikely practical. moreover would cost region currency. it would establish reserve bank start, would accept additional transaction cost cross-border transaction regions, would probably inhibit trade investment flow region country. very small currency area also often get trouble years. these reason many small country often peg currency large neighbour simply adopt currency outright. perceive gain part large monetary union continue attract small european country euro, even though membership condition fairly demanding, recently seen. there field economics think set issues. apart obvious criterion like language, culture political unity, suitable case single currency think strong when:  force (“shocks”) affect group region country fairly similar way regional economy respond similar;  lot trade region (as usually within single country);  factor production (labour capital) flow fairly easily region response difference conditions; and/or  mean respond difference experience (particularly fiscal transfers) available. that framework suggest several question might ask australia regions:  how different shock region?  how flexibly economy respond differences? bi review 119/2010 5  what policy mechanism work respond?  and finally, different, ultimately, experience response occurred? difference across country it worth observe “shocks” hit economy markedly different effect region industry. some fairly widespread effect. take sudden intensification financial turmoil september 2008. confidence slump people begin “batten hatches” – every industry every region around world – le simultaneously. bank become cautious lend – particularly property sector, generally almost borrower – every country. other shock particular. the one people would think likely differential impact across region would big rise mine price associate build-up investment saw year ago, return past year half. since mineral resource find abundance every region, area would expect receive boost others. for example western australia, mine account quarter production; 2 per cent production victoria. so would seem obvious impact event increase demand mineral likely see, time, output wa give boost victoria. but usual, picture get complicate think further. the headquarter major mine company melbourne. those company put additional demand various service provider around nation – air travel consultants, geologist manufacturers, on. the effect engineer construction build mineral investment felt region around country (and indeed also overseas suppliers). the high income generate mineral boom felt employees, shareholder (some overseas) government (via various taxes). depend entity respond gain income, subsequent effect economic activity around country. it may well still case effect obvious pronounce wa, substantial spillover economy responds. incidentally, data suggest quite recently economic activity grow fast victoria wa. so second question, mobility factor production? a remarkable feature remote area mine operation way labour operate “fly-in, fly-out” basis. any user perth airport easily attest “commutes” also occur eastern states. more generally, population shift long occur south-eastern state resource-rich states. while move costly, analysis i see mobility australian workforce pretty good – people shift response opportunity. capital course highly mobile, least margin. a policy mechanism work, substantial fiscal transfers. the “automatic stabilisers” take tax region well, since income rise relatively quickly, transfer area le well form welfare payments. government also use discretionary spend policy part this. moreover structure place deliberately design lessen systematically difference outcome might otherwise occur. opinion differ effective been, effective – recent political event probably demonstrated. but general point political federation australia, various fiscal transfer mechanism act diminish divergence might result difference initial condition exposure 6 bi review 119/2010 economic events. this likely le area monetary union political federation. indeed economist long point potential difficulty euro area set circumstances, like one exist europe present. that said, seeing, albeit somewhat ad hoc basis, intra-european transfer mechanism developed. so australia, effect “shock”, even concentrate initially, tend felt generally across economy time. the way economy work naturally tend help occur, various policy devices. that suppose happen well-functioning, integrate national economy. the next question, then, different outcome turn mechanism respond various impacts. of course difference remain industry level – ultimately, look likely mine sector area supply grow, industry will, relatively, get smaller. and point, much impact recent resource price change yet seen. nonetheless still worth examine different key trend date across regions. there various indicator state level even regional level. these vary reliability – sample size get pretty small cases. two reliable data set likely consumer price index unemployment rate. it these, course, people probably interest well. the cpi available capital cities. consumer price capital city track remarkably closely (graph 3) – least much single currency area like unite state euro area (graphs 4 5). graph 3 bi review 119/2010 7 graph 4

graph 9 10 bi review 119/2010 these comparison affect fact u europe deep recession early stage recovery, whereas australia mild downturn unemployment fall year now. a chart show, dispersion unemployment rate tend cyclical dimension. nonetheless i think reasonable, base history show here, conclude that, event lead divergence economic condition across australia, overall difference especially large recent time compare see entity might compare ourselves. that say difference unimportant immaterial people’s lives, could get larger. nonetheless perspective large actually useful. how reserve bank keep track different economic performances? that said, important add reserve bank make considerable effort look level national data pursuit full understand happen ground. over past decade put substantial resource comprehensive liaison program firms, industry group state regional government entities. officer base every mainland state capital spend much time talk people go on. every month talk 100 organisation around country. i know staff visit shepparton last month may meet them. the purpose help u understand happen “at coal face” – condition business actually experience thing concern them. this help give rich often timely understand go higher-level aggregate data alone might provide. talk business plan future help inform forecasts, especially useful recently build profile condition different sectors, expect investment mine sector come years. this important analysis capacity in, instance, mine sector, affect see commodity prices, term trade, exchange rate exports. conclusion a physically large country, quite diverse set industries, large population centre separate long distance even live different climates, australia always likely see difference economic experience region. what remarkable, fact, difference not, end, larger. that testimony degree flexibility within national economy build time, design national policy aim lessen stark difference might otherwise occur. those structure grow context system national money. monetary policy is, design, appropriately national policy. in conduct it, reserve bank devote considerable attention find understand happen regional industry level. that help u maintain overall set financial condition appropriate national economy. but know always difference change monetary policy felt (though always assume impact necessarily great country areas). monetary policy can’t make difference disappear. in end, however, monetary policy help deliver reasonable macroeconomic stability, offer best chance industry, region, business individual succeed merits. the reserve bank, take account condition across various sectors, remain commit goal. bi review 119/2010 1 grant spencer: the impact global financial crisis financial policy summary remark mr grant spencer, deputy governor reserve bank new zealand, symposium financial sector governance, auckland, 20 september 2010. * * * in presentation, i would like discus new zealand’s financial policy response global financial crisis. my focus permanent change policy follow crisis rather initial short term “emergency” responses. i cover financial policy oversee reserve bank, namely monetary policy, liquidity management prudential supervision bank non-banks. monetary policy in new zealand, monetary policy focus maintenance price stability. this alone provide guarantee economic stability financial stability. however, experience new zealand overseas suggest maintain price stability medium term best worthwhile contribution monetary policy make achieve broad economic financial stability. our inflation target framework serve u well financial crisis help guide sensible policy responses. immediately prior crisis, monetary policy new zealand relatively restrictive reserve bank increase official cash rate (ocr) 2004 2007 response elevate inflation pressure associate boom house market. a global crisis emerge deepened, respond reduce ocr aggressively. the ocr cut 2008 early 2009 high 8.25 percent 2.5 percent. these reduction appropriate, despite high headline rate inflation time due record high oil prices. the policy ease consistent outlook rapidly diminish inflation pressure global domestic economy turn sharply downwards. go forward, medium term price stability remain primary objective monetary policy. however, expect monetary policy bite next year many years; number reasons: first, follow crisis bank face high cost funds. it expensive borrow offshore, turn see compete aggressively fund raise domestic retail deposit market. we currently estimate spread banks’ average cost fund ocr 150 basis point high prior crisis. this state affair likely persist time. it mean that, give ocr, rate bank charge customer lend high before. second, evidence date suggest that, follow global crisis, household business considerably le will take new debt. credit growth remain subdued. we believe diminish appetite debt remain time people company work gradually strengthen financial positions. third, unlike situation much past twenty years, new zealand face upward slop yield curve – long term interest rate high short-term rates. this mean fix rate mortgage expensive float short-term fix rate mortgages. this see many borrower shift back float rate past two years. a result, move ocr high likely “bite” previously. 2 bi review 119/2010 liquidity management a global financial crisis broke, key policy response reserve bank expansion liquidity facility provide bank financial institutions, include broaden acceptable collateral

reserve bank’s expand liquidity facilities, experience underline need bank lengthen maturity liability relative assets, order reduce vulnerability shocks. to address issues, reserve bank introduce new prudential liquidity policy bank april 2010. this policy require bank hold sufficient eligible liquid asset meet one-week one-month liquidity mismatch ratio requirements. in addition, bank must meet core fund ratio requirement least 65 percent. core fund consist customer deposit (weighted size) market fund one year great maturity. the core fund ratio requirement rise 75 percent mid 2012. the bank

reserve system, brook panel economic activity, washington dc, 17 september 2010. * * * broadly speaking, threat financial stability arise two ways: first, rapid deterioration failure large institution leverage sufficient widespread knock-on effect and, second, breakdown significant market large number leverage actor depend upon similar source liquidity and, importantly, backup liquidity period stress. these two source systemic risk be, usually are, related. in fact, severity recent crisis might explain explosive combination two. but different origin risk call different or, perhaps precisely, complementary, policy responses.1 to date, reform financial regulation supervision focus mainly large regulate institutions: three example just-announced basel iii capital rules, much dodd-frank act, federal reserve’s revamp large hold company supervision. of course, attention also pay second source systemic risk, notably dodd-frank’s provision prudential supervision payments, clearing, settlement systems. but need do area, particularly new constraint applicable large regulate institution push activity unregulated sector. this paper gary gorton andrew metrick, “regulating shadow bank system” (g-m), fit squarely within enterprise. it build two important insight work gorton pursue well financial crisis began: first, enormous growth shadow bank system generally, repurchase agreement, “repo,” market specifically, depend engineer aaa-rated security lead participant believe need inquire soundness underlie collateral. this financial engineer largely succeed insulate participant idiosyncratic risk. but value whole class underlie collateral draw serious question, initially collapse subprime house market, participants’ lack information collateral hold lead shatter confidence collateral. in absence regulation government backstop apply traditional bank system since depression, run asset entire repo market ensued. the result force sale asset illiquid market turn many illiquid institution insolvent ones. the fallout that, day, amount repo fund available non-agency, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, high-yield corporate bonds, instrument back asset degree risk remain substantially pre-lehman levels. the second gorton insight paper build importance statutory franchise value business model viability least kind regulate financial entities. where competition unregulated entity permitted, explicitly de facto, capital requirement impose regulate firm may shrink margin enough make unattractive investors. the result, see past, combination regulatory arbitrage, assumption high risk permit activities, exit 1 the view present necessarily member board governor federal reserve system federal open market committee. tom king michael palumbo board’s staff contribute remarks. 2 bi review 118/2010 industry. each outcome least potentially undermine original motivation regulation. the g-m paper provide concrete, though respect fully elaborated, proposal remedy information problem repo market creation statutory franchise value g-m call narrow fund bank (nfbs). these bank would “narrow” asset would asset-backed security (abs) high quality instrument treasuries. they would, appears, make money income stream associate abs. they would raise fund purchase ab debt issuance and, significantly proposal, repo market, collateral offer would liability nfbs. the government would regulate nfbs directly, banks, also set requirement ab could buy nfbs. this regulation intend provide market confidence liability nfbs, would buttress nfb access discount window. a key feature proposal that, law, nfbs could buy securitized assets. the consequent franchise value would compensate nfbs cost incur hold high-quality securities, subject supervision prudential requirements, operate highly transparent fashion. in essence, abs-backed repo fund would limit nfbs. the first two question i would pose creative policy proposal basic: what problem suppose solve, breadth remedy align problem? give analysis breakdown repo market, gorton metrick’s answer might self-evident: the g-m proposal aim solve information problem increase risk maturity transformation associate ab repo funding. this, course, solve entire shadow bank system, though effective plan reform ab repo market would major accomplishment itself.2 but propose solution problem, g-m would significantly restrict asset-backed securitization. while obvious much credit create ab associate instrument year precede crisis, seem least reasonable question whether best policy response dramatic change regulatory environment. one wonders, example, desirable forbid anyone nfbs buy abs, particularly investor interest hold asset regardless utility repo arrangements. the severe problem associate ab begin asset hold mismatch entity like structure investment vehicle financial institution engage capital arbitrage basel ii, hold end investors. a variant initial question much legal environment securitization change order provide source stable short-term liquidity wholesale fund markets. limit securitization purchase nfbs surely result tailor ab business model nfbs, outcome might identical securitization market tailor fund need lender provide credit business consumers. also, i explain later, g-m proposal would require non-trivial change bank regulatory policy, well significant extension discount window access new kind institution. all would pursuit mechanism generate large amount liquidity. a cost-benefit discussion probably need outset, careful specification benefit repo market g-m try save, weigh likely impact – among thing – securitization market regulatory system. a second set question concern nfbs would operate practice. a threshold matter, worth note policymakers may find proposal certain binary 2 for survey entire shadow bank system, see pozsar, zoltan, tobian adrian, adam ashcraft, hayley boesky (july 2010): “shadow banking,” (928 kb pdf) federal reserve bank new york staff reports, no. 458. bi review 118/2010 3 quality. that is, would structurally change entire securitization market large portion repo market essentially overnight. in effect, g-m put securitization egg one basket. if new system work well, benefit presumably would significant, perhaps quickly realized. indeed, new system might succeed help restart, sound basis, various ab submarkets remain largely dormant three year crisis begin unfold.3 if, hand, new system encounter major difficulties, might materially reduce adaptive capacity financial actors, possibly considerable period. one obvious source difficulty possibility, well recognize g-m, business model mandate nfbs might viable stable. a form narrow bank propose years, nfbs group would seem likely generate relatively low revenues, give low risk security would invest. g-m propose counter problem grant franchise value statutory monopoly securitization mention early access federal reserve’s discount window. pick analogy creation deposit insurance 1930s, monopoly securitization intend help offset regulatory cost impose nfbs way monopoly “business banking” intend offset regulatory cost impose insure depository institutions. unlike business environment bank 1930s, however, securitization repo lend national – international – activities, little suggest advantage would derive local knowledge. it seem quite possible economy scale associate nfb model sufficiently high industry structure would tend toward oligopoly, even monopoly. that is, much franchise value might created. in event, would significant addition cost side proposal’s ledger, form price quantity effect result non-competitive industry structures. regardless eventual structure industry, nfbs essentially would monolines, highly correlate risk exposures. they could particularly vulnerable fund difficulty time deteriorate credit conditions. yet term g-m proposal, apparently would able hedge interest rate risks. g-m propose give nfbs access discount window forestall liquidity problem run nfbs, presumably way deposit insurance stop run traditional banks. here though, analogy perfect one. while bank depositor assure federal deposit insurance corporation keep latter whole event former’s failure, federal reserve make bind commitment lend institution actively discourage reliance window regular funding. a third question g-m proposal arise significant change current law practice would require proposal adopted. the prohibition ab hold anyone nfbs obvious major example. but several others: in addition possibly problematic feature discount window lend general proposal, federal reserve traditionally open window non-depository institution particularly stress conditions. under dodd-frank act, use credit rat federal regulation prohibited, obvious complication g-m proposal. this part dodd-frank accelerate expand effort already underway federal bank agency lessen regulatory reliance ratings. in truth, may pose great challenge g-m proposal many exist capital rules.4 3 the relative dormancy market also due part limit supply loan need fee securitization process. 4 for discussion issue raise context capital requirements, see board governor federal reserve system (2010), “advance notice propose rulemaking regard alternative use credit rat risk-based capital guideline federal bank agencies,” joint advance notice propose rulemaking (august 10). 4 bi review 118/2010 still, may require extension g-m’s confidence regulator could adequately oversee ab rat confidence could assign rat first place. i would observe substantial effort expend staff board federal reserve bank new york evaluate creditworthiness relatively small number securitizations term asset-backed security loan facility suggest enormity task. furthermore, wisdom government agency – even independent central bank – assume permanent, central role credit allocation least subject debate. a final regulatory issue raise another g-m response expectation equity return nfbs low traditional banks. in place equity capital requirement generally applicable bank organizations, g-m propose nfbs would issue capital note debt-like except period stress, would convert equity. in essence, nfb’s capital would contingent capital. while contingent capital item financial regulatory agenda, consider possible supplement common equity, substitute it. in respect, g-m proposal move opposite direction basel iii, follow market make common equity centerpiece capital evaluation requirements.5 these inconsistency current law practice g-m proposal argue soundness. they do, however, underscore degree nfbs would require development new financial regulatory approach, well restructure ab repo markets. more generally, existence cost problem counsel rejection proposal such. in face real flaw pre-crisis state markets, failure ab market recover, even seem could function sensibly, good case policy initiative. so let consider briefly whether variant basic g-m approach might retain core benefit address potential problems. one possibility would broaden permissible ownership nfbs include bank hold companies. this modification would make sense one believe basic g-m approach promise risk either untenable business model high industry concentration, consequent anti-competitive effects, high. it possible number large, diversify financial hold company would find nfb viable part operations. g-m require nfbs stand-alone entities, specifically prohibit ownership commercial bank effort avoid implicit contractual guarantees. this legitimate concern, sure, one might least imperfectly address specific restriction relationship affiliate bank hold company. the relevant comparison thus residual cost regulate relationship effect anti-competitive industry structure. a second variant g-m approach, also motivate industry structure problems, would turn nfbs privately own public utility (as g-m describe them) actual public utilities. however, extent change ownership structure would ameliorate anti-competitive problem uncertain. moreover, concern mention early respect government judgment credit allocation would remain, even provide another layer insulation device government corporation. in addition, course, history fannie mae freddie mac cautionary tale potential government monopoly conservative mandate expand operation much risky activities. 5 it also seem likely kind quantitative liquidity requirement currently development basel committee bank supervision would difficult nfbs satisfy. bi review 118/2010 5 at first glance, then, clear structural modification basic g-m approach would preferable proposal describe it. option depart g-m approach would need find different way solve information problem g-m identify. let briefly speculate possible alternative would use regulatory requirement create class ab market could, without inquiry nature quality underlie assets, confidence even period stress. one way, course, would follow closely deposit insurance analogy establish insurance system. g-m suggest insurance system repo market would impractical, question whether insure collateral (i.e., certain class securitized assets) would sustainable without create franchise value, worry creation franchise value limit entry securitization would, words, “limit amount money created.” yet, i suggest earlier, g-m proposal might constrain securitization undesirable ways, relate unrelated repo transactions. in address franchise value issue, would interest pursue important idea g-m mention, center proposal: make repo bankruptcy exception available collateral conform certain criterion establish law regulation. give demand repo funding, seem worth consider whether device could use create necessary franchise value. indeed, approach promise, might feasible regulatory body establish requisite criterion without provide insurance. with without insurance, “franchise value” might attach instrument institution. there time enumerate potential difficulty ideas, hard discern, even state skeletal form. in common g-m proposal, would require level expertise involvement credit rat government could pose practical and, conceivable alternatives, policy concerns. in case, think discussion, rather develop options. gary gorton andrew metrick have, set forth proposal, continue shape understand role risk shadow bank system, well add specific proposal menu possible responses. bi review 118/2010 1 axel a weber: growth prospect crisis speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, 21st european business school (ebs) symposium, oestrich-winkel, 17 september 2010. * * * 1. introduction professor jahns, lady gentlemen, i delight ask assume patronage 21st eb symposium thus opportunity speak today. occasion like provide platform student meet professional agreeable complement academic study. this symposium traditionally organise first-year student who, i must say, appear do well perform task. 2. growth financial system – general remark the topic year’s symposium “growth – a future without boundaries”. economic growth widely associate even equate prosperity, light current crisis topic receive lot attention: after all, crisis result pronounce downturn since world war ii, many also cast doubt path economic activity crisis over. nevertheless, wish make sound comprehensive judgement advisable look current gross domestic product (gdp). economic growth concept embrace longer-term perspective would well advise look beyond current crisis. the concept potential output permit calm objective view matter. abstract cyclical fluctuations, cover medium long-term trend gdp link drive factor time horizon. to specific focus mind last economic impact crisis, help take simple textbook model economic growth start point. in stylise model, growth determine three factors: capital, labour technical progress. how three factors, turn, affect financial system? the first factor – capital – point perhaps obviously importance financial system. after all, financial sector part economy distinct value added, also play crucial role capital accumulation. however, especially highly develop economy typically boast sizeable sophisticate financial sectors, role financial system go far beyond mere capital accumulation. in economies, financial system play key role identify fund innovations, thus help advance state technical knowledge promote technological progress. for reason – leave aside additional effect due labour force investment human capital – efficient financial system indispensable growth necessarily become complex advance stage economic development. in sense, even crisis massive repercussion real economy enormous cost illustrate important financial system stability economic performance welfare. consequently, financial stability become top priority global policy agenda. but stability end itself. historical record tell u financial crisis always element market economies. therefore, objective avoid entirely rather contain consequences. put differently, challenge regulatory reform strike right balance stability financial system efficiency. and, give experience past year well channel financial system affect economic growth, 2 bi review 118/2010 two objective are, significant degree, complementary. this mean trade-off stability efficiency see zero-sum game. well-designed regulatory reform make financial system stable without cut sustainable growth. 3. the crisis, regulatory reform future growth the strength scale financial crisis unforeseeable. there warn various exaggeration undesirable developments. but perception might lead fell well short reality actually materialised. prior crisis, global economy grow rapid pace. this due, least, fact emerge market become increasingly integrated. this set free large labour potential, provide high-yielding investment opportunities, lead significant growth per caput income. another drive factor behind growth le benign, however. in many areas, capital always channel productive areas. consider house market advance economy point case. an environment interest rate exceptionally low well loophole weakness regulatory framework act catalyst undesirable and, ultimately, unsustainable developments. eventually, underlie imbalance erupt suddenly come surface – well-known costs. the situation global economy find comparable rise bush sprout many new bud quickly. the new rosebud many attractive blossom soon start rain, support break off. against background, deficiency financial system remedied? at microeconomic level, whole cocktail different factor lead financial crisis. these include general lack transparency, insufficient capital buffers, development scarcely regulate shadow bank system, moral hazard various form – owe ill-designed remuneration schemes, example, insufficient risk liquidity management level individual institutions. at macroeconomic level, particular, pivotal role certain agent influence financial market – words, systematic importance – underestimate long. in order prevent rise bush sprout many weak bud blossom again, reform micro macro level need make financial system resilient future shocks. a first line defence, microprudential level regulation need strengthened. the measure propose include high capital liquidity requirements. these intend low probability institution’s insolvency enable cope good losses. proposal reform publish basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) december 2009. the discussion well advanced. a final proposal adopt last weekend, g20 meet november yield final decision. a result, financial institution request hold high quantity capital book also capital increase quality: minimum core capital requirement go 2% 4.5%, tier 1 capital current 4% 6%. this supplement additional buff 2.5% build common equity. this design enable bank absorb loss period economic financial disruptions. furthermore, strict definition core capital applied. yet, first line defence need supplemented. in market-based economy neither possible desirable entirely prevent failure individual enterprises. thus, second line defence draw macroprudential level regulation order contain impact individual bank failure financial system whole make financial system transparent. this part reform process deal fsb. major topic agenda handle systemically important financial institution “too-big-too-fail” problem, resolution regimes, role rat agencies, bi review 118/2010 3 harmonise account standards, roll back trade otc derivatives. even though issue seem attract le attention basel iii, i confident shall see significant progress area time g20 meet november well. once implemented, reform microprudential macroprudential level profound impact financial system, increase resilience hence stability significantly. but, go back i say earlier, reform also strike right balance stability growth? i certain do. true, development new basel iii proposal accompany concern tight regulation might negative impact economic performance severely restrict access credit. several study potential effect new regulatory requirement economy publish recently. a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis reveal fear significant negative impact growth unfounded. this case give transition period new requirement enter fully force, give bank sufficient time strengthen capital base. this favourable overall assessment macroeconomic impact well-designed regulatory reform highlight fact inherent conflict g20 agenda’s objective stable financial system ensure strong sustainable growth. and, term general future outlook growth, bear mind financial crisis impair major driver growth. emerge markets, instance, still make great effort catch up, technical progress continue. thus, crisis certainly mark end economic growth. rather, do highlight importance sustainable growth need supportive policy – financial regulation, also many policy areas. 4. conclusion lady gentlemen, event implication current financial crisis clearly demonstrate vulnerable financial system been. the necessity reform cannot denied, financial stability reinforced. however, say earlier, enhance financial stability end obstacle growth. rather, major prerequisite. regulatory reform along line currently propose low probability crisis occur well impact, unduly hamper access fund consumer firms. the outcome significant improvement welfare long run. thank attention. bi review 117/2010 1 philip lowe: the development asia – risk return australia speech mr philip lowe, assistant governor reserve bank australia, natstats 2010 conference, sydney, 16 september 2010. * * * i would like thank adam cagliarini assistance prepare talk. it pleasure able support work australian bureau statistic (abs) participate year’s natstats conference. the conference evidence abs’s commitment high-quality statistics. it also evidence bureau’s commitment make sure statistic remain relevant economy evolve year ahead. today, i would like talk expect evolution issue raises. my central thesis two elements. the first medium-term prospect australian economy look positive year back. this partly result policy choice make within australia, also reflect development economy asia. the second element australia’s medium-term prospect improved, risk face economy also change risk need managed. in time today, i would like explore elements. the medium term development asia a well understood, australia come global downturn good shape. not business cycle relatively mute compare elsewhere, medium-term prospect look bright advance economies. they also look bright decade ago. for many year seem australia inexorably slip global league tables. the price export gradually fall relative price imports, little optimism would change. and decade ago australia view old-fashioned, low-tech economy, rely natural resource instead develop new technologies. today, thing look quite different. while continue uncertainty near-term outlook, optimism medium-term prospect time. the price commodity rise substantially. investment australia high australian asset view attractive international investors. i talk previous occasion factor help australia global downturn i don’t plan revisit today. rather, i want focus change perception medium-term prospect occur and, particular, role development asia played. at general level, importance asia australia well understood. despite this, remain case financial news unite state europe dominate newspaper airwaves. with constant flow information north atlantic, sometimes easy forget profound – important australia – structural change take place asia. two change particularly important. these twin process urbanisation industrialisation. a country asia urbanise industrialised, demand infrastructure grow strongly. when people move cities, new dwell need built, live standard rise, quality dwell 2 bi review 117/2010 constructed. the growth urban centre also require build communication transport networks, demand roads, bridges, railway etc rising. all development require raw materials. in particular, require steel build apartment new city dweller live build infrastructure support cities. for example, typical 90m2 apartment china require six tonne steel, 10km metropolitan subway require around 75,000 tonnes. on average, every tonne steel produce require around 1.7 tonne iron ore half tonne coke coal, australia fortunate position ample low-cost, high-quality supply both. and high energy consumption also feature industrialisation, fortunate position large reserve natural gas. not surprisingly, strong growth demand raw material asia lead large increase price raw material past decade. a result, australia’s term trade increase significantly high level since spike early 1950s wool price soar due korean war (graph 1). graph 1 these high price raise return capital australian resource sector, result large increase investment. indeed, australia become one high-investment country develop world, stock physical capital estimate increase average rate around 5 per cent recent years. by way contrast, many advance economies, include unite states, level investment little need offset depreciation exist capital stock (graph 2). bi review 117/2010 3 graph 2 when discuss impact asia australia recent years, focus rightly china. the transformation occur truly remarkable reshape global economy. over past three decades, proportion chinese population live urban centre double almost 45 per cent (graph 3). while couple historical example country urbanise quickly, sheer number people migrate urban centre unprecedented human history – past 30 years, nearly 400 million chinese citizen (almost 20 time population australia) move cities. a result, around 170 chinese city million residents, compare around 35 europe. and urbanisation process still quite long way run, another 300 400 million people expect move country city next 20 years. graph 3 these development china closely observe australia, include reserve bank. a decade ago, spend lot time puzzle quarterly 4 bi review 117/2010 movement australian gdp highly correlate quarterly movement u gdp. we don’t puzzle anymore – solve puzzle, correlation fall (graph 4). at time, correlation quarterly movement australian chinese gdp steadily increased. clearly happen australian economy dependent upon happen china case time past. graph 4 but think future, story broad china. over year ahead, indian economy, also contain 20 per cent world’s population within borders, likely become increasingly important australia. after india grow disappoint pace 1960s 1970s, growth pick recent decades, average 7 per cent per year 2000s (graph 5). the economy gradually open foreign trade capital, government influence investment decision scale back. while india inevitably follow different development path china, prospect sustain solid growth look good many years. graph 5 bi review 117/2010 5 like china, india urbanising. the process though gradual, number people move urban area past 30 year le half china (graph 3). despite india’s population currently marginally low china’s, 40 city population 1 million, compare china’s 170 so. this low rate urbanisation partly reflect fact india industrialise quickly china. a i mention moment ago, people move city demand steel tend rise. not surprisingly, china consumption steel quadruple since 1997, half current steel consumption account construction sector (graph 6).1 indian steel consumption also grown, nearly quickly. however, experience china country urbanise hint potential growth india. while moment, bulk indian population live rural area investment infrastructure relatively low, potential change year ahead, china past 30 years. if indeed occur demand raw material – steel, particular – likely strong come decades. graph 6 the impact chinese indian development confine resource sector though. a country develop live standard rise demand steel increase, demand higher-quality food, consumption protein increases. again, comparison china india instructive (graph 7). a income per head china grow past 30 years, protein consumption per head also rise strongly, almost double period. protein consumption also rise india, although increase much small due slow growth income per head difference dietary preferences. 1 china’s share world steel consumption increase 15 per cent 1997 44 per cent 2009. 6 bi review 117/2010 graph 7 again, year ahead quite likely global demand protein grow strongly, particularly india china continue current paths. with australia’s strong history agricultural production, another area advantage. the overall impact growth urbanisation asia clearly see australia’s international trade statistics. the four large market export 2009 china, japan, india south korea (graph 8). over first half 2010, around 22 per cent australia’s export receipt come china 8 per cent india. these share trend high time likely continue medium term. there also large increase share resource australia’s total exports. a decade ago, iron ore coal together account around 10 per cent australia’s total export (graph 9). in contrast, past six months, share around one third, total resource export account 55 per cent aggregate export revenue, around 35 per cent 1990s. graph 8 bi review 117/2010 7 graph 9 these change country product composition export large. they also likely persistent give asian development still year run. this development mean that, aggregate, australian economy potential well year ahead. condition are, however likely differ substantially across sector economy. if past experience guide, growth resource sector positive spin-off effect industries, rise real income increase demand wide range good services. other industry though find condition difficult due level exchange rate competition labour capital. while difference across sector create challenges, overall medium-term outlook economy positive one. the change risk risk management i would like turn second element thesis – medium-term outlook changed, risks, risk need managed. one obvious way risk change economy dependent past upon performance chinese economy resource sector, i suspect say thing indian economy year track. while, generally good news story, china india face significant challenge year ahead. in china, authority face difficult task rebalancing growth away export investment domestic consumption. and india, burden red-tape remain major issue way need find improve country’s infrastructure economy’s potential unlocked. it would unrealistic assume growth path country without bumps, perhaps large ones. and bump impact upon australia. nor assume commodity price remain current elevate levels. new source supply discover developed, always possibility new technology reduce demand australia’s main resource exports. there little external risks. but right policy framework place respond thing inevitably turn differently expect. there four aspect risk management i would like talk about. the first ensure productivity growth strong. the second ensure economy retain 8 bi review 117/2010 flexibility. the third way investment financed. and fourth rate national consumption increase response improve medium-term outlook. first, importance productivity growth. regardless thing develop country north, increase productivity australia remain key sustain increase live standards. ensure continue make progress provide insurance possibility development asia turn positively expect. if look back recent years, see productivity growth slowed. since 2001, output per hour work increase 1 per cent per year compare 2 per cent per year 1990s (graph 10). this slowdown occur despite significant rise economy’s overall capital-labour ratio, would typically expect boost average output per hour worked. normally, slow rate productivity growth would lead slow increase average live standards. but occurred. indeed, past decade, growth gross national income per hour work unusually strong, average almost 2¾ per cent per year. the reason price australia’s export rise relative price imports, lift purchase power australia’s national income. with proceed tonne iron ore buy lcd tv domestic service could decade ago. this allow live standard increase fast pace rely productivity growth alone. graph 10 look forward, situation cannot continue indefinitely. over next years, commodity price likely decline somewhat current high level put focus back onto productivity growth economic reform driver increase live standards. the second issue importance ensure economy remain flexible, respond unexpected developments. my colleague reserve bank i speak length previous occasion key element here. have flexible exchange rate one great stabilise force australian economy past 30 years. labour market flexibility also important. so retain flexibility monetary fiscal policy respond quickly unexpected developments. to list, i would add importance highly train educate workforce. not education help lift productivity, also make economy flexible help low risk. bi review 117/2010 9 the third element affect nature risk way investment financed. historically, much external fund business investment come banks. while bank finance likely remain important many firms, great share investment likely finance source case recent past. this may welcome news banks, investment finance variety different source help reduce aggregate risk. over year ahead, foreign direct investment capital market raise firm resource sector likely play important role past decade. this mean risk – and, course, expect return – rapid increase australia’s capital stock share foreign investors. the fourth element risk management response domestic consumption improve outlook. the textbook say future income prospect improve, level national consumption – either private public – increase now. but textbook also say low appetite risk, great uncertainty future, small immediate adjustment consumption. it also say uncomfortable possibility future decline consumption thing work well, small adjustment now. if look back economic history, early 1980s provide good example happen adjustment quick. in first couple year decade, much optimism future resource sector, largely reflect rise oil price result opec ii. this optimism translate quickly high wage increase spending, economy grow strongly while. but, optimism turn short live result significant hangover, require substantial adjustment spend real wage follow years. by way contrast, current experience look quite different. despite considerable optimism future, household spend relatively restrain past couple year appetite debt declined. partly result, pace household borrow slow significantly (graph 11). one interpretation household sector, increase debt level many year witness problem elsewhere world, good appreciation risks. graph 11 10 bi review 117/2010 if interpretation correct likely good thing risk-management perspective. i say two reasons. first, restraint provide insurance possibility thing work well expected. in so, help low probability costly adjustment require point future. second, give currently relatively limit amount spare capacity economy, risk upwards pressure inflation would increase investment consumption increase strongly next years. in summary then, little control external environment australia faces, choice make productivity, flexibility, finance national consumption influence overall risk-profile australian economy. so look forward considerable optimism medium-term prospects, also need alert risk might best manage them. conclusion i would like close couple observation mean collection statistics. first, need high-quality comprehensive statistic understand structural change take place economy. one obvious area demand statistic increase resource sector. we need understand investment going, production volume price changing. but also need understand development affect part economy – linkage changing. second, abs’s work also important help u understand risk-management issue i speak about. we need continue make progress measurement productivity improve understand drive increase output per head. and financial side, need understand increase australia’s capital stock finance change pattern finance alter economy’s overall risk profile. i know area ab work i look forward see outcome work.

crisis recession – big economic upheaval since great depression. before crisis, steady growth low inflation high employment grasp. we let slip – we, is, financial sector policy-makers – member many business organisation around country employ them. and although cause crisis may root financial sector, consequence affect everyone, continue year come. thankfully, cost crisis small great depression. but learn experience. an unprecedented degree policy stimulus, abroad, prevent another world slump. even so, around million people britain work crisis. many, especially young unemployed, future blighted. so cannot carry are. unless reform economy – rebalance demand, restructure banking, restore sustainability public finance – shall jeopardise recovery, also fail next generation. to mind, market economy discipline offer best way raise live standards. but market economy cannot survive incentive alone. it must align incentive common good. it must command support among vast majority receive large reward accrue successful lucky. and must show sense fairness efficiency yield fruit. there nothing fair financial crisis. it cause problem real economy; come financial sector. but real economy suffer bank bail out. your members, indeed business employ them, entitle angry. but however legitimate, anger produce change unless energy harness cool analysis happen why. so i want discus fundamental cause crisis turn current policy. the fall berlin wall 1989 change politics economics. within years, former soviet empire, china asian economies, combine workforce billion people, enter world trade system market economies. their focus export-led growth allow consumer west enjoy rise live standard price trade good fell. but trade surplus emerge economy imply outflow capital. relatively poor country lend money rich western one – reverse traditional model development. in process, country like china build huge hold foreign asset – run trillion dollar – match equally huge debt deficit countries. such massive imbalance never likely sustainable, proved. if first fundamental cause crisis scale imbalance world economy, second inability bank system absorb large inflow capital 2 bi review 117/2010 without take excessive risk. in five year lead crisis, balance sheet west’s large bank double – mainly bank lend firm within financial sector wide economy. and proportion capital hold bank shrink leverage – ratio total liability equity capital – rise unprecedented levels. immediately prior crisis, leverage ratio uk bank approach 50. to say risky understatement: levels, 2% fall value bank’s asset sufficient wipe capital render insolvent. remuneration, especially structure financial sector bonuses, encourage excessive risk-taking, distort aspiration career choice many talented young people. investors, bank regulator sweep apparent success modern finance. when investor realise many asset bank hold balance sheet opaque hard value, immediate justifiable concern solvency many banks. at end 2008, two fundamental factor culminate bad financial crisis history. in six month lehman brother collapse world trade fell nearly 20% – fast decline great depression. around world, tell phrase repeated: economic activity “falling cliff”. in statement london g20 summit april 2009, international trade union movement argue “the first priority g20 leader must restore confidence halt freefall world growth”. that achieved. world output grow 4% past year. and unite kingdom, growth somewhat fast anticipate year ago. nevertheless, total uk output remain around 10% would crisis occurred. so prevent happen again? if prevent another crisis, action require fundamental causes. first, need resolve problem cause massive capital flow poor rich countries. yet imbalance grow again. this problem tackle international cooperation – obviously g20 – i hope trade union movement continue engage process. second, financial system need radical reform. slowly surely, must move towards bank system put economy members’ livelihood risk. in long run, bank hold much capital much le highly leveraged. part answer improve way regulate banks, devise policy tool control risk take financial system whole. the aim prevent bank failures. just every company economy, bank get wrong must allow fail, without risk ordinary depositor taxpayers. in 2008, bank bail protect protect rest economy banks. that may seem fair – isn’t – companies, jaguar, stand foot go wall. so bank must face market discipline. but need reform bank system. if world economy need rebalancing, own. the substantial trade deficit number year mean national spend exceed production. we need high national save rate, shift spend production away consumption towards exports. and key part reduction budget deficit. there perfectly reasonable debate precise speed reduce deficit. indeed, i support extra fiscal stimulus economy provide immediate wake crisis. and question deficit reduce – balance raise tax cut spending. that say; politician debate. but indisputable that, crisis, national income 10% low expect damage impact tax revenues. a result, country large peacetime budget deficit history – 11% gdp fiscal year 2010. although large budget deficit inevitable period crisis, also clearly unsustainable – national debt, even relative gdp, rise sharply continue several years. it vital government set bi review 117/2010 3 commit clear credible plan reduce deficit. i would shirk responsibility i explain risk fail so. vague promise would enough. market reaction rise sovereign debt turn quickly benign malign, saw euro area early year. it sensible risk damage rise long-term interest rate would make investment cost mortgage expensive. the current plan reduce deficit steadily five year – gradual fiscal tighten countries. a result failure put plan place sooner, euro-area country find – cost – much rapid adjustment force upon them. of course, one forecast gust – indeed storm – economy may face look ahead. but recovery slow expect automatic fiscal stabiliser – low tax receipt high spend result weak growth – act stimulate demand. and monetary policy react too, especially credible plan reduce deficit. in wake bad financial crisis ever, amount money economy – broad money – barely grow all. it failure 1930s halt mark contraction money supply lead great depression. so bank england take extraordinary measure – describe “quantitative easing” – boost supply money order support recovery economy keep inflation track meet target. and monetary policy flexible instrument change either direction month, best tool manage economy short run. nevertheless, road ahead unlikely straight. there considerable uncertainty prospect unite state euro area – important export markets. business consumer confidence home weaken recently, time bank sector able finance recovery usual terms. the transition good balance economy difficult. but already see encourage sign expansion manufacture uk exports. this morning’s figure show small rise claimant count small fall labour force survey measure unemployment. but big picture unemployment high crisis low many fear year ago. in july, one regular visit different part country, i meet scottish tuc glasgow learn labour market there. our contact experience union official touch range company sector best source intelligence labour markets. with help, determine understand happen every region country economy set right monetary policy. i want assure bank england serve whole economy, right across length breadth country. the cost crisis u generation. and owe next generation seize opportunity put place reform make another crisis much le likely much le damaging. we bank england trade union movement work together. that i please today. it require patience determination parts, include members. but prize restore maintain economic stability – return sustain rise employment live standard – worth effort. bi review 117/2010 1 axel a weber:

transformation nigerian economy. it usual conference governor, deliver keynote address, update industry stewardship past year, expect duration policy. 2. a aware, since commercial bank business commence 1892 nigeria, financial system experience several episode bank crisis. the first crisis take place late 1940s early 1950s, mainly result lack appropriate regulation, lead collapse 21 25 indigenous bank establish 1954. while failure resolve mainly self-liquidation, outcome bitter experience, especially depositor lose money. 3. systemic crisis re-appeared nigerian bank industry 1989 1998, many attribute withdrawal public sector deposit banks, consequence expose weak financial condition financial institution whose financial fragility conceal combination factors, include public subsidy improper account systems. the deregulation bank system mid-1980s facilitate dramatic increase number financial institution also expose bank intense competition many ill-prepared for. some bank attract significant market share improve customer service competitive prices. in contrast, many bank appear set largely take advantage arbitrage opportunity foreign exchange market, rather undertake conventional/traditional bank business. the consequence mass distress lay foundation bank consolidation exercise 2004, induce breath life banks, enhance capital position increase involvement business

practice seek quick fix easy solution. a resilient economy require hard work, intelligence, consistency time. we go difficulty short term. tough decision take continue take them. market condition must improve. we make point, continue make point line country cannot crossed. and one rich powerful get away put entire system risk fee personal greed. 22. a final thought, uniform effect, neither single remedy every crisis. each bring surprise risks. clearly, assume past remedy fully solve current next set problem address future crises. the key take lesson past tailor appropriately address future situation potential crisis. thank listening. guy quaden: basel iii beyond speech mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium, eurofi financial forum, brussels, 28 september 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, i please opportunity participate brussels eurofi conference share think open session. it 3 year u subprime crisis trigger world-wide financial turbulence 2 year collapse lehman brother dramatically escalate crisis. the crisis seriously dent belief ability market regulate themselves. there currently lot item agenda international forum wait deal with. the financial stability board g20 level well ecofin eu level draw detail roadmaps pave way extensive reforms. the crisis indeed give rise unique momentum profound reform financial system. we let momentum slip away. unfortunately general public sometimes get impression. of course many complicate technical issue resolved. and i admit important introduce new regulation timely manner hamper smooth flow credit require support nascent recovery. in fact, much discussion design exit strategy public support measures, monetary financial fields, equally aware need entry strategy move comprehensive regulatory requirements. from point view recent proposal come basel represent important contribution. two week ago, group governor head supervision, oversight body basel committee bank supervision, endorse broad proposal strengthen quality quantity regulatory capital hold bank institute global liquidity standard. this proposal, heart new basel iii framework, submit approval leader g20 country november summit seoul. the proposal represent major reform bank regulations, substantially improve resilience bank stress conditions, thus reinforce financial stability reduce occurrence new crisis injection public money. key element include increase minimum regulatory capital requirement also increase amount capital must hold form common equity, offer great capacity loss absorption. i discus various propose ratio detail, i sure know quite well. many bank industry complain argue reform make lend expensive imply decline quantity credit and, therefore, gdp. we regulatory community believe length transition period provide implementation new rule significantly diminish costs, bank economy alike. consequently, economic cost transition towards new requirement small relation magnitude long-term benefits, derive reduce probability financial crisis severe loss gdp growth would ensue. bi review 124/2010 1 moreover bank use different avenue reach, needed, high capital ratios: raise new funds, retain large part profit, reduce activity risky. while current proposal address large part g20 global financial reform agenda, work crucial, additional element complete come months, particular concern modality introduction countercyclical buff new liquidity ratios. but i would like insist short statement critical macroprudential issue yet really addressed: potential impact failure systemically important financial institutions, sifis, moral hazard associate belief institution big fail, curiosity and, i may say so, extravagance market economy. the basel committee currently work together financial stability board develop comprehensive, global approach sifis could involve potential mix policy capital liquidity surcharges, large exposure limits, contingent capital, bail-in debt. the goal jurisdiction place sifi policy. effective resolution regimes, constitute basis approach, upon policy would build. a cornerstone foundation should, i think, consist recovery resolution plans, “living wills”, formulate large financial institutions. these plan require institution specify measure take event severe stress also allow authority ass potential orderly resolvability institution without recourse public funds. the rapid spread financial crisis lesson market participant also supervisors. it show root problem gradual build-up common risk within system. it widely acknowledge crystallisation risk, link major shift correlation financial product markets, require systemically-focused oversight regulation. to use professional jargon, microprudential control, preserve supervisory authorities, must complement macroprudential oversight, resort expertise central banks. in order improve symbiosis two approaches, grow number country adopt so-called “twin peak model” central bank charge full range prudential supervision, micro macro-dimension, leave oversight market integrity investor protection separate institution. this “twin peak model” also introduce belgium next year. needle say, i well aware macro-dimension stop country’s frontiers, micro-supervision cross-border group also require close multinational coordination. so, i strongly support recent decision set up, eu level, european systemic risk board (esrb) european system financial supervisor (esfs), call cooperate closely order bring comprehensiveness consistency national international supervision. macroprudential analysis must rely rapid, direct comprehensive access data individual development liable affect global financial stability while, turn, analysis must fee microprudential supervision. it would pity effort improve flow information respective country impede hurdle international level. in conclusion, global nature crisis highlight necessity holistic, internationally coordinate approach achieve fundamental reform financial regulation. these reform way. it important approach result consistent, international adherence measure aim raise capacity individual institution absorb losses, reduce impact systemically important institution financial system whole economy, limit buildup systemic risk, foster international cooperation macro-prudential supervision. 2 bi review 124/2010 bi review 124/2010 3 lady gentlemen, week eurofi conference provide ample opportunity discus reflect topic challenge financial sector authority facing. i hope successful reward conference pleasant stay brussels. thank attention. ben s bernanke: implication financial crisis economics speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, conference co-sponsored center economic policy study bendheim center finance, princeton, new jersey, 24 september 2010. * * * thank give opportunity return princeton. it good able catch old friend colleague see change continuity campus. i particularly please see bendheim center finance thriving. when colleague i found center decade ago, intend place student would learn technicality modern financial theory practice also broad economic context financial activities. recent event make clear understand role financial market institution economy, effect economic development finance, important ever. the financial crisis begin three year ago indeed prove among difficult challenge economic policymakers since great depression. the policy response challenge include important successes, notably concert international effort stabilize global financial system crisis reach bad point fall 2008. for part, federal reserve work closely policymakers, domestically internationally, help develop collective response crisis, play key role response provide backstop liquidity range financial institution need stem panic. the feed also develop special lend facility help restore normal function critical financial markets, include commercial paper market market asset-backed securities; lead bank stress test spring 2009 significantly improve confidence u.s. bank system; and, area monetary policy, take aggressive innovative action help stabilize economy lay groundwork recovery. despite policy successes, episode whole kind reputation economic economists, understandably so. almost universally, economist fail predict nature, timing, severity crisis; issue early warn generally identify isolate weakness system, anything approach full set complex linkage mechanism amplify initial shock ultimately result devastate global crisis recession. moreover, although financial market part function normally now, concert policy effort far produce economic recovery sufficient vigor significantly reduce high level unemployment. a result developments, observer suggest need overhaul economics discipline, argue much research macroeconomics finance recent decade little value even counterproductive. although economist much learn crisis, i discuss, i think call radical rework field go far. in particular, seem current critique economics sometimes conflate three overlap yet separate enterprises, which, purpose remark today, i call economic science, economic engineering, economic management. economic science concern primarily theoretical empirical generalization behavior individuals, institutions, markets, national economies. most academic research fall category. economic engineer design analysis framework achieve specific economic objectives. example framework risk-management system financial institution financial regulatory system unite state countries. economic management involve operation economic framework real time – example, bi review 123/2010 1 private sector, management complex financial institution or, public sector, day-to-day supervision institutions. a may already guessed, terminology intend invoke loose analogy science engineering. underpin practical scientific engineer endeavor, moon shot, heart transplant, construction skyscraper are: first, fundamental scientific knowledge; second, principle design engineering, derive experience application fundamental knowledge; third, management particular endeavor, often include coordination effort many people complex enterprise deal myriad uncertainties. success practical undertake require three components. for example, fight control aid require scientific knowledge cause mechanism disease (the scientific component), development medical technology public health strategy (the engineer applications), implementation technology strategy specific community individual patient (the management aspect). twenty year ago, aid mortality rate mostly reflect gap scientific understand design drug treatment technologies; today, problem likely lack fund train personnel carry program apply treatments. with taxonomy hand, i would argue recent financial crisis failure economic engineer economic management i call economic science. the economic engineer problem reflect number structural weakness financial system. in private sector, weakness include inadequate risk-measurement risk-management system many financial firm well shortcoming firms’ business models, overreliance unstable short-term fund excessive leverage. in public sector, gap blind spot financial regulatory structure unite state country prove particularly damaging. these regulatory structure design early era adequately adapt rapid change innovation financial sector, increase financial intermediation take place outside regulate depository institution so-called shadow bank system. in realm economic management, leader financial firms, market participants, government policymakers either recognize important structural problem emerge risk or, identify them, respond sufficiently quickly forcefully address them. shortcoming i call economic science, contrast, part le central crisis; indeed, although great majority economist foresee near-collapse financial system, economic analysis prove continue prove critical understand crisis, develop policy contain it, design longer-term solution prevent recurrence. i don’t want push analogy far. economics discipline differ important way science engineering; latter, deal inanimate object rather willful human beings, often far precise predictions. also, distinction economic science economic engineer le sharp analogy may suggest, much economic research direct policy implications. and although i don’t think crisis mean require u rethink economics finance grind up, reveal important shortcoming understand certain aspect interaction financial markets, institutions, economy whole, i discuss. certainly, crisis lead – indeed, already lead – great focus research relate financial instability implication broad economy. in remainder remarks, i focus implication crisis i call economic science, is, basic economic research analysis. i first provide example economic principle economic research, rather mislead us, significantly enhance understand crisis inform regulatory response. however, crisis reveal gap economists’ knowledge remedied. i discus gap suggest possible 2 bi review 123/2010 direction future research could ultimately help u achieve great financial macroeconomic stability. how economics help u understand respond crisis the financial crisis represent enormously complex set interaction – indeed, discussion trigger touch crisis vulnerability financial system financial regulation allow crisis devastate effect could fill time afternoon.1 the complexity financial system, result difficulty predict development one financial market institution may affect system whole, present formidable challenges. but, least retrospect, economic principle research quite useful understand key aspect crisis design appropriate policy responses. for example, excessive dependence financial firm unstable short-term fund lead run key institutions, highly adverse implication function system whole. the fact dependence unstable short-term fund could lead run hardly news economists; central issue monetary economics since henry thornton walter bagehot write question 19th century.2 indeed, recent crisis bore strike resemblance bank run figure prominently thornton’s bagehot’s eras; case, run occur outside traditional bank system, shadow bank system – consist financial institution regulate depository institutions, securitization vehicles, money market funds, investment banks. prior crisis, institution become increasingly dependent various form short-term wholesale funding, globally active commercial banks. example fund include commercial paper, repurchase agreement (repos), security lending. in year immediately crisis, form fund grow especially rapidly; example, repo liability u.s. broker-dealer increase factor 2–1/2 four year crisis, good deal expansion reportedly fund hold relatively le liquid securities. in historically familiar bank run era deposit insurance, retail depositor hear rumor health bank – whether true untrue – would line withdraw funds. if run continued, then, absent intervention central bank provider liquidity, bank would run cash necessary pay depositor fail result. often, panic would spread bank similar characteristic to, financial relationship with, one fail come suspicion. in recent crisis, money market mutual fund investors, well provider short-term funding, economic equivalent early-1930s retail depositors. shadow bank rely provider fund longer-term credit instruments, include security back subprime mortgages. after house price begin decline, concern begin build quality subprime mortgage loan and, consequently, 1 for comprehensive discussion vulnerability trigger financial crisis, see ben s. bernanke (2010), “causes recent financial economic crisis,” testimony financial crisis inquiry commission, september 2. 2 see henry thornton ([1802] 1962), an enquiry nature effect paper credit great britain (new york: a. m. kelley); walter bagehot ([1873] 1897), lombard street: a description money market (new york: charles scribner’s sons). a

although many shadow bank limit exposure subprime loan questionable credits, complexity security involve opaqueness many financial arrangement make difficult investor distinguish relative risks. in environment heighten uncertainty, many investor conclude simply withdraw fund easy prudent alternative. in turn, financial institutions, know risk pose run, begin hoard cash, dry liquidity significantly limit willingness extend new credit.3 because run shadow bank system occur historically unfamiliar context, outside commercial bank system, private sector regulator insufficiently anticipate risk run might occur. however, threat become apparent, two century economic think run panic available inform diagnosis policy response. in particular, recent episode, central bank around world follow dictum set forth bagehot 1873: to avert contain panics, central bank lend freely solvent institutions, good collateral.4 the federal reserve indeed act quickly provide liquidity bank

crisis well. for example, one important development economics recent decade flower information economics, study incomplete information difference information among economic agent affect market 3 see gary b. gorton (2008), “the panic 2007,” paper present “maintaining stability change financial system,” symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, hold jackson hole, wyo., august 21–23. also see markus k. brunnermeier (2009), “deciphering liquidity credit crunch 2007–2008,” journal economic perspectives, vol. 23 (winter), pp. 77–100. 4 bagehot also suggest “these loan make high rate interest” (lombard street, p. 99; see note 2). some modern commentator rationalize bagehot’s dictum lend high “penalty” rate way mitigate moral hazard – is, help maintain incentive private-sector bank provide adequate liquidity advance crisis. however, risk moral hazard appear bagehot’s principal motivation recommend high rate; rather, saw tool dissuade unnecessary borrow thus help protect bank england’s finite store liquid assets. see bernanke, “liquidity provision,” note 2 documentation. today, potential limitation central bank’s lend capacity nearly press issue bagehot’s time, central bank’s ability provide liquidity far tenuous. generally, federal reserve lend rate “normal” rate market low rate prevail distress illiquid markets. this strategy provide need liquidity encourage borrower return private market condition normalized. 5 a substantial modern literature update formalize many insight bagehot thornton. a classic example douglas w. diamond philip h. dybvig (1983), “bank runs, deposit insurance, liquidity” journal political economy, vol. 91 (3), pp. 401–19. 4 bi review 123/2010 outcomes.6 an important branch information economics, principal-agent theory, consider implication difference information principal relationship (say, shareholder firm) agent work principal (say, firm’s managers). because agent typically information principal – manager tend know firm’s opportunity problem shareholders, example – financial interest principal agent perfectly aligned, much depend contract (whether explicit implicit) principal agent, and, particular, incentive contract provide agent. poorly structure incentive pervasive crisis. for example, compensation practice financial institutions, often tie bonus short-term result make insufficient adjustment risk, contribute environment top manager lower-level employees, trader loan officers, take excessive risks. serious problem structure incentive also emerge application so-called originate-to-distribute model subprime mortgages. to satisfy strong demand securitized products, mortgage lender package loan sale investor compensate primarily quantity “product” move system. a result, pay le attention credit quality many loan make without sufficient documentation care underwriting. conflict interest credit agencies, suppose serve investor incentive help issuer security obtain high credit ratings, another example. consistent key aspect research information economics, public policy response problem focus improve market participants’ incentives. for example, address problem compensation practices, federal reserve, conjunction supervisory agencies, subject compensation practice bank institution supervisory review. the interagency supervisory guidance support compensation practice induce employee take longer-term perspective, pay part employees’ compensation stock vest base sustain strong performance. to ameliorate problem originate-to-distribute model, recent legislation require regulatory agencies, include federal reserve, develop new standard applicable securitization activity would good align incentive face market participant involve various

reserve invoke “safety soundness” rationale guidance incentive compensation practices. more generally, crisis revealed, bad incentive lead problem affect individual involve broad financial system well; spillover suggest regulation help improve outcomes. bi review 123/2010 5 information economics principal-agent theory also essential understand problem create so-called too-big-to-fail financial institutions. prior crisis, market participant believe large, complex, interconnect financial firm would allow fail financial crisis. and, know, authority unite state abroad fact intervene number occasion prevent failure firm – special consideration owners, managers, creditor firms, legitimate concern potential damage financial system broad economy. however, although instability cause failure near-failure large firm indeed prove costly, sense real damage do crisis. if creditor good time believe certain firm allow fail, demand relatively little compensation risk, thus weaken market discipline; addition, creditor much incentive monitor firms’ risk-taking. a result, predict principal-agent theory, firm think big fail tend take risk, face little pressure investor expect receive assistance bet go bad. this problem example economist refer moral hazard. the result buildup risk too-big-to-fail firm increase likelihood financial crisis would occur worsen crisis occur. one response excessive risk-taking strong oversight regulators, recent legislation rule procedure develop federal reserve agency subject systemically critical firm tough regulatory requirement strict supervision. the federal reserve also involve international negotiation raise capital liquidity bank require hold. however, problem too-big-to-fail eliminate market participant believe authorities’ statement intervene prevent failures. if creditor believe government rescue firm bet go bad, creditor more-appropriate incentive price, monitor, limit risk-taking firm lend. the best way achieve credibility create institutional arrangement failure allow occur without widespread collateral damage; failure take place safely, authority long incentive try avoid them. the financial reform legislation take important step direction create resolution regime large, complex financial firm place receivership, also give government flexibility take action need safeguard systemic stability. this new regime help restore market discipline put great burden creditor counterparties monitor risk-taking large financial firms. the insight economist prove valuable policymakers many context well: set oversight bank capital standards, decision provide market extensive information glean bank stress test spring 2009, design fed’s liquidity facility nondepository institutions, analysis collapse securitization market, measure take protect consumer deceptive inappropriate lending, name few. many key ideas, like thornton bagehot, quite old, reflect relatively recent research. for example, recent work monetary policy help federal reserve provide policy accommodation despite constraint impose zero low bind interest rates.8 8 the federal reserve by, example, (1) act rapidly confront zero low bound, discuss david reifschneider john c. williams (2000), “three lesson monetary policy low-inflation era,” journal money, credit banking, vol. 32 (november), pp. 936–66; (2) provide forward guidance regard short-term interest rates, discuss gauti eggertsson michael woodford (2003), “the zero bind interest-rates optimal monetary policy,” brook paper economic activity, vol. 2003 (1), pp. 139–211; (3) expand federal reserve’s balance sheet purchase longer-term securities, discuss ben s. bernanke, vincent r. reinhart, brian p. sack (2004), “monetary policy alternative zero bound: an empirical assessment,” brook paper economic activity, vol. 2004 (2), pp. 1–78. 6 bi review 123/2010 economics economic research wake crisis economic principle research central understand react crisis. that said, crisis lead also challenge important economic principle research agendas. i briefly indicate area that, i believe, would benefit attention economics profession. most fundamentally, perhaps challenge researchers, crisis motivate economist think model human behavior. most economic researcher continue work within classical paradigm assume rational, self-interested behavior maximization “expected utility” – framework base formal description risky situation theory individual choice useful integration economics, statistics, decision theory.9 an important assumption framework that, make decision uncertainty, economic agent assign meaningful probability alternative outcomes. however, bad phase financial crisis, many economic actor – include investors, employers, consumer – metaphorically throw hand admit that, give extreme and, ways, unprecedented nature crisis, know know. or, donald rumsfeld might put it, many “unknown unknowns.” the profound uncertainty associate “unknown unknowns” crisis result panicky sell investors, sharp cut payroll employers, significant increase households’ precautionary saving. the idea that, certain times, decisionmakers simply cannot assign meaningful probability alternative outcome – indeed, cannot even think possible outcome – know knightian uncertainty, economist frank knight discuss idea 1920s. although economist psychologist long recognize challenge ambiguity present analyze distinction risk aversion ambiguity aversion, much work abstract relatively little progress make describe predict behavior human be circumstance knowledge experience provide little useful information.10 research area could aid understand crisis extreme situations. i suspect progress require careful empirical research attention psychological well economic factors. another issue clearly need attention formation propagation asset price bubbles. scholar great deal work bubble collapse dot-com bubble decade ago, much quite interesting, profession seem still quite far consensus able provide useful advice policymakers. much literature point address bubble persist expand circumstance would generally think not, agent know existence bubble sophisticate arbitrageur operate market. a put former colleague, markus brunnermeier, scholar affiliate bendheim center do 9 herein i use extension von neumann-morgenstern expect utility, focus objective probability risks, situation individual assign subjective probability risks. for review classic contribution area, see jacques h. drèze (1974), “axiomatic theory choice, cardinal utility subjective probability: a review,” jacques h. drèze, ed., allocation uncertainty: equilibrium optimality (london: macmillan), pp. 3–23. some author use risk refer situation objective probability uncertainty refer situation subjective probability (see, example, david m. kreps (1990), a course microeconomic theory (princeton, n.j.: princeton university press)). a highlight below, others refer uncertainty situation subjective probability cannot assessed. a discussion make clear, probably best focus context term risk uncertainty used. 10 the classic reference ambiguity aversion due daniel ellsberg (1961), “risk, ambiguity, savage axioms,” the quarterly journal economics, vol. 75 (4), pp. 643–69; recent, abstract, theoretical treatment, see larry g. epstein (1999), “a definition uncertainty aversion,” review economic studies, vol. 66 (july), pp. 579–608. bi review 123/2010 7 important research bubbles, “we many convince model explain bubble start.”11 i would add also don’t know much bubble stop either, good understand process – implication household, business, financial sector – would helpful design monetary regulatory policies. another issue bring fore crisis need good understand determinant liquidity financial markets. the notion financial asset always sell price close fundamental value build economic analysis, crisis, liquidity major market often take grant financial market participant regulator alike. the crisis showed, however, risk aversion, imperfect information, market dynamic scare away buyer badly impair price discovery. market illiquidity also interact financial panic dangerous ways. notably, vicious circle sometimes develop investor concern solvency financial firm lead runs: to obtain critically need liquidity, firm force sell asset quickly, “fire sales” drive asset price reinforce investor concern solvency firms. importantly, dynamic contribute profound blur distinction illiquidity insolvency crisis. study liquidity illiquidity difficult require go beyond standard model market clear examine motivation interaction buyer seller time.12 however, regulator prepare impose new liquidity requirement financial institution require change operation key market ensure normal function time stress, new policy-relevant research area would welcome. i discuss need research microeconomics financial economics yet touch macroeconomics. standard macroeconomic models, workhorse new-keynesian model, predict crisis, incorporate easily effect financial instability. do failure standard macroeconomic model mean irrelevant least significantly flawed? i think answer qualify no. economic model useful context designed. most time, include recessions, serious financial instability issue. the standard model design non-crisis periods, prove quite useful context. notably, part intellectual framework help deliver low inflation macroeconomic stability industrial country two decade begin mid-1980s. that said, understand relationship financial economic stability macroeconomic context critical unfinished task researchers. early work attempt incorporate credit financial intermediation study economic fluctuation transmission monetary policy represent one possible start point. to give example i know particularly well, much research academic (with coauthor mark gertler simon gilchrist) focus role financial factor propagate amplify business cycles. gertler nobuhiro kiyotaki develop basic framework look macroeconomic effect financial crises.13 more generally, i encourage see large number recent study incorporate bank credit creation standard macroeconomic models, though work still distance capture complex interaction risk-taking, 11 see markus k. brunnermeier (2008), “bubbles,” steven n. durlauf lawrence e. blume, eds., the new palgrave dictionary economics, 2nd ed.

now, number data point used. for example, experience unite state unite kingdom large-scale asset purchase could explore improve understand effect transaction longer-term yield effect incorporate modern model term structure interest rates.15 conclusion i begin remark draw distinction scientific, engineering, management aspect economics. for part, view, financial crisis reflect problem i refer economic engineer economic management. both private-sector arrangement (for example, risk management funding) financial regulatory framework flaw design execution, weakness primary reason financial crisis economic effect severe. disaster require urgent action prevent repetition. engineer seek enhance reliability complex machine improvement basic design; more-rigorous test quality assurance; increase resilience machine mean strong materials, great redundancy, good backup systems. economic policymakers’ effort avoid, least mitigate, future financial crisis proceed along analogous lines. first, recent reform legislation improve design regulatory framework, close important gap lack oversight shadow bank system. likewise, private sector, firm take significant step improve system manage risk liquidity. second, reduce probability severity future crises, policymakers monitor system intensively. for example, recent legislation create financial stability oversight council, make head financial regulatory agencies, ass potential risk financial system, identify regulatory gaps, coordinate effort various agencies. enhance market 14 see, example, marvin goodfriend bennett t. mccallum (2007), “banking interest rate monetary policy analysis: a quantitative exploration,” journal monetary economics, vol. 54 (5), pp.1480–1507;

macroprudential – is, focus risk system whole well individual institutions. together, good design private- public-sector framework manage risk, good monitor supervision, resilient financial system mean guarantee financial crisis recur, reduce risk crisis mitigate effect happen. in short, financial crisis discredit usefulness economic research analysis means; indeed, old recent idea draw economic research prove invaluable policymakers attempt diagnose respond financial crisis. however, crisis raise important question already occupy researcher continue so. a i discuss today, work need behavior economic agent time profound uncertainty; asset price bubble determinant market liquidity; implication financial factors, include financial instability, macroeconomics monetary policy. much work already way bendheim center department economics princeton. svein gjedrem: business cycles, crisis public finance – government able honour debts? speech mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), norwegian school economics business administration, bergen, 24 september 2010. the text may differ actual presentation. this speech contain assessment economic situation current interest rate setting. * * * 1. imbalance financial crisis the financial crisis origin abundant supply credit, market participant take steadily high risk lack oversight part banks, company authorities. the global economy enter severe downturn. the acute crisis financial market succeed substantial labour market fiscal imbalance country around us. severe shortcoming management public finance several advance economy also revealed. how public finance manage country also important norway. in period 1993 2008, global output expand 60 per cent, annual rate 4 per cent. at time, inflation remain low. this period norwegian economy could describe two golden decades. but imbalance build europe north america. with strong income growth easy access loans, number size home purchase household grew. house price surge many countries. the build industry financial sector expand segment economy. many government allow expenditure rise pace high tax revenues. like banks, many government also move expenditure balance sheet, public private partnership (ppp) agreements, example. the bubble allow expand. household borrow much, house price high, bank build industry big government expenditure debt grow rapidly. the imbalance gradually surfaced. the problem arise initially u house market spread earnest money capital market abruptly dry september 2008. once crisis become reality, authority respond rapidly. to begin with, provide support financial market failed, provide guarantees, offer liquidity fund purchase securities. central bank key rate aggressively cut. the crisis 1930s show cost fail implement measure high. (see chart: sovereign debt gdp g7.) the rescue package move private debt onto government central bank balance sheets. in addition, tax revenue decline social security expenditure increased. in next phase, government counteract fall corporate household demand good service increase public consumption investment. many country enter crisis deficit relatively high level debt. public debt major advance economy high, share gdp, second world war, high military spend finance borrowing. (see chart: government bond yields.) in late autumn 2009, fear arise financial market country would unable pay debts. the unrest trigger greece announce public finance bi review 123/2010 1 poor shape. government bond yield rise markedly greece, spain, portugal subsequently ireland compare german bond yields. sovereign credit rat downgrade price insurance sovereign debt default soared.

(see chart: bond yields.) state southern europe also pay high interest rate sound private borrower euro area. there also example state pay high interest rate sound private borrower country. in spring 2010, greece encounter acute payment problems. on 2 may, agreement reach greece, imf euro area country three-year loan package maximum limit eur 110 billion. the agreement include comprehensive imf adjustment program. greece borrow approximately eur 30 billion imf euro area country since may. other european country weak public finance also scrutinise risk contagion bank system europe, behind many loans. on 10 may eu european central bank announce extensive support measure eu countries, include european financial stability facility, provide loan country difficulty total limit eur 500 billion, additional loan eur 250 billion make available imf program facilities. country may draw loan facility provide tax increase expenditure cut enable country gradually become self-supporting. at time, european central bank begin buy government bonds, become difficult trade market, enable market monetary policy function effectively. economic history show period surge corporate household debt sharply rise property price often precede bank crises. the fate bank state inextricably linked. bank crisis usually lead fiscal crises. similarly, weak government finance undermine banks’ financial position.1 crisis costly. a historical study financial crisis show annual economic growth 1 per cent low decade follow crisis decade precede it.2 unemployment also typically remain high throughout decade follow crisis. we perhaps surprise results. since activity level usually high unemployment low crisis, cannot expect economic growth strong crisis precede period. crisis advantages. in norway, nordic countries, crisis year around 1990 bring change regulation, open market restructure public private enterprises. in crisis, foundation lay two golden decade follow norwegian economy. 1 carmen m. reinhart kenneth s. rogoff (2010): “from financial crash debt crises” nber work paper no, 1579, march 2010. 2 carmen m. reinhart vincent r. reinhart (2010): “after fall”, nber work paper no. 16334, september 2010. 2 bi review 123/2010 2. why government repay debt? government borrow save order smooth income expenditure time. sovereign debt denominate domestic foreign currency, issue domestically abroad. the norwegian government rely foreign fund 1970s develop norway’s oil industry welfare state. since time, north sea oil revenue substantial, today norwegian government invest large surplus equity bond countries. sovereign debt differ private debt. private debt protect law country loan contracted. the creditor recover debt legal mean event default. similar mechanism principle exist sovereign debt. there supranational body recover government debt government defaults.3 if government consider legally oblige repay creditor, might tempt default. in economic literature question therefore raised: why government repay debt? this question beg another: if government turn back commitments, investor lend money? we observe country choose repay debt. this must mean cost associate default. even creditor legal recourse collect debt, form cost impose debtor. first, creditor refrain provide new loan government default. when government debt negotiations, naturally difficult raise new capital. but recent history show take long creditor will provide loans. second, borrow cost may increase. fund rate rise fear sovereign default spread markets. for 30 country default sovereign debt recent decades, interest rate government bond 4 percentage point high normal one year default 2.5 percentage point high second year.4 thereafter, interest rate fell rapidly normal levels. third, creditor impose sanctions, trade blockades, seizure foreign asset choose even severe measures. at end 19th century, england take control egypt’s government finance country’s payment problems. egypt raise number loan finance construction suez canal. the administration establish british government restore order egypt’s government finance remain country 40 years. it likely economic incentive also play part today’s arm conflicts, instrument use recover sovereign debt. the effective weapon available creditor today probably take legal action seize debtor’s foreign assets. in past 30 years, creditor several cases. several study sovereign debt crisis past century show creditors’ action result particularly high cost debtor state. a state soon regain access capital market default borrow cost fall back fairly rapidly. if cost default transient, default could profitable proposition. when loan matures, may therefore tempt government renege promise repay 3 see carl august fleischer (2005): folkerett (international law). 4 eduardo borensztein ugo panizza (2009): “the cost sovereign default”, imf staff papers, vol. 56, no. 4. bi review 123/2010 3 debt. in economic policy know time-inconsistency problem. it profitable make lofty promises, turn back cash benefits. why country renege commitment stable times? we observe honour commitments, economic literature provide u good explanation case. country want preserve good reputation. government default adverse times, sharp fiscal retrenchment avoid fate. 3. country default frequently believe it new phenomenon country live beyond mean fail settle bill. history show many country default sovereign debts. this occur emerge phases. from 1500 1900, spain default sovereign debt 14 times.5 france default nine time period, state late become germany default six times. england also default once, far back 1594. (see chart: sovereign debt default.) the norwegian government always manage settle debts, little fault norway leave considerable government debt secession denmark 1814. the government treasury liquid assets. attempt increase tax revenue failed. moreover, norway little creditworthiness. at begin 1816 government position service debt. after four years, debt negotiate 6 3 million speciedaler. the entire principal repay ten-year period. in january 1820, norway conclude loan contract finance company benecke brother berlin.6 it positive young nation able borrow, term loan generally perceive poor, loan popularly refer “tyvelånet” (highway robbery). all government property current custom revenue require collateral. after period, “tyvelån” replace loan favourable terms. after great depression 1930s, many european state struggle debt problems. government debt write austria, greece, hungary, poland, romania turkey 1930s 1940s. germany able pay war reparation world war i. since world war ii sovereign default occur develop country emerge economies, particularly period 1980 2000. many country pursue policy result high inflation. it become increasingly difficult country raise loan domestic currency, particularly loan long maturities. attempt make keep inflation magnitude foreign debt check peg domestic currency u dollar. but fiscal mismanagement often trigger currency crises, fall value domestic currency surge foreign debt. this government give stop service debt. the degree loss incur creditor connection sovereign default varied. the recent default episode leave creditor loss range estimate 30 75 per cent.7 these experience probably influence interest rate sovereign loan country’s debt-servicing capacity question. 5 carmen m. reinhart kenneth s. rogoff (2009): this time different. eight century financial folly. 6 sverre steen (1954): “krise og avspenning”, det frie norge vol 3. 7 panizza et al (2009): “the economics law sovereign debt default”, journal economic literature 47. 4 bi review 123/2010 a forum established, paris club, meet regularly find solution bilateral debt problems. the paris club consist 19 creditor governments, include norway. a solution contingent implementation reform debtor country part adjustment program support international monetary fund (imf). since 1956, paris club negotiate 417 debt reduction agreement 87 countries. the paris club primarily negotiate debt relief country – often poor country – access traditional international fund markets. there supranational body debt negotiation country borrow international capital markets. some year ago, imf attempt draw regulatory framework government creditors, receive necessary support member countries. the imf’s work has, however, lead frequent inclusion clause international loan agreement facilitate constructive debt negotiations.8 in economic system, bankruptcy system useful instrument. it enable business put early mistake behind reemploy real capital labour. debt arrangement government play similar role counteract downward spirals. (see chart: inflation.) there two form debt default. breach contract one form borrower fail honour contractual obligations, illustrate example here. for debt denominate domestic currency, state also default pursue inflationary economic policy, reduce real value loan. over past 100 year inflation norway surge two world war korean war. the last period soar inflation 1970s 1980s, result sharp fall real value bond issue 1950s 1960s. i would also like cite curious example monetary history9: the norwegian state take advantage fall value money redeem government bond issue 1896 1909. france one primary bondholders. the bond issue gold standard period value krone directly link value gold. the lender promise repayment “monnaie d’or” (gold coins). when bond fell due, norwegian government insist repay debt use banknote lose substantial share value. france take legal action. the case bring norwegian supreme court 1962, court invoke law 1923 stipulate gold clause, i.e. repayment gold coins, apply redemption obligation suspended, definitively 1931. the supreme court also invoke “society’s vital interests” argumentation behind decision. the cost repay gold coin borrow 60 year early would excessively high norwegian state. the rule probably example limit benefit gain creditor case try debtor country’s legal apparatus. for nicolai rygg, governor norge bank 1920 1946, value money moral issue. the aim policy gold parity 1920s bring krone back value prevail world war i: “our monetary regime enshrine law.

(see chart: government pension fund global.) it transfer petroleum fund introduce 1996 fund accumulate could also use cover future pension payments. the fund, since change name government pension fund global (gpfg), grow almost nok 3 000 billion. it rapid growth neither expect plan due sharp improvement government finance economic upturn late 1990s. after turn millennium, rise oil price also provide boost. the size fund equivalent approximately 18 months’ mainland gdp may double next five ten years. total public expenditure equivalent le half total gdp. if government spend 4 per cent fund annually – expect real return – finance close 20 per cent public expenditure ten year ahead. the return fund become important source fund difficult imagine government authority would find sound argument draw accumulate capital. it also flow revenue adverse effect private sector production capacity, unlike taxes. (see chart: pension obligation government pension fund.) however, share future pension payment match revenue government pension fund. the government pension fund estimate cover around half national insurance scheme’s retirement disability pension obligations.16 (see chart: pension cost expect fund returns.) over next years, return pension fund expect rise roughly line government expenditure retirement pension national insurance scheme. revenue petroleum activity nonetheless gradually decline, pull growth fund. over time, therefore, national insurance scheme’s retirement pension grow considerably fast expect real return fund.

one prominent example regulatory reaction stock market crash 1929, result establishment glass-steagall act 1933. the act large extent motivate concern role bank run great depression particular conflict interest lending, underwrite proprietary trade 1 see, example, kindleberger (1978), manias, panics, crashes: a history financial crises, new york: basic books, garber (2000), famous first bubbles: the fundamental early manias, cambridge: mit press, reinhart rogoff (2009), this time be different: eight century financial folly, princeton: princeton university press. bi review 123/2010 1 functions. therefore, glass steagall act ban commercial bank underwriting, hold deal corporate securities, hence essentially separate investment commercial banks. the act major impact evolution bank us, also worldwide. for instance, emergence large u investment banks, also dependency europe, direct consequence implementation act. the act also affect supervision bank worldwide. owe fund structure base deposit many small relatively uninformed agents, hence possibility bank run involvement payment system, commercial bank regulate relatively heavily. in contrast, investment bank regard need le close public monitor regulation, see le important overall financial stability perspective mostly domain sophisticate investors. however, crisis show actor financial system contribute build systemic risk. research pre-glass-steagall-era unite state provide evidence security underwrite commercial banks’ subsidiary high probability default underwrite investment banks.2 however, whether glass steagall act contribute financial stability open question. nonetheless, 1999, gramm-leach-bliley act repeal glass steagall act grind would allow bank become competitive, attain favorable economy scope diversify source income. however, recent regulatory reform u frank-dodd bill re-introduce restriction proprietary trade deposit take institutions. a regulatory response worldwide impact regulatory standard banks’ business creation basel committee. the failure german herstatt bank lead serious spill-overs u bank sector. in late 1974, central banker canada, japan, u 9 european country found new body bank international settlement basel, become late know basel committee bank supervision. this new organization found understand increase cross-border activity bank associate risk financial instability would transmit across border require improvement quality supervision regulation globally well great international cooperation field. over year increasingly develop standard-setting body although standard – basel i basel ii – legally enforceable fact become worldwide benchmark. the list factor contribute financial crisis long. however, irrespective multiplicity factors, realize provision put place basel i basel ii sufficient ensure necessary resilience bank sector need withstand situation like one currently facing. in view, major lesson current crisis future regulatory policy following: first, basel ii rest principle purpose regulation ensure safety soundness individual financial institution risk loss assets. however ensure soundness individual institution necessarily ensure soundness financial system whole. 2 puri, m. (1999), “universal bank underwriters: implication go public process”, journal financial economics, 54, 133–163. kroszner, r.s. r.g. rajan (1994), “is glass steagall act justified? a study u experience universal bank 1933”, american economic review, 84, 810–832. 2 bi review 123/2010 second, crisis highlight main type risk, notably credit, market liquidity risk ultimately linked, fund liquidity bank essential element determine resilience. awareness importance regulate liquidity risk limit crisis bring fore. and third, part banks’ risk take activity leave other, non-bank entity financial system and, thus, activity able escape regulatory web build banks. already three point see lesson learn lead u systemic dimension supervision regulation. the current regulatory challenge so let turn challenge current regulatory reform discus need prevent contain financial instability systemic crisis future. these challenge concern three major fields: (i) classic bank regulation, (ii) market infrastructure regulation, (iii) systemic risk regulation. regulate bank concern bank regulation, major progress made. the basel committee publish regulatory reform package know basel iii. it address weakness bring fore crisis. the aim basel iii reform enhance capital regulation introduce liquidity regulation. in particular basel committee proposes: first, improve quality quantity capital, especially tier-1 capital improve loss-absorption go concern basis; second, introduce non-risk-based leverage ratio supplementary measure basel ii risk control framework; third, introduce capital buff forward-looking provision ensure financial system absorb shock thus low volatility financial real economic cycles; finally, elevate resilience financial institution liquidity stress introduce liquidity risk framework, improve liquidity risk management harmonise liquidity risk supervision. the significance internationally coordinate oversight cross-border web dependency financial system exemplify systemically important financial institution (sifis) often operate internationally. these play major role impact transmission crisis. in order increase long term financial stability need reduce moral hazard exhibit. to address this, policy recommendation develop include: (i) framework measure institution’s systemic importance, (ii) resolution tool framework effective resolution financial failure without taxpayer ultimately bear burden, well (iii) prudential structural policy tool reduce probability impact sifi’s failure. look ahead, important challenge remain improve bank sector stability: first, banks’ business model need become sustainable. in view, banks’ business strategy direct towards increase short-term profit way take extensive risk detriment long term viability business. in fact, level announce profit target impact peer bank also see perspective high profit mean high risk take and, hence, necessarily originate efficiency gain alone. second, i believe crucial bank undergo serious reform corporate governance compensation schemes. in particular, incentive traders, ceo creditor bank adequately reflect risk involve internalize cost risk take potential failure. this achieve bi review 123/2010 3 appropriate compensation schemes, transparency vis-à-vis creditor shareholder generally improve oversight banks’ business. overall, manage board bank shift focus away short-term objective towards long term corporate strategy. this also include accountable risk take overall business bank, bring next challenge. third, risk management practise need improved. most risk management technique – use bank also rat agency – neglect correlation risk across security sufficiently internalize grow systemic (credit, market liquidity) risks.3 moreover, bank underestimate tail risk. the exist risk management technique work well predict small day-to-day loss normal circumstance fail predict severe loss infrequent. however, exactly severe loss matter most. therefore, bank need devote great attention risk management. this mean particular risk management function need receive prominent role organizational structure, specifically respect authority independence. regulate market infrastructure concern regulation financial markets, crisis clearly show turbulence one segment financial market create spill-overs contagion segments. moreover, see bank type financial intermediary seriously affect financial crisis. therefore, i welcome recent agreement establish three pan-european micro-prudential supervisory authority – european bank authority (eba), european security market authority (esma) european insurance occupational pension authority (eiopa). they expect become operational begin next year. with regard regulation market infrastructures, let first say i see great achievement market infrastructure fare well. they able withstand shock-waves current crisis continue ensure clear settlement financial transactions. thus, contribute critically contain spread financial instability. this resilience, however, “dues ex machine”. it outcome well design international standard market infrastructures. still, need closely analyse lesson crisis also area – e.g. term market infrastructure risk management transparency arrangement cross-border cooperation among authorities. these lesson incorporate global cpss-iosco recommendation financial market infrastructure issue early next year. despite good performance market infrastructures, need develop highly resilient market infrastructures, particularly field otc derivatives. the crisis show legislation, supervision oversight global derivative market arrangement need improve – need do consistent way globally. follow agreement g20 high-level objectives, new legislation recently introduce u advance stage european union. such legislation stipulates, inter alia, otc derivative trade need report trade repository extent possible subject central clear via central counterparty (ccp). overall, also regard regulate market infrastructures, important challenge remain: 3 danielsson, jon, paul embrechts, charles goodhart, con keating, felix muennich, olivier renault hyun song shin (2001) “an academic response basel ii’’ financial market group special paper 130, london school economics. 4 bi review 123/2010 first, strive transparency financial markets. the activity shadow bank sector over-the-counter business contribute tremendously creation uncertainty opaque transmission channel risks. therefore, central goal future regulatory action improvement market transparency. clear otc derivative via ccps, report derivative trade data trade repository recent proposal european commission increase transparency shortselling activity important step right direction. second, deal financial innovation. independently doubtless benefit financial innovation, pose constant challenge regulators, supervisor overseer financial market infrastructures. the bank business constant state flux new financial instrument constantly develop traded. new technique instrument developed, particularly diversify trade credit risk, make market complex sometimes le transparent. for example, risk involve so-called “originate distribute” model – intermediation approach bank originate, repackage sell loan (or asset bond credit risk exposures) financial market – insufficiently recognize market participant supervisory authorities. therefore, financial innovation grow complexity mean market participant authority need constantly build in-depth knowledge financial innovation broaden analysis across whole spectrum financial market actions. third, minimization risk transmission institution markets. give resilience market infrastructure current crisis, need strengthen encourage use. moreover, crisis show exclusive focus bank prove insufficient contagion also occur across different type financial intermediaries, insurance company money market funds. therefore, look forward crucial cross border cooperation authority strengthened. in respect work newly create european supervisory authority key. look interrelation market systemic perspective another key task, bring third major field regulatory challenge, namely regulate systemic risk. regulate systemic risk a indicated, traditional bank regulation design limit individual institution’s risk see isolation. it sufficiently focus systemic risk, put simply, risk simultaneous collapse institutions. institutionally, significant progress make strengthen macro- micro-prudential supervision. in europe, european systemic risk board (esrb) – mention – three pan-european micro supervisor established. the esrb provide thorough analysis systemic risk financial system european union issue warn significant risk identified. it also provide policy recommendation address risk prevent renew build-up excessive risk financial system whole. with involvement esrb, ecb continue play active role safeguard financial stability europe. the ecb vice president go great detail tonight’s conference dinner prepare task. the main challenge i see ahead area regulate systemic risk follows: first, determine perimeter regulation. it important regulatory web cast wide enough ensure systemically important institutions, market product captured. caution also necessary avoid tight regulation simply shift activity unregulated market segment entities. therefore, step take towards harmonise bank supervision well progress make europe towards directive bi review 123/2010 5 6 bi review 123/2010 alternative investment fund managers, affect financial market tight web interlinkages financial sector, appreciated. second, ensure availability information data. the detection early warn systemic risk crucially depend quality availability relevant data well adequate assessment risk bear capacity system. therefore important information make available fee future assessment systemic risk, especially view key input work newly found esrb. in regard, equally important use qualitative data market information strengthen information feed regular analysis systemic risk systematic way. and third, measure systemic risk. a basic difficulty regulate system risk relate difficulty measure contribution individual institution systemic risk. the importance institution systemic risk function size, interconnectedness substitutability. one way regulator private market able monitor financial institution ass systemic reach, ass risk multiple defaults. measure risk difficult, measure may backward look face data limitations. i happy break chance hear late advance measure systemic risk keynote speech professor robert engle new york university. he develop measure systemic risk capture systemic impact individual institution’s shortfall publish so-called nyu stern systemic risk ranking. the keynote speech follow two outstanding paper measure systemic risk. kim giesecke present paper estimate systemic risk basis actual default time occurrence. the paper yang zhou go beyond usual focus existence contagion present analysis pattern propagation across financial institutions. for illustration show big challenge identify systemic risk is, one need go back far history. in 2003, young analyst new york state following: “you watch level nearly unlimited unprecedented credit growth long drive house market higher. i extremely bearish feel consequence could 50% drop residential real estate us. a large portion current [housing] demand current price would disappear people convince price rising. the collateral damage likely order magnitude bad anyone considers”.4 it take another 4 year risk and, particularly, systemic impact cost materialized. analyze systemic risk means, therefore, mainly go beyond mainstream think challenge widespread beliefs. we need type analyst i quoted. i much look forward hear conference’s analysis containment systemic risk, future challenge possible policy option go forward. 4 quote m. lewis, the big short, 2010. bi review 122/2010 1 guy quaden: modernise imf surveillance intervention mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium, international monetary fund–monetary authority singapore (imf–mas) conference “the imf international financial system: post crisis agenda”, singapore, 24 september 2010. * * * first all, i would like thank monetary authority singapore imf invite contribute high-level conference. the world economy change important ways. capital flow dwarf trade flows. many economy integrate world capital markets. financial sector become interconnect channel rapid transmission crisis across region global level. this require fund surveillance (in word crisis prevention role) adapt substance (what surveillance do) modality (how it). i would like focus three major topics: 1. analysis financial sector stability must strengthen global country level; 2. bilateral surveillance must complement multilateral surveillance; 3. so-called traction fund surveillance – ability willingness country heed fund advise – must improved. let elaborate. financial sector stability issue the international community draw many important lesson recent financial crisis. implement need change begun. the basel iii agreement, reach recently, major step make bank sector stable good equip absorb losses. it first step. improve capital adequacy primarily focus stability individual banks. it foremost instrument micro-prudential regulation. compliance individual bank prudential regulation assure stability system whole. macro-financial stability concern must keep constant review address national institution – central bank – clear mandate. in european union, european systemic risk board establish next year assume important role eu-wide-level. however, implementation recommendation remain largely responsibility national authorities. i see evident parallelism potential synergy surveillance mandate esrb imf surveillance, latter remain broad scope. after series national regional crisis (mexico, asia, russia, ...) imf board adopt 2000 financial sector assessment program. the fund would regular interval (of 3 5 years) conduct depth evaluation vulnerability country’s financial sector adequacy prudential regulation surveillance. however, membership could agree, straightforward manner, financial sector stability integral part fund surveillance, therefore mandatory. the technical assistance nature fsaps use country argue fund prioritise resource country le equip conduct sound financial sector policies. a consequence, major systemically important financial sector prove vulnerable undergo timely sufficiently in-depth scrutiny. 2 bi review 122/2010 last tuesday, imf board decide 25 country systemically important financial sector undergo least every 5 year in-depth assessment financial sector. moreover, board stress financial sector policy important case bilateral surveillance. this significant progress. multilateral surveillance bilateral surveillance, understandably, focus national policy must conduct country’s best interest. the premise simple: country achieve internal stability sustainable external position without manipulate exchange rates, system whole function satisfactorily. while remain largely valid, trade financial integration economic interdependence far advance national economic interest must pursue share framework collective stability. national policy pursue country’s best (short term) interest might collectively consistent. the problem persistent global imbalance important example. to complement bilateral surveillance, fund must formulate policy-oriented advice improve coherence national policy toward improve collective stability sustainable global growth. a promise proposal float recently production spillover reports. it welcome fund plan prepare, trial basis next year, least three spillover report us, euro area china. these report focus outward spillover domestic policy economy would involve authority economy (akin contact regular article iv consultations) also authority economy affect policies. the launch first mutual assessment process (map) g20, collaboration imf, new attempt multilateral cooperation coordination. give potential benefits, objective pursue determination. however, effectiveness g20 process still need demonstrate go forward. moreover, many special topic affect group country may include non-g20 member g20 member remain uncover g20 process. the imfc could provide forum address issues. prioritization collaboration the improvement surveillance require adequate resource fund member withhold them. but obvious choice make among wide range ideas; priority set. this happen take account particular effectiveness cost proposal work do international institutions. when consider creation imf surveillance products, sufficient attention devote integration product overall imf surveillance framework order maximise effectiveness synergy among products. the fund indeed already large array surveillance instrument (at bilateral, regional multilateral level: article iv, fsaps, weo, gfsr, reo, ewe, vulnerability exercise ems, multilateral consultation ...) result effort keep relevance change world. at time, close cooperation international institution forum essential, take due account comparative advantage expertise, avoid duplication efforts. regarding, instance, financial stability surveillance, imf fsb work together early warn exercise systemically important financial institutions. nevertheless, remain probably room improve coordination activities. in retrospect, admit record fsf imf le perfect. the fund also collaborate efficiently basel institutions: bi review 122/2010 3 bis, produce high-quality macrofinancial research, basel committee bank supervision, give much responsibility micro-financial issues. another proposal gain attention tailor content frequency surveillance process accord specific circumstance member country, thus also accord systemic importance country concerned. while i certainly see merit proposal, keep mind surveillance important country member right receive adequate policy advice regular article iv consultations. tailor consultation specific circumstance lead diverge surveillance quality different category members. traction fund surveillance i come last topic: so-called traction fund surveillance. with highly competent economic analyst central bank government countries, question usefulness fund surveillance. such view. the add value fund surveillance rest political independence fund opinion. like independent central banks, fund expert put long term consideration short term political calculus. in so, fund steer policy maker toward honesty boost government’s ability implement often politically difficult reforms. there debate transparency help improve traction fund surveillance. prior mexican crisis 1994, imf surveillance report highly confidential. today, article iv reports, exceptions, available fund’s website. for fund, challenge context, perceive impartial advisor monitor, tie structure official view problem downplayed1. let’s frank. the imf must indeed avoid public clash short term emergencies. on this, candid analysis acceptable treat need degree confidentiality. full unfettered transparency could contrary induce complacency loss credibility fund. however, time, imf must become pro-active persuade public opinion, social partners, ngo long-term cost unadjusted policy long-term gain outweigh short-term pain. explanation credible international institution promote global common good, might find support public long-term objective politician believe is.2 much say write improve governance imf enhance ministerial involvement. many observer conclude nothing really happen international meet imf world bank. this perception entirely unfounded. a i see it, central task minister governor meet imf seriously discus policy-oriented multilateral surveillance reports. this task imf executive board prepare. in end, policymakers high level agree consistency among policy promoted, policy coordination improved. pursue objective elevate level ambition fund surveillance cooperation member high level exist now. today’s conference advance ambition. 1 cfr. instance interview professor reinhart publish

significant asymmetry debate, evidenced, example, discussion post-crisis financial regulatory strategy g20 process. it fairly clear significant difference regulatory framework across country contribute different outcome term role national financial sector crisis and, turn, impact crisis financial sector themselves. within g20 process, result concern “one-size-fits-all” regulatory response crisis. however, constructive note, also contribute emergence collective view balance role financial sector development process need global co-ordination regulation face increase global integration financial system economy whole. this “emerging market perspective” subject seminar organize seoul prelude recent g20 finance deputy meet gwangju, korea, early month. i believe perspective provide important foundation sustain meaningful dialogue advance emerge economies, forum example. in brief keynote address, i would like put forward think broad principle guide think financial sector development shape contribution “emerging market perspective” i refer earlier. on previous occasions, i articulate four basic principles: efficiency, stability, transparency inclusion. an effective strategy would need balance objective implicit four principle by, first, exploit complementarity second, recognize tradeoff and, wherever arise, prioritize objectives. let elaborate “opportunities” “challenges” provide set objectives. a regard efficiency, little doubt financial system need meet expand increasingly complex requirement rapidly grow economy; so, need meet cost-effective manner possible. give imperative speed, number factor bring bear this. new capacity combine great competition clearly one way achieve objective. new way address specific needs, example, development new market new product another. however, important recognize efficiency financial system cannot view isolation. there must concrete link development economy capacity capability financial system. clearly, think rapid increase capacity capability, role foreign institution need consider reference ability bring capital knowledge table. however, benefit great foreign participation may generate balance potential increase risks. this bring u directly second principle, stability. financial stability, explicitly implicitly, always objective government central bank quite vividly demonstrate response crisis 2008. since then, perhaps implicit explicit seek formalize institutionalize many countries, include india. the 2 bi review 121/2010 mechanism need pre-empt deal systemic risk materialization seriously debated. from broad emerge market perspective, question significant presence large foreign player contribute systemic risk critical one regulatory prudential strategy design post-crisis environment. how exploit benefit offer respect broad developmental objective without make system vulnerable shock emanate outside whose transmission little control? a balance need maintain ownership, governance prudential norm satisfy reasonable systemic safety requirement commercial viability, make worthwhile institution expand set business. i would like emphasize stability principle confine exclusively foreign presence. systemic risk originate domestic financial player well. an effective safeguard mechanism must identify possible source risk put place appropriate measures. transparency critical requirement globally integrate financial system. standardize harmonize report norm help bring global comparability, which, turn, help national regulator identify vulnerability system take necessary step prevent precipitation crisis. however, desirable objective, process convergence resource knowledge intensive. cross-border comparability remain problem different country converge gradually global standards. even happens, mechanism ensure full dissemination information need institute strengthen derive full benefit comparability. finally, issue inclusion, clearly objective core large development agenda. it easy, even people within system, appreciate sheer scale challenge. it question numbers. the imperative provide financial access several hundred million people widely differ local environment term level affluence, economic structure mean livelihood, risk emanate natural man-made source infrastructure conditions. this require deep understand local terrain organizational ability find cost-effective way cater requirement financial service terrain. there are, course, universal replicable components, either already play become shortly. saturation coverage telecommunication network allow use low-cost wireless handheld device actually play role bank branch, significantly reduce cost expansion. the impend introduction unique identification number significantly improve efficiency kyc process well allow full mobility across network individual banks. but, give overall scale challenge, well regional diversity, properly visualize role different participant coordinate activity critical importance. and do full consideration cost-effectiveness, commercial viability and, course, implication strategy financial stability. in short, robust development financial sector manner consistent large goal economic development need balance four principles. it need exploit complementarity manage tradeoffs. let list three current area activity, reflect overall approach. first, process issue new bank license begun, articulation core issue pro con associate ownership capital criteria. a public debate consultation process way. second, effort coordinate action remain barrier development bond market motion. a important motivation sharp rise infrastructure spend need ensure hind financial constraints. third, process consultation individual bank objective develop realistic financial inclusion plan go on. i conclude highlight three balance act financial sector development strategy need perform: bi review 121/2010 3 1. between driver financial sector growth requirement large growth development agenda 2. between benefit risk great global integration 3. between advantage scale compulsion diversity i trust think useful input discussion follow i thank organizer panel opportunity share you. bi review 121/2010 1 andrew bailey: financial reform remark mr andrew bailey, executive director bank service chief cashier bank england, lord mayor’s city banquet, london, 21 september 2010. * * * my lord mayor, lady gentlemen. can i thank lord mayor behalf bank england invite u contribute regulatory banquet. adair i first meet current role literally i think first day job, incidentally weekend resolution bradford bingley. it great relief experience weekend cause second thoughts, benefit leadership provide since then. on subject time year, i add september, enjoy hospitality lord mayor distinct improvement recent september recover banks. an even mansion house beat pizza night session bank england long way. i go speak tonight public interest stability financial system matter us. calm time necessary environment task re-building financial stability. it task belong us, certainly task regulators, central banks, authority generally. we cannot achieve maintain financial stability own. above all, require recognition public interest financial stability. thirteen year ago, annual banquet banker merchant city, june 1997, month election year, comment new regulatory arrangements, governor bank, eddie george, say direction financial service regulation drive part “by rise tide public expectation term prudential behavioural standard require financial intermediaries”. eddie george undoubtedly correct public expect term standard business firms. but history tell u – painfully – way high standard terrible lapse many people industry forget preserve financial stability duty owe public. the fact matter public every right expect u act interest. this mean cannot attitude put short-term gain first basis stability financial system tomorrow’s objective, next person. but order achieve this, need clear benefit financial stability. one question i get ask frequently ensure lesson crisis stick. we achieve case financial stability well understood. there clear parallel monetary policy. the success monetary policy found public acceptance benefit sustain low inflation. that come easily, experience 1970s taught. but public acceptance interest start become embedded, task monetary policy become easy – easy, easier. in important sense, policy make apparatus independent interest public. and task ensure public acceptance ever finished. monetary policy demonstrate firmly establish last institutional framework policy make necessity. but exactly public interest financial stability? this hard question answer monetary policy, financial stability cannot readily summarise statistical series. there temptation generalise certainly know isn’t there. i think least four thing public want part overall stability financial system. first, confidence safety soundness institution hold money save write policy protect 2 bi review 121/2010 risks. second, institution capacity undertake stable sound provision financial service economy, include course lending. third, system business exist basis implicit commitment state use public money, public’s money, bail firm get trouble. and fourth, public place trust firm market base reputation transparency dealings. regulation important help foster trust, cannot substitute trust public need have, firm markets. the state support industry, regulator substitute trust reputation firm markets. some important principle follow identification public interest financial stability. first, competitive financial system exist root stability: competition stability cannot trade binary sense. second, public define financial stability prevent financial firm failing. in sector economy firm fail without put risk fund public taxpayers’ money. we truly solve big important fail problem thus public money problem tool disposal enable u resolve large institution get trouble. this create right incentive risk management. and third, regulator must use judgement mount robust challenge stop dangerous business model investment practices. this last point vital. financial service industry arbitrage rule regulation habitual, even addictive. money make way. we desire unduly suppress enterprise innovation, right thing preserve financial stability mean accept spirit rules. this small change. let give one important example. the new basel agreement emphasis loss-bearing capital – capital bear loss outside insolvency. it must stay way, chip away banner arbitrage masquerade innovation. i ask number time last week whether i think new basel agreement set capital requirement high enough. my answer capital buff future genuinely loss bear capital tricky wrinkles, keep outcome, take good step forward. sadly, case basel 1 late 1980s i start bank supervisor. the consultation document regulatory reform uk publish government end july emphasise need judgement-focused approach regulator “so business model challenged, risk identify action take preserve stability”. what mean? a primary focus new prudential regulation authority determine whether business models, governance system control firm enable satisfy public interest financial stability future state world. that require macro micro prudential view, two come together reach forward-looking judgement whether financial stability likely preserve range plausible future outcomes. this range outcome important, also underline need build role stress testing. such test important mechanism describe forward-looking view though continue evolve binary pass-fail world one toolkit test range possible future state world thereby judge wide resilience firms. the pra exercise judgement supervisory action takes, firm likely able meet objectives, policy rule medium term horizon. firm need demonstrate pra robust variety state world, include unanticipated stress scenarios. however, since possible forecast cover possible outcomes, always probability firm failing. work bank england’s resolution team, pra need closely integrate recovery resolution plan within supervision; view embed proactive intervention framework akin u prompt corrective action within supervisory approach deal inevitable situation firm get danger zone. above bi review 121/2010 3 all, tool support competition industry, accept winner losers. in two years’ time, new system financial regulation uk. those u involve assure transition small task, i also assure bank fully commit work fsa ensure smooth transition. there great deal do implement new system regulation, articulate build public interest financial stability, thereby improve stability system itself. basel iii, macroprudential tools, countercyclical buffers, thing adair i get excite about. they important foundation good policy. but don’t win public interest argument financial stability. to that, build case industry serve need interest public. the authority cannot alone. build confidence financial system take effort time. it common goal interest everyone. lord mayor, government city london important part fabric financial services, appreciate support industry objective stability financial system. it therefore great pleasure propose toast lord mayor lady mayoress. bi review 120/2010 1 jean-claude trichet: the entry estonia euro area speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, euro conference bank estonia, tallinn, 20 september 2010. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure today, tallinn, participate euro conference. on 1 january 2011 euro become legal tender estonia, estonia become 17th country join euro area. let first congratulate party involve outstanding achievement effort determination prepare estonia adoption euro. the creation single currency important step forward achievement historical endeavour create single market europeans, found father mind fifty year ago. it inception been, time, powerful symbol european country pursue actively strategic road towards unification. we eleven country start euro 1 january 1999. we seventeen 1 january 2011. there good way demonstrate euro area “closed shop” open country economy fully compliant entry criterion convince sustainable manner. 1 january 2011 become landmark history estonia, reflect long challenge process economic monetary integration enable estonia join euro area. after regain independence 1991, estonia embark rapid far-reaching programme social economic reform. in addition determine reformer, become model stable multi-party democracy. estonia transform dynamic economy, gain recognition sound fiscal record, economic freedom capacity develop new technologies. for several years, estonia also one world’s fast grow economies, growth far balanced. notwithstanding difficult year follow regain independence, estonia’s real gdp grow average rate 7.2% per annum period 1995 2007. however, growth rate come halt 2008. real output decline sharply 2008 2009, and, latvia, estonia become second severely affect eu member state term output decline. the severity adjustment reveal period rapid output growth was, extent, also period imbalanced growth economic overheating. during year economic expansion, strong domestic demand main drive force behind economic growth, domestic demand fuel by, among things, rapid increase real disposable income, overly optimistic expectation future income. the significant financial inflow estonia fuel credit growth increase asset prices, notably house markets, result imbalance unwind context severe recession. in addition, rapid growth real gdp estonian economy 2008 result accumulation sizeable, double-digit current capital account deficit gdp ratios. boom domestic demand capacity constraint support unsustainable rise unit labour costs, cumulative increase 50% period 2000 2007. the strong increase wage outpace productivity gain negative impact competitiveness economy. today, look forward introduction euro estonia, i would like point two key aspect country’s experience road adopt euro. the estonian experience may encourage euro area country tackle press need 2 bi review 120/2010 adjustment currently face inspire estonia, well current prospective euro area countries, contribute sustainable function economic monetary union year ahead. the first key aspect refer importance maintain sound fiscal record. even exceptional times, estonia demonstrate strong commitment maintain sound national fiscal policies, crucial element policy framework economic monetary union. there clear consensus estonia fiscal consolidation never compromised. indeed, despite significant degree uncertainty recovery external domestic demand, estonian authority implement significant fiscal consolidation measure 2009. this strong advantage estonia effort join euro area. indeed, country’s fiscal policy record since 1992 support view prudence key element fiscal policy. the second key aspect estonia’s experience refer importance effective prevention and, necessary, decisive correction economic imbalances. with benefit hindsight, clear estonia’s overall policy stance tight order contain demand pressure emergence significant macroeconomic imbalance time fast growth. this particularly true period 2005 2007, overheat pressure become apparent. effort reduce wage growth contain rapid credit growth period also prove largely ineffective. in end, macroeconomic imbalance accumulate estonian economy quite significant, magnitude speed adjustment follow indeed dramatic. however, estonian economy, citizen support it, adapt rather quickly new economic environment, prove remarkable capacity adjustment. this speak flexibility estonia’s economy “alertness” people. the new economic environment require prompt, determine action adoption difficult policy measures. the implementation measure contribute estonia’s prudent fiscal record rapid unwind external internal imbalance build boom years. competitiveness gradually restore current capital account balance record surplus since begin 2009. the adjustment nominal wage been, continue be, essential element gradual correction competitiveness loss return sustainable output growth. development public sector, nominal wage decline around 10% 2009, contribute adjustment wage economy whole. sustainable wage dynamics, increase line productivity progress, continue crucial restore competitiveness maintain low inflation environment. encouragingly, estonia’s economic recession appear over, know, time complacency. with mind, particularly important estonia euro area country support reallocation domestic resource export-oriented, high value add sector order ensure return sustainable external positions. to encourage sustainable job creation, important ensure wage remain sufficiently flexible. finally – crucially ecb’s perspective – estonian authority must remain alert, take forceful action necessary, ensure low inflation environment achieve recent past sustain year come. the experience estonia various euro area country past year highlight importance rigorous effective surveillance inside single currency area. in line treaty, ecb attache great importance notion sustainability. a country must eligible adopt euro achieve high degree sustainable convergence economy position fully reap benefit join euro area. a lack sustainability would inevitably result serious economic challenge newcomer would possibly also negative consequence euro area countries, even euro area whole. that thorough diligent approach bi review 120/2010 3 ensure adherence convergence criterion sustainable basis interest current prospective euro area countries. in order fully reap benefit euro allow adjustment mechanism operate efficiently within enlarge euro area, essential estonia adopt appropriate policies, thereby contribute robust economic growth sustainable basis. the success euro depend euro area country seriously engage responsibility go hand hand considerable benefit euro area membership offers. against background, we, ecb, welcome commitment estonian authority ensure, introduction euro, economic environment conducive sustainable output employment growth, balance macroeconomic conditions, include price stability. i also confident estonia, new member “euro area family”, make important contribution strong effective governance framework eu euro area levels, thus help ensure implementation sound economic policy closely scrutinised. recently, ecb set number proposal reinforce economic governance euro area1. these proposals, follow task force chair president van rompuy, identify need strengthen governance enforcement structure economic policy framework euro area. they require “quantum leap” term progress towards strengthen institutional foundation economic monetary union. it contribute deep economic union commensurate degree economic integration interdependency already achieve monetary union. the introduction new currency also represent logistical challenge require careful preparation. great effort been, continue be, make ensure people estonia well-informed euro banknote coins, particular banknotes’ security features. i confident close cooperation ecb eesti pank achieve last year leadership governor lipstok, cooperation continue future, make significant contribution smooth successful introduction euro estonia. we look forward welcome estonia euro area! thank much attention. 1 see “reinforcing economic governance euro area”, available ecb’s website (www.ecb.europa.eu). bi review 120/2010 1 umayya toukan: the international monetary system – big fail speech mr umayya toukan, governor central bank jordan, 34th jackson hole economic symposium “macroeconomic policy: post-crisis”, session 6, jackson hole, wyoming, 28 august 2010. * * * the international monetary system: big fail i extremely honor ask speak important topic distinguish audience i wish thank tom hoenig give opportunity. i also proud panel. some year back, throughout dissertation work able guidance frederic mishkin, maurice obstfeld go beyond call duty respond many inquiries. i wish, again, express professor obstfeld feel gratitude. john lipsky give valuable advice matter monetary policy bank supervision country i wish thank team international monetary fund. there shortage justification call reform international monetary system (ims). the justification refer sort two categories: macro policy member country imperfection bretton wood system. macro policy member country include policy run massive deficit intervene foreign exchange markets. on hand, commentator agree bretton wood system function originally planned. after 1973, ims seem revert market oriented, hybrid voluntary system oppose system characterize imf surveillance support imf facilities. in remark today, i attempt relate mention issue three set interrelate time conflict considerations: (i) national vs. international consideration (ii) political vs. economic considerations. (iii) public policy vs. market considerations. give seven country currently dollarized currency board use dollar, 89 country peg exchange rate use dollar anchor1, clear macro policy main reserve currency country huge impact country mention also rest develop world. it equally important appreciate perception vulnerability country whose currency peg major reserve currency consequent need accumulate reserve self insurance2. the global current account imbalance result volatility capital inflow several serious consequences, which, blame recent global economic financial crisis3. considerable volatility capital flows, associate “liquidity shocks” create strong need accumulate reserves. commentator generally agree that, case oil exporter china, reserve hold exceed conceivable precautionary needs, reflect state still develop financial market country well desire boost policy credibility4. the move flexible exchange rate regime advance economy expect help clear global imbalances. that expectation fully meet several reasons. first, public policy choice country continue put important structural adjustments. 1 reinhart rogoff 2004. 2 aizenman sun 2009. 3 kohn, 2010. 4 obstfeld, shambaugh taylor, 2009. 2 bi review 120/2010 furthermore, number emerge economy allow currency float freely, continue defend peg undervalue exchange rate. those mode behavior beg issue deal protectionist sentiments. we light hearted question region asks: god choose send prophet three religion middle east? and answer is: impossible get schengen visa. divine wisdom aside, protectionism, broad sense, continue major challenge global coordination. anecdotal evidence suggest that, last year alone, 450 “low intensity” protectionist measure take g20 members5. with fiscal consolidation many country almost jobless growth, country may continue resort increase export create jobs. consequently, risk competitive devaluations, intervention otherwise, may growing. the plausible assumption persistence protectionist sentiment country take protectionist measure protect “national interest ”. similarly, one may also assume competitive devaluation 1930s intend protect national interest country concerned. the outcome event 1930s aftermath clearly support fine objective line reason neither present imbalance present market volatility. and public policy tend overvalue national interest undervalue international interest also market mechanism seem produce similar outcome. an interest argument support view present per jacobson lecture last june basle6 i quote “...there nationalist bias pro-market revolution...” unquote. give dominance globalization interdependence financial markets, may seem paradoxical still much difficulty reconcile national international interests. to sum point: i think bretton wood institution indeed unite nation system design reconcile national interest global interest ensure mutual consistency national policies7. the fix adjustable peg late float manage exchange rate regime suppose take care imbalance current account. the prevail hybrid system exchange rate could clear current account imbalance continue persist. the good news imf surveillance prove invaluable case deficit develop countries. since late 1980s, introduce several key structural reform jordan base imf surveillance imf consultations. more recently, fsap review help u introduce several key reform financial sector. other develop country may go exercise. in regard, imf play important role ongoing regulatory financial reform effort side atlantic. furthermore, call legitimacy representation quota may enhance multilateral role imf meet concern regard imf governance. more importantly, i suggest enable imf provide international liquidity need scheme establish “global financial safety net” expand mandate light recent global crisis include macrofinancial surveillance spillover analysis seriously considered. in general, i would suggest strengthen imf enforcement mechanism, keynes original idea global clear bank, would restore international monetary system need ownership credibility. i believe late charles kindleberger8 say international financial system work unless somebody take responsibility it. finally point, also essential imf 5 saccomanni, 2010. 6 tommaso, 2010. 7 carney, 2009. 8 landau, 2010. bi review 120/2010 3 enhance collaboration financial stability board (fsb) well bank international settlement (bis). a major criticism bretton wood agreement 1944 separate economics politics “water tight ” compartment accord richard gardner interest book “sterling dollar diplomacy9”. in regard, political policy choice continue put adjustment surplus countries. how reform international monetary system bring need consistency economic political consideration major challenge global community come years. the global crisis fact start u may lead believe current ims model use dollar global key currency undermined. moreover, recent sovereign debt problem europe raise doubt euro whether single currency, limit political integration, little fiscal coordination among member countries, could sustainable. in regard, i suggest concern totally justified. the dollar back trust u political economic system, liquidity depth u financial market outstanding infrastructure payments’ settlement. moreover, although euro around ten years, today associate price stability. in regard, i think major credit go european central bank (ecb) president trichet also consistent stand independence integrity ecb. by definition, currency freely convertible trade investment purpose potential achieve status international currency. furthermore, international use currency market-driven process determine independent decision private agent public policy. the criterion central banks’ decision foreign currency portfolio often differ consideration private save may relate standard portfolio choice criteria. when present international monetary system original form agree upon 1944, expect dollar would main reserve currency. over sixty year on, dollar still main reserve currency. any shift central bank hold dollar reserve asset risk large account loses. structural reforms, particular, area medical care entitlement well address often describe save glut investment drought, essential restore balance global economy. major reserve currency government respond call fiscal balance, high savings, balance investment spend home. other country could also introduce flexibility exchange rate currency allow relative price change. fiscal policy emerge market also stimulate domestic demand away export toward consumption home. this well know i think bear repetition. before i conclude, i would like present quotation book history bank international settlement basle10, one cold snowy december night north carolina, author wake power failure which, words, take back 19th century realize take grant many thing life i quote: “…the payment system yet another example highly complex network technology. we take grant check clear, atm instantly provide cash anywhere world, import pay require currency, desire amount liquidity available u time low cost. in fact, marvel ordinarily smooth work international payment system rather surprise occasional malfunction...” unquote. 9 gardner, 1980. 10 toniolo, 2005. 4 bi review 120/2010 clearly, global crisis past two year hardly occasional malfunction. however, i would like suggest bretton wood agreement subsequent reform serve global economy well since world war ii. furthermore, market work even become dysfunctional, saw past 18 month so, market send clear message corrective action. of course coordinate non-conventional measure take major central banks, particular federal reserve, bank england ecb, well action take governments, save global economy meltdown. the manage director imf suggest last spring 1/3 effectiveness stimulus measure due global coordination. those measure take individually may produce result. a quick review statement minister imf meet last spring would reveal term “multilateralism”, “coordination” “surveillance” frequently use terms. at least one minister call “compulsory multilateral coordinate surveillance”. the ministers’ remark reflect “g-20 framework strong, sustainable balance growth” emphasize mutual assessment members’ monetary, exchange rate, fiscal financial policy assistance imf international financial institutions. i start remark refer several inconsistency need reconcile global community i would like end remark go back basics. central bank continue adhere medium term objective price stability government adhere fiscal consolidation unwind fiscal deficits. furthermore, international agreement framework financial sector reform arrive at. maintain central bank credibility well fiscal regulatory credibility essential restore confidence ims. however, still clear reform mechanism impose adjustment surplus countries. furthermore, clear either, reform system, international body impose fiscal discipline member countries. i would therefore fully subscribe view “achieving good balance require last shift spending, production, save borrow around world11”. it would ideal political-economic mix public policy, especially major economies, would consistent allow market produce shift country concern conceive shift national interest. after all, anything big fail, international monetary system. i thank attention. reference aizenman, j., y., sun, 2009. “the financial crisis sizable international reserve depletion: from fear float fear lose

bank france, reinvent bretton wood committee, beijing, 6 september 2010. * * * opinion express solely mine represent view banque de france eurosystem. international financial monetary arrangement currently extensively debated. for many countries, advance emerging, crisis show close link internal international financial stability. in addition, rebalancing world economy stand forefront g20 policy agenda perception may difficult achieve current arrangements. accord apt definition, international monetary system consist (i) exchange rate arrangements; (ii) capital flows; (iii) collection institutions, rules, convention govern operation (carney, 2009). explicit implicit “rules games” form backbone system. this ambitious approach may seem normative some. but long history, start gold standard, phrase “rules games” originated. the bretton wood system build around elaborate framework rules, discipline support mechanism aim ensure convertibility current account – but, crucially, capital account –, together fix adjustable exchange rates. with generalisation flexible exchange rate regimes, normative approach international monetary system somehow weakened. capital account liberalisation lead entrust international financial market “disciplining” function. when become apparent discipline could often lead abrupt capital flow reversal crisis, international community attempt strengthen imf surveillance develop facility pre-empt shock make manageable. that is, basically, today. everything must do ensure imf surveillance works. but, like “disciplinary” approach, meet three essential difficulties: first, diverge interest countries; second, enforcement problem (the imf naturally leverage country need help others). finally perception asymmetry imf surveillance; may compound fundamental natural asymmetry surplus deficit countries, come implement adjustment measures. and, would say, might also de facto asymmetry reserve non reserve currencies, although, i shall mention later, situation subtle. these difficulty apparent last part 20th century. but make “disciplinary” approach almost impracticable today change occur world turn 21st century. the world today stand stark contrast bretton wood era period follow immediately:  the first – obvious – difference number country active participant system stake functioning. the monetary financial world become increasingly “multipolar”. while current system comprise three currency blocs, least one (the chinese rmb) may additional systemic currency emerge future.  second, participant diverse point view economic structure, demography, level development, and, importantly, social choice preferences. for instance, different save rate may see result divergent time preferences. likewise, asymmetry financial 2 bi review 120/2010 development may, extent, reflect different choice tradeoff efficiency stability organisation capital market architecture financial systems.  finally, linkage economies, whether trade, capital intangible “confidence” channel continuously get strong witness speed amplitude contagion economic financial shock last eighteen months, take everybody surprise. pending economic catastrophe, characteristic persist time. a large number different countries, different preferences, permanently link interdependent active, imperfect capital markets. any future international architecture must compatible basic feature today’s world which, prima facie, create potential complexity and, maybe, instability. therefore, discuss international monetary arrangements, one must try take different view, encompass aspect financial interrelationship nations. to large extent, international monetary arrangements, well current account imbalances, by-product policy choice make country capital account regime financial development. here, i focus three topics: global imbalances, provision international liquidity newly emerge question international store value. these issue joint common interest countries, get common understand matter would help make progress other, contentious questions, exchange rate regimes. global imbalance policy agenda current account imbalance increase amplitude durability last decade. in fact, become permanent characteristic economic environment. contemporary analysis point “structural” cause behind pattern capital flow global imbalances:  accord “bretton wood ii” approach (dooley et al. 2003, 2008, 2009), pattern capital flow result mutually beneficial equilibrium two group countries. on one hand, emerge economy follow export-led development strategy seek prevent appreciation real exchange rate constant foreign exchange intervention (together capital controls). a consequence, accept accumulate increase stock liquid asset denominate dollars. on hand, u happy get reserve inflow finance deficit cheap import fuel demand consumption goods. such equilibrium stable virtue mutual benefit bring groups. moreover, lasts, impossible change since group become mutually dependant stock claim debt reciprocally accumulated. any significant break, instance, allocation reserve surplus countries, would trigger major exchange interest rate volatility deficit country lead significant valuation loss surplus countries. this “financial balance terror” suppose keep system place long period time. implicit behind doctrine, however, assumption creditor country live risk loss reserve accept possibility price pay success growth strategy.  a recent explanation provide “asset shortage” theory (caballero, 2006), help explain asymmetry financial development generate payment imbalance asset bubbles. accord theory, world shortage liquid riskless assets. moreover, supply bi review 120/2010 3 asset asymmetrically distribute regions, u provide large chunk total. hence, structural excess demand dollar denominate securities, sustain permanent capital inflow us. to extent u financial system generate enough “pure” safe assets, create incentive financial sector manufacture asset securitization low quality ones, cost greatly increase financial fragility (caballero, 2009). the policy consequence important. 1. first, current account imbalance likely prove resilient expect exchange rate movement inflexion macro policies. if cause "structural”, significant shift demand relative price country may well lead suboptimal growth excess volatility. in immediate future, “financing “ imbalance take precedence “adjustment”. 2. second, global imbalance reflect mix different national preference inflexion cause public interventions. one important focus policy debate disentangle two type structural causes, eliminate pure policy induce distortions. obviously, easy task, but, end, crucial one imbalance address reduced. 3. finally, financial development matters. this one area preference differ nation public policy huge impact. this also source major uncertainty future. in diverse, multipolar world, interaction country different financial system become complex and, crisis shown, destabilizing. will move towards liberalisation capital account exist restriction control maintain part world? open capital account expose country increase financial volatility. the impact, however, different capital importer exporters. capital importer face possibility flow would abruptly dry up, thus inflict damage shock financial system national economies. capital exporter accumulate claim outside world and, therefore, run risk valuation loss (through exposure country exchange rate risk). ideally, international open capital account regime would protect capital importer towards sudden liquidity shock capital exporter toward abrupt change value assets. these potential avenue progress debate. international liquidity the crisis powerful reminder liquidity – domestic international – never take granted. the provision international liquidity severely disrupted. how provide future, whom? these new questions. in recent period, governor zhu, people bank china raise issue reserve currencies. accord governor zhu, current arrangement liquidity provision source instability play role cause crisis. governor zhu mentioned, particular, intrinsic contradiction embody famous “triffin dilemma”. because dollar major reserve currency, international liquidity supply depend u run sufficiently large current account deficit which, itself, aggravate global imbalance create instability. governor zhu suggest role status sdr enhanced, long term objective create “super reserve” currency. however, triffin dilemma go back period international capital market poorly developed. by then, international liquidity limit instrument use settle payment official monetary authorities. it represent claim official 4 bi review 120/2010 entities. by contrast, today’s world, international liquidity privately provide represent claim private institutions. interbank market play crucial role process. the capital market become integrate short end, international liquidity provide private sector. a consequence, strong continuity complementarity domestic international liquidity. both depend willingness counterparties extend credit other. both subject aggregate supply demand shock sudden shift risk aversion liquidity preference. both result leverage deleveraging private institution (adrian shin, 2008). when market seize, counterparty risk perceive excessive, uncertainty settle in, financial institution deleverage position towards non residents, international liquidity dry disappears. when shock occurs, public provision liquidity substitute private provision. in domestic context, function lender last resort. but shortage foreign currency liquidity, role play foreign exchange reserves. foreign exchange reserve in last decade, emerge country constantly seek expand foreign exchange reserves. the emerge markets’ average reserve ratio quintuple 4 percent 20 percent gdp since 1990 (obstfeld et al. 2009, matteo lagos et al., 2009). one cannot assume, however, equilibrium reach demand reserve stabilize. on contrary, strong indication trend persist, even amplified, follow crisis. how much reserve enough? theoretical reason would balance benefit hold reserve cost, notion optimum. on benefit side, reserve detain accumulate variety motives:  smooth impact consumption shock current account, basic traditional motive, even absence international capital flow  result by-product foreign market intervention prevent exchange rate appreciation. this usually define “mercantilist” motive.  precaution possible abrupt capital outflow (the “sudden stop” syndrome) the cost hold reserve also well identified:  direct opportunity cost foreign exchange reserves’ risk / return profile may low other, alternative, investments.  finally, reserve accumulate, country get increasingly expose exchange rate risk face possibility significant valuation losses. this traditional cost / benefit analysis seem le le able, however, account true behavior reserve holders. during crisis, foreign exchange reserve use tool internal – well external – financial stability. national central banks, especially latin america, act dollar lender last resort domestic banks. (obstfeld et al. 2009). this function develop future. financial openness integration mean domestic bank engage foreign currency operations. in turn, expansion international balance sheet increase potential demand liquidity support case shocks. this trend accept normal consequence open bi review 120/2010 5 capital market international banking, together predominance limit number currency international finance. it bind impact demand reserve increase need self insurance. one characteristic liquidity shock net demand liquidity may become almost infinite. ex ante, buff ever big enough. no amount reserve fully protect financially open economy systemic shock. it noticeable countries, korea, possess important amount reserve prior crisis flexible exchange rate regime, nevertheless felt need enter currency swap federal reserve. in sense, country face dilemma private institutions. they need liquidity time stress costly hold normal times. their reactions, however, opposite. private institution tend underestimate liquidity need because, case shock, central bank step lender last resort. for countries, bias go direction. provision international liquidity, whether private official, contingent, conditional uncertain. with international lender last resort, financial stability motif could lead unlimited accumulation liquidity. internationalisation finance create fundamental indeterminacy demand reserves. a consequence, past benchmark use ass adequacy reserve long valid. current research (obstfeld et al. 2009 ) show broad domestic money aggregate may best explanatory factor amount reserves. multilateral provision international liquidity: search financial safety net the rationale multilateral source liquidity provision straightforward: stabilize demand international reserve would bring huge benefit term world welfare. at moment, reserve accumulation occur conjunction balance payment surplus degree exchange rate intervention create externality countries. now, suppose “ex ante” exist pool reserve asset country could tap specific circumstances. if access pool credible predictable, would need get reserve market. this would reduce incentive country conduct whole set policy as:  generate current account surplus active exchange rate management  ring fence pool liquidity capital local subsidiaries, therefore create potential segmentation international financial markets.  implement “soft” capital control limit impact shock diminish need reserve all countries, therefore common interest find way disconnect reserve accumulation exchange rate management and, generally, balance payment situation monetary policies. the need national reserve could reduce credible mechanism exist provide supply official liquidity multilateral basis. significant progress achieve direction recent period. a dense network forex swap put place major central bank midst crisis. other recent official initiative include: creation imf new facility – flexible credit line – aim ease liquidity pressure country fundamental balance payment difficulties; new sdr allocation, big ever, equivalent 250 bn usd, enact imf executive board. these are, however, revocable limit source liquidity provision. swap agreement (and been) terminated. out total, small part sdr allocation 6 bi review 120/2010 benefit country may effectively need use them. more may need substitute national foreign exchange reserve permanent insurance mechanism. contingent liquidity the search new liquidity source meet inescapable moral hazard problem. on one hand, equivalent reserve go forward, multilateral liquidity must available ex ante without condition. on other, danger fully unconditional liquidity use deal fundamental “solvency” imbalances. in real life, easy distinction make. the dilemma solved, domestic level, provision eligible collateral. this may prove uneasy international liquidity: transfer ownership substantial amount sovereign asset country international institution would meet huge legal political difficulties. this rationale conditionality. but, course, conditionality create uncertainty incompatible purpose instant supply liquidity. a conditional facility never perfect substitute reserves. many country fully eligible flexible credit line (fcl) use foreign swap instead. anecdotal evidence suggest swap often perceive carry le stigma effect. one way deal moral hazard would distinguish explicitly two different risk face country: one hand idiosyncratic risk, create national policy country specific shocks; hand, “systemic” risk stem aggregate liquidity shock occur broad – global regional – scale. country would self insure idiosyncratic risk hold sufficient amount reserves. protection systemic risk would come multilateral mechanism international liquidity provision. of course, distinction idiosyncratic systemic risk may difficult involve broad degree judgment. but two basic rule guide future work multilateral safety net: (1) condition access specify ex ante; (2) condition fully delinked situation individual economies. rather, depend state global economy international financial markets. from point view individual country, access fully unconditional, global condition met. a considerable amount work currently devote devise instrument contingent capital financial institution time crisis. the intellectual framework extend liquidity. what need contingent liquidity i.e. liquidity available nation time aggregate shock international financial system. this raise two questions: would liquidity come from? how could mobilized? a source, possibility would create process periodic general allocation sdrs, accord predetermine schedule. those sdrs, however, would immediately available use beneficiaries. rather, would “frozen” unblock pre – specify circumstance (landau, 2009). criterion use would define basis individual countries’ situations, consideration condition prevail global economy international capital markets. if properly constructed, scheme may provide, cost, kind insurance country currently seek build excess reserves. how would country access new source liquidity? the traditional approach would allocate contingent liquidity country accord quota share imf. however, imperfect representation countries’ liquidity need especially time crisis. take inspiration contingent capital literature, one could imagine country could “buy” access contingent liquidity crisis time paying, normal times, premium issuer (the imf?). this could prove le costly accumulate excess reserves. go one step further, transpose idea caballero kurlat (2009), imf could issue tradable instrument give access contingent liquidity bi review 120/2010 7 activated. if broadly trade public entities, price instrument would give useful indication underlie systemic tension international financial markets. regional arrangement another approach would privilege regional arrangement either pool reserve redistribute though permanent swap agreements. asian countries, especially, work implement progressively scheme chiang mai initiative. it note regional pool efficient country face asymmetric liquidity shock within region. pool bring additional benefit shock occur global scale country hit simultaneously. also, regional arrangement cannot avoid moral hazard problem multilateral scheme facing. nevertheless, seem considerable scope regional arrangement prosper future. first, act useful complement global scheme articulate (and support by) imf facilities. second, one expect regional financial integration progress, especially part world huge pool save available currently intermediate financial system locate outside region. with deep financial integration, probability significant portfolio shift inside one region increase markedly, create potential asymmetric liquidity shocks. the development regional liquidity arrangement may appear useful underpin development regional financial markets. store value one consequence crisis cast doubt ability assets, consider riskless, serve reliable store value. the ability private sector create “safe” asset financial innovation prove largely illusory (caballero, 2009). so, period come may increase demand worldwide risk free asset much le certainty future supply. the search liquid instrument would also provide reliable international store value go many decades. when discussion hold build bretton wood system, keynes propose creation new international currency, “bancor” could serve source liquidity store value. thirty year ago, extensive discussion imf creation substitution account. this mechanism country could exchange reserve currency sdrs, get protection exchange rate risk. most recently, governor zhu reopen debate suggested, long run, creation new “super reserve” currency, while, meantime, enhance role status sdr. there good argument create international instrument provide reliable store value:  first, safe investor feel risk-return profile holdings, big exposure prepare accept. in way, structural characteristic international monetary system influence sustainability global imbalances.  second, uncertainty relative value settle in, would likely accompany extreme volatility investors, whether public private, constantly reshuffle exist portfolio country currency order manage exposure.  finally, important, many oil commodity producer face intertemporal choice extract resource keep 8 bi review 120/2010 ground. accord standard economic reason (the hotelling rule), one important determinant return earn financial assets, compare expect commodity price increase long run. the possibility large valuation loss financial asset make optimal reduce rate extraction, would durably low supply oil commodities. however, also practical conceptual difficulties:  a choice would make true nature “super reserve currency”. would basket exist monies new “fiat” currency? if “super reserve” basket exist currency (such sdr today) would basically serve instrument diversification foreign exchange reserve (or private portfolios), diversification easily achieve use exist currencies. on hand, “super sovereign” could issue fiat currency. then, international community would basic choice. either new currency could make “strong” never depreciate major exist currencies, probably mean supply would severely restricted. or, “super sovereign” would issue accord pre-specified rules, depreciation exist currency could excluded. it would ensure regular supply international liquidity, could provide partial protection exchange rate volatility valuation losses. there important trade off, there, essence new “triffin dilemma” cannot avoid look public supply international liquidity, whether one nation within multilateral framework.  more fundamentally, new currency would provide reliable store value would, fact, grant holder collective guarantee exchange risk. that guarantee would benefit surplus country would give deficit countries. this issue intensely debate substitution account discuss negotiate within imf, 25 year ago. it become clear, time would accept many country unless explicit, bind symmetric rule balance payment adjustment agree upon simultaneously. most likely, question would raise today creation new reserve currency would part broad framework. conclusion provisional policy lesson look next decade, one project two alternative – polar – scenario evolution international financial system. first, scenario progressive partial fragmentation: significant capital account open would occur many part world. on contrary, new barrier could erect either form capital control national regulation force financial institution ring fence local pool capital liquidity. there would little convergence domestic financial system regulations. foreign exchange reserve would keep growing, absolute percentage world gdp. this scenario may see realistic response increase diversity multipolar world. such evolution could also defend grind assume benefit financial harmonization integration really materialize (rodrik et al. 2008). furthermore, crisis show financial system claim intrinsically superior country could feel justify adopt promote models. the systemic consequences, however, clear. in world, current account imbalance would heavily influence public action policies. regulatory competition would dominate localization financial activity allocation savings. in absence “rules game”, tension would naturally arise countries, likely conflict exchange rate regime policies. bi review 120/2010 9 an opposite scenario would see progressive open capital accounts, together (more le intensive) convergence financial system regulations. this would allow emergence unify world capital market, efficient allocation save across country smooth finance current account imbalances. such scenario could prove attractive capital exporter (through good return excess savings) capital importers, may option isolate international capital market anyway. experience shows, however, open international financial system inherently stable and, therefore, dependent strong infrastructure conditions. the move towards financially open world would, least, support robust arrangement international liquidity provision. pending ambitious reforms, lot still do provide investor stable store value. one promise avenue would be, country surplus savings, develop internal store value expand range safe liquid financial asset available domestic international investors. by so, would achieve several goal time. they would bring efficiency finance domestic needs. they would provide investor broad range choices. they would also eliminate currently exist incentive export capital order protect value. they would contribute reduce “asset shortage” negative consequences, include international imbalance finance asset bubbles. financial development many country would address cause international imbalance root financial crisis. reference adrian, t. h. s. shin (2008), “liquidity leverage”, federal reserve bank new york staff report no 328. aizenman, j., y. jinjarak d. park

bank get trouble, likely almost sector rescue government whose intervention back budgetary resources. all dramatically illustrate recent years, month indeed weeks. and although epicentre global financial crisis u investment bank market, link bank budget arguably recently illustrate region europe european country ireland. two-way channel influence bank budget – irish example the channel influence present way way down, direction bank budget. let make concrete give flavour irish situation. from 2003 2007 irish bank system import fund equivalent 50 per cent gdp fund runaway property construction bubble. the tax revenue generate boom come many forms: capital gain property, stamp duty property transactions, value add tax construction material income tax extra worker – immigrant rest europe, africa, china, flood construction sector alone swell account 13 per cent number work (about twice current level, close would normal). for decade budget surplus (averaging 1½ per cent gdp) almost every year. no need, seemed, restraint spending, so, year relatively discipline government budgeting, relaxation spend control – one i say broadly welcome across political spectrum. alas, apparent solidity public finance mirage brutally expose global financial confidence collapsed. already irish boom well over: house price fall government deficit widen early 2007. the global recession damage budget also direct effect world trade accordingly economic activity, give open nature irish economy. but direct effect budget yet become manifest. the progressive tighten short-term financial market second half 2007 2008, peak dramatic week bankruptcy lehman brothers, eventually expose fact that, bank fuel unsustainable property bubble, safeguard solvency adequate collateral guarantees. the government little alternative 2 bi review 119/2010 announce extensive guarantee bank liabilities. this prove costless, impose net cost place heavy burden taxpayer user public service ireland several year – though, i repeatedly state since broad magnitude become clear march year, manageable point view national public finance good deal le alarmist commentary suggested. to specific, every one top eight retail lender – three subsidiary branch well-known international bank group – record loan loss would eventually eat substantially capital fact process replenished. thus entire bank sector get catch unreal scenario. each firm look shoulder others reluctant miss seemingly profitable growth business fearful shareholders’ reaction decline market share. in ideal world, prudential regulator would call halt, – i recently document detail report minister finance matter – despite misgive grow exposure, regulatory apparatus fully appreciate scale imminence risk whether systemic individual bank level act timidly ineffectually restrain lend boom. rather see bank limp on, cripple non-performing loan would inhibit ability retain depositor fund discourage new lending, government already step begin 2009 begin portfolio restructure system. the approach adopt comprehensive transparent. it design remove overhang large hard-to-recover property loan book banks, free management concentrate provide credit service need economic recovery. the bank recapitalized – parent case foreign-owned banks, market-sources, backed-up injection capital government necessary rest. the asset management agency nama establish purchase large property relate loan bank ambitious scale – indeed, relative economy nama among large agency type – china provide possibly close parallel. the nama approach buy loan market-related prices, view nama break even good time recover loans. despite haircut inevitably entails, five main locally-controlled bank agree participate nama. the process value transfer loan painstaking one take long everyone hoped, well way, discount initial tranche large – 50 per cent first two tranche average. of course crystallization loss erode capital banks, give rise visible transparent recapitalization need address energetically central bank. (i hear suggestion up-front transparency could avoid brush problem carpet variety ways. bank resolution history provide much support suggestion. denial obfuscation would, i believe, credible anyway, would prolong crisis increase ultimate cost.) it clear authority bank would need recapitalized comfortable credible level recover financial independence operate without place additional burden budget. well ahead recent eu-wide stress tests, central bank conduct stress tests, call prudential capital adequacy review (pcar), start two main banks. this entail detail assessment loan-loss prospect across non-nama part portfolio end current loan-loss cycle, assume 2012, well projection operate income. a result assessment, challenge go banks’ exist provisions, management’s projection loan losses, central bank determine bank additional capital amount would raise, bi review 119/2010 3 one way another. the additional amount design cover loan loss imply read across first nama haircut rest non-nama book, also ensure bank would ample capital meet future losses. thus, base case projection – mention highly stress relative ifrs provision relative banks’ projection – bank come bottom cycle least 8 per cent core tier 1 capital (7 per cent equity). these new capital requirement irish bank announce end march, meet end year. bank ireland already satisfy requirement, inter alia raise equity capital right issue. aib, large core bank system do, still work it, announce satisfactory sale polish subsidiary within last days. to extent aib may raise full amount own, government undertake meet deficiency, conversion preference share stake need additional equity injection, presumably use resource national pension reserve fund. recapitalization restructure three small institution well way also. bid receive number interest party ebs, i expect future ownership resolve quite soon. the disposition retail business irish nationwide follow soon thereafter. the pcar exercise bancassurer ilp recently complete involve small additional sum raised. the recapitalization process also benefit banks’ liquidity position, term cash raise reduce loan deposit ratios. the government’s decision anglo

process running-off loan asset time. the government ask central bank determine appropriate level capital need two institution anglo split. there technicality involved, and, i don’t want anticipate

regulatory status asset recovery entity time. our analysis base capital calculation therefore focus amount require ensure new structure capitalize accordance current basel capital requirement light exist provision immediate expect losses. we also publish stress assessment potential future loss take account stress fund cost well. thus, recognize loss may exceed base assessment time, set stress case aim provide much certainty reasonably possible potential exposure present anglo severe hypothetical stress scenario run book. i’m plan revisit today detail overall net fiscal cost irish bank crisis. everyone know month exposure large, wide, though narrowing, range uncertainty. current work seek narrow range far possible, though historical experience caution expect great precision. the anglo base capital stress calculation definitely help, completion nama process also narrow range – example regard inbs. much exceptional government financial support bank restructure arise year, follower budgetary statistic see sizable step jump irish government debt, sharp transient spike government borrow 2010. interest market participant keep well aware this, publication exact number come surprise. actually, though, exceptional financial injection bank small rest government deficit 2009–10. just expansive credit condition fill 4 bi review 119/2010 coffer good years, unwind unsustainable domestic boom drain coffer much way similar magnitude. a many know, government already take prompt painful step readjust spend tax profile, conspicuously effectively cut public sector pay rates. it keep target set net budgetary save 2009 2010. i recently look closely though multi-year prospect budget. of course said, economy stay close track originally envisaged, deficit would come close 3 per cent 2014. but imf others noted, real economy, price level also interest rate government borrowing, evolve le favorable way. service additional debt relate bank restructure also negative factor. some explicit reprogramming budgetary profile come year clearly necessary soon debt dynamic convincingly convergent. recent movement yield spread government debt – ireland country – readily demonstrate cost result unless international lender remain convince budget go keep convergent path, indeed government commit ensuring. during 1980s ireland pay high price term borrow cost market fear much steep exchange rate depreciation actually occurred. an equilibrium pessimism, economy struggling, investor require risk premium impose additional cost taxpayer, displace could equilibrium self-fulfilling optimism. it important re-set fiscal path ensure virtuous cycle low borrow rate contribute even fast fiscal adjustment low overall cost adjustment society large. while international debate matter large countries, seem question, ireland small financially-stressed sovereigns, national growth best serve ensure public finance convincingly convergent path: impact fund cost confidence surely offset short-term adverse impact domestic demand low net public spending. other recent european example bank impose cost budget there several high profile case europe – iceland latvia conspicuously – see public finance (and economy generally) cripple local bank excess coincide with, close way relate to, contemporary excess relate u mortgage market. these two case provide contrast irish one regard impact bank recapitalisation national budget. a mervyn king remarked, current crisis show extent which, matter global bank life, death – near death experience – local; context impose national budget. a thoroughly document report inquiry there, iceland’s bank make leap scale simply base import fund pump local economy. indeed greatly outgrow local economy (which small, national population le half million persons) heavily involve finance international investment venture iceland-based customers. when bank – middle size international comparison – failed, national authority regard burden meet liability great assumed, rescue restructure entity partial only, much foreign liability covered, matter lead fraught international negotiation, especially authority uk netherlands. bi review 119/2010 5 the iceland case probe limit impact bank system rescue budget. indeed general issue limit scope bailouts come increase international scrutiny academic policymakers try design

country see need public injection fund one form another. in case (such switzerland) main source problem participation bank taint securitisations come us; case national bubble also present. from budget bank but also pressure opposite direction, i.e. budget banks, come fore first time advance economy (though long important dimension bank crisis suffer many develop country 70s, 80 90s). two aspect far central here, one relate pressure fiscally weak sovereign place fund cost home banks; pressure place bank jurisdiction think have, exposure sovereigns. 6 bi review 119/2010 the first problem affect bank lend rate across much europe, evident euro area, effect unrelated currency differentials. the sharp jump sovereign spread first half may, 2010 dramatic illustration degree pressure matter. the tension transmit immediately fully bank fund condition affect cost availability wholesale fund relevant countries. with european council act put place huge commitment public fund – €750 billion, huge

policy stance, gear many month provide adequate liquidity low interest rate consistent override goal low inflation. although market function improve follow actions, spread debt several sovereign widen level exceptionally high historical standard still pass bank interest rate relevant countries, add cost difficulty roll wholesale deposit debt issuance bank relevant countries. a i mention outset, irish bank become heavily dependent foreign fund source height boom. it clearly take time irish banks, like many jurisdictions, readjust fund profile. for example, well know, irish bank face increase liability refinance month. several policy tool available assist process, elg guarantee scheme – i understand shortly formally confirm apply 0–3 month maturity – central bank liquidity resource extent

highly relevant. it’s topical week commission publish legislative proposal mr van rompuy present one month report task force european council. it’s highly relevant since recent development demonstrate urgent necessity improve economic governance stability framework union, particular euro area. indeed, improve governance stability framework euro area, need first understand go wrong previous system risk may occur failure remedied. there broad agreement go wrong. the system able impose discipline necessary monetary union. in particular, mechanism design promote budgetary discipline work expected. first, decision-making process underlie stability growth pact (sgp) prevent excessive deficit emerge and, did, correct quickly enough. second, financial market act deterrent accumulation excessive deficits, discriminate national issuers. a result, combination global financial economic crisis – bad since wwii – accumulation undue imbalance within euro area, result insufficient attention pay

intervene directly security market restore proper functioning. that action stop speculative rout force market participant take short position euro sovereign asset bear losses. the action succeed preserve integrity euro area. bi review 118/2010 3 it would mistake think risk emerge last spring never occur again. unless weakness expose spring definitely addressed, new bout instability may arise. the van rompuy task force mandate produce concrete proposals. those proposal must close loophole institutional construction euro, could leave expose future attacks. this real challenge confront with. any change institutional structure euro start avoid simplify assumption make past. let mention three. the first think market always right able discipline country debts. market make mistake past under-pricing risk, probably over-pricing it, also make mistake future. leave market task discipline budgetary policy induce member state take corrective action illusion economist have. if really want prevent correct imbalances, particular fiscal imbalances, need strong institutional mechanisms, across euro area within countries. this mean rule automatic sanctions. the second mistake think crisis prevent altogether. crisis occur past might occur future, also contagion. we prepare able manage efficiently. the third mistake think easy, “orderly” solution crises. crisis messy, contagious unintended consequences. the ecb develop concrete proposal address issues. they well known, let concise point three main aspects, relate fiscal discipline, macroeconomic surveillance crisis management. let start two general, important points. the first proposal change fundamental nature euro area, particular respect basic allocation responsibility relation budgetary policy, remain hand national authorities. there need single budgetary policy euro area. no need so-called transfer union. however, national budgetary policy conduct framework consistent single currency. we need leap forward governance underlie economic policy conduct member state euro area. we therefore concentrate effort strengthen discipline first foremost euro area country since share common currency, make use provision treaty – notably article 136 – insert treaty precisely member country monetary union require enhance economic governance. whatever decide euro area could conceivably also apply rest union, discussion among 27 member state water necessary euro area. the second point institutional framework strengthen within current treaty, exploit extent possible secondary legislation. there need treaty change achieve large part proposal require put forward. there also time. a i mention previously, doubt raise financial market ability system become resilient need answer quickly. if answer link long uncertain ratification process, doubt spread again. let turn discussion take place far three main build bloc reform. on subject reinforce fiscal governance, first step forward make 7 september, ecofin council endorse new framework eu semester propose commission communication 12 may. good fiscal governance require change national european level. at national level, 4 bi review 118/2010 ecb support establishment national fiscal framework set minimum requirement compliance eu fiscal statistical rule particular would promote independence national fiscal assessment, high-quality standards, medium-term orientation effective coverage general government finances. at eu level, ecb favour strengthen fiscal framework around five follow measures: 1. streamline hence effective procedure assessment fiscal developments; 2. reversal burden proof, make difficult council overturn decision assessment commission. 3. independence collection, verification assessment fiscal data fiscal analysis level commission. 4. emphasis public debt developments, treaty foresees. 5. quasi-automaticity sanction case breach rules, include provision so-called procedural financial sanctions. the commission’s communication 12 may 30 june go far enough ecb’s view two counts: 1. they thus far remain silent independence fiscal assessment independence quality assessment statistical data collection make effective within commission. in particular, would like see procedure currently force dg competition level technical assessment role commissioner college also apply dg ecfin commissioner. a regard statistics, new council regulation july 2010 follow deeds; particular resource devote fiscal data verification eurostat. 2. the commission idea currently table provide little term streamline procedure hence make effective. we see many time past procedure lengthy laborious effective action undertake incentivise enforce member state correction fiscal developments. so far, procedure launch basis notification member states. it could envisage also launch basis assessment forward look assessment commission. have do case greece, many problem could avoid least reduced. on second build block – broad macroeconomic surveillance – see strong need make quantum leap, give large spillover macroeconomic policy one country participate country single currency area. accordingly, ecb propose creation alert mechanism base clear limit set indicator identify unsustainable policy sufficiently early stage. we would also like see put place procedure correction macroeconomic imbalance preventive corrective arm include graduate enforcement step ensure compliance, include sanctions. again, commission idea voice communication 30 june go right direction yet ambitious enough meet long-term requirement efficiently function monetary union. we await new proposal field stand ready contribute actively. let spend word third build block, crisis management. there theory accord good prevention system crisis. it theory, indeed. in practice, crisis occur, even though institutional system underlie surveillance prevention strengthen avoid crises. a i mention earlier, would mistake also irresponsible assume crisis never bi review 118/2010 5 occur again. this would encourage market participant speculate re-occurrence lack proper management framework. a experienced, self-fulfilling expectation could precipitate crisis. the creation efsf ultimately avert financial collapse early may. without system euro would vulnerable speculative attack members, justify economic fundamentals.2 the question create management mechanism avoid crisis without create moral hazard. this new issue. it deal context imf consist attach strong conditions, term structural fiscal policies, financial support provide country difficulty. financial support disburse accord precise milestones, link compliance condition contain programme. there need europe reinvent wheel. we learn experience imf. history show country particularly keen get financial support imf, precisely tough conditions. the proposal put forward ecb go much direction aim create framework manage crisis effectively discourage speculative attack system. the crisis management framework raise another issue, complex deserve reflection. the issue know “private sector involvement” crisis resolution. what mean public money use bail private sector organisation take wrong decisions. this would case money provide crisis management framework use reimburse private sector losses, eliminate risk expose to. this issue consider context imf reform asian crisis. the discussion show difficult design simple mechanism would make restructure mandatory. the reason simple. the solvency state different concept company financial institution. it ultimately depend economic political sustainability achieve sustain give level primary budget surplus stabilise reduce debt. if country commit certain recovery programme justify financial support partners, cannot consider insolvent unable reimburse debts. why case restructure them? on hand, debt restructure make easy, “orderly” – use fashionable term – market participant may consider easy way country might tempt take speculative position would profit case default. in words, restructure mechanism, simple, could lead moral hazard. furthermore, nature market would mean contagion spread immediately countries, participant would start guess country might need undergo restructuring. to sum up, use word recent imf document, today’s advance economy default uuu, “unnecessary, undesirable unlikely”.3 it naïve think thing orderly debt restructure mechanism. what solution then, want avoid moral hazard unduly bail private sector? the best way involve private sector ensure country experience financial difficulty implement credible adjustment programme, convince market invest country. experience show successful programme – “success” measure policy 2 “an economist reflects: a view 2020: the eurozone break-up 2013” morgan stanley research europe, 30 july 2010. 3 cottarelli, forni, gottschalk mauro, “default today’s advance economies: unnecessary, undesirable, unlikely”, imf staff position note 10/12, 1 september 2010. 6 bi review 118/2010 implement – ultimately make possible regain market confidence. it may take time, re-profiling official financial support, end access market regained. if form reschedule re-profiling debt time turn necessary, debt sustainable, achieve orderly way agreement creditor debtors. other form constrain action, creditor debtor side, bind lead litigation produce disorderly effect financial markets. in respect, adoption collective action clause euro area member state would make easy creditor debtor agree fair burden-sharing. this conclusion discussion context imf explore european level. another way prevent market participant bail use fund make available official support mechanism purchase debt secondary market, prevail market discount, rather reimburse mature debt nominal value. in way holder debt instrument will sell would accept market haircut. this possibility envisage ecb’s proposals. to conclude, european union community law, subscribe member state pacta sunt servanda. this refer pacts, start fiscal discipline member state commitment member state pay debts. in view, careful consider exemptions, provide possibility country unilaterally modify value debt contracts. the euro, underlie institutional construction, respect law. if change made, strengthen principle rather provide exemption – dangerous exemption could undermine stability cohesion whole union. thank attention. bi review 118/2010 7 chart 1: tension euro area select intra-euro area spread germany (10y) source:

crisis speech mr lars e o svensson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, second international journal central bank (ijcb) fall conference, tokyo, 17 september 2010. * * * i thank claes berg, marianne nessén, staffan viotti barbro wickman-parak comment speech. the view express necessarily member riks-bank’s executive board riksbank’s staff. gabriela guibourg riksbank’s staff contrib-uted speech. a world economy recover recent financial crisis great recession followed, debate go regard cause behind crisis reduce risk future crises. the role monetary policy relation financial stability also debate argue need modify framework flexible inflation target give great role financial-stability considerations. some blame expansionary monetary policy federal reserve 2001 lay foundation crisis. my view crisis largely cause factor little monetary policy. and main conclusion monetary policy flexible inflation target – apply right way particular use information financial condition relevant forecast inflation resource utilisation horizon – remain best-practice monetary policy before, during, financial crisis. a relate conclusion neither price stability interest-rate policy sufficient achieve financial stability. a separate financial-stability policy needed. in particular, monetary policy financial-stability policy need conceptually distinguished, since different objective different appropriate instruments, even central bank responsibility both1. so today, i first briefly summary view cause crisis, discus possible lesson future monetary policy, finally i shall emphasise distinction monetary policy financial-stability policy. the financial crisis little monetary policy a i see it, financial crisis cause factor little monetary policy. the factor macro conditions; distort incentive financial markets; regulatory supervisory failures; information problems; specific circumstances, u house policy support home ownership low-income households2. regard macro conditions, global imbalance large save relative investment many emerging-market economies, correspond low save relative investment industrialise country – call global save glut investment shortage – lead low real interest rate high asset price (bernanke 2007). low world real interest rate combination great moderation, long period stable growth stable low inflation, lead systematic underestimation risk, low risk premia financial markets, large expansion credit. 1 for detail discussion issues, see svensson (2010, section 5.2). 2 see bean (2009) discussion. 2 bi review 118/2010 distort incentive commercial investment bank increase leverage excessive levels, together lax regulation supervision lack appropriate bank resolution regime, lead fragile financial sector. securitisation reduce incentive exercise due diligence loan origination. it also lead regulatory arbitrage set off-balance-sheet entities, various reason nevertheless remain effect balance sheet. trader fund manager also distort incentive take excessive risk short-sighted asymmetric remuneration contracts. there eventually enormous information problem assess risk extremely complex asset-backed securities, potential correlate systemic risk grossly underestimated. none cause anything monetary policy, except indirectly monetary policy may contribute great moderation. regard role federal reserve’s expansionary monetary policy period precede crisis, opinion divide whether contribute build-up crisis. in view, period question genuine well-motivated fear unite state fall japanese-style deflationary liquidity trap, optimal policy situation expansionary monetary policy3. give empirically limit effect policy rate house prices, tight u monetary policy would require prevent house price boom, deep recession risk u fall deflation liquidity trap4. and tight monetary policy would impact global imbalances, regulatory problems, distort incentive information problem mention (although could end great moderation deep recession deflation). lesson monetary policy what conclusion draw far financial crisis conduct monetary policy need modify framework flexible inflation targeting? one obvious conclusion price stability enough achieve financial stability (carney 2009, white 2006). good flexible inflation target achieve financial stability, anyone ever think did. specific policy instrument need ensure financial stability. another conclusion interest-rate policy enough achieve financial stability. the policy rate ineffective instrument influence financial stability, policy rate high enough noticeable effect credit growth house price strong negative effect inflation resource utilisation, even sector experience speculative activity. the use policy rate prevent unsustainable boom house price credit growth pose major problem timely identification unsustainable development, well assessment whether policy-rate adjustment would noticeable impact development, whether, long run, development inflation resource utilisation would good (bean et al. 2010, kohn 2008, 2009). other instrument like supervision regulation, include appropriate bank resolution regimes, first choice financial stability. prevent financial crisis require improvement supervision financial institutions, also great emphasis supervision financial system whole. a regard regulatory framework, generally, extent financial instability depend specific distortions, good regulation aim attack distortion close source possible. macro- 3 see svensson (2003) discussion policy option liquidity trap. 4 see assenmacher-wesche gerlach (2009), bean (2009), bean et al. (2010), bernanke (2010), dokko et al. (2009), imf (2009). bi review 118/2010 3 prudential regulation contingent business cycle financial indicator may need introduce induce good financial stability. possible macro-prudential regulation include variable capital, margin, equity/loan requirements. however, one important lesson financial crisis financial condition may strong deteriorate effect transmission mechanism, make standard interest-rate policy much le effective. this motivate research incorporate financial condition financial intermediation standard model transmission mechanism use central banks. much progress already make understand effect (see adrian shin 2010, gertler kiyotaki 2010 woodford 2010a). however, even much good analytical foundation concern role financial condition transmission mechanism, course, always, considerable scope application good judgment monetary policy. what “leaning wind”, idea central bank raise interest rate appear warrant inflation resource utilisation counter rapid credit growth rise asset prices? it sometimes entirely clear whether advocate lean wind policy mean credit growth asset price consider target enter explicit implicit loss function alongside inflation resource utilisation. or whether mean credit growth asset price still consider indicators, emphasise merely credit growth asset price may potential negative effect inflation resource utilisation long horizon. in latter case, lean wind way improve stability inflation resource utilisation long run. then completely consistent interpretation flexible inflation targeting. more precisely, flexible inflation target aim stabilise inflation around inflation target resource utilisation around normal level. monetary policy boil “forecast targeting”, choose policy-rate path correspond forecast inflation resource utilisation best stabilise inflation around target resource utilisation around normal level. if central bank us relevant information construct forecasts, include impact change financial condition inflation resource utilisation horizon, monetary policy automatically respond best possible way change financial condition (woodford 2007, 2010a). take financial condition account become special case general rule “filtering information forecast”. only information affect forecast respond to, whereas information affect forecast disregarded. however, suppose that, reason, appropriate effective instrument ensure financial stability available, instance, serious problem regulatory supervisory framework cannot remedied short run. in second-best situation, threat financial stability, one may argue that, extent policy rate impact financial stability, impact take consideration choose policy-rate path best stabilise inflation resource utilisation. such consideration could result low high policy-rate path otherwise, order trade le effective stabilisation inflation resource utilisation financial stability5. however, far evidence indicate normal time 5 such consideration could include evidence “risk-taking channel” borio zhu (2008). adrian shin (forthcoming) adrian shin (2010) argue, model risk-taking channel, short interest-rate movement may considerable effect leverage security broker-dealer market-based financial sector outside commercial-banking sector. if assume risk financial crisis increase leverage increases, policy rate affect leverage, policy rate would affect risk financial crisis (woodford 2010b). however, new regulation likely limit excess leverage limit magnitude affects. the size market-based financial sector may end 4 bi review 118/2010 trade-off unfavourable, sense impact policy rate financial stability quite small impact inflation resource utilisation significantly larger, optimal trade-off would still little impact financial stability. a good financial-stability policy framework necessary ensure financial stability. monetary policy cannot serve substitute. the relation monetary policy financial-stability policy in general, helpful conceptually distinguish financial-stability policy monetary policy. different economic policy policy areas, fiscal policy, monetary policy, labour market policy, etc., distinguish accord objectives, policy instrument suitable achieve objectives, authority authority control instrument responsible achieve objectives. from point view, clear monetary policy financial-stability policy different, understand distinction important. monetary policy, form flexible inflation targeting, objective stabilise inflation around inflation target well resource utilisation around normal level. under normal circumstances, suitable instrument policy rate communication. in time crisis, see current crisis, unconventional method used, fixed-rate lend long maturity asset purchase (quantity easing) affect long interest rate expectation future short rates, foreign-exchange intervention prevent currency appreciation even induce currency depreciation. the authority responsible monetary policy typically central bank. financial-stability policy objective maintain promote financial stability. financial stability define situation financial system fulfil main function submit payments, channel save investment, provide risk share without disturbance significant costs. the available instrument are, normal circumstances, supervision, regulation, financial-stability report analysis lead indicator may provide early warn stability threats. in time crisis, authority may use instrument lend last resort, variable-rate lend long maturity (credit policy, credit easing), special resolution regime financial firm trouble, government lend guarantees, government capital injections, forth. the responsible authority authority vary across countries. in country central bank, country separate financial supervisory authority, sometimes authority share different institutions. financial-stability policy monetary policy conceptually distinct, distinct objective distinct suitable instruments. my point take account consider lesson financial crisis monetary policy. the interest rate blunt unsuitable instrument achieve financial stability thus make little sense assign objective financial stability monetary policy. however, may make sense assign objective financial stability central bank, central bank give control appropriate supervisory regulatory instruments. the fact financial-stability policy monetary policy different mean interaction them. similarly, monetary policy fiscal policy distinct policy impact inflation resource utilisation. the interaction monetary policy financial-stability policy considered. monetary policy affect asset price balance sheet thereby affect financial stability. financial-stability small crisis. in europe, canada nordic countries, commercial bank dominate financial sector. bi review 118/2010 5 policy directly affect financial conditions, affect transmission mechanism monetary policy. this motivate research incorporate financial condition standard model transmission mechanism use central banks. the outcome might well financial condition consider play large role transmission mechanism indicator future inflation resource utilisation. if so, central bank would end respond financial indicators, sense adjust policy rate policy-rate path give change financial indicator. but would mean financial condition indicator would become independent target monetary policy. conclusion my main conclusion crisis regard monetary policy far flexible inflation target – apply right way use information financial condition relevant forecast inflation resource utilisation horizon – remain best-practice monetary policy before, during, financial crisis. but good theoretical, empirical operational understand role financial condition financial intermediation transmission mechanism urgently require need much work, work already underway academia central banks. furthermore, monetary policy cannot guarantee financial stability. a separate financial-stability policy, objective financial stability suitable instrument policy rate, required. reference adrian, tobias, hyun song shin (2010), “financial intermediary monetary

(2002), krugman (1998), posen (1998). 2 see, example, bullard (2010) rogoff (2010). 3 in speech today, i focus japan’s experience burst bubble. see also okina, shirakawa, shiratsuka (2001) discussion cause bubble since late 1980s lesson monetary policy. 4 with regard appropriateness phrase, “lost decade,” see shirakawa (2009). 5 in 2000s, average growth rate recover slightly, stay 1.7 percent 2007

real gdp growth remain negative. on financial system policy front, capital injection undercapitalized financial institution start 1998. the amount inject public fund relative nominal gdp finally reach 2.5 percent japan. compare unite state recent crisis, amount inject public fund small unite states, remain 1.5 percent nominal gdp, capital injection carry much fast unite states. those quick summary macroeconomic condition policy response burst bubble japan. when make use japan’s experience monetary policy studies, i want draw attention follow facts. first, japan experience business cycle expansion contraction three time since low-growth 1990s (chart 5).8 that seem contrary impression phrase “lost decade” japan remain stagnant time since 1990s. whenever sign recovery observe japan, expectation economy would finally escape stagnant condition enter full-fledged recovery rising. base japan’s experience, i attempt draw public attention risk fall false optimism use phrase “false dawn,” saw sign economic recovery advance economy spring 2009.9 second, japan experience sharp drastic economic contraction scale experience failure lehman brothers. look japan’s real gdp trend, large decline record first quarter 1998 −1.9 percent. that decline, however, small many countries, include japan, failure lehman brother fall 2008 (chart 6). even period 1997 1998, japan’s financial crisis severest, level real gdp remain high average level 1989, japan peak bubble period. third, japan show economic growth per worker basis comparable unite state 2000s, although significantly decline 1980s (chart 7). at time, japan deliver weak performance real gdp growth. obviously, difference real gdp growth real gdp growth per worker reflect decline workforce japan.10 in event, analyze japanese economy burst bubble, essential take account change potential growth, determine productivity growth demographic changes. fourth, japan experience deflation, severity contain mild level. consumer price inflation turn negative 1998, 1997 2010 decline −3.3 percent cumulative basis, −0.3 percent annualized basis (chart 8).11 in 6 the interval peak land/housing price first policy rate reduction almost japan unite states. 7 okina shiratsuka (2002) make assessment boj’s monetary policy action burst bubble base taylor rule. 8 in japan, president economic social research institute, cabinet office, decide reference date business cycles, base discussion investigation committee business cycle. 9 see shirakawa (2009). 10 that tendency become evident, compare real gdp growth per man-hour. see hayashi prescott (2002). 11 the late figure japanese cpi july 2010. bi review 118/2010 3 meantime, long-term inflation expectation remain generally unchanged, anchor around 1 percent (chart 9). japan’s deflation since second half 1990s rare experience post-war advance economies, scale price decline far smaller, compare period great depression unite state register cpi decline 24 percent 1930s (chart 10). fifth, japan experience deflation good price also service prices. compare unite states, difference consumer price inflation mainly attribute service price (chart 11). that reflect flexible adjustment nominal wage japan, since service sector basically labor-intensive. sixth, japan experience deflationary spiral. more precisely, japan experience phenomenon burst bubble decline price induce decline economic activity, thereby lead decline prices.12 instead, japan experience long recovery, duration without consider strength, 2002 mild deflation (chart 12). seventh finally, boj introduce various innovative policy measure (chart 13).13 the zero interest rate policy first introduce boj 1999. the “quantitative ease policy,” set target money market operation outstanding amount current account balance central bank expand balance far require reserve levels, also first introduce boj 2001. the boj expand balance sheet size considerably. from 1995 overnight interest rate fell virtually zero, ratio boj’s balance sheet size nominal gdp increase 20 percentage point peak (chart 14). that increase ratio boj twice large u.s. federal reserve (fed), european central bank (ecb), bank england (boe) recent crisis. in addition, level ratio boj still high fed, ecb, boe. a target level current account balance raised, maturity short-term funds-supplying operation become lengthened. in final stage quantitative ease policy, average maturity exceed six months, long one reach eleven months. in addition, experimental policy measure commitment future course monetary policy first introduce boj. under quantitative ease policy, example, boj make commitment continue quantitative ease policy “until core cpi inflation become stably zero above.” the boj also adopt “credit easing” current terminology. the asset purchase include asset-backed security (abss) asset-backed commercial paper (abcps). the boj purchase stock hold financial institution reduce market risk associate stockholdings, one big risk factor potentially destabilize financial system. a i review far, boj introduce various unprecedented measure uncharted circumstance period late 1990s early 2000s. innovative aspect policy measure well recognize time, but, retrospect, measure involve element unconventional policy measure take recent global financial crisis. 12 for example, posen (2010) note japanese deflation remain stable course 1990s rather accelerated. 13 for overview empirical study effect boj’s monetary policy measure 2000s, include quantitative ease policy, see ugai (2007). 4 bi review 118/2010 iii. four similarity economic condition policy response burst bubble base fact japan’s experience burst bubble, i next point four observation common economic condition policy response burst bubble two cases: one u.s. european economy recent crisis japanese economy since 1990s. i also elaborate implication analyze economic condition monetary policy burst bubble. sluggish economic recovery balance-sheet adjustment the first similarity concern fact take fairly long restore full-fledged recovery path burst bubble.14 in japan, 2003 economy go back steady recovery path, thus take ten year since burst bubble. in u.s. european economies, adjustment still continuing, duration adjustment period yet confirmed. however, safely say take time restore full-fledged recovery path. that balance-sheet adjustment produce significant downward pressure economy process resolve various “excesses” accumulate bubble period.15 the form “excesses” vary country country. in japan, “three excesses” business sector: employment, production capacity, debt (chart 15).16 it essential explicitly incorporate adjustment mechanism “excesses” analyze economy burst bubble. a relate issue, crisis frequently argue financial system well-developed capital markets, addition sturdy bank system, robust shock bank-centric financial system, since bank channel capital market channel work complementary manner.17 it seems, however, view need reconsidered. effect dysfunctional interbank money market the second similarity lie fact sharp contraction economic activity burst bubble occur interbank money market become destabilized. in japan, i mention earlier, period 1997 1998 real gdp decline most, fall 1997 interbank money market become destabilize (chart 16).18 in recent global financial crisis, real gdp advance economies, include unite state european countries, register large decline period fourth quarter 2008 first quarter 2009. such massive decline attribute malfunction interbank money markets, trigger failure lehman brothers. the two case common start point interbank market participant default.19 14 see reinhart rogoff (2009), reinhart reinhart (2010) detail discussion recovery pattern crises. 15 nakakuki, otani, shiratsuka (2004) make quantitative assessment effect structural adjustment economic growth japan. 16 for issue “three excesses,” see 2003-05 issue boj’s outlook economic activity prices. 17 see greenspan (1999). 18 the failure medium-sized sanyo security 1997 lead first default interbank money market postwar period japan. that trigger sudden liquidity contraction interbank money markets, immediately spill wide-range financial markets. 19 see nakaso (2001) detail japan’s financial crisis boj’s role lender last resort. when sanyo security failed, default one billion yen interbank money market occurred. bi review 118/2010 5 give serious adverse effect failure medium-sized sanyo security interbank money markets, time subsequent large failure yamaichi securities, boj commit provide unlimited amount liquidity, thereby enable orderly resolution.20 such policy response stave global financial crisis start japan.21 a series observations, i mentioned, show ensure fund liquidity one important prerequisite achieve stable economic activity, and, end, crucial stave malfunction interbank money markets. in addition, i emphasize importance differentiate two thing analyze economy burst bubble: phase “acute pains” arise malfunction interbank money market phase “chronic illnesses” balance-sheet adjustments. weaken credit channel the third similarity find fact transmission channel conventional monetary policy, explain standard textbooks, seem work well burst bubble. a typical example find credit channel. in japan, growth bank lend decelerate rapidly burst bubble, continue remain stagnant long time (chart 17). the growth bank lend finally turn positive 2005. look unite state european countries, growth bank lend still continue decline, pace decline much fast japan burst bubble. in addition, expansion monetary base induce increase money supply bank lend (chart 18). before outbreak recent global financial crisis, quantitative ease frequently propose measure deflation. nevertheless, hardly observe fact massive expansion central bank balance sheet result increase inflation advance economies.22 such fact suggest conventional monetary policy become substantially constrain economic circumstance zero interest rate on-going balance-sheet adjustments. the effectiveness unconventional policy measure dysfunctional financial system the fourth similarity relate fact various unconventional measure take central bank crisis produce significant effect stabilize financial system, thus contribute minimize economic downturn.23 in particular, unconventional measure effective situation overall function financial although default amount relatively small, market participant become suddenly cautious counterparty risk. 20 due policy actions, liability own yamaichi security replace boj. of course, international spillover shock could occurred, complex securitization scheme extensively use time. 21 yamaichi security play important role one four big security company japan actively conduct overseas businesses. due massive off-the-book liabilities, so-called stock shuffle (loss compensation), yamaichi’s fund become increasingly tight home abroad. yamaichi finally decide go voluntary closure security business november 1997. when yamaichi failed, boj extend uncollateralized lend order support orderly wind-down transactions, turn irrecoverable conclusion yamaichi’s bankruptcy procedure january 2005. 22 posen (2009), use inflation data g7 countries, note period excessive monetary growth lead sustain rise inflation early mid-1970s. 23 bernanke (2009) emphasize point. 6 bi review 118/2010 system, include credit markets, deteriorate due malfunction interbank money markets. the success measure essentially due central banks’ undertake counterparty risk credit risk. such central banks’ risk-taking certainly crucial phase “acute pains.” thus, examine effectiveness monetary policy, broadly central bank policy general, crucial make clear distinction phase “acute pains” phase “chronic illnesses.” iv. thing remember interpret japan’s experience so far i discuss common factor economic condition burst bubble. at time, exist factor peculiar japan’s experience. in monetary policy studies, need interpret japan’s experience consideration differences. difference phase adopt unconventional measure first, need take account difference phase adopt unconventional measures. in malfunction interbank money markets, unconventional measure prove effective japan’s experience well global financial crisis time.24 the real issue whether unconventional measures, especially quantitative ease credit easing, effective phase “chronic illnesses” crisis subsides. empirical study japan mostly show quantitative ease produce significant effect stabilize financial system, limit effect stimulate economic activity prices. such empirical analysis unite state unite kingdom seem yet available moment.25 but seem difficult differentiate effect conventional interest rate channel unconventional measures. that unconventional measure introduce phase “acute pains” considerably high nominal interest rate credit spread japan. by contrast, japan virtually face zero low bind nominal interest rate second half 1995, thus stimulative effect conventional interest rate channel exhaust introduction zero interest rate policy february 1999. the effect demographic change productivity decline second, need consider development supply side potential growth rate. a standard macroeconomic theory emphasizes, long-term growth determine labor force growth productivity growth. in japan, labor force growth peak mid-1970s, decelerate thereafter, turn negative mid-1990s (chart 19). when assess factor behind long-lasting economic stagnation one two decades, important focus analysis real side economy.26 24 see ugai (2007) comprehensive survey empirical study effect quantitative ease policy japan. see also, example, gagnon et al. (2010) joyce et al. (2010) empirical study recent experience unite state unite kingdom, respectively. bean et al. (2010) also provide broad review monetary policy response recent global financial crisis. 25 ugai (2007) conclude effect expand monetary base alter composition boj’s balance sheet, any, generally small stem policy commitment. 26 hayashi prescott (2002) argue growth theory, treat economic productivity exogenous, account well japanese lose decade, call analysis policy change allow productivity grow rapidly. see also rogoff (2010). bi review 118/2010 7 such decline potential growth rate, associate downward revision public expectation future growth rate, seem produce downward pressure prices.27 in fact, exist significantly positive correlation potential growth rate long-term expectation inflation japan, contrast advance country (chart 20). several interpretation possible observation. for example, consider decline potential growth rate induce persistent significant decline natural rate interest, thus make difficult monetary policy produce sufficient ease effects. alternatively, economic growth expectation revise downward, reflect decline potential growth rate, subsequent increase discount present value future net tax burden debt-repayment burden private sector likely restrain private expenditure. difference labor practice third, also need pay attention difference labor practice. japan’s labor practice general feature dismissal regular worker relatively difficult, compare u.s. labor practice. a result, labor cost regular worker entail nature quasi-fixed costs. under circumstances, firm incentive cover fix cost low sale prices. price decline early stage post-bubble period partly explain mechanism.28 a disinflation progressed, japan tend set wage flexible manner. such flexibility wage set attain reduction bonus payment increase number non-regular workers, also downward revision fix compensation regular worker (chart 21). a mention earlier, compare unite states, price decline japan attribute mostly decline service prices. that reflect flexible downward revision nominal wages. the propensity consume japan’s household sector increase even deflation, partly owe fact price decline drive unstorable service price (chart 22).29 the difference labor practice one factor behind observation deflation severe japan among major countries, never turn deflationary spiral. although ultimately labor practice determine endogenously, need incorporate difference labor practice analyze short- medium-term development deflation. development external demand fourth, need take account increase external demand one drive force behind japan’s recovery (chart 23). a i mention earlier, japanese economy need resolution “three excesses” business sector restore full-fledged recovery path. in addition, recovery japanese economy also attribute increase external demand since 2003, support high growth global economy global credit bubble well depreciation japanese yen. under current circumstances, advance economy need gain momentum recovery without rely “external” demand, since many economy affect burst bubble. 27 see kimura et al. (2010) fujiwara, hirose, shintani (2008). 28 see kuroda yamamoto (2005). 29 the increase trend propensity consume also influence age population. 8 bi review 118/2010 in sense, need analysis consider difference recovery mechanism burst bubble, depend whether one country experience bubble many country world experience bubble. v. future research challenge to conclude speech today, i touch upon challenge monetary policy study base experience financial crisis.30 that said, fully aware many issue already raise various occasions. i thus focus relevant, often miss item research agenda relate conventional unconventional monetary policies. speak conventional monetary policy, i stress importance deepen understand effectiveness aggressive policy rate reduction burst bubble. before burst bubble time, majority view aggressive policy rate reduction enable u stave sharp serious economic contraction.31 such optimistic view challenge severe economic contraction recent global financial crisis. such aggressive policy rate reduction certainly need mitigate economic downturn. still, need recognize fact extremely low interest rate environment. first, short-term nominal interest rate come extraordinarily low level, smooth function interbank money market undermine margin financial institution also reduced. a result, incentive extend loan financial institution weakened, result diminish monetary ease effects.32 second, protract low interest rate play important role prevent economic downturn, but, time, tend delay adjustment excess accumulate period bubble expansion. in addition, also tend delay rejuvenation businesses.33 third, expectation continuation low interest rate considerable period future necessary condition bubble. a bubble emerge easy monetary policy alone, and, time, emerge without expectation continuation easy monetary policy. in event, productivity trend burst bubble one key factor define macroeconomic performance. if shock hit economy huge, temporary, natural rate interest decline much, policy commitment continue low interest rate produce certain ease effect intertemporal substitutions. but, otherwise, policy commitment cannot effective enough. the comment i make deny necessity aggressive policy rate reduction burst bubble all. my main point need pay attention effect financial market dynamic cause behavioral economics element market participants. let turn another line research i think important, is, unconventional monetary policy. a i discuss earlier, unconventional monetary policy highly effective “acute pains” recent financial crisis. we invent various unconventional policy 30 for importance revisit philosophy behind central bank policy independence central bank democratic society, monetary policy making, see shirakawa (2010a, b). 31 see greenspan (2002), mishkin (2007). 32 see bernanke (2010), boe (2009). 33 bi (2010) point possibility. see also rajan (2010). bi review 118/2010 9 measure necessity. nevertheless, difficult say reliable theoretical basis policy. we choice “think running” formulate unconventional policy measures. in sense, i impression translation accumulate “tacit knowledge” within central bank practice.34 central bank thus need make effort transform “tacit knowledge” “explicit knowledge.” through experience recent crisis, i fully recognize liquidity counterparty risk two important concept conduct study unconventional monetary policy. in recent crisis, various unconventional measures, dollar funds-supplying operation outright purchase cps, produce substantial effects. that suggest necessity deepen understand liquidity counterparty risks. in particular, need explore essential condition smooth function financial markets, especially short-term money market foreign exchange markets, consideration behavioral characteristic market participant market microstructure. we thus need make use study various activity central banking, range daily operation system design money market operations, payment settlement systems, financial regulation. in closing, i sure discussion conference constructive meaningful. thank you. 34 for example, saito, suzuki, yamada (2010) show market able create collateral asset (relatively safe bonds) crisis endogenously use model country-specific catastrophic shock share two country presence solvency constraints. they discus possibility endogenous creation collateral asset crisis interpret central bank intervention crisis. 10 bi review 118/2010 bi review 118/2010 11 12 bi review 118/2010 bi review 118/2010 13 14 bi review 118/2010 bi

anything else i want welcome colleague oxford university, undertake important mission albania region: contribute growth research capacity, sapience, build sustain long-term response growth challenge come common ways, similar unique, towards european union. it great pleasure bank albania opportunity begin series study domestic regional economic policy, assist scientific debate economic growth model, also back regional point view social, economic political level. you may ask yourself, bank albania much interest economic growth economic policy overall, main target central bank stability prices. in follow minute i shall try deal main point bank albania’s agenda recent years. in respect, efficiency monetary policy, importance internal external economic anchors, build research capacity purpose implement policies, well public communication education. the right address issue indispensable monetary policy crucial role economic prosperity. the successful central banks, whose main target inflation, increasingly give importance economic activity, also indicator real economy. this trend base fact inflation directly impact fluctuation economic activity unemployment short-run, also theory monetary economics, accordingly central bank pay attention potential economic growth long run well. in addition, argument economic growth key target economic policies. therefore, decision central bank file monetary policy, supervision financial stability, interact harmonise central target, thus guarantee macroeconomic financial stability country. the central bank, respect, try policies, neither increase short-term volatility economic activity, impede potential economic growth long run. the monetary policy bank albania policy similar policy implement european central bank; base two pillars: first monetary analysis, second economic analysis. the second pillar considerable importance inflation’s performance, particularly long-run. inflation, general, monetary phenomenon such, depend considerably money supply pace latter increase relative gross domestic product. the right tie exist variable impose growth monetary supply long-term fast growth economic activity, thus central bank monetary policy lead inflation. 2 bi review 117/2010 have maintain price stability financial stability main priorities, bank albania determine make endeavour encourage play active role convergence

remain one main instrument shall provide sustainable performance economic financial activity home. for strategy successful, must include one substantial constituent philosophy priority western balkan regional development. this need derive upon competition requirement achieve economy scale, also upon common target european integration. during recent years, i continuously highlight key successful integration european union regional cooperation. there many reason back conclusion model growth must see complementary competitive each-other. it indispensable complete process structural reform take place quickly coordinate way, precede membership european union. only way whole region converge naturally, avoid episode misbalances within bosom european family upon membership. this real contribution long-term sustainability european developments. the whole region go political, economic social consolidation process. the policy-makers, decision-makers, examiner almost everybody declare priority adherence european union. the question ask if:  either converge towards european economic zone small fragment economic structure compete european market opportunities,  embrace model:  gain economy scale,  encourage exploit advantage current competitive positions;  grow economic prosperity whole region individual economy? personally i think second alternative contemporary approach region embrace hesitation. the success process shall depend attempt devotion see competitive advantage build right bi review 117/2010 3 economic, financial, legal physical infrastructure use increase

coordinate financial reforms, risk lose open trade financial system underpin economic miracle recent times. 1 j. dimon, chairman ceo, jp morgan chase & company, testimony u.s. financial crisis inquiry commission, 13 january 2010. 2 bi review 117/2010 the role financial sector before analyse impact reforms, allow discus briefly role financial sector fail crisis. by translate save productive investment, finance central economic growth. it three core functions. first, payment system, facilitate decentralize exchange, fundamental function market economy. second, finance transform maturity asset liabilities, take short-term liabilities, deposits, transform long-term assets, mortgage corporate loans. household business therefore reverse, hold short-term asset longer-term liabilities. this help plan future manage risk arise uncertainty cash flows. the social value maturity transformation unquestioned, performance create fundamental risks, require public intervention.2 third, financial system intermediate credit, channel fund saver investors. this allow saver diversify risk everyone smooth consumption time across state world. young family borrow buy house; student pay university. people invest retirement business finance work capital investment. however, risk persistently mispriced, save investment misallocated economic welfare reduced. the crisis financial service supply combination bank markets. in recent years, market grow point become important alternative bank corporate household finance. more traditional function bank – include maturity transformation credit intermediation – conduct broad range intermediary investment vehicles, collectively refer “shadow banking” system.3 all country participate trends, vary degrees. from financial system perspective, deepen market generally welcome make system robust increase competition. however, market expand choice low price available financial consumers, function differently banks. unlike banks, market rely completely confidence liquidity. to maintain confidence, market need clear rule robust infrastructure. in response increase competitive pressure markets, bank employ three strategies: increase leverage, great use securitization, write deep out-of-the-money options. though recognise time, increase risk system. by borrow short-term wholesale market fund asset growth, bank become dependent continuous access liquidity money capital markets. by use securitization diversify fund source reduce credit risks, bank create new exposures. the sever relationship originator risk holder low underwrite monitor standards. in addition, transfer risk frequently 2 to manage fundamental risk create maturity mismatch, bank rely two crucial supports: deposit insurance central bank lender last resort solvent illiquid institutions. bank implicitly accept social contract give access liquidity support time stress return regulation behaviour times. 3 shadow bank include investment banks, mortgage brokers, finance companies, structure investment vehicles, hedge funds, private asset pools. bi review 117/2010 3 incomplete, bank retain large quantity supposedly risk-free leverage super senior tranche structure products. these exposure compound rapid expansion bank over-the-counter derivative products. in essence, bank write series large out-of-the-money option market credit default swaps.4 a credit standard deteriorated, tail risk embed strategy become fatter. with price risk management lag reality, widespread misallocation capital. the magnitude development remarkable. in final year boom, complacency liquidity reach zenith, scale shadow bank activity exploded. the value structure investment vehicles, example, triple three year 2007. credit default swap grow sixfold. financial institutions, include many banks, come rely high level liquidity markets. short-term money market predominant source finance one-third increase gross leverage u.s. investment banks, u.k. banks, european banks. the system’s exposure market confidence enormous. through this, mirage form relentlessly expand profitability financial sector. in unite states, 2000 2006, corporate profit sector average 36 per cent total profits. it appear briefly finance ruler, rather servant of, real economy. the large loss costly bailouts require repair balance sheet shatter illusion.5 the shortcoming regulation similarly exposed. the shadow bank system supported, regulated, monitor fashion conventional bank system, despite fact equal size eve crisis.6 there also major flaw regulation supervision bank themselves. basel ii feed procyclicalities, underestimate risks, permit excess leverage. gallingly, day go under, every bank fail (or save state) report capital exceed basel ii standard wide margin. most fundamentally, global financial crisis reveal fallacy composition strong individual financial institution collectively ensure safety soundness system whole. even vigilant, microprudential regulatory regime overwhelm systemic risks. a consequence, policy-makers recognise systemic risk product resiliency financial institutions, robustness systemically important markets, interconnectedness institution markets. the g-20 reform agenda the g-20 initiate extensive program reform design improve safety robustness global financial system. the measure mutually reinforcing, necessary. 4 see a. haldane, “the contribution financial sector – miracle mirage?” speech deliver future finance conference, london, 14 july 2010. 5 it question mislead data profitability. the basic shortcoming financial growth account also plague compensation structures. employee pay cash positive net present value long-tailed risks. 6 z. pozsar, t. adrian, a. ashcraft, h. boesky, ”shadow

in particular, keep market continuously open require policy infrastructure reinforce private generation liquidity normal time facilitate central bank support time crisis. the cornerstone clear settlement process risk-reducing elements, particularly central clear counterparties “ccps” repos otc derivatives. properly risk-proofed ccps act firewall propagation default shock across major market participants. through centralise clearing, authority also require use through-the-cycle margins, would reduce liquidity spiral contribution boom-bust cycles.7 reduce interconnectedness institution market the second g-20 imperative create system withstand failure single financial institution. from bear stearns hypo real estate lehman brothers, market fail test. today, series extraordinary, necessary, measure keep system functioning, awash moral hazard. if leave unchecked, distort private behaviour inflate public costs. a consequence, firm conviction among policy-makers loss incur future crisis must bear institution themselves. this mean management, shareholders, creditors, rather taxpayers. measure expose fully firm ultimate sanction market also reduce interconnectedness institutions. in addition change market infrastructure, priority include: staged-intervention regulatory regimes, “living wills” banks, good cross-border resolution regimes. another promise avenue embed contingent capital feature debt prefer share issue financial institutions. contingent capital security convert capital financial institution serious trouble, thereby replenish capital without use taxpayer funds. contingent conversion could embed future new issue senior unsecured debt subordinate security create broad bail-in approach. it presence would also discipline management, since common shareholder would incented act prudently avoid stake dilute conversion. overall, bank canada belief contingent capital reduce moral hazard increase efficiency bank capital structures. we correspondingly welcome basel committee’s recent public consultation paper topic. improve resiliency financial institution the third priority improve resiliency financial institution themselves. create resilient institution require good capital, improve balance sheet liquidity, enhance risk management.8 this past weekend’s basel iii agreement deliver objective by: 7 market resiliency also improve good more-readily available information. this reduce information asymmetry, facilitate valuation process and, hence, support market efficiency stability. in regard, priority expansion use trade repository otc derivative market substantial enhancement continuous disclosure standard securitization. 8 the crisis also underscore need good capture counterparty exposures, market risk, host contingent claims. bi review 117/2010 5  create global standard liquidity.  raise substantially quantity, quality, consistency, transparency tier 1 capital base.  introduce leverage ratio complement basel ii risk-based framework. the leverage ratio is, effect, safety harness design protect risk regulator think low which, fact, not.  introduce capital conservation buff minimum capital requirement ensure bank supervisor take prompt corrective action bank absorb loss period financial economic stress. this conservation buff complement countercyclical buffer, would vary time. it maximum period credit grow rapidly system-wide risk rising. in time stress, buff would reduce ensure flow credit undermine regulatory constraints. the goal make financial system le vulnerable boom bust crisis le frequent le severe. through evidence-based analysis, policy-makers determine package reform maximise net economic benefits. it issue i turn. the benefit reform the potential economic benefit strong capital liquidity standard significant. these benefit emerge variety sources:  high capital liquidity standard contribute low incidence financial crises.  the severity financial crisis could also reduced.  the economy benefit smooth economic cycles.  high standard help reduce risk resource misallocated. to put magnitude potential gain context, consider closely cost financial crises. in 10 year follow financial crisis, median output growth rate decrease 1 per cent, unemployment rate increase 5 percentage points.9 experience suggest cost build well future. in study release last month, basel committee find median cumulative loss past financial crisis 63 per cent national gdp. give scale potential losses, clearly large benefit reduce frequency crisis (chart 2). the extensive analysis basel committee suggest high capital liquidity standard would that. in particular, combination strengthen liquidity standard 2-percentage-point increase bank capital ratio would raise annual expect level gdp 1.8 per cent relative trend. 9 see c. reinhart v. reinhart, “after fall”, forthcoming macroeconomic policy: post-crisis risk ahead, federal reserve bank kansa city economic policy symposium, jackson hole, wyoming, 26–28 august 2010. 6 bi review 117/2010 because improve performance accrue time, gift keep giving. use conservative real discount rate 5 per cent, cumulative present value good performance equivalent 35 per cent gdp, €0.9 trillion germany.10 some canada argue sound financial system imply potential gain small country g-20 reform are, therefore, unimportant. this misguided. in open economy germany’s, reduce incidence foreign crisis even important domestic benefits. today’s reality one deep interconnectedness, financial problem region spill rapidly own. in increasingly multi-polar economy, simply cannot afford lurch crisis crisis every five years. to reduce frequency, need strong, universally apply framework. the basel iii rules, combine fsb imf’s review processes, potential that. cost reform despite clear benefits, strong prudential standard also impose costs. bank follow several strategy meet regulatory demand high capital requirements. most obviously, could raise additional capital public markets. if give sufficient time, could generate capital internally retain earnings. in addition, could pas cost high standard customer high interest spread increase fee income. finally, could shed, slow growth, assets. past experience suggest bank use combination methods.11 however, conservative, basel report assume bank would recoup cost high capital liquidity requirement entirely high lend spreads. the long-term estimate increase lend spread use input variety model ass impact output. by combine strengthen liquidity standard 2-percentage-point increase bank capital ratios, expect output growth, relative trend, reduce 0.25 per cent average country analyse (0.30 per cent canada). in present-value terms, equate 5 per cent gdp. together long-run costs, also cost incur transition period. the basel study estimate sophisticate approach use wide range models.12 the result group 1.1 per cent cumulative reduction gdp four-year transition period (in present value). a conservative estimate net benefit net long-run benefit le frequent financial crisis long-run transition cost yield average net benefit g-20 economy 30 per cent gdp present-value terms, €10 trillion (table 1).13 10 the bank canada estimate equivalent figure canada would 1.1 per cent 20 per cent gdp. 11 the long transition period is, important internal generation earn be. 12 it necessary make number assumption analysis. for example, typically assume monetary policy would respond mitigate effect stringent bank capital liquidity requirements. it also important include spillover effect occur across borders, magnify impact output. 13 assume 2-percentage-point increase capital (plus liquidity changes). for canada, estimate approximately 13 per cent gdp present-value terms, equal can$200 billion (tables 2 3). bi review 117/2010 7 this estimate conservative. the analysis understate benefit new rule err side overstate costs. this bias reflect several key assumptions. first, bank assume fully pas cost high capital liquidity requirement borrower rather reduce current return shareholders’ equity operate expenses, compensation, adjust new rules. consider alternative. if bank reduce personnel expense 10 per cent (equal 5 per cent reduction operate expenses), could low spread amount would completely offset impact 2-percentage-point increase capital requirements. second, high capital liquidity requirement assume permanent effect lend spreads, hence level economic output. no allowance make possibility household firm may find cheap alternative source financing. third, discount rate use calculate net benefit twice current real interest rate longer-run real growth rate canadian german economies. finally, benefit quantify gain gdp result reduce probability future financial crises. other benefit financial reform substantial however, variety potential benefit high capital liquidity standard broad range g-20 reforms. first, variability economic cycle reduce host macroprudential measures. analysis bank canada basel group suggest modest dampen output volatility achieve basel iii proposals, high capital liquidity allow bank smooth supply credit cycle. for instance, 2-percentage-point rise capital ratio low standard deviation output 3 per cent. a much significant impact expect macroprudential instrument consideration. these include vary loan-to-value credit term mortgage markets, adopt through-the-cycle margining core fund markets, introduction countercyclical capital buffers. the bank canada model potential impact time-varying buff translate gain reduce volatility domestic consumption gdp. the preliminary find suggest potential gain range 4 per cent 6 per cent gdp present-value terms. in words, countercyclical buff alone could increase net benefit reform 20 per cent. it reasonable expect similar result countries.14 second, range initiative consideration reduce moral hazard, include new framework effective resolution banks, intensive supervision key institutions, introduction contingent capital, creation robust infrastructure. adoption measure reinforce ability basel iii standard reduce probability crisis thereby increase net benefits. 14 see c. meh k. moran, “the role bank capital propagation shocks”, journal economic dynamic control 34: 555–76 (2010); i. christensen, c. meh, k. moran, “bank leverage regulation macroeconomic dynamics”, forthcoming bank canada work paper (2010); a. dib, “banks, credit market frictions, business cycles”, forthcoming bank canada work paper (2010). 8 bi review 117/2010 third, totality g-20 reform potential shift balance resiliency competition. by create system robust failure single firm, reform could increase competitive intensity financial service sector, attendant benefits. a financial sector le volatile, le prone debilitate crises, robust face adverse shock likely view favourably investor attract investment need continue expand sustainable manner. by reduce moral hazard, incumbent also enjoy few oligopolistic privilege behind regulatory barrier entry. great competition commonly lead innovative diverse strategies, would promote resiliency system. great competition safe bank may also contribute low expect return equity (roe) financial institutions. this, turn, could help offset cost increase net benefit discuss earlier. these gain competition could considerable. the financial service sector earn 50 per cent high return equity economy-wide average. if great competition lead one-percentage-point decline roe (through decline spreads), estimate cost one-percentage point increase capital would completely offset. conclusion the fundamental objective reform create system efficiently support economic growth provide financial consumer choice. the system must robust shocks, dampening, rather amplifying, effect real economy. it also support sensible innovation. the system need stable bank robust markets, since play central role financing, and, properly structured, support other. this mean ensure individual financial institution strong le systemically important, option liquidity available state world, new measure promote competition. a fully risk-proofed system neither attainable desirable. the point pile much capital institution never hear again, either source instability growth. the challenge get balance resiliency efficiency right. the basel iii agreement accomplish objectives. moreover, careful analysis indicate economic case reform compelling. most fundamentally, successful implementation g-20 agenda increase

carney: restore faith international monetary system remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, spruce meadow change fortune round table, calgary, alberta,10 september 2010. * * * introduction we three year global financial crisis, dynamic still dominate economic outlook. in particular, broad force bank, household, sovereign deleveraging expect add variability temper pace global economic growth year ahead. this would true even policy optimal; globally, case. one reason function current international monetary system. it promote enormous build-up debt precede crisis could complicate necessary process balance-sheet repair wake. it foster deflationary risk major advance economy asset-price inflation emerge markets. for country like canada, outlook policy environment remain unusually challenging. it context international monetary system re-examined. the question whether change system change policy consistent current system. i argue today miracle cure. faith required, barbarous relic utopian global central bank. rather, country must restore faith adjustment process current system. both g-20 framework financial reform necessary restore trust. the international monetary system crisis the international monetary system consist (i) exchange rate arrangements; (ii) capital flows; (iii) collection institutions, rules, convention govern operation. these core element supplement two important ways. domestic monetary policy framework essential component global system. the international monetary system also closely relate international financial system, comprise financial market institutions, rules, regulation govern them. the international monetary system increasingly unstable hybrid fix float regimes. follow breakdown bretton woods, general move market-based system increase number country adopt float exchange rate steadily liberalize capital accounts. capital flow exploded, rise three time fast rate growth trade past three decades. in contrast, aftermath asian crisis, range emerge market become increasingly active manager exchange rates. a by-product, foreign exchange reserve build well beyond prudential levels, country become important player several key asset markets. the combination official asset private flow create huge gross international asset positions, important implication function international monetary system.1 this make internationally coordinate financial supervision 1 m. obstfeld, “expanding gross asset position international monetary system,” remark deliver federal reserve bank kansa city symposium

non-reserve currencies. well-functioning market clear rule engagement robust infrastructure. that cannot say current system. it convention best describe occasional observance article agreement international monetary fund (imf). it governance diffuse ineffective. the imf effectively without power sanction, informal governance mechanism g-7 increasingly lose legitimacy global economic power transformed. moreover, event last year expose frailty international financial system. a number global bank woefully under-capitalised; participant assume market would liquid state world; incentive problem lead dramatic underprice risks. it clear that, run-up crisis, financial regulation neither well-conceived well-coordinated. implementation uneven peer review non-existent. when crisis hit, liquidity become concentrate handful market one currency. in wake large, negative spillover experienced, change clearly required. this need doubly important unprecedented structural change global economy strain international monetary system itself. the integration one-third humanity today’s global economy dwarf shock experience canada unite state emerge turn last century (chart 1). the global economy rapidly become multi-polar. emerging-market economy main driver commodity prices, represent almost one-half growth import past decade, currently account two-thirds global growth.2 any monetary system would fragile face large, positive forces. there cause concern current system repeat failure predecessors. history show international system dominate fix exchange rate seldom cope well major structural change.3 this failure result two pervasive problems: downward rigidity nominal price wage asymmetric adjustment process. in short run, generally much le costly, economically well politically, country balance payment surplus maintain accumulate reserve deficit country sustain deficits. country deficit must either run reserve deflate currencies. the limit reserve accumulation surplus country ultimate impact domestic prices. depend openness financial system degree sterilization, impact delay long time. such case recent year (table 1). indeed, give scale economic miracle, remarkable currency brics appreciate 5 per cent real term g-7 past decade (chart 2). another lesson history major country pursue policy perceive self-interest. export-oriented growth strategies, support part undervalue currencies, prove effective catalyst recent decades. country generally reluctant adjust even long demand need rebalanced desire self-insure sated. there are, however, deep cause inertia today’s emerging-market economy (emes). governance problem international 2 bank canada calculations. 3 see m. carney, “the evolution international monetary system,” speech foreign policy

legitimate concern resiliency global financial system slow financial liberalisation. emerge market also somewhat slow realise that, grow importance, delay adjustment become self-defeating. give economic importance emerge markets, policy decision material stability international monetary system, therefore strong, sustainable balance global growth. in end, excessive reserve accumulation represent fallacy composition. these effort secure stability one country collectively reduce stability system.4 the flip side large current account surplus large current account deficit several advance economies, notably unite states. the combination expansionary u.s. monetary fiscal policy follow 2001 recession high save rate east asia generate significant global imbalances, massive capital flows, “conundrum” low, long-term interest rates. these low, risk-free rates, turn, feed search yield excessive leverage across system. the deregulation house consumer finance reinforce secular decline private savings. vulnerability grow combination macro imbalance micro fail risk management, supervision, financial regulation. policy-makers advance economy slow recognise address loom risks. the overall result period increasingly unbalance growth, without real financial signal necessary promote timely orderly economic adjustment. three year ago, pressure become overwhelming. financial system advance economy seize up; virtually every financial asset world repriced; private demand advance economy collapsed. the policy response crash unprecedented ease fiscal monetary policy. this buy time necessary adjustments. but durable solution require rebalancing global supply demand, happen without change function international monetary financial systems. the challenge ahead without successful completion g-20 reforms, current recovery risk. structural change global economy eventually yield important adjustment real exchange rates. these would effectively achieve movement nominal exchange rates, allow relative wage price adjust quickly symmetrically restore external balance. however, lack confidence international monetary financial systems, country resist nominal adjustments. a result, real exchange rate adjustment likely occur change general wage prices. the implication asset prices, output, employment could considerable. already, inflationary pressure rise emerge economy (chart 3). give divergent growth inflation prospects, monetary policy suitable unite state may appropriate country (chart 4). however, country relatively fix exchange rate relatively open capital account act though is. if divergence optimal monetary policy stance persists, exist strain system grow. in major advance economies, deflationary pressure emerging. give fiscal constraint scale balance-sheet repair necessary, economy 4 obstfeld, 2010. 4 bi review 116/2010 diminish ability expand domestic demand. external competitiveness need rebuild change nominal exchange rate or, fail low domestic wage prices. the dynamic perhaps stark peripheral europe first option available. the current frustration adjustment surplus countries, perpetuated, risk create similar dynamic global scale. history suggest process could take years, repress global output welfare interim. against difficult dynamics, major economy lock larry summer term “the balance financial terror.”5 reserve highly concentrate holder (the top five country hold roughly 50 per cent) currency (two-thirds u.s. dollars). reserve accumulator trade exchange rate stability exposure large capital loss dollar depreciate. they confer exorbitant privilege low finance cost unite states, principal supplier reserve currency. the unite state face risk support suddenly withdrawn, trigger sharp adjustment. all aware decisions, actual perceived, sovereign disproportionate, disruptive impact range asset price and, ultimately, global output. what done? first, maintain open global financial system incredibly important. sovereign borrow need business investment requirement considerable. it would sheer incompetence move world save glut one capital starved. one tail risk present possible repeat great

institution rule support cross-border finance thus essential. second, new reserve asset required. over long term, possible envision system reserve currency addition u.s. dollar. however, alternative

generally, alternative dollar reserve currency would materially improve function system. while reserve alternative would increase pressure unite state adjust, since “artificial” demand asset would share others, incentive surplus country thwart adjustment would change. the common lesson gold standard, bretton wood system, current hybrid system adjustment mechanism, choice reserve asset ultimately matters. there silver bullet; constellation policy across major economic area required. the answer question i pose outset change current system, rather change policy consistent it. change policy require country change macro policy country agree series financial reforms. the g-20 framework globally coherent policy with burden squarely policy dialogue cooperation, g-20 assume central

fiscal, financial, structural policies. there several reason process potential encourage action across range countries. there clear timetable. a comprehensive set policy consideration. policy-makers high level directly involved, support international financial institutions. finally, discussion take place g-20, major economy present china assume constructive leadership role. a often case, first

the area best prospect success financial reforms. 9 sdrs could catalyze change facilitate desire reserve diversification. establish enhance substitution account imf, temporary basis, would allow large

fundamental asymmetry adjustment process. thus, would appear essential substitution account mark transition current hybrid system international system characterize flexible exchange rate systemic countries. 6 bi review 116/2010 give scale international asset positions, progress financial reform essential. these also proceed focus three core issues:  improve resiliency institution (raising quality level capital);  build robust market (improving infrastructure enhance transparency); and,  reduce interconnectedness institution (macroprudential management systemic risk). in regard, interim measure already taken. most notably, china’s recent decision enhance flexibility exchange rate welcome full implementation would contribute strong, sustainable, balance global economic growth. european country take measure consolidate fiscal position conduct stress test banks. the oversight board basel committee release broad detail agreement new definition bank capital liquidity. with

over time, fsb potential become fourth pillar bretton wood system. it expertise broad membership yield comprehensive integrate global financial regulations. this essential ensure ongoing cross border

expectation new normal – public perspective speech mr durmuş yılmaz, governor central bank republic turkey, active academy 8th international finance summit, istanbul, 8 december 2010. * * * distinguish participant esteem guests, before start speech, i would like thank director staff active academy effort organize 8th international finance summit. the turkish economy, achieve strong macroeconomic fundamental sound financial system thank steadfast implementation structural reform since 2001, one economy exit crisis rapidly. in upcoming period, new economic conjuncture need manage wisely order sustain macroeconomic stability. therefore, today i would like devote speech entirely macroeconomic stability. distinguish participants, the recovery observe aftermath crisis continue albeit slow gradual. however, downside risk pertain future global growth outlook persist. vulnerability continue especially develop country experience serious deterioration budget balance excessive rise public debts. perception grow accommodative fiscal policy expansionary monetary policy adopt country fall short achieve desire result unemployment growth. meanwhile, develop countries, strong financial structures, enjoy fast recovery process. the decouple observe two group country expect continue upcoming period well. global liquidity increase significantly central bank develop countries, ease policy rate rapidly, adopt quantitative ease policies. recently, capital flow develop country turkey accelerate owe expectation short-term interest rate develop country would remain low extend period, decouple growth performance country increase risk appetite. in face grow capital flows, develop country introduce measure prevent capital inflows. however, past experience country show restrict capital inflow really effective term volume capital inflow partially effective term type incoming capital. in words, due reason financial innovation integration markets, possible effectively prevent capital flows, unless fully controlled. the current conjuncture conducive benefit wisely capital flow implement policy would reinforce financial stability enhance financial depth. in respect, financial stability report, prepare central bank republic turkey make public yesterday, important policy text delineate strategy implement upcoming period maintain reinforce financial stability turkey. therefore, i suggest report examine detail. the policy framework, report outline detail, four pillars. one main pillar policy implementation respect encourage economic unit borrow le use equity capital (in word low leverage ratios). recent implementation increase require reserve ratios, termination remuneration require reserves, sustain fiscal discipline public sector underline bi review 174/2010 1 revise medium-term program, increase resource utilization support fund deduction impose consumer loans, introduction limitation loan/value ratio mortgages, 12-percent target banks’ capital adequacy ratio deter measure excessive rise indebtedness ratios. secondly, extension maturity regard borrow economic unit encouraged. under aegis undersecretariat treasury, study extension maturity public borrow carry successfully. an important development the bank regulation supervision agency permit issuance turkish lira bond extend maturity liability bank sector. additionally, central bank decrease overnight borrow 400 basis point last month enable short-term swap interest rate go required. besides, central bank aim encourage long-term deposit new arrangement make require reserves. the third pillar policy framework encourage borrow term turkish currency strengthen net foreign exchange position. to end, undersecretariat treasury orient towards borrow tl; fx-denominated domestic debt stock push gradually central bank accelerate reserve accumulation time elevate capital inflows, flexible foreign exchange buy auctions. reason implementation float exchange rate regime, progress make term attain price stability decrease tl interest rate facilitate wide use turkish lira economy oppose foreign currency. moreover, measure like set high require reserve ratio foreign exchange turkish lira permit household use fx-denominated fx-indexed loan encourage private sector borrow turkish lira. the foreign exchange net general position arrangement bank sector allow issuance tl bond bank control manner also consider context. the fourth last pillar policy framework promote risk management concept. in respect, step take regard financial train assume importance smooth function system. we welcome effort towards increase recognition turkish derivative exchange, diversify product widespread use forward transactions. in addition, believe float exchange rate regime implementation since 2001 significantly contribute embed awareness exchange rate risk. in short, give current conjuncture, avoidance excessive borrow public private sector; preference long maturity borrowings, opt borrow tl much possible manage risk efficiently considerably strengthen resilience turkish economy external shocks. the monetary policy adopt central bank compose way make price stability financial stability complementary. in context, i would like evaluate cbrt use policy tool upcoming period within framework possible scenario provide inflation reports. a also demonstrate slide, current conjuncture support cbrt’s stance keep policy rate constant time, low level long period. on hand, development aggregate demand composition necessitate instrument policy rate bring pre-crisis levels. in respect, largely complete exit strategy measure announce april 2010. 2 bi review 174/2010 in october inflation report, state baseline scenario base outlook domestic demand strong compare previous report period, external demand continue restrain economic activity, thus aggregate demand condition continue support disinflation, albeit less degree. this baseline scenario assume policy framework measure outline exit strategy complete end year, policy rate keep constant current level time follow limit increase start last quarter 2011, policy rate stay single digit throughout forecast horizon (in words, 3 years). in respect, non-interest instrument actively use order address risk financial stability stem rapid credit expansion deterioration current account balance. the european central bank reluctantly join rank federal reserve, bank england bank japan engage monetary expansion due fast-growing debt problem europe. a result, materialization first scenario become likely, illustrate right-hand part chart. in case, scenario describe inflation report october 2009 might come agenda. accord scenario, account expansionary fiscal monetary policy worldwide scale, couple rise risk appetite relative improvement credit risk across emerge market include turkey, capital inflow country continue hold strong. the low level resource utilization well strong tendency cost shocks, reduce price import inputs, reflect upon consumer price suggest downside risk inflation short term. materialization scenario could lead temporarily low policy rate envisage baseline scenario use macroprudential instrument direction tighten order cut pace credit growth tandem temporary rate cuts. the second scenario illustrate chart share public inflation report october 2010. both recent economic development europe decision take bi review 174/2010 3 4 bi review 174/2010 central bank develop country increase global economic uncertainty significantly. should measure take global level cause long-term high-rated increase food commodity prices, increase lead deterioration price set behavior, turn, hamper achieve medium-term inflation targets, earlier-than envisage tighten baseline scenario would considered. in case, domestic credit expansion would weaken, use macroprudential instrument might need direction tightening. if measure take develop country remain inadequate, third scenario illustrate low left-hand part chart might considered. in case, indicate late inflation report, global economy face longer-than-anticipated period anemic growth, monetary tighten envisage start final quarter 2011 baseline scenario might postponed. moreover, outcome, whereby global economic problem intensify contribute contraction domestic economic activity, may trigger second round easing. in case, use macroprudential instrument might need direction tightening, domestic credit expansion weaken. distinguish guests, i would like underscore central bank, primary objective achieve maintain price stability, stipulate article 4 cbrt law, responsible “taking precaution enhance stability financial system take regulatory measure respect money foreign exchange markets”. therefore, continue act due diligence term financial stability upcoming period well. however, central bank entity charge financial stability. other public authority ministry finance, undersecretariat treasury, capital market board turkey, primarily bank regulation supervision agency, also significant authority policy instrument regard. it essential period go through, policy instrument hand deploy coordinate manner establishment sound stable financial structure. to close remarks, i would like thank everyone contribute organization event. emmanuel tumusiime-mutebile: farewell party 2010 retire

imbalance straddle many today’s important global public policy issues. these include architecture international monetary system, future international trade system design international financial system. these high stakes. this paper assemble fact past global imbalances. more speculatively, also ass factor shape course imbalance future. those medium-term force suggest imbalance may get bad get better. if so, global financial fault-line could cause tremor international monetary, trade financial system period ahead, like currently experiencing. global imbalance – past global imbalance natural by-product free trade goods, service capital. in others words, capital flow necessary ingredient trade capital liberalisation. in sense, good cholesterol. but capital flow may also demonstrate imbalance demand output economy, must eventually correct debt wealth stock become unsustainable. sharp correction rate domestic absorption and/or capital flow could result, attendant output costs. in sense, global imbalance may also bad cholesterol.1 so capital flow today? historical evidence illuminating. chart 1 plot (the absolute value of) current account balance thirteen countries, % gdp, since 1880. other wartime, global imbalance high well century. they surpass level prevail classical gold standard twice level bretton wood period (chart 2). for individual countries, capital flow look large still, absolutely relative historical norm (chart 3). it size global flow unusual. so direction. contrary theory, capital flow develop country low capital stock, towards develop country high capital stock (lucas (1990)). in words, capital flow “uphill”, away country marginal product capital high towards country low. this make pattern global capital flow doubly perplexing. 1 blanchard milesi-ferretti (2009) discus cause “good” “bad” imbalances. bi review 174/2010 1 perplex need mean bad. current account imbalance arithmetic difference gross capital inflow outflows. a gross flow increase result financial liberalisation, natural expect difference become volatile (obstfeld (2010)). a chart 4 shows, growth gross capital flow 2 bi review 174/2010 year precede crisis dramatic. at start 1980s, gross capital flow around 5% world gdp. by 2007, rise 7 time that. this growth capital flow imbalance mirror path external balance sheet major economies. these, too, adjust rapidly. in 1985, u net external creditor. by 2009, become net external debtor tune around 20% gdp. in 1999, china net external debtor. by 2008, become net external creditor around one third gdp. an interest perspective driver imbalance provide look gross save investment behaviour surplus deficit country period. chart 5 look patterns. it suggest couple strike patterns. first, correlation save investment rate appear weaken significantly past two decades, surplus deficit countries. this consistent increase capital mobility. historically, high correlation national save investment rate – feldstein-horioka (1980) puzzle. chart 6 plot felstein-horioka correlation coefficient alongside index financial liberalisation obstfeld taylor (2004). between 1930 1980, feldstein-horioka coefficient close one – puzzlingly high co-movement save investment. but pattern shift significantly past 30 years. save investment correlation long puzzlingly strong. indeed, ahead crisis, saving/investment correlation fall around zero. they presently low level almost century. on face it, might point toward rather benign interpretation rise global imbalances: may simply mirror image rise capital liberalisation. this would good cholesterol story. even then, however, may risk associate intermediate large global flow funds. gross flow matter. a experience 2008 illustrate (chart 4), sharp reversal gross flow disrupt function financial systems, particular bank system reliant overseas funding. large inflow may also cause indigestion problem small domestic capital markets. the strong upward pressure asset price number emerge market economy past month testament that. a chart 5 also shows, rise global flow past decade account change save rate deficit surplus countries, rather investment rates. in words, differential save behaviour prime mover behind rise global imbalances. it unsurprising, then, save behaviour lie heart current debate among policymakers academic cause imbalances. this, too, need bad news. for example, differential save may simply mirror fundamentals, reflect difference rate time preference among consumer differential rate technological progress among companies. equally, possible conceive explanation differential save le well-rooted fundamentals, lax monetary policy west mercantilist trade policy east.2 these latter explanation take u close bad cholesterol story global imbalances. this much current debate global imbalance centred. be result surplus country save excessively – “savings glut” explanation (bernanke (2005))? or instead deficit country save little – “savings shortage” explanation (taylor (2007)). put differently, problem impatience west excessive patience east? 2 this lead global co-ordination (or adding-up) problem, country seek individually run current account surplus, depress global demand (king (2010)). bi review 174/2010 3 global imbalance – present to begin answer questions, consider recent save behaviour two archetypical surplus deficit country – china us. chart 7 look respective contribution china u global save since 1980. in 1980, u contribute around quarter global saving. today, contribute around tenth. china mirror image. have contribute le 5% 1980, today china single large source global saving, contribute around one fifth. it argue trend could simply reflect different cultural attitude towards save among u chinese citizens. in us, often say culture spend rather save – neurologically, impatience gene may dominant (haldane (2010)). in china, contrast, culture may bias towards save rather spending, patience gene dominant. in words, difference agents’ rate time preference, degree patience, might account save imbalance (buiter (1981)). 4 bi review 174/2010 but recent survey time preference 45 country suggest cultural difference full story (wang, rieger hen (2010)). ask choose payoff month large payoff next month, 68% u student choose wait; exhibit patience. face trade-off, 62% chinese student make choice. these difference small.3 they also “wrong way around” explain imbalances. so cultural factor explanation, is? chart 8 9 plot national save rate china us, break sectoral basis. there strike difference save behaviour across government, household corporate sector two countries. around two-thirds rise chinese save since early 1990s derive corporate sector.4 this reflect two things. first, rapidly rise corporate profitability, backdrop strong growth rise productivity (ma yi (2010)). since 2000, profit among chinese industrial company rise around 30% per year. second, significantly still, profit retain within chinese company rather distribute shareholder (qiao song (2009)). these difference us/chinese corporate save behaviour show dramatically dividend payouts. the average dividend payout ratio among u corporation 2009 40%, le quarter company fail pay dividend. the average dividend payout ratio among list chinese corporation 2009 around 18%. among these, half pay dividend whatsoever. 3 among 45 countries, germany rank patient (almost 90% student waited), nigeria least patient (less 10%). 4 use firm-level data, bayoumi, tong wei (2010) argue chinese list firms’ corporate save rate neither especially high compare list firm country gross save rate typical list chinese firm declined, albeit insignificantly, 2002–2007. bi review 174/2010 5 chart 10 11 consider distribution change dividend payout ratio among global chinese companies. among global companies, payout ratio rarely fall. more half time increase. impatient investor demand immediate dividend gratification, lead large rise distributions. this dividend ratchet puzzle empirical finance (black (1976)). if anything, one grow time. the payout pattern among chinese quote firm could different. increase decrease payout ratio roughly evenly split. the high proportion “unchanged” payout ratio simply reflect zero payout policy half quote chinese companies. there distribution ratchet. profit largely plough back. in respect, chinese payout behaviour today dissimilar among u company rapid growth phase 19th century (chart 12). there one explanation behaviour among chinese firms. a benign interpretation reflect high option value chinese company retain fund give future growth prospects, u firm 19th century. a le benign interpretation reflect absence external source company finance shortfall corporate governance, insufficient discipline company outside investors. in practice, factor likely important recent years. turn u chinese households, century household gross save fraction gdp average le 5% us. in china, average around 20%. in china, constancy high household save rate mask two striking, broadly offsetting, factors: 10 percentage point fall household’s income share; 10 percentage point rise household’s save propensity (ma yi (2010)). much rise save propensity appear precautionary. face “three mountains” future – education, pension health care – chinese consumer take high (saving) road. in us, fall household financial balance correlate strongly path household net worth (mckelvey (2010), chart 13). this correlation emerge strongly 1980s, simultaneous rise net wealth fall saving. this correlation remain strong net worth reverse recently due fall house equity prices. what lie behind movements? lax monetary policy suggest (taylor (2007)). financial liberalisation second plausible candidate. this effect loosen constraint supply house credit thereby boost house demand price us. it also enable household mobilise withdraw accrue equity property finance spending. estimate house equity withdrawal spend rise 2% personal disposable income 2000 around 4% peak 2005 (greenspan kennedy (2007), chart 14). micro-level data support story. they show home equity withdrawal drive primarily household low credit score high credit card utilisation rates, likely credit-constrained past (mian sufi (2009)). a constraint loosened, spend rise save fell. liberalisation feed impatience. these pattern also consistent inequality-based explanation low save (rajan (2010)). rise inequality may generate increase desire “keep jones’s”. that, turn, may lead high borrowing, low net saving, poor. and apply within country appear also apply across them. among advance countries, significant negative relationship within-country measure inequality current account position (chart 15). rise inequality, low save rate among poor, appear deficit-inducing. rise imbalance may important social, well economic, roots. 6 bi review 174/2010 bi review 174/2010 7 8 bi review 174/2010 global imbalance – future so key force drive global imbalance period ahead? judge recent past, two factor important:  global financial integration;  differential save behaviour. consider turn likely evolution. global financial integration. in period ahead, shape number medium-term structural factors. one key factor cross-country gdp convergence. over time, would expect countries’ income level converge, currently low income country catch-up high income trade neighbour (solow (1956)). this convergence process well-established empirical phenomenon (barro (1991) mankiw, romer weil (1992)). accompany gdp convergence likely catch-up gross external balance sheet positions. a country develop, integration global capital markets, high level gross external asset liabilities. cross-country evidence bear out. there well-defined empirical relationship country’s gdp per head gross external balance sheet position (chart 16). bi review 174/2010 9 take together, two factor imply pattern steadily rise gross capital flow time, growth strong among country catch high-income trade neighbours. it possible calibrate integration trend project forward simulate future external balance sheet position among major economies. these simulation take initial condition cross-country gdp per capita, project forward use calibrate rate growth convergence draw previous empirical study adjust know future change population growth. this give set cross-country projection gdp per capita. these translate gross external balance sheet position use historical relationship per caput gdp. chart 17 plot projection (the average of) gross external asset liability relative gdp g7 countries, china, india, brazil russia. these projection go 2050. among g7 economies, external balance sheet ratio broadly flat around twice nominal gdp. this flatness drive large part assumption, assume highest-income country maintain flat ratio external asset gdp. this almost certainly extreme assumption. although small past, remain strong home bias investment portfolio develop countries’ institutional investor (obstfeld rogoff (2000) imf (2010)). a liberalisation progresses, bias would expect unwind, boost gross external asset relation gdp develop countries. for reason, calibration think limit case likely adjustment pattern global capital flows. subject important caveat, growth non-g7 economies’ contribution global capital market still striking. among brics, external balance sheet fraction gdp exceed g7 level around 2035. by 2050, around 2.5 time nominal gdp. these pattern even strike express share global external assets. by 2050, half g20 external asset associate brics, around 9% currently (chart 18). among non-g7, non-bric g20 countries, share treble 5% around 15%. within this, countries’ share global asset sky-rocket. china’s share global finance rise around 30% 2050, roughly entire g7. india rise almost 20%, le 0.5% currently (chart 19). the u share fall 28% around 12%. the flow counterpart external stock position le dramatic (chart 20). by 2020, gross capital flow non-g7 country project exceed g7 economies. by 2030, non-g7 flow three time g7 flows. and 2040, almost four time g7 flows. even calibration represent extreme case, indicative strike power shift pattern global financial flows. if path even broadly followed, would implication scale global imbalances, tend rise gross capital flow outpace gdp growth. it would implication financial stability, scale gross capital surge (fuelling bubbles) reversal (fuelling crises) increases. and may also implication dollar’s reserve currency status. differential save behaviour. consider next possible future path save behaviour across world’s major economies. there likely many factor affect cross-country save rate period ahead. predict fraught uncertainty. but one key medium-term determinant save demographic (wilson ahmed (2010)). and demographic trend something little uncertainty period ahead. 10 bi review 174/2010 bi review 174/2010 11 chart 21 look project change fraction adult age range 40 59 develop emerge country – “prime savings” cohort. it suggest sharp bifurcation demographic trend develop emerge economies. among advance countries, age population result decline middle-aged share, peak today almost 30% around 25% 2050. for develop economy reverse true, continue rise fraction middle-aged individual 20% today around 25% 2050. cross-country correlation suggest relationship prime-saving cohort save behaviour. chart 22 suggest every 1 percentage point rise middle-aged population share raise national save rate around 1.75 percentage points.5 take together emerge population trends, suggest potentially important life-cycle pressure global pattern save period ahead. to bring pressure life, chart 23 project save rate selection country 2050 base population gdp projections. this plainly gross over-simplification. these projection take account whole host factor may push direction, include late retirement date may boost save country age population, fall save rate emerge country social safety net widened. but base demographic convergence trend alone, save rate brics, already high, project continue ascent. for example, india lead increase save around 10 percentage point gdp, raise save ratio 50% 2050, demographic push large fraction population high save cohort. among develop countries, meanwhile, trend reverse demography-induced fall save rates. 5 see also evidence wilson ahmed (2010). 12 bi review 174/2010 give rise income share bric countries, pattern even dramatic consider country share future global savings. china rise represent around 40% global save 2050. over period, u share global save continue descent, stabilise around 5%. on face it, partial equilibrium projection future save rate suggest medium-term pressure global imbalance could intensify, save rate rise among surplus country fall deficit countries. to bring intuition life, assume simplicity’s sake investment rate fraction gdp remain fix 2010 level across countries, save rate evolve chart 23. the result would treble global imbalance current elevate level next twenty years. of course, projection look marginal impact imbalance medium-term demographic gdp trends. they take account host factor may defuse pressure imbalances, include adjustment real exchange rates, low investment ratio marginal product capital reduce emerge market fall save rate emerge market social safety net widen deepened. these offset factor need significant, however, counterbalance medium-term upward pressure global imbalance demographic convergence. conclusion so leave us? with potentially dramatic change future international financial landscape. with

sheet risk introductory remark mr thomas jordan, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 16 december 2010. * * * in follow remarks, i address two issue depth. i start detail set instrument swiss national bank (snb) disposal prevention financial crises. i take look risk balance sheet. macroprudential instrument snb more three year pass since outbreak international financial crisis. the crisis make two thing clear. first, capital liquidity buff financial system far low. second, systemic risk grossly underestimate prior crisis even identified. almost nobody suspect risk closely interlinked, problem small segment u mortgage market could rock global financial system world economy. in order make financial system resilient, one thing need do strengthen capital liquidity buffers. significant progress already make regard approval basel iii new “too big fail” (tbtf) regulations. these measure help ease problem connection tbtf issue significantly. but crisis future, too. that equally important identify build-up risk financial system early stage take countercyclical measure mitigate them. it area – refer macroprudential policy – still major deficiencies. the national bank statutory mandate contribute stability financial system. in function lender last resort, snb play key role manage financial crises. it provide emergency liquidity assistance bank run difficulties, thus prevent negative impact bank’s default could bank sector economy. this remedial measure prove highly effective crisis. however, emergency liquidity assistance provide exceptional cases, create false incentive bank entail considerable financial risk snb. in order national bank fulfil mandate, imperative also able take preventative action future. this way snb guard effectively future crises. preventative action possible national bank efficient effective instrument disposal. however, currently glare deficiency area. up now, precautionary measure snb could employ issue warning. yet experience show warn alone enough. before crisis, national bank repeatedly draw attention high leverage big bank warn ability absorb loss adequate. these caveat result voluntary change behaviour. for reason, essential set preventative instrument financial stability improve three areas; namely, improve access information, close involvement regulatory procedure regard financial stability issues, direct macroprudential decision-making powers. i would like take close look these. first, crucial necessary information quickly hand order identify build-up risk financial system early stage. while snb’s statutory authority compile statistical data necessary helpful, late crisis clearly demonstrate national bank must able request additional information. with i mean, example, quantitative, non-standardised data banks’ risk exposure. bi review 173/2010 1 unlike finma, switzerland’s financial market supervisory authority, snb’s stance primarily macroeconomic systemic one. this must able act independently certain situation gather information. at time, also want keep access information absolute minimum avoid duplication activity finma. second, clarification snb’s participation right obligation need area regulation essential financial stability. in order give appropriate consideration financial stability aspects, feel snb involve regulatory procedure early stage. in words, conceptual phase. the authority responsible issue financial market regulation should, therefore, oblige consult snb early process. thirdly, national bank must clearly define decision-making power regard regulation either bear direct relation monetary policy emergency liquidity assistance. i would like take two current regulatory proposal explain clearly i mean: countercyclical capital buff implementation tbtf regulations. the countercyclical capital buff represent capital requirement adjust time. this buff introduce within framework basel iii important task protect bank sector risk pose excessive lend curb bank sector’s procyclical behaviour. in event excessive growth lending, capital requirement increased; growth lend weak, low even reduce zero. the countercyclical capital buff thus direct impact banks’ lend activity can, result, strengthen weaken effect snb’s monetary policy significantly. therefore, whoever determine level buff also influence effect monetary policy. it reason – opinion – responsibility countercyclical capital buff domestic lend must lie snb. the national bank must able decide buff activate high be. it go without say would within legally define limits. the also apply activation loan-to-value ratio affordability criterion mortgage loans. all instrument closely link monetary policy. within context implementation tbtf regulations, systemically important bank determined. this rigorous capital liquidity requirement intend banks. and emergency liquidity assistance also reserve systemically important banks, decision systemic importance bank direct impact snb function lender last resort. these decision-making powers, too, must therefore place national bank’s hands. this propose solution give snb formal responsibility need order fulfil mandate area financial stability preventative manner. in many countries, transfer bank supervision central bank currently subject intensive discussion. in contrast, national bank mean call question separation bank supervision central bank activity solution present here. this separation work switzerland. the aim infringe finma’s jurisdiction. instead, finma snb need clearly define new responsibility task arise urgent need rigorous analysis regulation systemic risk divide them. at point, i also want stress macroprudential task call question snb’s primary mandate, maintenance price stability. instead, support long-term fulfilment mandate. the snb also express opinion – along line proposal – recommendation make business audit commission national council council state report financial crisis. 2 bi review 173/2010 snb balance sheet risk in follow remarks, i would like look snb’s balance sheet risks. a chairman govern board, philipp hildebrand, already mentioned, primarily large-scale purchase foreign currency contribute expansion balance sheet current level approximately chf 280 billion. of amount, chf 260 billion make currency reserves, comprise foreign exchange, also gold imf’s special draw rights. if add snb’s loan stabilisation fund, 95% asset denominate foreign currency. not balance sheet long result, also carry risk. without doubt, exchange rate risk significant risk. while fluctuation annual earn run billion also occur past, likely even pronounce future owe great size balance sheet. in context, i would like point two factor particular. first, experience show loss foreign currency position decline time. on one hand, strong currency fluctuation often follow corrections, since market tend overreact, other, interest dividend payment help reduce loss foreign currency investments. second, snb has, long time now, place great deal value robust balance sheet. establish mechanism steady build-up provision smooth profit distribution help build equity capital buff years, make possible u carry losses. owe largely foresighted approach, level equity capital balance sheet is, international standards, still average, spite current size. a gratify reduction balance sheet risk achieve 2010 stabilisation fund. give market situation improve considerably year, hold usd 3 billion sell number derivative position closed. in addition, interest payment repayment investment amount approximately usd 3 billion. overall, snb’s loan stabfund end november 2010 roughly usd 13 billion, compare almost usd 20 billion end 2009. at time, overall risk snb decrease usd 24 billion usd 16 billion. this usd 16 billion correspond maximum possible loan. this upper limit exceed current loan, since part stabfund’s portfolio require finance present. owe continue favourable market situation fourth quarter, value fund’s asset considerably high value loan. the risk snb suffer loss upon liquidate fund thus decrease further. a long maintain high level foreign exchange reserve monetary policy reasons, currency risk balance sheet easy reduce. we have, however, take two measure effort strengthen balance sheet further. first, decide back 2009 double annual allocation provision course five years. second, recent months, reduce risk concentration currency hold borrower category – arise intervention – diversification. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, discus great depth. a previously mentioned, high level risk evidence great fluctuation snb’s annual earnings. it early say whether eventually affect distribution profit confederation cantons. there need action stage. the profit distribution agreement federal department finance snb set clearly define threshold value review. the current agreement – run end 2017 – review late regard distribution 2013 financial year. should distribution reserve, build last years, deplete then, agreement call immediate review. bi review 173/2010 3 4 bi review 173/2010 it currently early say anything definite outcome review. see current perspective, would come surprise, however, annual distribution reduce somewhat. we repeatedly emphasise annual distribution chf 2.5 billion cannot guarantee long term. ardian fullani: macrofinancial stability eu candidate country potential candidate country – lesson learn speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, high-level policy workshop macro-prudential policy, frankfurt main, 14 december 2010. * * * dear colleagues, it pleasure discus experience crisis share think relevant lesson future. my perspective issue focus case albania; emerge market economy import crisis financial market channel interconnectedness. the challenge pose eastern european economy decision maker mostly nature, policy response differ accord economic structures, institutional difference degree freedom enjoy them. let briefly preview three main message speech. the first one conflict price stability financial system stability long run – instead, mutually re-enforce resilience economy external internal shocks. from central bank’s point view, corollary macro-prudential measure take enhance financial stability investment medium long term price stability. i believe conclusion amply bear albania’s recent experience. my second message global even regional financial market require global least regional supervision crisis resolution mechanisms. just problem originate particular sector economy escalate general macroeconomic imbalances, financial market imbalance one financial institution one country disrupt financial institution countries. collaboration home-host supervisor therefore must, i would argue probably do regard. my third message concern role anchor design implementation macro-prudential policies. monetary policy make credible clear focus transparent measure price stability (cpi inflation) turn increase accountability central bank pursue ultimately operational flexibility. financial stability inherently difficult concept, even theoretical level, i think do quantify term unify understanding. this would allow transparent communication increase public support central bank’s action. i expand issues. 1. price stability macro-prudential measure a panoramic glance experience central eastern european economy late crisis would indicate broad range outcomes. while might look normal first view, worth remember cee country share quite commonality economic financial structures. furthermore, hit type external shock, exactly time. one thus fair approximation control experiment role macroeconomic policy crisis. at risk generalize much, i would say cee economy share broadly development model problems. we benefit large capital inflow mainly form fdi, remittance cross-border loans. western european bank penetrate financial system, increase financial intermediation facilitate capital inflows. this bi review 173/2010 1 process result fast credit economic growth base consumption lead model. while inflation generally control financial imbalance vulnerability increasing, form rapid growth real estate price balance sheet exposure liquidity foreign currencies. our economy hit crisis since first week october 2008. the fear contagion enhance sharp decrease market value eu bank group operate region. it affect negatively public trust system, result widespread deposit withdrawals. later, financial crisis progress transform global economic recession, effect extend real economy exchange rate depreciation. most country region face rapid liquidity shortage cause deposit run, low remittance fdi outflows. the balance sheet across region suffer liquidity problem exchange rate depreciation. this negatively reflect consumption investment, deteriorate financial stability outlook possibility balance sheet deflation economic contraction mutually support vicious spiral. the ability economy absorb shock however different. the natural instinct macroeconomic policy face contraction scenario engage countercyclical measure form expansionary monetary fiscal policies. however, presence financial stability concern equation significantly change equation. we safely argue country experience least macroeconomic financial imbalance one good place pursue countercyclical policy fact one emerge fast effect crisis. i believe albania country:  we bank failure public injection capital;  we contain reverse confidence crisis financial system adverse effects. in fact, experience financial disintermediation;  we continue grow, albeit slow pace;  we manage keep inflation expectation anchored. therefore, i share think measure throughout period. to conclude topic i briefly summarize personal lesson crisis. before crisis, bank albania concern possible financial threat accumulate year fast financial intermediation. to illustrate point: credit growth go non-tradable sector, service construction account expansion. at time, 70 percent total credit foreign currency euro make big share outstanding stock. the tune period entire region. the overall impression financial innovation reduce risk abundant global liquidity create optimistic picture. despite truth this, pace financial intermediation grow annually frenetically high. in particular two main aspect financial intermediation particularly trouble opinion. first, economic agent create financial excess use mostly financial system. while meet needs, financial system align match agents’ position accord length maturity liquidity. this hold true assumption claim obligation fulfil timely manner order. otherwise violate assumption end overlap financial system might become unstable. our concern many gap open fast albanian economy seem experience sort latter come name risk-taking channel. second, appear general mispricing risk bank sector. high concentration particular sector client indicate undue risk analysis risk management banks, lend 2 bi review 173/2010 un-hedged borrower flexible exchange rate regime seem potential moral hazard issue. we address first issue increase information share facilitate dialogue monetary policy financial stability supervision bank. normally, foresight monetary policy trough pick business cycle mandate smooth fluctuation economy prices. however, duration financial gap excess might different usually much longer. therefore monetary policy design potential forget financial stability; therefore potentially miss important information regard effect decision make monetary policy could sustainability agent’s budgets. that i believe important guardian financial stability monetary policy decision make process. with reason bring director supervision director financial stability monetary policy advisory committee. in respect monetary policy focus discussion macro effect also discussion micro effect decision making. this result policy coordination within central bank. i believe first line defense philosophy. this help u strike correct balance policies. the second issue address tighten macro-prudential regulation policy strengthen on-site supervision banks. through regulatory supervisory interventions, aim improve commercial bank’s governance transparency, strengthen risk assessment risk mitigation strategies, improve capital adequacy liquidity ratios, well reduce exposure credit risk stem un-hedged borrower foreign currency predatory practice commercial banks. on line, policy response crisis cautious, prioritize financial stability preservation inflation expectation outright economic stimulus. by begin first quarter 2009, financial panic, liquidity problem especially foreign currency, slowdown eu economic area financial stress eu bank system affect real financial sector albanian economy. credit slow considerably, exchange rate start depreciate, forecast economic growth inflation down. in mean time deposit withdrawal continue liquidity concern become prominent. bank albania provide ample liquidity domestic currency interbank market tighten supervision bank increase collaboration home supervisors. a specific feature need mention timely increase deposit insurance scheme. this move mark turn point confidence crisis public bank system liquidity problem system. from narrow perspective center main objective price stability, focus monetary policy would expansionary action. however, consideration external balance economy, financial stability need anchor expectations, constrain decisions. i elaborate briefly factors. face contain upward pressure inflation, central bank focus attention determinant factor financial stability. by refrain pursue expansionary monetary policy, central bank exacerbate pressure exchange rate would put additional strain un-hedged borrower bank’s balance sheets. furthermore, interest rate cut potential affect deposit withdrawal cause liquidity problem depreciation. at time two main concern financial stability. the albanian economy however receive macroeconomic stimulus form fiscal expansion. this countercyclical policy make possible previous work do consolidate fiscal position anchor macroeconomic policy public expectations. albania approach crisis sustainable fiscal position term deficit public debt, create room maneuver fiscal expansion support economy bi review 173/2010 3 monetary policy could intervene. therefore first lesson crisis authority would follow countercyclical policies, permit bold action time crisis. what lesson future? i think i already mention first one. the second lesson, relate price financial stability, equally important. price financial stability conflict long run. central banker never forget fiat money base way life prosperity, social contract, base society’s trust every bill honor creator money, case central bank. this trust one important pillar guaranty economic system entire society. in opinion, even short run, central bank well equip pursue two goal instrument disposal: main policy rate refinance operation; macro-prudential policy systemic level; and, careful diligent micro supervision commercial banks. have two goal least two instrument allow optimal mix policies, least theory. in practice, indicate experience, central bank shy lean wing order discourage least contain financial imbalances. furthermore, every time face fundamental economic problem potentially negative systemic implications, revert financial stability. i firmly believe first important job central bank ensure integrity money bank system. 2. joint supervision crisis response mechanism build bridge continuous communication local bank managers, home supervisor headquarter mother institution prove critical deal problem get hand. while communication advice frequently used, make good use beyond mere courtesy. we acknowledge financial development follow certain pattern. financial institution like business adopt market strategy stick strategy markets. what mean u new product develop test markets, follow pattern market market well. in year precede crisis, financial institution start practice lend exotic currencies, offer low interest rate without economic relation borrower activity. be aware developments, previous communication central bank region, alert spot first sign behavior economy. therefore first sign credits, discuss management bank stop administratively lend currency un-hedged borrowers. on systemic level, i believe recent experience highlight issue need look carefully future. i highlight three them.  the policy facilitate capital inflow economy region follow action could provide need liquidity flow reverse stopped. country region benefit swap agreement similar arrangement would allow u access short term liquidity. one certainly say normal time could resolve group level. however, didn’t necessarily prove case recent experience. because financial system inter-connected, i think issue deserve attention future.  a crucial step alleviate financial crisis cee country vienna initiative, stabilize balance sheet big bank group operate region trust public them. i think facility need permanent, least case global european potential financial 4 bi review 173/2010  financial regulation regulatory arbitrage serious issue throughout crisis. before crisis, bank group would play regulatory regime policy try reach kind low common denominator throughout region. countless time hear complaint “why allow this, neighbor do!”, i’m sure others people room hear too. during crisis, experience several case country try seek individual solution common problems. while fully respect idiosyncrasy different time priority country, i think would benefit collegial approach regulation.  on national level, i believe stress supervision systemically important financial institutions, right care create wrong perception relate moral hazard. in region, institution typically banks. in view, bank become subject stringent regulatory framework, term capital liquidity requirements, business risk profile, include contingency plans. the supervisory authority always prepare bad make sure crisis management procedure complete tested. in process, valid recommendation international organization closely follow adequate implementation time. it important close coordination public authority country, include government. 3. anchor macro-prudential policy the role anchor monetary policy well known. i mention important lesson crisis authority would rigorously pursue countercyclical policies. i would like stop bite focus issue. i believe albania prepare crisis imf program play important role credible foreign anchor economic policies. the imf program similar eu membership process play similar role cee see countries. however country mature program join eu, political incentive continue fiscal consolidation fade away. current event show symptom spread old member eu, policy become reason behind instability. therefore role anchor important preserve safeguard financial stability. sound, clear enforceable fiscal rule would important step. effective supervision base simple clear capital adequacy liquidity rule would another. the basel iii accord first step right direction. a unify approach technical toolkit stress-testing exercise would also helpful. the joint stress-test exercise conduct escb right way forward. i would however encourage broaden scope candidate potential candidate country cee, order unify measurement system throughout europe. lastly, measure financial imbalance excessive asset price increases, under-pricing risks, search yield increase risk take need good incorporate standard model use central banks. conclusion in light discussion, central bank could avoid responsibility engage protect financial stability, even though define particular mandate. our experience emerge country indicate price financial stability precondition other. our motto investment make financial stability today return high benefit price stability long run. bi review 173/2010 5 6 bi review 173/2010 concurrently, i think collective experience throughout crisis show do order develop institutionalize proper mechanism would allow good fx liquidity management ee countries. a mechanism vienna initiative would encourage commitment parent bank ee subsidiary would discourage financial disintermediation country make permanent add benefit stakeholders. furthermore, regulatory harmonization improve regulatory arbitrage mitigated. on macro-prudential policy i argue need develop specific anchor would make credible, transparent therefore achievable goal financial stability. measure financial stability, instability, might difficult discourage u trying. thank attention. box 1 measure take bank supervision area pre-crisis period.  on june 2007, new law bank republic albania enter force. this law stipulate rigorous principle rule risk management, aim protect depositors, investor foster bank system’s stability.  on january 2008, credit registry start operation represent vital infrastructure-related development.  on march 2008, bank albania adopt package regulatory amendment generally orient adopt conservatory policy several main direction day-to-day commercial bank running. in concrete terms, therapy described:  in compliance new law on bank republic albania, new quantitative threshold set calculation, supervision report banks’ large exposure parent bank relate entities.  in order good diversify risk arise concentration banks’ investment international financial markets, low threshold set banks’ large exposures.  internal control consider integral part banks’ governance. hence, special emphasis put design key principle independent, unbiased accountable internal control. internal control cover section bank order prevent origination development undesired risks.  accountable governance key principle, especially financial institutions, whose success is, among others, largely dependent public confidence them. accordingly, bank albania consider quality human capacity – imply hire skillful people decision-making process risk management – fundamental. the decision make process, always base expert opinion recommendations.  the transparency relate bank financial product service provided, also pay special attention. the new legal requirement standardize manner form provide information client bank product service bank provide.  part new package also standardization require information bank branch foreign bank disclose, relate banks’ main activity, organization management, financial performance position, risk management account policies. erkki liikanen: global rebalancing, asset price policy response speech mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, fifth high-level seminar eurosystem latin american central banks, madrid, 10 december 2010. * * * due strike weather condition speech distribute write form. some background global imbalance certainly new policy concern. the visible manifestation imbalance large current account deficit surpluses, whole story. current account position reflect number deeper, fundamental problems. therefore, inevitable future rebalancing involve deep structural change country involved. the risk cause global imbalance well document research policy paper last ten years. also, imbalance long among central agenda item several international meetings. most recent serious effort address include imf-led multilateral consultation 2006 and, today, ongoing g20 mutual assessment process. such round discussion successfully establish broad agreement key policy objective resolve problem. at simplest, remarkably straightforward. national save need increase major deficit country (such unite states), reduce major surplus country (such emerge asia oil export countries). it also acknowledge deficit surplus countries, meet objective require significant policy adjustments. however, multilateral initiative address global imbalance far suffer obvious lack traction actual policy outcomes. since onset global financial crisis, imbalance admittedly undergo certain reduction. but recent projection indicate imbalance tend persist – even grow – well future. it appear imbalance become even persistent characteristic economic environment previously thought. the nature imbalance international surplus deficit not, course, harmful remain reasonable. they natural reflection financial integration. they provide flexibility saver investors. by that, welfare enhancing. however, large current account deficits, persistent growing, fuel concern external sustainability. two main risk international community extensively debate almost decade. first, sustainability concern may lead sudden collapse confidence ability deficit country maintain external positions. the result disruptive adjustment would harmful deficit surplus country alike bystander country well. so far, risk materialize moment, u bond market seem consider particularly acute. the second risk imbalance may give rise tension global trade well exchange rate relations; risk materialize constantly, witness run-up seoul g20 summit. beyond two main risks, financial crisis expose number subtle channel transmission global imbalance undermine global economic stability. in particular, enormous growth financial intermediation innovation, relate bi review 172/2010 1 imbalances, combine regulatory weakness, make international financial system much fragile relative accumulate risks. also, fragility international financial market lead volatility capital flow may harm even fundamentally stable economies. easy simplistic explanation global imbalance typically fail stand test time. they may explain conspicuous development one time period, yet fail capture multitude relevant factor play. it therefore necessary think imbalance product several fundamental factors, lie deep superficial level macroeconomic policies. i go great detail, wish merely mention couple rather general trends. the low pre-crisis national save rate deficit economy support low borrow cost consequent asset price boom period “great moderation”. the low borrow cost reflect number reason – “global save glut” emerge market failure financial markets’ risk assessment – relative significance certainly vary country country. but now, economic structure deficit country adapt inflow resource abroad, internationally competitive sector small be. the high save rate major surplus economy largely drive broadly two key factors. official sector save derive largely export-lead growth strategy base asset-accumulating competitive exchange rate peg combine capital controls. private sector save part motivate structural forces, include demographic trends, lack develop social safety net still underdevelop financial sector hamper domestic lend – channel domestic save abroad. of course, commodity export countries, surplus official sector save boost elevate commodity prices. i would also like emphasize significance domestic policy context major deficit surplus countries. a i mention beginning, solution issue external imbalance seem relatively simple consider isolation: reverse exist divergent trend save investment ratio country involved. it important, however, recognize global imbalance also reflect cross-country difference economic structure real resources, give rise differ policy interests. the post-crisis outlook imbalance so crisis imply evolution imbalance go forward? here i wish make brief observations. on one hand, challenge external rebalancing deficit country become closely intertwine internal rebalancing public private demand. whereas low save rate major deficit economy previously reflect large-scale private sector borrowing, rapid decline private spend crisis replace private deficit sizeable public sector deficits. too much global demand economic activity dependent fiscal deficit develop world. therefore, deficit country face dual task: rebalance government budget and, time, establish growth-friendly economic environment provide sustainable foundation growth private spending. in term policy, one priority lie measure maintain availability credit private sector, example repair reform financial sector. however, credit enough itself. the growth private demand must lie sustainable basis. in deficit countries, future growth inevitably need rely increasingly 2 bi review 172/2010 net exports. this competitiveness question, also structural question. and this, course, go part parcel objective reduce external imbalances. on hand, recent event clearly demonstrate current crisis increase international pressure emerge market country surpluses. this clearly apparent last round g20 discussions, foreign exchange issue centre agenda. undoubtedly, problem go away one hard issue also upcoming meetings. however exchange rate, real exchange rate exact, part adjustment mechanism lead balance redistribution economic activity spending. in end, surplus country achieve open markets, increase competition, diversify economy towards services, le pressure prevail exchange rates, small inflationary pressure encounter. so, orderly balance structural change affect societies, deficit country well surplus countries, around globe. the political difficulty make adjustment happen considerable. the role euro area latin america no matter eventual necessary global adjustment take place, spill effect concern u all. what unite latin america euro area fact global imbalance problem making. both regions, take aggregates, broadly balance current account maintain flexible exchange rate regimes. but still, neither region would immune spill effect possible disorderly adjustment. and would immune change relative price go together orderly adjustment, either. it common role expose bystander latin american european viewpoint meet, regard global imbalances. policy maker region worry danger exchange rate volatility, think hard position economy future, post-adjustment circumstances. for euro area, challenge threefold. there fiscal challenge well aware of; challenge increase productivity euro area economies, especially country big external deficits, challenge strengthen financial system, severely shake crisis. of these, i think productivity challenge fundamental long run, much fiscal sustainability issue hinge well. and without credible public finances, cannot last solution stability financial sector. latin america part already fall victim fallout global imbalances. since bust u asset price boom, suppress domestic demand couple near-zero interest policy turn private capital search high yield still-growing emerge markets. latin america painful experience excessive external indebtedness, hence prospect large capital inflow cause understandable concern. under circumstance potentially disruptive capital inflows, capital control understandably become increasingly attractive option emerge market try temporarily smooth inflow foreign capital, alleviate excessive pressure exchange rate mitigate build-up risk domestic economies. the debate desirability effectiveness capital control still ongoing i wish give definite advice proper role scope. however, i believe bi review 172/2010 3 4 bi review 172/2010 financial development innovation tend make maintenance capital control progressively difficult ineffective. and even view control become pragmatic within international community, historical experience thus far mixed. it safe consider temporary expedient, cannot rely upon provide last solution. i would also note proliferation capital control introduce potentially adverse distortion international financial system, ignored. where necessary, international community therefore seek establish common principle appropriate design. this area imf policy advice monitor could great role. conclusion: address problem finally, let say word problem global imbalance could constructively addressed. i leave detail discussion subsequent session seminar, wish highlight one observation relevant i said. if deficit surplus country would choose pursue policy base narrow self-interests, seek postpone inevitable structural changes, problem global imbalance – adverse effect – would likely persist. the way address problem international policy coordination. it enough simply demonstrate imbalance address orderly, policy-driven adjustment. what also require credible commitment key stakeholder follow cooperative approach. a i see it, success latter require two things. partly, commitment cooperative approach commitment compromise. this achieve open direct interaction involve key players. despite limitations, g20 mutual assessment process best tool task. it mere existence facilitate exchange view long lack international policy coordination. but, fortunately so, necessary global rebalancing make compromises. the world economy zero sum game, good cooperation deliver real benefit shared. one need present convince enough case – major deficit surplus economy – spillover globally inconsistent policies, interest country. this certainly easy feat major challenge discussion go forward. the challenge even large solution involve deep adjustments, macroeconomic policies, economic structure country involved. choongsoo kim: the prospect korean economy 2011 keynote speech mr

speech mr hirohide yamaguchi, deputy governor bank japan, symposium co-hosted university tokyo development bank japan, tokyo, 10 december 2010. * * * introduction it great honor opportunity speak symposium co-hosted center advance research finance, university tokyo, research institute capital formation, development bank japan. while global financial crisis erupt two year ago, trigger failure lehman brother completely over, situation significantly improved. progress also make establish international framework prevent recurrence recent global crisis future. meanwhile, japan’s financial system relatively stable, compare unite state europe, challenge become clear effect crisis reach various forms. in circumstances, indeed topical discus today future japan’s financial system be, i look forward discussion experts. for part, i briefly review financial crisis talk future japan’s financial system challenge japanese financial institutions. i. global financial crisis japan’s financial system a. the international financial system lehman shock these two year follow failure lehman brother indeed tumultuous period global economy international financial system. follow failure lehman brothers, financial crisis erupt global scale, global economy deteriorate simultaneously rapidly. subsequently, due effect exhaustive policy response government central banks, global economy gradually start recover around spring 2009 profit fund condition major u.s. european financial institution improve significantly. however, backdrop european fiscal problem include greece ireland well heighten uncertainty future u.s. economy, phase financial market become unstable since spring 2010. in unite state europe, amid continue balance sheet adjustments, bank lend sluggish credit cost somewhat high levels. the international financial system still fragile state. b. effect japan’s financial system look impact global financial crisis japan’s financial system, relatively large decline function cp corporate bond markets. on hand, direct impact financial institution central japan’s financial intermediation remain relatively small, compare u.s. european financial institutions, stability financial system whole maintained. three reason point out. first, probably major reason, japanese financial institution generally cautious take risk base experience financial crisis since bi review 172/2010 1 1990s. specifically, investment complex financial product collateralize debt obligation low adopted, unlike major u.s. european financial institutions, originate-to-distribute business model full-fledged manner. second, term incentive, relatively low pressure shareholder pursue short-term return remuneration system financial institutions’ manager also conducive short-term risk-taking activity. third, result effort public authority enhance robustness financial system, include establishment resolution framework financial institutions, concern surface systemic risk heighten among depositor market participants. nevertheless, global financial crisis also affect japan’s economy various form deterioration economic activity, fall stock prices, decline market functioning. japanese financial institution also hit accordingly form impairment due decline stock price increase credit costs. in meantime, challenge japanese financial institution face with, weakness core profitability vulnerability stock price fluctuations, highlight again. i come back detail later. ii. prospect japan’s financial system a. change environment surround japan’s financial system the topic today’s panel discussion “whither financial system?” it quite difficult question, hope provide reference discussion, i offer consideration japan’s financial system financial crisis macro micro perspectives. a might useful consider first change expect environment surround japan’s financial system future, let start follow three points. strengthen global regulation supervision first, financial regulation supervision strengthen global basis. on regulations, vigorous discussion ongoing internationally, issue cover quite wide, range banks’ capital adequacy liquidity, leverage, remuneration, accounting. in term supervision, scope widen mainly cover take sufficiently past, so-called shadow bank system. let talk recent developments. for example, term banks’ capital, internationally common new regulatory framework, namely, basel iii, recently agree on. both quality quantity bank’s capital enhanced, albeit gradually, increase ratio common equity tier i high loss absorb capacity time bankruptcy. like so-called “volcker rule” unite states, also move directly regulate banks’ high risk business proprietary trade investment hedge funds. through next year, issue moral hazard associate systemically important financial institution (sifis), namely, “too-big-to-fail problem,” expect discussed, include specify sifis response necessary prevent failure specify sifis minimize impact fail. if i offer opinion issue, give essence issue avoid moral hazard, would desirable take flexible approach. namely, accordance situation country, appropriate response choose various option include bank capital surcharge also liquidity surcharge strengthen supervision, establishment resolution framework. 2 bi review 172/2010 increase new demand fund second, content demand fund financial institution face home abroad change, possibility new demand fund increase. for example, emerge economy expect continue drive force global economy, thus fund demand improve infrastructure firms’ business fix investment well asset management associate accumulation personal financial asset economies, expect increase. turn domestic areas, process firm explore new growth strategy rebuild supply system good services, could new fund demand research development well business relocation. moreover, industrial structure expect change further, increase importance fund demand associate corporate rehabilitation realignment m&a finance dip finance fund demand emerge company challenge new areas. moreover, need asset management mainly elderly people expect diversify increase. change business model globally active major financial institution third, business model globally active major financial institution might change. specifically, originate-to-distribute business model actively use prior crisis relatively decrease number proportion commercial bank business put emphasis relationship customer likely increase: call “back basics.” moreover, business regulation volcker rule implement regulation supervision review order restrain “too-big-to-fail,” likely move toward mere scale expansion toward excessive risk-taking restrained. in term funding, awareness liquidity risk heighten considerably experience financial crisis, emphasis would put retail deposits, stability short-term wholesale fund repo transactions. such change business model globally active major financial institution could impact business model competitiveness japanese financial institutions. b. future japan’s financial system: macro perspective i next touch japan’s financial system future macro perspective, namely, perspective financial system structure. needle say again, japan’s financial system long characterize financial intermediation center banks. in situation, perspective improve function stability financial system, many argue follows. it desirable bank-based financial intermediation also financial intermediation capital market, inclusive so-called market-based financial intermediation. to end, necessary increase supply risk money eventually enhance diversification households’ asset investment. in fact, many policy measure take bolster moves, include enhancement market infrastructure, improvement market transparency, investor protection. if revisit discussion base experience recent crisis, summarize follows. first, complementarity function bank capital market important. while function corporate bond cp market decline significantly japan crisis, bank lend substitute financial intermediation function phase underpin rapidly deteriorate firms’ funding. subsequently, function capital market restored, bank lend start decline. therefore, become clear existence multiple financial intermediation channel important availability firms’ fund robustness financial system. bi review 172/2010 3 second, existence multiple financial intermediation channel alone would sufficient ensure financial system stability. former federal reserve board chairman greenspan point one reason japan’s protract crisis financial intermediation concentrate banks, financial system like unite states, variety financial intermediation channels, would robust shock financial system real economy. however, fact crisis deepen unite state imply view necessarily correct. what important financial system participant maintain business soundness pursue solid risk management, and, time, regulatory supervisory authority central bank recognize risk lie financial system whole macro perspective take proper responses. namely, i believe critical financial system stability maintain robustness financial system structure also self discipline financial system participant risk capture capability authority high level whole. c. challenge japanese financial institutions: micro perspective i next talk two specific challenge japanese financial institutions. i touch challenge authority final part speech. select business model sustain improvement profitability the first big challenge japanese financial institution raise profitability sustain manner. look recent business performance japanese financial institutions, core profitability trend due partly narrow profit margin decline lend outstanding. for reason, increase profitability imminent challenge. in so, apply every industry, essential choose optimal business model utilize institution’s respective realm expertise. a i mention earlier, competition commercial bank business, japanese financial institution mainly engaged, expect intensify home abroad. japanese financial institution receive domestic stable personal deposit advantage, include fund overseas activities, term resilience liquidity risk. moreover, characteristic japanese financial institution traditionally put emphasis customer relationship important element term “information production,” key conduct lend business, could serve positively business japan also overseas include asian countries. furthermore, japanese firm households, main customer japanese financial institutions, need balance sheet adjustment like unite state europe. therefore, term competitiveness japanese financial institution compare u.s. european financial institutions, i believe nothing pessimistic. with recognition, necessary japanese financial institution is, first, hone skill identify firm growth potential continue strive find new borrower also tap new fund demand exist borrowers. while fundamental problem japan’s economy face decline medium- long-term growth expectations, overcome problem, important private firm promote innovative activity pursue new source growth home abroad. it essential financial institution also firmly support moves. in regard, look recent effort japanese financial institutions, proactive development utilize respective characteristics, quite assuring. the major bank expand business asian emerge economy regardless customers’ nationality, regional bank make effort tap growth area regions, include distinct local firms. i hope japanese financial institution establish respective business model pursue proactive effort include tap new fund 4 bi review 172/2010 demand, skillfully gauge various change business environment home abroad. second, also important raise core profitability exist borrow firm enhance governance. it often say japan corporate governance raise firm’s profitability weak. there many view that, one way overcome weakness use equity funds, strong tendency search yields, leverage strengthen corporate governance outside. financial institution play significant role regard involve create investment funds. moreover, role financial institution lender also insignificant. many japanese financial institution appear rely much real estate collateral personal guarantee provide loan especially medium small firms, governance loan provision necessarily sufficient. financial institution require bolster firms’ growth constantly deepen ongoing relationship them. in complement support, lend us movable assets, inventories, account receivables collateral – so-called asset-based lend – utilize covenant medium small firm useful options. third, intrinsically important financial institution play role encourage metabolism, example, corporate realignment. at time, also important financial institution also aim metabolize mergers, consolidation, unbundling, accordance business models. for example, financial institution aim globally active could pursue advantage scale scope merger acquisitions. by contrast, financial institution aspire enhance presence niche markets, limit function concentrate resource could important option. those financial institutions’ behavior expect improve management efficiency individual financial institution increase competitiveness also lead increase profitability financial sector whole efficient resource reallocation. proper risk management the second challenge japanese financial institution proper risk management. in regard, increase awareness among financial institutions, include overseas, importance following: gauge risk comprehensively, example, way stress testing, without rely much specific quantitative method var, share recognition risk risk management section also include top management. in addition general challenge, reduction market risk associate stockholdings, particular, would specific challenge future. a market risk associate stockholdings, many japanese financial institution recognize magnitude price volatility associate stockholding take step reduce risk management priority. nevertheless, pace reduction stockholding somewhat slow recently due partly sluggish stock price thus due amount market risk associate stockholding still remains. of course, stockholding could implication part corporate governance could play role tool gain total profit include fee revenues. even cases, however, important firmly identify risk returns. on basis, judge risk larger, financial institution require steadily promote effort toward reduction stockholdings. conclude remark while i talk challenge japanese financial institutions, recent crisis leave various lesson regulatory supervisory authority well central banks. in relation ensure financial system stability, one lesson might “it important gauge sharp distinction micro-level risks, risk bi review 172/2010 5 6 bi review 172/2010 individual financial institutions, risk financial system whole.” by take point account, importance so-called macroprudence – aim accurately gauge risk financial system whole, due recognition relationship economic activity, financial markets, financial institutions, take necessary policy response – increasingly recognize global basis. in regard, bank japan been, standpoint conduct monetary policy, monitor wide range economic financial development home abroad make in-depth research analyses, well strive improve infrastructure, include financial market payment settlement system. in addition, bank gauge business condition individual financial institution on-site bank examination off-site monitoring, information perspective obtain process utilize gauge condition financial system whole risk analyses, publish financial system report. also, bank take measure purchase banks’ stockholding provision subordinate loan aim ensure stability financial system whole. the bank thus make various effort macroprudence front. nevertheless, effort half done. for example, gauge macro risk still sufficient. from viewpoint strengthen macroprudential analysis, bank try financial system report broaden analysis business banks, example, insurance companies, gauge macro financial imbalances, expand stress testing, effort still remain stage trial error. in addition, bank aware that, even macro risk properly gauged, still remain future challenge examine specific policy measure would desirable address risk. the bank will, include response challenge i mentioned, continue effort ensure stability financial system. nout wellink: rebuild financial sector speech dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, colloquium centre financial studies, frankfurt main, 8 december 2010. * * * introduction 1. lady gentlemen, financial crisis rag since july 2007 many-headed monster. at core lack market confidence financial institution countries. i speak background global financial crisis, impact, current situation european countries. i elaborate challenge face future. in particular, i focus strengthen resilience bank sector, include approach towards too-big-to-fail banks. i conclude initiative enhance macro-prudential supervision. cause global crisis global fire fuel interdependencies, … 2. after first sign difficulty subprime mortgage unite state emerge summer 2007, long think specific u problem would indirectly affect part world. that prove illusion: mortgage problem u spark set system fire worldwide. the flame kindle negligent contract mortgage loans, via risky construction poor documentation. the popularity financial innovation generate opaque pyramid financial risk become steadily unstable. … insufficient buff 3. the innovation enlarge net leverage system, enable bank operate ever slim capital position; ratio asset capital large bank crisis average 30. the supervision liquidity risk bank inadequate fragmented, also europe. in addition, innovation deepen interdependency financial institutions, hence pace scope contagion channels. in words: fuel start great fire omnipresent. the crisis eventually erupt great force collapse u investment bank lehman brother september 2008. the loss cause collapse major uncertainty exactly hit, lead disappearance market confidence full-blown systemic crisis. global imbalance contribute indiscipline 4. although relative importance various cause subject debate, rather broad consensus development lead crisis. the globalisation integration part global economy, like china eastern europe, thus far isolate couple build-up global imbalances. excessive debt build-up western, notably anglo-saxon, country go tandem huge surplus oil-exporting country asian countries. asian country stick stable currency, cause imbalance continue currency reserve accumulate. the investment reserve u keep u interest rate low, so-called global save glut, contribute financial indiscipline country. bi review 171/2010 1 loose monetary policy another cause 5. the accommodate monetary policy, particularly us, sow seed imbalances. in year crisis, money supply growth well outpace potential gdp growth. this reflect mount inflation, supply relatively cheap product asia keep price rise moderate. nonetheless, monetary expansion result acceleration asset price credit aggregates. before crisis, lend industrial country grow around 10% annually. the low interest rate abundant availability credit encourage search yield. risk underprice bubble could easily arise, especially real estate. this case u also european countries. with hindsight, interest rate low tame monetary expansion other, macro-prudential, instrument deploy contain credit expansion. what impact crisis? serious damage financial sector, partly governments’ expense 6. writedowns securitisation product ordinary loan lead huge loss bank sector. bank worldwide write around usd 1,400 billion. this blow big hole capital base, order uphold confidence sector, government rig extensive support programmes. some usd 500 billion pump banks, bank debt asset risk guarantee deposit guarantee extended. large amount require stabilise institutions, relative gdp especially ireland, belgium uk. real economy hit hard 7. the current economic downturn deeper, prolong widespread occur 15 previous crisis period history, accord multi-country study reinhart reinhart (2010). this reflect radical deleveraging financial system. the study show deleveraging financial crisis often initially postpone lengthy process average seven years. the revival follow financial crisis hence tend slow. a rapid recovery global economy set year ago. a end last year, recovery gradually flatten somewhat, likelihood double dip u seem slight. the european debt crisis: imbalance underpin negative momentum 8. let mention word debt crisis currently plague europe, cause policy response. it clear establish emu currency union satisfy ideal conditions. a currency union preferably couple political union, latter – notwithstanding continue european integration – still place. large balance-of-payments imbalance build up, germany netherlands run surplus around 5% gdp call peripheral country report deficit 5% gdp more. the current account deficit signal major structural imbalances, public finances. when investor become reluctant finance deficits, debt crisis unfolded. this threaten financial stability europe-wide country euro area highly interdependent financially. decisive action government require 9. in market turbulence last may, greece epicentre. with drastic intervention, government leader ecb temporarily manage turn tide 2 bi review 171/2010 market turmoil abated. however, owe concern surround ireland, market turbulence flare recent weeks, market participant fear potential contagion peripheral countries. to maintain market public confidence, essential country make every effort introduce credible consolidation programme reform bring public finance onto sustainable path. the primary responsibility improve public finance lie authorities. moreover, europe imf set ultimate safety net could also resort need be, eurosystem provide enhance credit support aim safeguard monetary transmission prevent tight credit ration private sector. in november, ireland conclude program european commission imf, liaison ecb. this program deliver important contribution restore financial stability country. lesson learn challenge 10. the worldwide crisis expose fundamentally weak spot international economy global financial system. in many case effort address get way, still much uncertainty effect measures. i focus two main challenges, first strengthen bank sector second enhance macro-prudential oversight. strengthen resilience bank 11. bank epicentre crisis. after wave bank collapses, nationalisations, conversions, break-ups, sales, bailouts – impact real economy – financial bank system seem stabilise way recovery. however, reform essential make financial bank system truly resilient period stress. the basel committee bank supervision announce comprehensive package measure strengthen bank sector. the content call basel iii endorse g20 world leaders, seoul begin november. basel iii contain bankspecific reforms, goal make bank resilient shocks. it also address system wide risks, bank-specific approach enough. bank specific reform 12. the core bank-specific reform strong capital liquidity regulation. raise quality capital base one primary objective basel iii. in future, emphasis core capital, common equity retain earnings, bank le incentive attract low quality capital. in line qualitative improvement increase minimum quantity regulatory capital. for first time, hard minimum requirement set core capital, namely 4.5% bank’s total risk-weighted assets. in addition, committee improve risk coverage regulatory framework improvement way. the goal ensure material risk captured. during crisis, many risk reflect risk-based regime. capital requirement trade book exposure well complex securitisations exposure off-balance-sheet vehicle increase substantially, three four time old capital requirements. 13. an additional element capital framework leverage ratio, serve backstop risk-based capital requirement. in lead-up crisis, many bank report strong risk-based capital ratio while, time, manage build high level on- off-balance sheet leverage. the use supplementary leverage ratio help contain build-up excessive leverage. it also serve additional safeguard attempt “game” risk-based requirement help address model risk. a minimum leverage ratio 3% test observation period. bi review 171/2010 3 14. the propose liquidity framework also profound effect since global liquidity standard currently exist. during crisis, fund remain short supply extend period. in response, committee propose global minimum liquidity standard make bank resilient potential short-term disruption access fund address longer-term structural liquidity mismatch balance sheets. the liquidity coverage ratio require bank sufficient high-quality liquid asset withstand 30-day stress fund scenario. this complement net stable fund ratio, longer-term structural ratio design address liquidity mismatches. address system-wide risk 15. however, firm-specific approach sufficient. broad macroprudential measure strengthen entire bank system equally important. an essential element address system wide risk build buff good time draw period stress. the committee introduce two capital buffers. first capital conservation buffer, increase minimum capital requirement 2.5%. a bank’s capital level move close minimum requirements, conservation buff impose constraint discretionary distributions, like dividend payments, share buyback bonuses. secondly, countercyclical buffer, would impose excess credit growth associate excessive build-up system-wide risk. this buff vary 0 2.5%. 16. in order give bank time adjust new requirement support ongoing economic recovery, basel iii implement gradually. from 2013 onwards, increase minimum requirement core capital phase three years’ time. and thereafter capital conservation buff introduce step-by-step four years’ time. the new liquidity standard implement observation period ensure effectiveness. too important fail 17. but effective system wide focus also address problem relate interconnectedness perception bank important fail. some institution grow vital financial stability become systemically important failure socially acceptable option. during financial crisis, government authority choice save institutions. at time loss external capital provider keep minimum. let explain concept systemically important financial institutions, call sifis, discus international policy response address problem relate “too important fail”. 18. there roughly three characteristic make institution systemically important: size, interconnectedness limit substitutability. size measure volume financial service provide financial institution. interconnectedness increase extent problem institution may affect financial system. this may happen via institution’s direct link institution well indirectly, via role financial infrastructure financial markets. the third factor, limit substitutability, indicate crucial function service cannot quickly easily take another party, system become seriously disrupted. 19. aside structural characteristic institutions, two factor may accelerate spillover entire financial system. first all, complexity organisation structure. complex internationally active bank cannot easily wind crucial function easily transfer another party. secondly, crisis situation, confidence effect herd behaviour market participant play reinforce role. 4 bi review 171/2010 fsb framework sifis these contagion channel make bailouts systemic institution crisis inevitable. such intervention, however, carry number problems, like burden fiscal position, create moral hazard make government guarantee explicit, undermine level playing-field institutions. therefore, step take tackle too-important-to-fail problem. the financial stability board develop policy framework deal systemically important financial institutions, g20 world leader ratify last month. this framework design reduce probability impact failure sifi. it rest intensive supervision, high buff sifis compare basel iii increase resolution capacity national authorities. the case macro-prudential oversight 20. on top new standard regulations, enhance supervision also vital. macro-prudential oversight is, put simply, miss link different approach central bank financial supervisor. a central bank significantly promote financial stability aim low inflation, sound payment system sustainable credit growth. supervisor exercise responsibility stability individual financial institution ensure adequate buff withstand shocks. the problem responsibilities, although closely interrelated, poorly attuned. let explain. 21. in run-up crisis, central bank warn risk financial system. but warn prove meaningful, effectively translate mitigate action supervisors. likewise, supervisor believe individual institution sound, financial system whole would too. however, financial crisis show supervision individual institution important, sufficient preserve financial stability. 22. the message clear: supervision financial system whole strengthen low chance impact future crises, require central bank supervisor join forces. one important add value macro-prudential oversight look interaction financial institution environment. a single bank, say, exercise limit influence house prices. but, many bank ease credit standard mortgage loans, house price could soar, possibly cause house market overheat. a house market crash entail huge loss bank sector real economy. thus, monitor interaction within financial system, include dynamic behind build-up imbalances, macro-prudential oversight identify threat financial stability. in light lessons, eu political authority decide establish new european systemic risk board per 1 january 2011 strengthen macro-prudential oversight eu. conclusion 23. lady gentlemen, let come end. i talk one sweep crisis financial world confront since long time. governments, supervisor financial sector worldwide reply ambitious measure reforms. i sure many people, maybe even among you, question whether measure initiative end improve world? it simple fair question, easy answer! and though i fortune teller, i firmly believe reform make financial sector healthier, stabilise economy improve world. 24. and need reform evident. a recent imf study, instance, estimate cost financial crisis around 15 percent gdp, research bi review 171/2010 5 6 bi review 171/2010 factor long-term impact crisis might easily arrive multiple figure. with measure discussed, future crisis become le probable. at time realise objective present u silver platter. all party involve work hard meet requirement implementation next challenge. so let u wait long, start make plan instead. thank attention. miguel fernández ordóñez: the crisis financial market speech mr miguel fernández ordóñez, governor bank spain, annual financial conference asociación de mercados financieros, madrid, 13 december 2010. * * * good afternoon, thank asociación de mercados financieros kind invitation participate lunch colloquium. since great depression last century, world see financial crisis deep present one. and, like then, many year intense study sufficient time perspective probably need accurately ass factor cause crisis mechanism contribute spread. in particular, still much learn relationship development crisis behaviour financial markets. nonetheless, i shall take opportunity today offer brief reflection conduct market crisis, perspective way claim all-encompassing since i shall concern exclusively impact spanish economy. to end i’ll discus two clearly differentiate episode financial crisis past three years: first, might call “banking crisis”, affect spain le countries; second, associate rapid deterioration public finance euro area, significant effect country. the outbreak first phase crisis date back three years, european bank suspend redemption fund invest u mortgage loans. it soon become apparent source problem lay u subprime mortgage spread associate risk via “originate distribute” model. bank hit hardest. major financial institution collapse country problem originated, also many others whose bank invest save product generate indebted economies. by contrast, spanish bank system originate invest type product, thank largely relatively conservative approach behind regulation supervision. consequently, although bank obviously immune effect crisis, deterioration economic situation consequence collapse confidence work wholesale fund markets, direct effect spanish bank system relatively minor. during long expansion prior crisis, constant increase indebtedness spanish economy, similar country which, crisis, saw bank system collapse. some analyst draw parallel event country warn similar problem could arise spain. but case. true, expansionary phase, private-sector debt grow high rates, although clarify growth asset price – unwarranted fundamental – le countries. yet three year spanish bank system prove reasonably resilient; two small entity take central bank control, volume public aid make available small compare public resource earmark end countries. the explanation different outcome apparently similar situation must seek quality bank regulation supervision, retail banking-based business model bank spain. what happen country saw bank system collapse largely which, precede years, vigorously defend benefit “hands-off” government approach function financial sector. this quite opposite approach banco de españa, central bank take heart lesson serious bank crisis 1980s early 1990s spain. bi review 171/2010 1 until crisis erupted, prevail doctrine advocate light-handed regulation, consider supervisory approach bank system’s business model, centre traditional bank activities, outmoded. but wake crisis, pendulum swung. now predominant approach financial regulation go extreme. testify work programme place main international agency fora, g20, financial stability board basel committee bank supervision. intense work way introduce major change international regulatory supervisory framework prevent similar crisis recur improve financial system’s resilience move forward. such change include notably new rule know basel iii, alter regulation bank sector international level several fundamental respects: bank require better-quality capital; explicit requirement make respect liquidity risk; measure take mitigate procyclical behaviour financial activity. further, fsb work treatment systemic banks, i.e. consider important fail due size, level complexity operation interconnectedness financial system

rat agencies, etc. generally speaking, spain much learn country economic policies. the clear press example, light economic social consequence burgeon number jobless spaniards, employment labour market policy country which, even height crises, keep unemployment rate low. however, within realm financial regulation supervision policies, opposite case: supervisory arrangement closely study reform countries. the ingenious idea governor rojo team set place countercyclical mechanism order try soften credit growth least mitigate adverse consequence cyclical behaviour bank system forerunner countercyclical capital buff envisage basel iii accord. the constraint complex product obligation consolidate example rule guideline characteristic spanish bank supervision regulation fully coincide direction global financial system reform advancing. spain’s approach restructure bank sector demonstrable advantages. the process undertake use frob (fund orderly restructure bank sector), set follow parliamentary approval 18 month ago since oversee numerous integration process save bank reduce number 45 17. the design frob base around two-pronged approach. first, gear support bank which, viable, require restructure ensure ability resume path sustainable profitability, reinforce solvency public funds. significantly, certain country need similar instrument acknowledged, yet created. second, frob involve give banco de españa wide-ranging power swiftly effectively take control resolve problem bank viable. round remit frob approval reform legal regime save banks. to date, limitation inherent legal status prevent save bank reinforce core capital, except capitalisation profits. the reform open way save bank tap private capital enable issue core equity instruments, provide

expansion, bank system become excessively big parallel growth construction sector. if aid conditional upon presentation capacity-adjustment programme, profit loss account bank would continue perform poorly, conjunctural term also structurally. and know, profit loss account first line defence come avert bank crises. another criterion prove useful relate substantial amount (up €99 billion) authorise parliament meet recapitalisation need may arise crisis, contain turn budgetary impact restructure process. the €10 billion lend spanish bank doubt considerable sum. but actually small amount compare outlay countries, react pump tower amount public fund private banks, lead serious increase public debt case ultimately cause problem country concerned. where necessary, sufficient backstop meet recapitalisation needs, absurd inject public fund unnecessarily. let’s turn role financial market second phase financial crisis, so-called “sovereign debt crisis”, erupt recently, spring year. the behaviour sovereign bond market could analyse standpoint market failure regulated. while interest perspective, proposal reform major scale yet set train, unlike bank regulation. the crisis disclose numerous shortcoming function markets, one frequent criticism market influence public policy agenda. but fact matter hardly far-reaching reform draw credit market proposed. those interest viewpoint read late speech fernando restoy, vice-chairman cnmv (spanish national security market commission). in suggest certain area regulation market could improved. i’m go adopt le ambitious approach, focus describe market behaviour standpoint country ours, recent month tackle lack investor confidence. what learn behaviour debt market second phase crisis? perhaps one key lesson market capable identify certain structural problem which, whatever reason, may affect economy’s solvency. and market offer u economic policy pointers, interest also us. restore health public finances, reform boost growth reduce unemployment, restructure bank system position promote growth credit demand pick up, etc. piece advice benefit u worth following. admittedly, may say, market issue warnings. but usually belatedly. and true. turn spain’s case, 10-year-long boom credit hit double-digit growth rate current account, practically balance 1996, begin run systematically continuously widen deficit. over period market exactly profuse give signal imbalance build up. the markets, like spaniards, think spanish economy fine. we acknowledge, raghuram rajan talk u economy, delay realise actual problem share agent economy. but mean that, although late, message market merit hear give due assessment. if think investors’ evaluation problem reasonable, recommendable response follow advice. we’ve also learn market may err late offer advice, judgment may also mistaken. frequently, information diffuse insufficient, investors’ view different economy shape overly simplistic bi review 171/2010 3 fashion. what we’ve seen, case, criticise ignorance little use practical terms. the proper response provide best information possible. generally, investor right information, incorporate appropriately judgments. in modesty, i think example appropriate response incorrect diagnosis market decision last summer perform stress test list spanish bank save banks. the markets’ doubt time spanish system’s capacity digest real estate problem unfounded. but reacted, transparently, uncertainty dispelled, bank save bank able raise fund market recourse bank ecb finance drop dramatically. in vein lesson learned, we’ve recently see markets, addition infallible, also sometimes forget. the late instance doubt emerge spanish bank system. the stress test perform end july, may well suppose, value spanish banks’ real estate asset cannot vary significantly three months. nothing change substantially respect assumption made, yet market appear forget adopt line logic ireland real estate problem serious bank problems, something similar might happen spain. this suspicion strengthen fact irish bank also pass stress tests. in respect, underscore stress test perform spain exhaustive offer detail information. while ireland two bank participate tests, spain list bank save bank take part information provide exposure risks, real estate risk particular, notably great degree detail transparency countries. but do market forget investors’ doubt resurface? once cases, medicine transparency. this why, late november, take initiative explain situation lay bare spanish banks, save bank particular. we ask bank explain detail situation market. in particular, banco de españa give instruction relate bank association ensure institution disclose standardise additional information quarterly basis market exposure real estate development construction sector, detail percentage doubtful loans, relate collateral provision set aside withstand potential impairment. they also give detail retail mortgage portfolio, include relate ltv ratio percentage doubtful assets. finally, must ass market fund need short-, medium- long-term strategy implemented. all necessary reality perceive bad actually is, best possible response explain fine detail. a lesson draw conduct market like uncertainty. a top film scriptwriter know, filmgoers happy predict little bite what’s go happen. music composer also know this. the unpredictable film musical composition is, unsatisfied viewer listener are. in debt crisis, addition responsibility country subject market mistrust, lack coordination among european union leader also play key role. in public eye, latter air substantial difference sometimes do bad possible time crisis, thereby contribute compound problems. i recall journalist interview analyst u tv programme week back. the analyst set discuss europe’s sovereign debt problem main source instability present worldwide. the journalist ask possible that, among markets’ reason nervousness, even mention north korean bomb incident previous day. and analyst replied: “look, market like predictable. and north korean government much predictable european politicians”. 4 bi review 171/2010 bi review 171/2010 5 what i say european union institution also extend institution within individual countries, important central government say does, also regional governments, opposition and, generally, relevant economic agent say. and that’s something else we’ve learn markets: see u afar don’t distinguish distinguish within. specifically, case, always draw distinction regional central governments, government opposition. what see is, simply, spain. take lesson market behaviour heart important countries, country spain which, owe systematic grow build-up current account deficit since 1996, resort external financing. accordingly, vital transmit confidence finance us. we’re move right direction. in space three year we’ve move current account deficit around 10% gdp one 5% year. and case budget deficit, we’ll see decline 11% last year 6% next year. once adjustment over, spanish economy outgrow big economy euro area, foresee international institutions. yet complacent, carry push structural reform through. you’ll note market behave like people: sometimes give reasonable advice, sometimes late, sometimes make mistakes, sometimes short memory. and waver greed fear, depend whether they’re preoccupy return risk. we’re witness “flight risk”. but you’ll doubt recall frenzied “search yield” financial market worldwide decade prior crisis. should always heed advice markets? not necessarily. it’s highly recommendable message sensible ones. and frequently, albeit belatedly, demand benefit us. but also make mistake occasionally and, cases, there’s sense get work call ignorant. that serf purpose. the right response offer information possible explain reasoning. this convince somebody, react markets. indeed, market people. that i’m ask react them, usual advice treat like people ultimately are. thank you. guy debelle: bank fund capital flow speech mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, 23rd australasian finance bank conference, sydney, 15 december 2010. * * * thank alex heath, chris stewart crystal ossolinski help prepare speech. the financial crisis lead significant re-assessment risk. have underprice number year prior 2007, risk rapidly substantially re-priced financial crisis unfolded. counterparty risk come fore also fundamental re-assessment importance liquidity risk. there new-found, re-found, appreciation complex way risk affect broad financial system. give pivotal role bank financial system, evolution financial crisis place particular focus way fund themselves. because one main feature bank business maturity transformation, bank expose realisation liquidity shock. problem associate liquidity (or precisely lack it) prove important channel shock one part financial system propagate others. the re-assessment re-pricing risk cause change structure fund australian banks. today, i discus development liability side banks’ balance sheets. but time, also change asset side balance sheets, credit growth slow significantly, particularly lend large businesses. the combination changes, together investment-focused growth australian economy, mark effect composition capital flow australia i discus late talk. these development may well persist quite time come. bank funding1 the re-pricing risk significantly increase cost wholesale fund global bank system. at short end yield curve, rise cost primarily reflect counterparty concerns. this best exemplify spread short-term rate interbank market expect policy rate (graph 1). a note past, spread serf one good summary illustration evolution financial crisis. in australia, spread never rise much countries, reflect general absence counterparty concern associate smooth function interbank market throughout crisis. a graph 1 shows, spread fall back australia far pre-crisis levels: pre-crisis 90-day spread average around 10 basis points, around 20 basis points. it surprise spread narrow far. by large, one would expect stable times, counterparty concern would reasonably absent short horizon much risk premium present pricing. but counterparty concern rising, tend rapidly incorporate spread. 1 for detail bank funding, see reserve bank australia submission senate economics reference committee inquiry competition within australian bank sector, 30 november 2010. bi review 171/2010 1 graph 1 at long terms, effect repricing risk much stark and, price ease back peaks, still remain well pre-crisis level (graph 2). the overall cost major australian bank issue three-year bond rise around 120 basis point government bond yield compare around 50

standard bank system. graph 3 one notable change rise share deposit le 40 per cent 2007 45 per cent currently. the deputy governor ric battellino talk conference last year.2 the desire increase share deposit reflect assumption deposit represent stable source funding. in order boost share deposit funding, bank australia compete aggressively term price. an indication degree competition deposit extent increase cost deposit fund relative cash rate since mid 2008: average cost major banks’ new deposit slightly cash rate, whereas prior onset financial crisis, deposit rate 150 basis point cash rate (graph 4). 2 see battellino r (2009), “some comment bank funding”, remark 22nd australasian finance bank conference, sydney, 16 december 2009. bi review 171/2010 3 graph 4 competition strong term deposits. the average rate banks’ term deposit special currently 70 basis point market rate debt equivalent term (graph 5). in year prior global financial crisis average rate generally 60 basis point below. this notwithstanding fact wholesale debt liquid tradable instrument whereas deposit not; one might expect liquidity wholesale debt would result cheaper. graph 5 4 bi review 171/2010 rate at-call save deposit – include bonus saver, cash management online save account – also rise relative cash rate. the average rate major banks’ at-call deposits, account little half total deposits, currently estimate around 40 basis point cash rate compare around 100 basis point mid 2007. so bottom line deposit market extremely competitive. the mark increase competition occur late last year early part year. since then, liaison suggest competitive pressure intensify nevertheless remain high level. a ric battellino note last year, point, likely elasticity deposit price declines. this mean increase price result bank mostly shuffle deposit themselves, rather generate increase share fund investor allocate deposits. at time bank increase share deposit fund around 7 percentage points, share longer-term wholesale fund also increase similar amount. this increase share fund source deposit long-term debt mirror decline share fund source short-term wholesale debt, domestic foreign markets. the share short-term fund fall 10 percentage point past three years, large change indeed. a result changes, vulnerability australian bank system seizure global financial market decreased. but change increase cost fund bank system whole. the cost form fund risen, and, time, bank shift expensive source funding. a i say earlier, shift reflect market regulatory pressure follow re-assessment risk. the re-pricing risk increase cost intermediation pre-crisis level, arguably underpriced. this rise cost intermediation reflect increase lend rate relative cash rate.3 the financial crisis also raise awareness source risk global bank sector. for number european banks, currency maturity mismatch asset liability raise significant issue throughout crisis continue vulnerability. the fact issue ongoing reflect recent rise eur/usd cross currency basis swap. in contrast, australian bank hedge currency risk offshore borrow use instrument maturity matched. a result face issue european bank face fund u

reflect current economic financial trends. i sure many room would like stop title, “living low long,” go merrily christmas holidays, content i provide early present extraordinary guidance future canadian monetary policy. however, i bear gift today. canadian monetary policy continue set, past, overall canadian condition guide 2 per cent inflation target. in remark today, i focus factor lead low-interest-rate environment major advance economies, implication environment financial stability economic growth. global economic outlook current turbulence europe reminder crisis over, merely enter new phase. in world awash debt, repair balance sheet banks, household country take years. a consequence, pace, pattern variability global economic growth changing, canada must adapt. for crisis economies, easy bite recovery finished. temporary factor support growth 2010 – turn inventory cycle release pent-up demand – largely run course. fiscal stimulus turn fiscal drag and, countries, rapid consolidation become urgent. household expenditure expect recover slowly. this imply gradual absorption large excess capacity many advance economies. this surprising. history suggest recession involve financial crisis tend deep recovery take twice long. in decade follow severe financial crises, growth rate tend one percentage point low unemployment rate five percentage point higher.1 the current u.s. recovery prove exception. in environment, low policy rate major advance economy could place prolong period – possibility underscore recent extension unconventional monetary policy unite states, japan europe. this tendency towards low-interest rate reinforce structural forces. the global economy rapidly become multi-polar, emerging-market economy drive commodity prices, represent almost one-half import growth, account two-thirds global growth. this increasingly uneasy emergence. growth strategy reliant export excess national save unsustainable long term. in near term, many emerge economies, limit non-inflationary growth approach challenge shadow u.s. monetary policy increasing. 1 see c. reinhart v. reinhart, “after fall,” macroeconomic challenges: the decade ahead, federal

excessive reserve accumulation prove futile. structural change global economy yield important adjustment real exchange rates. if nominal exchange rate change, adjustment come inflation emerge economy disinflation major advance economies. this wrench adjustment already begun, raise risk debt deflation deficient global demand. at minimum, dynamic reinforce low-interest-rate strategy major advance economy may necessitate round quantitative easing. so mean country catch middle, like canada? i review three aspects:  effect second round quantitative ease (qe2);  implication canadian monetary policy;  potential financial stability implication “low long” interest rates. qe2 implication canada last month, federal reserve launch new program buy us$600 billion longer-term treasury security

kong sar government swiftly roll series measure “stabilise financial system, support enterprise preserve employment”. a key measure help smes launch $100 billion special loan guarantee scheme december 2008. by october year, scheme help 20,000 companies, approve loan amount exceed $98 billion, help secure 330,000 jobs. with recovery local economy improve finance cash flow smes, special loan guarantee scheme cease receive application early next year. since may year, many smes think-tanks suggest hong kong develop market-oriented platform guarantee sme loan upon phase special loan guarantee scheme. this suggestion gain good measure support market society large. the hkmc therefore immediately launch in-depth study market consultation exercise. in mid-november, hkmc announce launch sme finance guarantee scheme 1 january next year. the scheme offer extensive flexible guarantee coverage help smes hong kong obtain sustainable bank finance daily operation purchase equipment etc. also, scheme help bank manage lend risk effectively – bank meet finance need smes without warehouse excessive credit risks. undoubtedly, scheme bring benefit smes, banks, economy employment hong

economy – common challenge keynote address mr jean-pierre landau, second deputy governor bank france, chinese academy social science economic forum, beijing, 11 november 2010. * * * in prepare remarks, i influence work ricardo caballero raghuram rajan (see references) among others. all interpretation error mine. great change take place world economy. the center gravity move asia emerge world. this recognize landmark agreement imf reform reach last g20 ministerial meeting. china become imf’s third shareholder, india move five rank brazil par canada (a g7 country). symmetrically, european representation board reduce equivalent two chair (out nine currently held). at time, face great challenges. output grow fast emerge economy relative shift production fully match rebalancing demand. overall, beyond turbulence cause “hot money”, net capital flow go “uphill” emerge develop economies. that mean poor citizen world lend money richest, allow finance consumption. and financial bubble tend proliferate environment permanently low inflation ample liquidity. i argue phenomenon ascribe two common causes: worldwide base shift primary distribution income; asymmetry financial development among countries. together, combine produce (1) excess save emerge economy (2) strong capital inflow u (3) increase frequency financial boom bust asset price bubble advance emerge economies. let’s look first income distribution. in china, share wage gdp decline 55% 1992 48% 2008. in us, median real wage stagnant last fifteen year despite fact real gdp grow annually 3% period. these deep change mostly drive technology demographics, proportion hotly debated, partly unexplained. in contrast wage developments, consumption trend widely divergent. in china, share consumption go 10 % gdp last decade. in us, consumption keep grow (both absolute gdp share) fuel demand imports. household u could consume save le felt richer. and felt rich value house financial asset rise quick pace trend expect persist. broadly speaking, worldwide equilibrium demand supply good base continue asset price bubble unite states. consider financial development, another kind imbalance show up. the global rise savings, especially emerge world, match equivalent increase supply safe liquid financial assets. this “asset shortage” one fundamental reason bubble erupt many country increase frequency, either real estate financial market both. it also strong impact direction capital flows. only u economy ability generate liquid safe asset significant quantities. u capital market act naturally magnet world savings, especially foreign exchange reserves. in addition, financial engineer allow u institution manufacture complex product look apparently safe, prove fragile. admittedly, internal imbalance huge deficiency supervision regulation bi review 170/2010 1 play role run crisis. but process largely drive capital inflow u look improbable combination liquidity, safety high returns. combine evolution give good picture structural force behind crisis. worldwide shift income distribution generate excess saving, compensate wealth effect bear increase asset prices. since transformation asymmetrically distribute around world, accompany grow imbalance capital flows. obviously, purely domestic factors, especially u play major role amplify underlie imbalances. but, ultimately, crisis bear structural change world economy collective inability adjust. look forward, many feature precrisis environment still us. emerge economy still save high proportion income. a significant part save invest foreign exchange reserves. downward pressure wage subsist. there sign wage dynamic changing, especially china, whose economy deem many analyst reach “lewis turn point” demographic pressure offset increase demand (at least) qualify labor. nevertheless, process likely gradual. a advance economies, bias technical progress pressure emerge world well unemployment may work constrain wage dynamics. a general sense economic insecurity lead increase savings. in country especially europe urgent need strong fiscal consolidation. market discipline act powerfully impose strong consolidation public finance extend period time. therefore, valid question ask: growth world demand come future ? this may sound paradoxical. in emerge world, demand seem booming, and, many analyst future economic growth primarily constrain scarcity natural resource environmental pressures. these real unprecedented call new technological revolution. i optimistic. history teach u malthus intellectual descendant always prove wrong. the whole process economic growth bear ability mankind overcome scarcity human inventiveness technical progress. it won’t different time. i also optimistic long run fundamental rebalancing world economy. income per caput level emerge world progressively converge advance economy present gigantic market opportunity producer countries. at time, tension insecurity create difference income productivity level abate disappear. the transition process, however, may bumpy. unavoidably, advance economies, especially europe, adjust permanent shift world comparative advantages. they increase flexibility and, all, develop preserve precious resource – human capital – education excellence research. emerge economy face dual challenge age reduce inequalities. during transition period, may last several decades, important whole process derail shock crisis bear imbalance world economy. this twin question – (1) level distribution global demand (2) level allocation world save – may matter most. inside g20, broad agreement need rebalance aggregate demand. that share objective create cohesion play essential role 2008 2009 restore confidence set path recovery. the debate still go on, however, three major interrelate issue : first, appropriate pace rebalancing, advance country feel great sense urgency; second, efficient strategies, particular regard exchange rates; finally, broadly, best international financial monetary architecture. 2 bi review 170/2010 i would like offer tentative reflexions. these purely personal thoughts, although i try put perspective incoming french presidency g20. rebalancing global demand easy task. simple arithmetic size effect show amplitude challenge. at word level, compensate one one decrease 1% u consumption, chinese consumption go 7%. in addition, save behaviour deeply root cultural demographic structure societies. in western countries, consumption see ultimate objective economic activity, well fundamental measure welfare. other country may different preferences. in speech one year ago, governor zhou point fact “east asia country influence confucianism, value thrift, self-discipline, … anti-extravagancy”. in period aging, thrift see necessity much virtue. shift income distribution might happen fast strong structural force push direction. public policy (fiscal, social safety nets) certainly role play, take time redeploy implement. finally, consumption pattern differ across country strongly influence difference taste level developments. so, global rebalancing consumption require change production structures. that change – – occur overnight. attempt speed process would result major disruption increase volatility. rebalancing progressive start now. it cannot achieve without adjustment relative prices. in market economies, important producer face right price environment make long term decision invest technology productive capacity. country free – remain free – choose whatever exchange rate regime policy suit best, take account specific national circumstances. real exchange rate adjustment, however, integral part global orderly rebalancing strategy. that wisdom best embody one governor hu xiaolian’s speeches, last july, demonstrate domestic factor price exchange rate adjustment substitute complementary. many interaction economy occur capital rather good markets; this normal “multipolar” world give diversity countries, different preferences, demographic level development. some u save spend. others need capital finance growth. many age want secure future income good safe return investments. we therefore share common interest well function global capital markets. asymmetry financial development prevent u reap benefit save efforts. these asymmetry exist good reasons. in many emerge economies, memory 1997–98 crisis still there. they lead precautionary behavior cautious approach capital market liberalization. obviously, case unrestricted financial development market liberalization somehow weaken crisis. nevertheless, might pay heavy price disorganize state global financial monetary system. while real interest rate historically low, many investment high return undertaken. poor emerge economy growth is, many cases, constrain lack infrastructure. we may face future shortage many essential commodity insufficient investment current period. difference financial system also exacerbate capital flow exchange rate volatility, especially when, case today, monetary policy widely divergent across countries. surely, good future. full harmonization total convergence financial development different country neither desirable feasible. but ensure different financial system interact harmoniously priority. there four possible avenue progress. bi review 170/2010 3 first, great convergence financial regulation approach advance emerge economies. significant advance made. china, together brazil india been, year, full member financial stability board, as, such, participate steer lead effort build resilient efficient global financial system. second, may start think way deal international capital flow volatility. for one give country, capital control may temporarily reduce pressure capital account even permanently limit volatility exchange rate. for whole international system, however, may simply displace pressure country asset class exacerbate, rather reduce, overall volatility. there might way eliminate negative effect create predictable framework define circumstances, modality condition trough temporary permanent control would implemented. third, important country decide open capital market adequately protect external financial shocks. emerge country constantly seek expand foreign exchange reserve 4 percent gdp 1190 20 percent average today. reserve act precaution possible abrupt capital outflows. they also serve provide liquidity domestic financial institutions. they use tool internal – well external – financial stability. the need national reserve could reduce credible mechanism exist provide supply official liquidity multilateral basis. hence current search financial safety net take first stage g20. significant progress achieve direction recent period creation imf new facility new sdr allocation, big ever, equivalent 250 bn usd. more need do work undertake find source international liquidity truly substitutable reserve without create undue excessive moral hazard. and, finally, important question find, future ,reliable international store value. the crisis amplify “asset shortage” instruments, consider riskless, prove vulnerable change financial conditions. the ability private sector create “safe” asset financial innovation prove largely illusory. so, period come may increase demand worldwide risk free asset much le certainty future supply. the search reliable international store value go many decades. when discussion hold build bretton wood system, keynes propose creation new international currency, “bancor” could serve source liquidity store value. thirty year ago, extensive discussion imf creation substitution account. most recently, 2009, governor zhou reopen debate suggested, long run, creation new “super reserve” currency, while, meantime, enhance role status sdr. there good argument create international instrument provide reliable store value. there also conceptual political difficulties. a choice would make true nature “super reserve currency”. would basket exist monies sdr today? or would new “fiat” currency? more fundamentally, new reserve currency would, fact, grant collective guarantee exchange risk. this guarantee would benefit surplus country would give deficit countries. when substitution account discuss 25 year ago, become clear, time would part package encompass explicit, bind symmetric rule balance payment adjustments. most likely, question would raise today creation new reserve currency would part broad framework. that may take time, chinese colleague fond remind u discus issues. 4 bi review 170/2010 bi review 170/2010 5 in meantime, financial development emerge economy go long way towards expand range safe liquid financial asset available domestic international investors. capital market local currency develop significantly last decade fiscal position emerge country dramatically improved. there seem considerable scope regional financial monetary arrangement prosper future. those huge pool save currently available intermediate locally instead go financial system locate advance economies. regional financial market would complement underpin monetary arrangements. asian country work implement progressively scheme chiang mai initiative. we, europe, monitor closely evolution well progressive emergence rmb international currency. a know, long successful history economic, financial monetary integration. we learn lot and, still recently, go many crisis difficulties. nevertheless euro, exist fifteen year ago, stand today one two major world currencies. we certainly don’t pretend experience constitute model example followed. i have, however, one certainty: strong permanently renew spirit cooperation allow u overcome many obstacle reap many benefit term prosperity stability. in world full opportunities, also increasingly complex, may inspiration us. i thank

committee inquiry competition australian bank sector, sydney, 13 december 2010. * * * the reserve bank provide submission committee detail trend lending, costs, margins, fee factual material committee may find use. we course seek answer question submission. perhaps i note general points. first, risk re-priced since early 2007. all u still adjust change implications. it widely hold risk under-priced year then. that say, investor demand little risk compensation expect return – perhaps case didn’t understand risks. so financial institution type could get ample fund cheaply, could pass borrowers. business model take particular advantage low-cost wholesale fund and/or securitisation able provide competitive edge certain markets, particularly (though only) market mortgage lending. but investor around world change attitude risk 2007 2008. the compensation require take risk increased. wholesale fund securitisation expensive. in case securitisation, cost also rise part investor leave market altogether. the increase cost affect financial institutions, vary degrees. a such, also affect competitive landscape. some business model well early state world find hard go now. part competitive advantage erode market developments. the current relationship variable mortgage rate market fund cost make difficult use lender rely securitisation compete major banks. this change attitude risk affect locus competitive forces. whereas four year ago environment one competition among financial institution lend money intense, recently competition raise money intense. various thing happen also bear competitive landscape, fundamental change state world. that said, market remain good deal competitive mid 1990s borrower access much large range products. moreover, overall availability finance purchase house particular seem adequate. the second theme that, market price risk risen, various player want public purse take high price various form support regulatory change. the various idea should, course, assess merits. but important high-level point that, instance least, would appear taxpayer ask shoulder risk, one way another, order facilitate provision private finance. whether, areas, might good idea – much might charge support – course government legislature determine. hopefully inquiry able assist process. bi review 169/2010 1 charles bean: the economic outlook 2011 beyond speech mr charles bean, deputy governor monetary policy bank england, market news international annual seminar, london, 13 december 2010. * * * good morning! christmas traditional time look back event past year contemplate new year might bring. today i shall follow tradition take stock economic development past year look challenge ahead. many recent activity indicator somewhat comforting. global growth recover strongly back strong rebound emerge economies, imf project expansion close 5% year 4% next year. here unite kingdom, also see nascent recovery; output third quarter was, accord late ons estimates, 2.8% high year earlier. that marginally strong projection most-likely path four-quarter growth make year early august 2009 inflation report. around half growth past year was, however, contribution stockbuilding, business reduce rate inventory decumulation and, cases, start rebuild stocks. that provide temporary boost aggregate demand growth. and contribution public spend growth also set fall government’s plan fiscal consolidation get underway. so economic prospect depend crucially private final domestic demand net export pick baton; fortunately sign handover might start take place late quarterly data. private final domestic demand fell sharply recession. consumer spend decrease 4% five quarter 2008q2, prospect reduce real income lead household cut borrow build precautionary save balances. during period, household save rate rise almost six percentage points. since then, see modest recovery consumer spending, measure cbi distributive trade survey suggest recovery likely continue final quarter year. the prospect household spend next year beyond depend crucially households’ expectation future incomes, well balance sheet positions. consumer confidence measure generally weaken year, possibly reflect concern prospective fiscal consolidation. an open question far impact consolidation already take board household spend decisions, much adjustment yet come. the annual survey households’ financial position carry bank nmg consulting1 include special question topic find that, majority household expect affect way, le half far respond spend less, work long hour look new job. that suggest may adjustment come. investment fell even sharply private consumption recession – almost 20% – high cost reduce availability finance, couple sharply heighten uncertainty economic prospects, lead business cancel postpone 1 see “the financial position british households: evidence 2010 nmg consult survey” mette nielsen, silvia pezzini, kate reinold richard williams, bank england quarterly bulletin, winter 2010. bi review 169/2010 1 investment projects. while outlook remain highly uncertain, improvement financial market real economy since mid-2009 likely contribute modest recovery see businesses’ capital spend past year. and though continue tight credit condition may restrain investment spend small medium-sized enterprises, bulk capital expenditure carry large businesses. they appear le credit-constrained also good access capital markets. moreover, despite downturn, corporate financial position appear relatively healthy. so availability finance unlikely major brake. rather investment spend likely restrain juxtaposition mute product demand overhang spare capacity. for almost long i member bank’s monetary policy committee, point need re-balancing composition demand juncture, away domestic demand towards net exports. accompany re-balancing would re-orientation structure activity away business predominantly meet domestic need towards produce internationally tradable good services. the substantial depreciation sterling – around quarter since august 2007 – facilitate re-balancing make profitable produce export compete imports. for example, relative unit labour cost unite kingdom 25% low crisis. the contribution net export recovery – least late gdp release – somewhat disappointing. net export reduce growth total 0.7 percentage point past four quarters, import growth outstrip exports. a world output, weight accord countries’ importance uk trade, grow somewhat fast period uk activity, weakness uk’s net export performance cannot attribute rapid recovery here. some weakness perhaps ascribe strong import growth associate work stock cycle, inventory relatively import intensive. but close investigation suggest weakness especially concentrate export financial services, doubt part reflect impact bank crisis. foreigners’ demand uk financial service may plausibly continue somewhat low crisis, weakness may persist. in contrast, sign depreciation sterling expect effect market share good exporters. that also reflect robust growth manufacture output business survey report buoyant export orders. so far, le sign low level sterling lead substitution import domestically produce good services. but likely producer internationally tradable good service take time respond improve opportunity associate low real exchange rate, especially investment foreign distribution network repatriation off-shored activity required. so, thing equal, seem reasonable expect impact low level sterling net export continue build next year. the prospect net export obviously depend response past depreciation sterling, also demand uk’s main export markets. while global growth strong past year, much emerge economy presently account relatively small proportion uk exports. growth patchy develop economies. in unite states, follow series soft indicator late summer early autumn, u federal reserve announce additional purchase u treasuries. and obama administration seek inject fiscal stimulus, incorporate widely expect extension bush administration tax cuts, also temporary cut payroll taxes. the extension federal reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programme prove controversial, u critic assert inflationary policymakers emerge 2 bi review 169/2010 economy claim attempt engineer beggar-my-neighbour devaluation boost capital inflow foster asset-price bubbles. these criticism seem mostly mark. central bank undertake asset purchase finance issuance central bank money order boost nominal spending. they depress range longer-term real yield raise asset prices. the early phase quantitative ease unite state indeed appear low longer-term nominal real yield would otherwise been.2 this time around, transmission channel rather different, fall anticipation asset purchases, longer-term u yield rose. but policy prove inflationary medium long run result excessive nominal spend growth, hardly appear likely current juncture. only federal reserve fail tighten policy promptly recovery take hold excessive inflation likely problem. the criticism outside seem almost misplaced. while quantitative ease likely associate exchange rate depreciation, also boost domestic spending. demand country therefore rise result increase demand unite states, well fall result appreciation currencies. these normal mechanism operate official interest rate cut one country. it empirical matter dominant channel. quantitative ease consequently different character sterilise exchange rate intervention, merely redistribute global demand. there is, though, substance concern stimulatory monetary policy develop economy encourage search yield capital inflow emerge economies. so justification imposition temporary restraint inflows. but asset price pressure building, seem likely relate overly loose monetary financial policy country unwillingness allow exchange rate bear strain. it euro area, however, particular importance unite kingdom. in aggregate, euro area look undergo steady recovery, dissimilar ours. output third quarter 1.9% high year earlier, roughly line euro area’s historical average growth rate. but mask markedly divergent performance prospect within euro area. germany grow rapidly, lead part expansion export boom asian economies. the country periphery are, however, struggle face significant fiscal structural challenges. while country euro-area periphery confront specific challenges, need restore competitiveness without option devaluation. instead, absence effective structural reform, face prospect sustain low growth order drive wage prices. that make task stabilise public debt harder. support greece ireland imf rest european union give country breathe space undertake necessary adjustments. financial support country may may prove necessary – time tell. but important thing u whether intensification difficulty euro-area periphery could also derail recovery here. 2 analysis early phase quantitative ease unite state suggest purchase order 12–14% gdp low longer-term government corporate bond yield around 70–100 basis point relative would otherwise been. see michael joyce, ana lasaosa, ibrahim

greece, ireland, portugal spain without much difficulty. there is, though, possibility indirect effect arise interconnectedness cross-border operation european bank could amplify impact. so adverse

transmission channel real economy. an intensification sovereign debt problem euro area could therefore administer blow recovery here. but give high degree uncertainty, little mpc deal risk ahead crystallisation. while uk output growth come much line expectations, cannot say primary objective, inflation. back august last year, central projection cpi inflation around 1.5% now. but inflation markedly strong – 3.2% late reading. why inflation much higher, especially give expectation growth largely fulfilled? there three factor account this.3 first, energy non-oil commodity price substantially high summer 2009. by convention, base forecast variable future prices, relatively flat time. the buoyancy commodity price since reflect rebound global activity, especially strength emerge economies. in addition, temporary supply factor boost price agricultural commodities. at present appear margin spare capacity oil market, may permit global growth remain strong without put upward pressure energy price immediately. but low elasticity supply commodity mean prices, relative finish good services, may continue drift upwards. that would constitute additional headwind unite kingdom. a second factor behind unexpectedly high inflation appear great expect pass-through final price depreciation sterling august 2007. evidence unite kingdom country great moderation suggest pass-through fallen, perhaps inflation expectation good anchored. we expect something similar occasion too. in event, strength uk good inflation, relative g7 economies, suggest pass-through depreciation fact rather greater, similar great moderation. the third potential ingredient behind high inflation moderate drag margin spare capacity economy. pay growth subdue recession, help ensure unemployment rise far le many commentator feared. rather puzzle price side, price high relative cost expected. that could indicate margin spare capacity large collapse activity might suggest. on current estimates, output presently 10% continuation pre-crisis trend. but historical experience indicate output loss – relative pre-crisis trend – bank crisis tend highly persistent. that suggest 3 see page 48–49 august 2010 inflation report this. 4 bi review 169/2010 crisis associate impairment supply capacity too. business survey consistent this, imply margin spare capacity firm relatively limit – fact much large burst dotcom bubble. but that, difficult find direct evidence supply impairment. for instance, liquidation run le 1% (compared 3% 1990s recession). one resolution puzzle may producer mothball capacity, could, cost, bring use demand condition warranted. the mpc’s view current elevate level inflation likely persist near term – indeed central expectation inflation somewhat high outside commentators. ultimately, however, period elevate inflation prove temporary. the standard rate vat set rise begin next year, drop annual comparison year later, inflation rate likely fall back sharply. the impact price sterling’s past depreciation start wane. and relatively moderate expansion expect next year two ensure some, albeit uncertain, brake inflation spare capacity. we see mute underlie inflation pressure euro area unite states, reflect spare capacity economies, reason believe unite kingdom behave differently temporary influence subside. but risk scenario. they twofold. first, strong global growth continue generate upward pressure price commodity tradable good generally. and, second, period elevate inflation cause medium-term inflation expectation drift up, lead high rate increase wage prices. measure near-term household inflation move line mpc’s assessment near-term inflation, rise longer-term measure considerably muted. and measure derive inflation swap suggest expectation financial market participant five year ahead remain stable. but give unexpected strength inflation recent months, risk probably increase late. so shall watch indicators, impact wage prices, like proverbial hawks. what implication monetary policy? the recovery far turn broadly line expect year ago, outlook growth remain highly uncertain. though inflation run well target likely continue yet, beyond end next year fall back near committee’s 2% target. in light outlook, i believe make appropriate use “constrained discretion” grant u chancellor’s remit, look temporarily elevate inflation medium term order avoid unnecessary volatility output. tighten policy sharply order deal currently elevate level inflation would simply put brake recovery unnecessarily would make inflation likely fall target medium term. if go plan, however, private final demand continue pick baton fiscal consolidation proceeds, margin spare capacity shrink juncture become appropriate begin withdraw current extraordinary degree monetary stimulus. and, point comes, mpc aim timely, measured, fashion. a 2010 draw close, good news, then, recovery, widely, remain track, follow sharp downturn activity since great depression. such outcome mean guarantee twelve month ago; must grateful. but remain significant challenge year ahead. in many develop countries, after-effects financial crisis still linger, form bank still overly reliant official support, fragile household business confidence, bloat public sector deficit debt. moreover, rapid recovery emerge market bi review 169/2010 5 6 bi

kong master’s degree 2009–2010 graduation ceremony, hong kong, 17 december 2010. * * * professor wong, professor lee, faculty members, graduates, lady gentlemen, it great honour invite speak today’s graduation ceremony. i happy see many fine men woman graduate today. all make well earn accomplishment make parent family feel proud. on joyful day, clearly time celebration photograph-taking family friends. however, may, quiet moment own, ask question : what would i become 10, 20 30 years’ time? have i choose right field career? what take succeed make name society many cuhk senior do me? these pertinent question certainly i ask question i attend graduation ceremony cuhk 34 year ago. in talk successful people, i sure u idols. but people disagree i refer bill gate prime example success. we know bill gate set profitable software company call microsoft. bill gate rich man world spend time charity work worldwide. bill gate clearly idol lot people, old young, symbol great success. but come bill gate become successful? many say genius, computer program business. but simple? i recently come across book write malcolm gladwell, refer interest thesis call 10,000 hour rule. to understand thesis, look close bill gate’s life. no doubt bill gate clever extremely talented computer programming. however, make special distinct many equally clever talented people past three four decade time gate drop harvard sophomore year mid-1970s set little backyard software company, already 8 solid year non-stop computer program experience, something exceptionally unique time young man 20. for number peculiar reasons, gate start program venture early 1968 eighth grade kid high school seattle. in days, even university student usa would find easy access mainframe computers, let alone non-stop programming. but gate opportunity advantage do lot lot programming, probably 10,000 hours, start microsoft, subsequently outperform competitor field huge margins. the question i this: would bill gate still bill gate know opportunity open early year adolescence enable jump start program career ahead many equally clever talented people usa? i don’t quite know answer, let turn another example great success last century musical world – beatles. be person bear 1950s, surprise i fond beatles. john lennon, paul mccartney, george harrison ringo starr clearly very, talented. ever since launch hugely successful tour usa february 1964, beatles several decade become centre rock roll world. but true beatles become good successful simply music geniuses? bi review 174/2010 1 2 bi review 174/2010 be simple? let’s look close day become idol world. before 1960, beatles still struggle high school band. however, strange connections, beatles get invite play night club hamburg 1960–1962. within year half’s time, beatles play hamburg club 270 nights. these hamburg club kind music hall proper concert conducted. they like drink club lot people come go constantly live entertainment stage performed. the beatles perform 4, 6 even 8 hour night. because many live performance long hours, beatles greatly improve stamen team work. moreover, try different variety music song order satisfy customers. so, time beatles make celebrate u tour february 1964, already do amaze 1,200 live performances. this astonish unusual number. in day even now, rock roll band able many live performance entire careers. again question i is: would beatles good talented without hamburg? there enlighten study conduct ericsson 1990s. the study show violin student elite berlin academy music, rank top class attain performer soloist standard student practise most: 10,000 hour age twenty. student rank next level, i.e. professional quite soloist standard, practise less, 8,000 hour age twenty. for student next level down, practise around 4,000 hours. the result study seem suggest that, student reach certain level aptitude talent, least good enough admission academy music, practise diligently tend yield best outcome. the study find student practise 10,000 hour fail reach top level. on hand, study find student achieve top level without put huge amount practice. the reason i wish share fascinate story today pure academic interest curiosity. to me, story carry message profound importance. the message success precisely, great success, come naturally. it often easy say bill gate beatles become idol world bear geniuses. since u geniuses, natural conclude cannot ever aspire succeed way did. however, really dig deep story great success, probably find even clever talented people make use every opportunity come across develop perfect talent transform good great, great awesome. while one cannot turn genius one, still decide, own, hard work upgrade excel whatever profession pursuing. there course guarantee work really hard definitely achieve great success, least chance. if don’t even give try, hope. it matter way may wish go long fully aware choice. that choice, shape career whole life, alone.

jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 16 december 2010. * * * my remark today focus three topics. i start look situation international financial markets. i speak snb’s financial market activity connection two core task monetary policy implementation foreign exchange reserve management. finally, i would like briefly discus plan pan-european security settlement system, target2-securities. international financial market the situation international financial market reflect gradual global economic recovery. at time, market continue affect fallout financial crisis doubt whether current global economic recovery robust enough reduce exist financial imbalances. on stock markets, volatility trend downwards past half-year, remain high. share corporate bond benefit investors’ grow risk appetite, ongoing expansionary monetary condition good corporate results. on bond markets, contrast, uncertainty has, anything, grown. with global economic recovery, yield long-term government bond pick low levels. in europe risk premia heavily indebted sovereign rise markedly. the imbalance many government budget take problematic proportions. wide-ranging cut announce affect countries, international rescue package put together, first greece latterly also ireland, order prevent situation escalating. the market will, however, monitor effectiveness announce cut support measure closely. the problem sovereign indebtedness europe remain source considerable uncertainty. a high level uncertainty also remain foreign exchange markets. the continue high volatility couple strongly divergent exchange rate developments. over last years, number currency appreciate substantially two major world currencies: euro u dollar (cf. chart 1). these currency shift negatively affect export capability country whose currency appreciated; also heavy impact monetary terms. this because, order keep appreciation check, country intervene foreign exchange markets, others even resort restriction movement capital flows. the result global rise foreign exchange reserves. indeed, almost double past four year (cf. chart 2). the high level foreign exchange reserve ultimately reflect substantial global economic imbalances. a know, swiss franc also appreciate substantially wake financial crisis. look swiss franc’s real trade-weighted external value change long term (cf. chart 3), see that, historically, period swiss franc strength alternate period weakness. the fact current swiss franc strength prove particularly burdensome swiss economy due partly rapidity appreciation, also uncertain economic climate. bi review 173/2010 1 diversification foreign exchange reserve a aware, foreign exchange intervention since march 2009 result snb’s foreign exchange reserve expand chf 200 billion. a primarily buy euros, euro hold account 70% foreign exchange reserve one point. in meantime, reduce euro’s share foreign exchange reserve substantially, 55%. moreover, diversify foreign currency risk invest first time australian singapore dollars, well swedish kronor danish kroner. together, currency make 3% foreign exchange reserves. the majority non-euro hold continue u dollar (25%), japanese yen (10%), canadian dollar pound sterling. finally, increase proportion foreign exchange reserve make equities, 4% back 10%. this comprehensive reposition carry gradually, market problem absorb it. we thus able considerably reduce risk concentration foreign exchange holdings. an examination diversification measure form part annual investment strategy formulation process. normalisation swiss franc money market the effect monetary policy crisis measure introduce recent year also felt area monetary policy implementation. by buy foreign currency swiss francs, create structural liquidity surplus swiss franc market. we since largely reabsorb excess liquidity via set instrument already well established. liquidity absorbed, one hand, weekly issuance snb’s money market bill (snb bills) term 4, 12, 24 48 weeks, daily one-week repo transaction (cf. chart 4). we currently use instrument absorb around chf 140 billion liquidity, chf 110 billion account snb bills. this bring banks’ sight deposits, ultimately determine level interest rate money market, around chf 20 billion. compare period prior financial crisis, level liquidity still high. however, experience liquidity-absorbing operation show u reabsorb excess liquidity time. this allow u manage three-month libor. there liquidity overhang bank system result interventions. this pose problem monetary policy, reduce monetary base directly liquidity-absorbing operations. since absorb liquidity tie form securities, bank cannot use either mean payment (like cash sight deposits) satisfy minimum reserve requirements. to extent snb bill purchase non-banks, customer deposit bank system decrease, thereby directly reduce broad monetary aggregates. the decisive factor determine degree monetary policy restrictiveness remain level interest rate money market. and able control level tailor scope condition liquidity-absorbing operation accordingly. the shift liquidity regime bring certain number change snb central bank operation banks. for instance, normally conduct operation bank need place excess liquidity. the group bank fairly large, consist 80 mainly domestic banks. something long offer, contrast, regular refinancing. bank cover refinance need via money market. refinance snb available exceptional circumstance via liquidity-shortage finance facility, high rate interest. access facility thus part domestic banks’ liquidity arrangements. a effect regime shift money market snb pay bank interest liquidity-absorbing operations, whereas previously receive interest payment provide liquidity. the snb’s additional interest cost – amount chf 100 million current year – offset additional income correspondingly high foreign exchange reserves. 2 bi review 173/2010 experience show that, long term, income diversify foreign exchange hold exceed interest cost swiss franc money market, even exchange rate loss take account. however, clearly see year’s income statement, fluctuation income large. swiss market consider participation target2-securities, european security settlement system finally, i would like briefly discus plan pan-european security settlement system. target2-securities (t2s) design replace, either totally partially, exist domestic settlement system national central security depository (csds), drastically reduce cost cross-border security settlement europe. the european central bank (ecb) regard t2s contribution harmonisation integration european market. t2s schedule go operation 2014. the ecb’s project also impact swiss financial centre. the question swiss financial market infrastructure connect important bank snb. in 2009, agreement snb, six si ag – swiss csd subsidiary six group – sign memorandum intent participate t2s euro-denominated securities. this would allow bank switzerland settle security transaction euro cheaply. t2s multicurrency dimension, ecb interest integrate currency system. consequently, snb, agreement six group banks, currently investigate suitability t2s settle swiss franc-denominated securities. for happen, snb would permit snb account swiss franc maintain t2s (similar swiss interbank clear sic), allow bank hold part central bank deposit (sight deposits) swiss franc account t2s. the management snb account within foreign system would significant change need investigate thoroughly. these investigation currently underway, decision snb whether settle swiss franc transaction t2s expect mid-may 2011. bi review 173/2010 3 4 bi review 173/2010 bi review

fifth high-level seminar eurosystem latin american central banks, madrid, 10 december 2010. * * * good morning welcome again. more three year global financial system start show serious sign instability two year verge global economic financial meltdown, world economy seem avoid risk, back strong coordinate policy response. nevertheless, strengthen uneven risk economic financial instability still persistent significant regions, like euro area. indeed, hard emphasise sufficiently challenge ahead crucial present juncture future monetary union. on contrary, latin american economy learn lesson severe financial economic disruption experience distant past, challenge currently face similar characterise period strong growth prior financial crisis. these different set present circumstance make today’s exchange mutual experience policy discussion particularly interesting. the title today’s seminar choose almost year ago, couldn’t timely: global rebalancing, asset price policy responses. from today’s perspective, three issue refer – le directly – basic challenge tackle make present uneven unbalance global recovery sustainable. with mind, i organise open remark around three topics. first, i deal global rebalancing achieve context diverge economic prospect advance emerge market economies. second, i address recent behaviour global financial flow challenge emerge market economy face regard, include risk asset price overvaluation. and finally, i touch briefly upon need enhance policy cooperation global level, especially economy progressively leave bad crisis behind. let move first issue: global rebalancing world economic outlook. although global imbalance consider one major risk face world economy crisis, risk finally materialise expect form disorderly adjustment exchange rates, disruptive effect global financial stability. nevertheless, even large unsustainable deficit finance accumulation reserve surplus emerge economy ultimate cause global economic financial crisis, still argue provide support build-up financial excess lead it. in aftermath crisis, global imbalance reduce consequence financial retrenchment severe downturn activity worldwide. however, large portion correction likely merely cyclical. a matter fact, global recovery take hold, new widen imbalance start perceive year foresee continue 2011. indeed, basic structural factor underlie global imbalance remain essentially place; crisis bring potentially important change nature imbalances. a trade capital flow experience sudden stop crisis, immediate impact deep economy open trade – collapse – high net external finance needs. when trade recovered, export economy tend bi review 172/2010 1 rebound strongly, country large external deficit generally lag behind. in many advance economies, particularly run deficits, private domestic demand remain severely impair adjustment process need private sector deleverage. a result process private sector save rate increase sharply public sector balance rapidly deteriorated. in end, external deficit reflect anymore large finance need private sector – crisis – public sector. high fiscal deficit rapidly increase debt level advance economy consequence crisis policy response it, government try make sharp collapse private sector activity support financial sectors, context rapidly shrink public revenues. give deep concern public debt sustainability bring developments, key policy challenge advance economy achieve fiscal consolidation, even time expect last weakness domestic demand. european economy act resolutely pursuit fiscal consolidation. in particular, spain undergo intense adjustment process halve current account deficit (from 9,6% 2007 around 5% year). the government implement ambitious fiscal consolidation plan, combine tax increase sizable spend cut and, importantly, adjustment long-term expenditures, particular pension system, strong positive impact long-term sustainability public finances. but success adjustment depend first foremost achieve solid sustainable growth rate. this goal require implement necessary structural reform increase productivity efficiency economy, establish balance stable pattern growth. the important reform already begin introduced, particular bear labour market financial sector, continuous progress needed. the third pillar spanish action plan restructure financial sector adaptation economy le dependent credit leverage growth. restructure turn two essential aspects: downsize bank sector whole, maintain sufficiently large backstop ensure capital required, use necessary overburden public debt, matter small spanish public debt is. the hard time characterise protract process economic financial adjustment familiar many latin american countries, experience sovereign bank crisis past decades. but avoid time. indeed, latin america prove outstandingly resilient time global hardship, many emerge economy – perhaps exception eastern european countries. before crisis, latin american country dramatically reduce vulnerabilities, precisely result lesson learn previous crisis. accordingly, severe problem overborrowing external imbalance sort experience industrial countries, current adjustment, significant size, swift. recovery asia latin america prove strong drive increasingly domestic demand. all all, improve fundamental relative industrial country place emerge market economy much good position resume high level growth. go back debate popular first half 2008, say that, all, emerge country able “decouple” dire growth prospect advance economies. but still uncertain whether solid growth emerge economy sustain medium term external demand major industrial economy remain subdue protract period. move one step forward, ask extent emerge economy act effective engine growth advance economy external 2 bi review 172/2010 demand. there clear incentive emerge market economy forcefully promote growth domestic demand contribute, time, rebalancing world economy render global growth sustainable. let turn second topic: financial flow financial globalisation. increase capital inflow emerge market economy time strong domestic growth probably central concern economy today; however, come situation risk “sudden stop” become serious, end 2008, current bonanza appear bad outcome all. yet large capital inflow together strong domestic demand pressure combine make expansionary economic conditions, pose risk economic management form overheating, inflation appreciation pressures, credit boom asset price overvaluation. emerge economy traditionally prone “booms busts” “sudden stops” mature economies, help explain policy awareness deal strong credit growth currency volatility. total capital inflow emerge market economies, also latin america, strongly rebound fall late 2008 2009, expect continue grow medium term. drive development combination solid economic prospect sizable interest rate differential relative advance economies. which two factor dominate hard say ex-ante important implication term economic policy management situation. on one hand, current capital inflow emerge market simply reflect perceive relative economic strength go forward, expect largely permanent, therefore, appreciation exchange rate would take granted. such choice would provide monetary policy degree freedom, allow tighten suit cyclical conditions, rebalancing growth towards domestic demand. however, short-term interest rate differential also play role explain new wave inflows, reluctance emerge market country tolerate large appreciation would understandable, also dynamic component inflow – portfolio equity debt flow – volatile subject eventual reversals. however, limit upward exchange rate flexibility may attract capital inflows, expectation future appreciations, turn thereby self-defeating strategy. in summary, choose right policy mix become challenge task many emerge market economies, absence globally coordinate policy response. face uncertain times, latin american economy apply mix policy attain multiple objective minimise risks. the mix includes, differ degree intensity, monetary policy tightening, foreign exchange intervention reserve accumulation, macro-prudential policy and, cases, capital controls. the use capital control traditionally controversial, distort market effectiveness back empirical evidence. but must acknowledge shift opinion favour – least last-resort instrument – even among institution imf. in turn, shift probably reflect change perceive balance benefit cost associate financial excesses. nevertheless, important bear mind capital control also entail negative externality global economy. while fully convince benefit financial globalisation, topic devote seminar 2006, i concern risk financial deglobalisation arise wake crisis. there much discussion risk trade protectionism consequence crisis, risk financial protectionism least significant probably evident. for instance, national rescue plan address financial crisis may jeopardise level play field must underpin cross-country financial flows. in similar vein, capital control could induce bi review 172/2010 3 market segmentation trigger spiral would erode progress achieve financial integration past decades. let specific bank flow lesson global financial crisis. the crisis emphasise vulnerability cross-country bank flows, quickly may retrench time stress. such retrenchment important transmission channel financial strain global financial crisis. however, bank behave equally; lend prove resilient others. recent research1 performance cross-border lend emerge market recent crisis yield number interest conclusions. among them, lend spanish bank latin america resilient lend international banks, behave like domestic bank contribute impact foreign shock credit interest rates. the relative stability spanish bank flow bank business model quality supervision. spanish bank latin america traditionally operate subsidiary model, whereby financially autonomous head office comply host country’s capital requirement deposit insurance schemes. in turn, supervisory responsibility share host country home country supervisors. another factor resilience behind business model spanish bank latin america focus retail banking, tend le volatile closely link real economy wholesale investment banking. both emphasis retail bank principle financial autonomy subsidiary induce bank fund primarily deposit base host country. this reliance domestic fund favour “business usual” even home country endure financial stress, help reduce financial vulnerability host country mitigate exposure external flows. i aware even subsidiary model prove resilience crisis, may involve cost term liquidity management, alternative bank model may virtue depend nature bank business. with due attention limit financial vulnerabilities, question model cross-border bank address necessary flexibility. in case, relatively mild recession favourable prospect bank business latin america encourage spanish bank maintain even increase activity region time hardship home. this last factor indeed example benefit preserve financial globalisation: strong economic prospect latin america help spanish company build important buff deterioration domestic market, important contribution financial stability. let briefly address third final point today: need maintain high degree global policy cooperation. the immediate crisis response international community first coordinate revamp g20. the crisis showed, one hand, national policy systemic economy long neglect spillover policy country and, time, policy entrench unsustainable pattern growth. in addition, mention before, crisis expose country sudden severe liquidity shortages. against background, g20 pledge significant strengthen global surveillance global financial safety nets. the measure take coordination involve highlight remarkable unity achieve response crisis. however, recovery gather steam different speeds, 1 see kamil rai (2010), galindo, izquierdo rojas-suarez (2009). 4 bi review 172/2010 bi review 172/2010 5 dissent surfaced. although difference policy completely unexpected collapse scenario reduced, show international financial architecture still lack sufficient leverage coordinate interest different countries. symptom imperfect coordination see across board today and, unfortunately, euro area exception. a i mention illustrate above, lack coordination lead national response generate negative externalities. recover sense common purpose share height crisis remain essence design right policy global level. in circumstances, would paramount importance reinforce effort keep cooperation dialogue open, seminar intend contribute goal. the area international cooperation definitely need construction global safety net way reduce global financial risks. a wide use could help mitigate certain policy may detrimental global stability collective standpoint, excessive reserve accumulation. in respect, additional work need improve incentive associate imf lend facility emerge market economy address effectively traditional problem associate (for instance, stigma problem). international forum well suit resolve coordination problems. that bring end introduction seminar. a see programme, three session take topic i addressed. each session organise panel discussion facilitate presentation exchange different views, three panellist side atlantic. after panel, allot sufficient time open general discussion. finally, end today’s proceedings, president trichet make close remark seminar. i hope intense productive day’s discussion. without delay, i give floor friend governor carlos costa, chair first session seminar global rebalancing. thank stanley fischer: israel’s economy summary address professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, israel business conference, tel aviv, 13 december 2010. * * * israel’s economy well, still many long-term goal need deal with. each one need approach differently, require hard work difficult decisions. i outline i consider major challenge confront u next decade. first, must ask strategy lead u towards long-term growth. it clear israel’s economy, like every open economy, must continue base export engine growth open competition economies. the result international test show persistent decline relative achievement israeli student indicate must continue promote education system solve problem face segment across entire age structure. the problem education directly connect problem poverty, israel concentrate two sector population – ultra-orthodox, arab sector. only 30 percent ultra-orthodox men participate work force, inevitable result large part population poverty line. in arab sector main problem low level employment women, well discrimination, need improve education system. if deal problem unable maintain standard live – advance economies. israel also suffer lack infrastructures, relate that, bureaucracy, slow decision making, low level public-sector efficiency. our geopolitical situation clearly another factor; problem would solved, standard live whole region, israel too, would improve significantly. the problem i enumerate till long-term ones. i turn short-term macroeconomic issue come within scope responsibility central bank. the main goal bank israel, bank israel law pass knesset year, preservation price stability, i.e., keep inflation 1 percent 3 percent year. in addition, bank’s objective work towards achievement goal government’s economic policy, particular growth, employment narrow social gaps, maintain stability financial system proper functioning. recently inflation within target range, probably remain within end year. inflation expectation next year, however, relatively high. a expectation around upper limit target inflation range, present serious problem stage, task ensure inflation exceed upper limit target. to achieve require slightly tight monetary policy. let u turn second goal, employment. the rate unemployment, increase crisis decline recovery almost pre-crisis level, recently rise slightly. this, effect, good news, unemployment rate increase increase rate participation labor force, drop number employ persons. if rate participation risen, rate unemployment would today 5.5 percent. our function also promote economic growth, therefore also keep eye development exchange rate. the late figure show export remain steady import declined, expect current account surplus increase despite relatively strong shekel exchange rate. nonetheless, must continue support exports, bi review 172/2010 1 2 bi review 172/2010 therefore continue intervene foreign currency market, like every country, must prepare every possible economic scenario. with regard financial stability, currently mainly concern development house market. the ministry finance report price new house fallen, central bureau statistic (cbs) report overall house price continue increase. until trend real estate market become clearer, bank israel must ensure bubble house price develop would harm financial stability. the best solution boost supply house thus low prices, together ministry finance examine way that. meanwhile, i said, must ensure financial stability maintained. another issue i would like address medium term. the question ask whether recent discovery natural gas major impact israel’s economy. it soon answer. we continue encourage various investor keep search gas, must await results. the immediate issue royalties, review sheshinski committee. i support committee’s approach, aim find way divide gas profit entrepreneur search find gas israel’s citizens. in context i refer i say committee’s recommendation publish i stand behind view i express then. the gas discovery raise relate issue, know dutch disease. i state past opinion right way deal problem norwegian model, royalty relevant government’s tax revenue invest sovereign fund. the fund invest income abroad, government’s income investment stable time, fund moderate short-term effect gas income exchange rate, effect could prove disastrous tradable good industries, happen netherlands countries. i would like introduce next speaker. dr jihad al-wazir, governor chairman board palestine monetary authority (pma), bear 1963. dr al-wazir obtain ph.d. business administration loughborough university unite kingdom, past serve deputy minister finance act minister finance palestinian authority. relation bank israel pma dr al-wazir’s leadership mark effective productive cooperation, i hope continue so. deepak mohanty: investment finance – cause private investment remain relatively low asia? welcome remark

club economic journalists, frankfurt main, 13 december 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, it true pleasure participate meet co-organised international club frankfurt economic journalists. i vividly remember interest discussion december 2008. at time, i take opportunity discus change central bank communication. today, i would like focus current situation regard economic monetary union. let start quote famous speech that, accord ancient greek historian thucydides, athenian statesman leader pericles deliver fellow citizen peloponnesian war 2400 year ago: “our constitution copy law neighbour states; rather pattern others imitator ourselves. it administration favour many instead few; call democracy.”1 a democracy periclean athens 2400 year ago, construction europe establish institutional pattern copy. the european union euro area shape new form cooperation integration sovereign states. the found father economic monetary union (emu) build european house foundations. they could count neither guideline predetermine rules. we still progressing. an ambitious agenda lie front european leaders. it visionary agenda, despite current challenge pursue determination. serious work currently way underpin macroeconomic financial stability euro area. we know call determination, resolve solid sense direction. for concern monetary policy, rest assure european central bank continue deliver efficient policy response retain posture “credible alertness” adopt since outbreak financial turmoil back august 2007. this posture include standard monetary policy, implement interest rate changes, non-standard policies, implemented, essence, special liquidity operation intervention bond markets. the ecb’s govern council demonstrate strong ability preserve price stability one challenge period modern monetary history, period could lead repeat great depression 1930s. not surprisingly advance economies, stress bad financial economic crisis since world war ii, call reflect weakness economic financial structure appropriate reform redress medium long term macroeconomic macro-financial strategies. this case unite states. this case japan. it case european union euro area well. my plan tonight precisely ass institutional framework euro area highlight origin tension currently experience plausible solution would help restore market confidence consolidate build block emu. 1 thucydides (431 bc): the history peloponnesian war (translated richard crawley). bi review 171/2010 1 a name suggests, “economic monetary union” two attributes: one “economic” one “monetary.” the monetary attribute union refer ecb, mandate independence. the “economic” aspect union comprise fiscal regime enshrine stability growth pact; national framework economic policy, include macroeconomic policy financial supervision; system mutual surveillance. the development currently witness europe’s economy “economic” functions. they essentially three origins: unsound fiscal policy number member states; inappropriate macroeconomic supervisory policy number member states; overall inadequate system surveillance. this triangle lie behind current situation. and let make clear: triangle include monetary policy. *** the “monetary” side: price stability euro area the “m” side emu relatively straightforward assess. the treaty assign ecb primary responsibility maintain price stability euro area medium term. we almost 12 year experience euro: sufficiently long span time provide evaluation successful ecb deliver mandate. you know outset ecb set clear numerical benchmark, public transparent yardstick. the ecb’s govern council define price stability annual rate inflation euro area 2% medium terms. the govern council also declare that, pursue mandate, aim – within range value – inflation rate medium term close 2%. let emphasize track record solid. over first 12 year existence euro, average annual inflation rate euro area 1.97%. this best result euro area least 50 year despite number economic political shock face since began, 1999, new institution, new currency new framework monetary policy-making. it achieve environment positive growth per caput term virtually unite states. it achieve environment employment growth employment rise 14 million. and achieve entire continent 330 million people. furthermore, period, inflation expectation generally align definition price stability. even height financial crisis, situation high uncertainty, inflation expectation remain anchored. today, witness october read consensus forecast, well survey professional forecaster euro zone barometer, remain anchored, read 1.9% 5 year horizon. the recent eurosystem staff economic projection – span short time horizon – also reflect stability inflation look forward. our monetary policy strategy communicate clear sense direction. the sustain anchor expectation make possible ecb ease policy stance response crisis without enter pre-commitments future path policy rate. our definition price stability guide citizen economic decision act built-in stabiliser deep phase crisis. the “economic” side: sound sustainable fiscal policy let turn main contention remarks: tension experience today euro area sovereign debt market find deep cause countries’ policy 2 bi review 171/2010 slippage past years. these slippage concentrate “e” side emu. first, fiscal policy country align requirement lay stability growth pact. second macroeconomic policy euro area country fully consistent participation monetary union found price stability. to sure, look euro area aggregate, compare euro area major global partners, fiscal problem appear relatively modest. next year, average euro area budget deficit order 4.6%. by 2012 expect decline 3.9% (source ec autumn 2010 economic forecast). these expect number half correspond expect figure u japan. the problem, source current tension clearly reside national fiscal developments, notably localise country do enough correct imbalance prepare difficult times, time still good. we know several years, fiscal policy european country breach letter spirit stability growth pact. the pact call budget close balance surplus cycle, deficit always 3% gdp public debt level 60% gdp. when year ago become clear important country fiscal policy would able meet rule stability growth pact, policy change pact. this clearly dark moment history european policy decision making. in 2004 2005, government three large member economy coalesce try dismantle stability growth pact. it fierce battle time, ecb publicly voice grave concerns. the recent crisis demonstrate grow underlie macroeconomic imbalance also destabilise fiscal policy place country unsustainable trajectory. a boom-bust cycle mask fiscal problem long time suddenly expose problem turns. high fiscal elasticity tend curb budget deficit – even produce overall surplus – asset price run-up boost revenue financial house transactions. the elasticities, however, send budget distress boom reverses. the second area policy slippage concern macroeconomic policies. here stand clearly front policymakers sustain increase unit labour cost whose growth member country consistently outpace domestic inflation euro-area average union labour costs. such competitiveness loss cannot sustain forever, catching-up phenomenon explain limit part process. sooner late adjustment unsustainable economic policy made. fiscal structural policy need keep domestic demand line rate sustainable growth price stability. reinforce fiscal surveillance, critical importance, enough. we need scrutinise closely macroeconomic policies. we need reinforce macroeconomic surveillance. you know monitor fiscal macroeconomic policy european union euro area perform peer group fora: eurogroup ecofin meet finance ministers. the european commission typically support activity fora. of course, effective monitor require adherence member policy framework, require peer pressure consequence deal deviant behaviour, require reliable statistics. europe’s economy: current challenge way ahead let come third part remarks: expect national government european union institutions? bi review 171/2010 3 start fiscal policies, country remain significant concern sustainability fiscal positions. it possible procrastinate solution problem fiscal authority need act order strengthen public confidence sound public finances, thereby reduce risk premia interest rate support sustainable growth medium term. more generally, euro area government step consolidation effort way credible lay foundation sustainable long-term growth. to end, essential country pursue credible multi-year consolidation plan fully implement plan consolidation measures. positive fiscal development may emerge, reflect factor favourable expect economic environment, exploit make fast progress fiscal consolidation. in 2011 budgets, country need specify necessary fiscal adjustment measure detail, stand ready correct slippage fiscal objective announced. in context, let express appreciation govern council economic financial adjustment programme recently agree irish government european commission, liaison ecb, international monetary fund. i sure programme suit bring sustainable stabilisation irish economy sooth tension financial market associate irish fiscal problem reorganisation bank sector. furthermore, address decisive manner economic financial cause underlie current market concern programme also contribute restore confidence safeguard financial stability euro area whole. equally important structural reform rapidly implement enhance prospect high sustainable growth especially country accumulate past year significant loss competitiveness suffer high fiscal external deficits. remove labour market rigidity increase product market competition – particularly service sector – would support adjustment process economies. measure work direction also facilitate restructure economy foster innovation, productivity growth, ultimately lead sustainable long-term economic growth. at current stage cannot stress enough important bank sector euro area appropriately restructured. by repair balance sheets, implement sound effective risk management strategy bank euro area increase resilience domestic external shocks, would allow make contribution sustainable growth financial stability. finally, let state clearly – also behalf govern council ecb – completely satisfy proposal put forward commission european council task force aim strengthen system economic governance europe. these proposal view yet represent quantum leap economic governance need fully commensurate monetary union created. most important, need strengthen particular two area economic financial structure eu. the first area surveillance domestic fiscal policy view prevent excessive deficit unsustainable public debt. the second one adoption mutual surveillance framework macroeconomic policy euro area focus country experience sustain loss competitiveness large current account deficit country face great sustainability challenges. to specific, i think two broad areas, one highlight six main line reform ecb deem necessary purse further. start fiscal policy side, i convince that, far euro area concerned, one should: 1. the deadline action side government excessive deficit procedure shortened, system sanction operate much 4 bi review 171/2010 early edp process. in past lenient application rule exploit short-sighted policymakers irresponsible delay adjustment lay premise current situation. 2. sanction apply way quasi-automatic base clearly define criterion le discretion outcomes. this mean, first diversify spectrum possible financial non-financial enforcement mechanisms. among financial mechanisms, i include fines, deposit reduce access eu funds. under non-financial mechanisms, i include country missions, recommend adjustment programmes, possible limitation vote right member state persistence violation. quasi-automaticity also imply limitation scope discretional intervention political level, example implement maximum possible extent “reversal vote majorities” european council. 3. place ambitious target reduction public debt towards 60% ceiling. we assign debt criterion importance give treaty combine clear sufficiently ambitious rule public debt reduction prescription deficit development typically exclusive focus edp procedures. for concern mutual surveillance framework, three main line reform necessary opinion: 1. the design transparent procedure clearly specify sanction case breach sustainability rules. identification member state vulnerability do basis clear undisputable quantitative indicator leave sole discretion commission. we advocate specific scoreboard design euro area member state would trigger quasi-automatic in-depth analysis reinforce monitoring. a detail self-contained scoreboard offer concrete basis assessment. furthermore, restrict scope open country arbitrage across indicator monitor dimensions. 2. the procedure transparent order give possibility general public market participant appreciate evolution process, stage macroeconomic imbalance detect assessed, stage recommendation corrective action issued. transparency case reinforce – rather weaken – teeth procedures. 3. the increase quality independence economic analysis underpin surveillance exercises. it important commission permit ass national budgets, also individual budgetary measure take member state right – liaison ecb – carry mission member state order ass budgetary situation. ancillary last point, need bring reliability statistical data high possible level. it opinion order pursue line reform need give commissioner commission service charge conduct macroeconomic fiscal surveillance euro area high degree independence possible within commission, ideally support body “wise persons” provide external assessments. let conclude example demonstrate europe policymakers make bold step necessary. i refer recent decision european council european parliament create european systemic risk board – esrb – i shall honour chair. bi review 171/2010 5 6 bi review 171/2010 this new european body part new european system financial supervision function provide macro-prudential oversight eu financial system. it bring together governor national central banks, new european supervisory agencies, commission national supervisory authority 27 member states. the establishment esrb landmark event europe deal preventively systemic risk. it complete european construction direction add safeguard stabilise financial system make europe’s economy stable resilient medium terms. furthermore, facilitate multilateral dialogue cooperation field macro prudential oversight similar institution countries, include u newly create financial stability oversight council (fsoc). conclusion the ecb has, i trust, live responsibility deliver promise people: stable currency promote economic growth job creation. this easy journey drive rocky road absorb various shocks, include food oil price gyration well consequence terrible terrorist attack us. over years, euro always force stability remain also three-year period economic financial instability. in europe, major advance economies, call react challenge pose crisis. change need euro area involve economic model surveillance frameworks. take account lesson draw global crisis term function economic union, appear essence pursue great cooperation great cohesion economic governance considerably reinforced. we must keep sense direction: towards european unity responsible european unity. thank attention. muhammad al-jasser: small medium enterprise open speech his excellency dr muhammad al-jasser, governor saudi arabian monetary agency (sama), symposium “small medium enterprises”, organize institute bank cooperation international finance corporation, riyadh, 2 november 2010. * * * excellency honor audience, it give great pleasure welcome headquarter institute banking. i’m delight receive invitation deliver open speech symposium “small medium enterprises” distinguish elite participant audience. i would like express thank appreciation colleague institute bank international finance corporation (ifc) organize symposium. i try speech shed light idea relate importance role enterprise national economy, challenge face growth, provision appropriate fund them. dear audience, the national economy consist integrate wide range public private enterprise utilize available material human factor production provide continuous flow good service meet need domestic society part external demand. a matter fact, size local firm vary accord size labour, capital, sales…etc. it mistakenly believe large-scale enterprise main impetus economic activity. such belief stem attention pay entity different mass media. however, true state affair emphasize small medium enterprise (smes) play important role economic activity advance develop country massive absorption capacity employ labour force, include modest average train scientific qualifications, apart role daily movement goods, service commercial activity. for instance, small medium enterprise euro area account 99.8 percent total business enterprises, 60 percent value added, 70 percent total employment. such percentage confine euro area only, many country world may similar percentage well. small medium enterprise consider efficient capable instrument accelerate pace economic social development, especially remote area le opportunity benefit development. apart nucleus large-scale enterprises, small medium enterprise provide fertile environment train worker develop skills; help speed turnover small amount invest funds. base perspective, government long since pay great attention enterprise enact law provide infrastructure would contribute growth development, particularly prove capacity reduce pressure public sector regard provision job opportunities. moreover, small medium enterprise serve wide arena develop workers’ technical management skills. they also assist large enterprise market process provide crude material primary commodity throughout phase production. most regional international donor institution organization grow tendency provide financial resource technical assistance small medium enterprise self-dependent play necessary role economy. dear audience, some may wonder small medium enterprise are, differentiate international definition. in fact, much difference bi review 171/2010 1 definition international level, difficult reach uniform definition. if depend capital criterion, example, find enterprise capital 10 million euro consider small-sized enterprise european union regard medium probably large enterprise develop countries. moreover, “small” “medium” two comparative word relative concept vary one sector another one country another. however, general practice every country region depend number criteria, include manpower numbers, capital, volume annual sale total financial position end period. in european union region, small enterprise define 50 worker activity volume 10 million euros, medium one 250 worker annual activity volume 50 million euros. in kingdom saudi arabia, saudi industrial development fund adopt criterion annual sale define small medium enterprise whose annual sale exceed rls 20 million finance purpose accord “kafallah” program. the world bank distribute questionnaire commercial bank determine definition small medium enterprises. the result questionnaire show difference banks’ definitions. however, may conclude small enterprise annual sale range rls 100 thousand rls 5 million worker 2 49. medium enterprise annual sale rls 5 million 50 million worker 50 200. dear audience, smes characterize many feature including, simplicity establishment due low value capital need foundation operation, simplicity establishment procedures, low cost establishment administration simplicity administrative structure. moreover, smes feature independent management owner seek much success possible. their feature are: low administrative market cost, labor wages, simple routine procedures, highly efficient communication readily available information need work therein, usage uncomplicated production operation methods, ability cope new change regard meet consumers’ preference tastes, ability change composition labor force, production, market finance police face quick change without hesitation, help overcome economic cycle changes. in addition, smes also characterize freedom enter exit market modest ratio liability fix full assets, easiness convert small enterprise liquidity short time without incur significant loss. furthermore, exit sme significant impact market. finally, smes flexible move spread geographically. in spite features, growth smes face variety challenge may similar great extent level one country only, also global level. the prominent challenge high cost capital result high interest rate compare large enterprise (les), difficulty obtain proper finance due shortage guarantee modest credit record, inability compete affect market’s power make advantage economy scale case les, weak capacity face facilitate governmental procedure expand work, low spend development research works. dear audience, business enterprise kingdom saudi arabia witness notable growth last years. the enterprise subscribe social insurance system increase 121.5 thousand 1426ah 218.4 thousand 1430ah, average annual growth 16 percent. individual enterprise represent 93.1 percent, limit partnership enterprise 4.7 percent, joint enterprise 0.6 percent total number. these enterprises’ economic activity concentrate three areas, namely, commerce 34.3 percent, construction build 32.3 percent, manufacture industry 14.6 percent. small enterprise employ le five person account bulk share, represent 45.5 percent total enterprise end 1430ah, enterprise 2 bi review 171/2010 bi review 171/2010 3 5–59 employee constitute 42 percent, remain 3.8 percent account enterprise 60 employees. these data show enterprise saudi arabia small ones, base number employees. the sme’s contribution total gdp low. the share private sector gross product, smes part of, 33 percent, share smes gdp 57 percent japan, 64.3 percent spain, 56 percent france, 44 percent austria, 43 percent canada, 33 percent australia 50 percent unite states. the sme’s modest contribution gdp saudi arabia could ascribe immensity oil public sectors, main catalyst economic activity. smes coverage national income account might low. dear audience, small medium enterprise face clear challenge obtain necessary fund meet expansion need several reasons; one lack guarantee grant credit. to overcome problem kingdom, ministry finance, cooperation saudi banks, establish “kafalah program” finance small medium enterprises. it program administer saudi industrial development fund capital rls 200 million cover proportion risk fund entity case guarantee enterprise fail repay finance part thereof, encourage bank finance viable small medium enterprises, cannot provide necessary guarantee account record prove eligibility funding. the program perform well since inception 2006 end 2010. the number guarantee approve period amount 1,668 total value rls 644 million loan tune rls1.6 billion grant bank umbrella program, benefit 1,113 small medium enterprises. this addition loan provide saudi credit save bank, finance young people small enterprises, well centennial fund, abdul latif jameel’s “finance program” provide material support youth’s project train courses. dear audience, in conclusion, i wish emphasize status small medium enterprise kingdom still need lot care appropriate environment perform require role economy, especially field saudization jobs. this important symposium may, hopefully, discus topic different aspect provide necessary recommendation assist competent authority make appropriate decision important sector. thank listen wish success. shahid h kardar: understand inflation sbp’s monetary policy stance address mr shahid h kardar, governor state bank pakistan, federation pakistan chamber commerce industry, karachi 13 december 2010. * * * the debate role monetary policy ensure macroeconomic stability general price stability particular intensify global financial economic crisis 2008/2009. while may take time consensus emerge appropriate monetary policy strategy, almost economist central banker global policy circles, whether favor criticize current monetary policy stance, still believe contain inflation fundamental objective monetary policy. in pakistan, similar debate, albeit different backdrop parameters, cause inflation role monetary policy intensify last years. most observer agree inflation, persist high level almost three year now, one major economic issue currently face country. however, skeptical effectiveness monetary policy bring down. some commentator believe entirely “supply-side” phenomenon monetary policy cannot play role contain inflation. others cite fiscal weakness large budgetary deficit main reason inflation point monetary policy cannot influence behavior government. in remark today, i would like share think perspective important topic. we, sbp, firmly believe implement coherent strategy monetary policy may enough element strategy sufficiently well communicate understood, responsibility outcome monetary policy stance clearly delineated. but, i get specific inflationary phenomenon pakistan discus rationale sbp’s current monetary policy stance, i would like discus three conceptual points. first, process price determination basic level. second, behavior inflation. third, understand trade-off face policy makers. this discourse would help u appreciate scope effectiveness monetary policy also limit constraint face state bank achieve objectives. it important understand relationship cost produce good price firm level discussion cause inflation economy. suppose cost rs10 produce good, include wage bill, cost raw-material, acquire instal machines, expenses. to remain business earn profits, producer would like sell rs10 plus “x”. the rs“x” generally term mark depend degree competition industry, nature product, overall administrative efficiency producer government authorities, adequate supply-chain infrastructure etc. what over-looked simplistic example role productivity factor production, worker machines. if productivity low declining, final price tend high even cost acquire factor production remain same. put differently, price keep stable even reduce increase productivity worker good efficient use technology. the monetary policy stance gear towards containment overall inflation thus stability price eas pressure cost production cannot increase productivity. factor positively influence productivity include stable law order conditions, healthy skilled labor force, effective governance, uninterrupted availability energy. a micro-level understand price determination process helpful, discussion behavior price inflation aggregate level also important. three broad bi review 171/2010 1 parameter worth mention regard: i)- expectation continuation inflationary trends; ii)- output gap difference aggregate domestic demand ability capacity economy meet demand; and, iii)- cost push supply shocks. expectation likely inflation path strong feedback effect actual inflation. such expectation could base past inflationary trend may form expect impact government policies, lack thereof, inflation. for example, economy experience high rise inflation time people tend expect trend would continue seek high wage least maintain purchase power. typically, adjustment wage tend slow increase price good service people consume. this lead discontent pressure government authority control inflation keep stable. thus, manage expectation inflation devise implement consistent predictable economic policy critical task normally perform central bank around globe. however, support role policies, fiscal policy, assure public government pursue anti-inflationary policy underestimated. failure credible manner create uncertainty distort decision general public businesses. in turn, exacerbate inflationary pressures. regard impact “gap” output inflation, important point aggregate demand alone cannot explain inflation. it compare ability economy produce supply demand. thus, inflationary pressure exist economy even aggregate demand relatively contained. in words, productive capacity economy decreasing, inflation persist level aggregate demand. however, assess prevail output gap difficult task economic mangers. it involve judge capacity potential economy, almost impossible measure. lack timely availability relevant data aggregate demand, consumption investment expenditure private public sector, complicate task. the authorities, therefore, tend rely available indicator help assess aggregate demand pressure productive capacity economy. the behavior monetary variables, credit demand private sector fiscal authority trend foreign exchange reserve position country, serve useful lead indicator aggregate demand. the reason transaction take place economy involve use money, whether document undocumented part economy. not surprisingly, phrase like “inflation always everywhere monetary phenomenon” “too much money chase goods” use describe inflationary pressures. supply shock include unexpected shock cost production, natural disaster affect production supply chain, intervention market administrative measures. such factor typically temporary effect level price influence rate change prices, is, inflation. importantly, shock continue hit economy regular intervals, case reduction electricity petroleum subsidy pakistan, effect filter price fuel inflationary expectations. the last conceptual point i want highlight every economic policy decision entail trade-off among desirable impact key variables. we cannot everything wish without pay price. for example, understand rise aggregate demand relative available productive capacity lead inflation. an effort contain inflation tight monetary policy stance tend dampen effect economic activity. in instances, adjustment private sector make pronounce compare make public sector. 2 bi review 171/2010 similarly, deterioration external accounts, either large gap payment receipt lack fund finance it, cannot continue without adjustment exchange rate. attempt maintain stability exchange rate supply require foreign currency cannot achieve sustain basis without interest rate increases. the reason injection foreign currency central bank, outflow foreign currency country great inflow, require purchase domestic currency exchange. this reduce availability liquidity domestic currency, push market interest rates. to ease liquidity pressures, central bank inject domestic currency normal open market operations. however, strategy become difficult maintain foreign currency outflow continue remain high inflow domestic inflation start increase ample availability domestic currency. the principle apply fiscal matters. the government cannot long period continue spend revenue mobilizes. the amount borrow require close gap come cost – interest payment future. failure increase revenue proportion increase expenditure compound problem interest expense continue rise, lead borrow rise debt levels. measure raise revenue increase tax cut expenditure reduction subsidy tend increase cost production possibly inflation. the point i essentially try make policy decision effective adjustment area economy required. if require adjustment take place policy dilute neutralize it, credibility decision maker suffers, lead uncertainty. what require policy maker articulate agenda priority future economy, communicate general public, develop political consensus, take timely coordinate decisions, implement agenda number years. delay uncertainty aspect strategy result le desirable outcome make trade-off among key priority tougher. against conceptual backdrop, let’s talk specific current high inflation phenomenon pakistan role monetary policy deal issue. in cumulative terms, pakistan’s economy experience inflation 66 percent october 2010 june 2007. this almost twice level inflation see june 2003 june 2007, 36 percent. what make last three year different three year that? to begin, let’s dissect inflation data bite shed light issue, start food prices. the behavior food group, share 40 percent overall consumer price index (cpi), much different across periods. it true food price grow 88 percent june 2007 october 2010 47 percent june 2003 june 2007. but, share cpi inflation period much different; 56 51 percent respectively. moreover, virtually item across time period responsible 80 percent food inflation. key among wheat flour, sugar, fresh milk, meat, vegetables. so, food inflation entirely “supply shocks”? be anything different highlighted? let’s take example wheat sugar. between june 2003 june 2007, price 10 kg bag wheat increase rs85 rs119; cumulative price increase 40 percent. in next three years, increase rs260; cumulative price increase 120 percent. but, international price wheat increase 22 percent. so, happened? do productivity collapse input price shoot up? we know government increase “support price” wheat. would consider supply shock policy decision? same case sugar prices. after increase 46 percent june 2003 june 2007, sugar price increase 184 percent next three years. the point price increase cannot consider pure supply shocks. for instance, government would able procure 10 million ton bi review 171/2010 3 wheat high international price without borrow extensively bank system. not surprisingly, credit extend “commodity operations”, include wheat sugar, grow 288 percent last three year compare 33 percent three year that. borrow scale would possible without upward pressure market interest rates. thus, borrow government agency finance wheat, urea, sugar trade operation rs382 billion 3 percentage point kibor, indicate interest rate regime private sector would face competition sovereign. further, lead injection lot cash rural areas, use high expenditure consumer durables possibly food item well. thus, initial “supply shock” turn “demand shock” adversely affect expectation inflation remain high. to understand difference price set commodity level aggregate level, let’s look evolution price petroleum products, electricity gas. traditionally, price heavily subsidize government. so, one would expect approach would keep lid price product market. and subsidy scale back, increase price impact overall inflation would become pronounced. a careful look data reveal necessarily case. for example, price diesel increase rs20 per liter rs38 per liter june 2003 june 2007 – cumulative increase 90 percent – increase rs79 per liter october 2010 – increase another 108 percent. the difference large claim main reason relatively high rate inflation last three years. in fact, case price petrol opposite true. it grow 37 percent june 2007 october 2010 72 percent june 2003 june 2007.the increase price electricity were, however, sharp recent years; 62 percent average compare 5 percent respectively. on hand, borrow public sector enterprises, partially explain transfer subsidy government’s budgetary expenditure directly power sector entities, grow 305 percent october 2010 june 2007 compare 17 percent 2003 june 2007. the contribution towards growth money thus overall inflation discounted. however, even exclude food energy group price cpi, observe substantial increase inflationary pressures. both non-food-non-energy (nfne) trim measure core inflation validate observation. for example, nfne grow 58 percent last three year compare 28 percent three year that. do reduction subsidy help reduce fiscal deficit ease aggregate demand pressure? unfortunately, happen. in cumulative terms, fiscal deficit grow 146 percent nominal term june 2007 june 2010 compare 113 percent june 2003 june 2007. if take interest payments, mention factor add fiscal problems, look primary deficit, fiscal drive aggregate demand pressure look pronounced. the primary deficit grow 3182 percent last three year compare improvement 140 percent three year that. the case revenue deficit – difference current expenditure total revenues. this deficit increase 298 percent compare 27 percent respectively. thus, unquestionable increase aggregate demand pressure public sector. what worry trend finance pressure substantial fiscal expansion resource bank system. during june 2007 november 2010, cumulative borrow bank system increase 187 percent compare 58 percent june 2003 june 2007.we know that, within bank system, government substantially increase reliance borrow sbp. the stock outstanding borrow government sbp excess rs1500 billion today compare rs53 billion end-june 2003. imagine effect market interest rate government borrow amount schedule 4 bi review 171/2010 banks. undoubtedly, interest rate would much higher. moreover, since interest rate definition price one pay bring future resource present, borrow increase debt scale possible without correspond increase interest rates. the continuation trend fuel expectation inflation and, resultantly, interest rate remain high. thus, anything, criticism sbp’s current monetary policy stance could tight enough. the reason sbp pursue relatively “loose” monetary policy concern would crowd private sector negatively impact growth rate. face trade-off, sbp try strike difficult balance considerations. there deny private sector bear brunt require adjustment economy government considerably crowd private sector reduce availability price credit. between june 2003 june 2007 private sector credit cumulatively grow 162 percent, increase 24 percent june 2007 november 2010. in turn, negatively affect future productive capacity economy, make difficult meet relatively low aggregate demand bring inflation down. another downside heavy presence government borrow sbp deterioration currency deposit ratio bank system. during june 2007 june 2003, currency circulation grow 70 percent total deposit bank system, exclude government deposits, grow 104 percent. in follow three years, currency circulation increase 82 percent deposit increase 40 percent. while currency circulation strong positive relationship overall inflation, deposit represent main fund source bank system. a decline deposit tend contractionary effect market liquidity put upward pressure market interest rates. how economy cope aggregate demand pressures? during 2003 2007, contribution private sector government sector “balanced”. nonetheless, aggregate demand pressure relative available productive capacity economy substantial. this gauge observe cumulative growth 2605 percent increase trade deficit. which raise obvious question inflation, interest rates, even exchange rate relatively stable? the reason economy largely able finance demand capital inflow abroad, see growth 1462 percent foreign investment 83 percent growth net foreign asset (nfa) bank system. the situation look totally different look period june 2007 november 2010. in response grow demand pressures, sbp start tighten monetary policy stance effect. help decline international commodity prices, trade deficit grow 18 percent period. and reason sbp continue stance foreign investment contract 74 percent nfa decline 37 percent. in words, aggregate demand decline ability economy meet demand flow resource abroad fill gap. have sbp responded, inflation outlook reserve position country would worse. for instance, growth broad money thus inflation would much high private sector also continue borrow unchecked bank system along public sector. some observer comment availability cheap credit private sector would add productive capacity, help reduce output gap. however, give deterioration law order condition energy sector problem last three years, highly unlikely investment country, local foreign investors, would grow rapidly. in case, rise inflation would make business uncompetitive increase cost production. bi review 171/2010 5 6 bi review 171/2010 so, learn dynamic inflation pakistan? in broad terms, inflationary pressure mix upward adjustment administrate prices, persistence output gap inconsistent macroeconomic policy negatively influence expectation inflation. monetary policy play part correct macroeconomic imbalances, government policy supportive. the future strategy control inflation must include coordinate timely response change macroeconomic condition along concert effort raise productive capacity economy. delay implement strategy would make policy trade-off much difficult result continue uncertainty regard desirable economic outcomes. ardian fullani: late economic financial development albania speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, press conference monetary policy decision-making supervisory council bank albania, tirana, 26 october 2010. * * * at today’s meet 26 october 2010, supervisory council bank albania analyze approve monetary policy report third quarter 2010. after scrutinize late economic financial dynamic home expect performance future, supervisory council bank albania decide keep key interest rate unchanged 5.00%. in follows, i elaborate upon analysis main conclusion today’s decision-making monetary policy base on. *** the performance albanian economy third quarter 2010 reinforce main development first half present year, feature gradual recovery aggregate demand, low risk premium consolidation macroeconomic stability. broadly line projections:  economic growth accelerate (resurged) base seem broadened;  cpi inflation expectation anchor close bank albania’s target inflation;  the external position albanian economy recover exchange rate stable;  liquidity system increase interest rate generally downward. these highlight reflect, inter alia, macroeconomic policy pursue course period. monetary fiscal policy have, concert manner, aim fuel aggregate demand economic growth, ensure time preservation macroeconomic balances. july’s state budget revision put emphasis measure require take view maintain medium long-term fiscal sustainability, hence imply low budget deficit less impact fiscal stimulus aggregate demand short run. this revision pave way pursue easy monetary policy. the key interest rate low 0.25 p.p., hence yield stimulate monetary condition last decade. nevertheless, complex challenge remain albanian economy economic agents. economic growth rate, albeit positive, seem insufficient yield improvement labour market low unemployment. in addition, sustainability economic growth remain frail short run. it reliance foreign demand export growth may insufficient background non-consolidated global economic outlook. the wan fiscal stimulus also require great contribution private sector economic growth, hence bring consumer business behaviour forefront accentuate role bank credit financing. set proper equilibrium bi review 170/2010 1 short-term stimulus long-term stability require courage diligence policy-makers. ongoing structural reform remain priority long run. the latter aim broaden potential growth rate albania underpin macroeconomic sustainability. in follow i elaborate issues, begin first brief overview recent development global economy. the recovery global economic activity persist second quarter 2010, indirect preliminary data show moderate growth rate third quarter. economic outlook remain highly uncertain due fiscal stimulus withdrawal private sector’s (unsatisfactory) soundness. growth advance economy main trade partner moderate due correction private sector’s balance sheets, weak lend labour market, low consumer confidence. the low capacity utilization rate yield weak inflationary pressure global level. the financial market continue show high level volatility response concern economic outlook long-term sustainability fiscal indicators. in political terms, maintain macroeconomic co-ordination global level keep open channel movement goods, capital technology, consider priority measure avoid second recession. this would certainly provide substantial contribution albanian economy, remain net borrower global market benefit largely growth demand global trade form high export 2010. in light developments, largely affect them, albanian economy grow progressively year. accord instat, gdp grow 3.3% y-o-y second quarter 2010, considerably high 2.0% first quarter year. this growth mainly drive foreign demand, domestic demand perform stable rates. this performance reflect improve figure industry, particularly export-related sub-branches. construction service perform alike:  the gradual recovery domestic demand boost activity services.  by contrast, construction sector continue suffer weak demand real estate market, limit financial resource structural concern relate regulation. subsequently, activity construction sector post high annual contraction rate second quarter, 28.9%. indirect economic financial indicator suggest economic growth perform similarly third quarter well. the weak impact fiscal stimulus deep trade deficit seem offset good performance tourism period. the positive economic outlook second quarter 2010 also reflect labour market. although unemployment rate remain almost unchanged 13.8%, high activity industry service increase employment 1.8%. nonetheless, dynamic indicator le promise pre-last quarter 2008 period. the analysis economic activity aggregate demand component allow thorough assessment current expect developments. (in absence direct data, continue base indirect quantitative qualitative indicators.) 2 bi review 170/2010 available indicator suggest economy grow second quarter response high foreign demand. the performance domestic demand attest positive private consumption, high private investment positive contribution public sector, albeit moderately previous year. except pronounce wan fiscal stimulus effect, development consider persist third quarter well. although private consumption indicator often contradictory, overall set show good performance compare first quarter 2010. the rise average wage employment, increase import consumer good substantial improvement consumer confidence index reinforce signal resurgence consumption second third quarter 2010. on hand, decline remittance contraction consumer loans, drop retail trade index high consumers’ propensity save suggest growth rate consumption remain expectations. private investment record positive growth rate evidence increase capacity utilization, high import capital good good performance investment loans. the increase investment economy reciprocally relate bank system lending; ultimately, depend performance domestic foreign demand albanian good services. the gradual increase capacity utilization rate economy, report business surveys, show room current juncture increase private investment. fiscal policy prudent 2010 owe narrow room fiscal expansion public debt approach threshold 60% gdp. despite public sector’s positive contribution sustain economic activity, fiscal indicator point less impact economic growth. the government’s prudent approach first eight month 2010 view meet plan deficit figure 2010 actualize annual reduction public expenditure budget deficit. the latter amount all 23.2 billion, within project figure budget 51% low 2009. the 2010 state budget revision july, establish reduction expenditure budget deficit 10% 23%, respectively, expression fiscal authority’s firm commitment safeguard economic stability ensure fiscal sustainability long run. the high growth rate export contain performance import yield positive contribution foreign demand economic growth second quarter 2010. foreign trade data july august attest moderate annual growth rate export positive annual growth rate imports, hence lead high trade deficit period. the growth export 2010 fuel recovery global economy favourable conjuncture price global markets, depreciation exchange rate, albanian entrepreneurship effort expand market factor transitory nature. therefore, promote export stable long-term fashion require undertake structural reforms, turn enhance competitiveness albanian economy. this would ultimately serve transition stable economic growth model and, time, curb reliance foreign financial sources. our analysis monetary indicator conclude growth money economy concurrent economic agents’ demand monetary assets, hence create room inflationary pressure future. bi review 170/2010 3 4 bi review 170/2010 aggregate m3’s average growth 11.2% july august, line nominal economic growth enhance confidence bank system. it growth period mainly determine increase bank system’s net foreign assets. private sector credit grow 9.8% y-o-y, close previous quarter’s rate. although good liquidity figure improve banks’ balance sheet lead high bank supply provide great room lending, latter progress moderate rates. our analysis lend economy show demand remain contract number worthy project lend still low. the forego remain constant concern bank albania. to purpose, alongside bank system, consider require measure may lead growth lend line cyclical structural need economy. economic monetary development elaborate yield environment contain inflationary pressures. average annual inflation mark 3.4% third quarter. against background below-potential economic growth, give absence monetary-related inflationary pressures, inflation largely affect rise administer prices. the contribution latter’s rise headline inflation 1 p.p. in absence second-round effects, effect rise administer price expect transitory, inflationary pressure arise domestic demand remain well contained. on hand, depreciation national currency declining, hence offset rise primary commodity price world market increase inflation albania’s main trade partners. the absence inflationary pressure medium run contain fiscal policy provide room pursue stimulate monetary policy sustain economic activity. in july, supervisory council bank albania cut key interest rate 0.25 p.p. bring historical low 5.00%. in addition, bank albania continue supply bank system require liquidity order ensure smooth operation money market enhance financial intermediation economy. the favourable liquidity situation facilitate rapid transmission key interest rate cut interbank primary market, hence allow reflection cut interest rate economy well. the bank albania consider inflationary pressure remain well contain time frame monetary policy effect: effect supply-side factor expect offset downward pressure arise performance demand economy. the projection inflation inflationary expectation remain well-anchored around bank albania’s target. therefore, central bank consider monetary condition economy adequate warrant safeguard price stability medium-run boost economic development further. the bank albania will, response actual expect economic monetary developments, continue pursue prudent monetary policy, thus provide require monetary condition achieve inflation target safeguard macroeconomic stability. muhammad al-jasser: the need national data compilation dissemination open speech his excellency dr muhammad al-jasser, governor saudi arabian monetary agency (sama), special data dissemination standard monetary statistic workshop, institute banking, riyadh, 11 december 2010. * * * dear workshop organizer participants, it pleasure inaugurate important workshop time many national data compile agency confront ever increase user demand challenges. i take opportunity express thank gcc organization (central banks, ministry finance, statistic centers) participate event. of course, i also extend appreciation imf provide pivotal leadership build capacity produce official statistic region, pave way add new dimension quality official statistic thereby contribute global statistical system. dear participants, the need compile disseminate data systematic professional way, especially respect grow data needs, hardly overemphasized. for example, recent global financial crisis expose lack data key statistical area might help authority good measure understand risk international financial system. remedy fill data gap (e.g., maturity mismatches) critical monitor systemic risk originate systemically important financial institutions. similarly, rapid transformation world economy also bring new data need environmental social welfare statistics. data need could originate necessity cover new area measurement use new methodology improve data quality, use availability. they could also stem requirement come new subject measure variables. therefore, national data compile agency must cognizant evolve data need remain relevant useful. after all, responsibility statistical community make sure address new data-related challenge drive current emerge user demand official statistics. it potentially recognition emerge data-related challenge imf take several step enhance transparency openness, launch two key data dissemination standard 1990s. these include special data dissemination standard (sdds) general data dissemination system (gdds). let briefly touch standards. the sdds establish 1996 guide imf member countries, interact set interact international capital markets, provision economic financial data public. country subscribe sdds agree follow good practice four area include coverage, periodicity, timeliness data, public access data, data integrity, data quality. early year, imf board expand

day, sofia, 6 december 2010. * * * lady gentlemen, it’s great pleasure even all, 6th december, saint nicholas day, celebrate professional holiday. over last eight year i colleague bnb govern council, regardless numerous engagements, miss single occasion celebrate great day. by gesture show respect acknowledgement job well do favour national economy. commercial bank merely many capitalist business focus profit make shareholders. the bank system major part infrastructure market economy; circulatory system. without daily commit work, state would able function properly. by tradition today chance pause reflect past year share hope year come would successfully meet new challenges. i doubt prove capable turn trial useful experience, experience mean complete mission society assign us. the economic crisis, continue 2010, confirm expectation mine. bank become reason deepen problem economy, also main pillar stability driver overcome problems. the bulgarian bank system continue paragon stability predictability face unprecedented slowdown decade. a regard blatantly provocative “projections” domestic foreign “analysts”, day ago i remind fantasy sort chart “unfulfilled black predictions” bulgarian bank system. the come year 2011 year elections. we central bank well aware could possible local candidate glory – eternal candidate come back big political scene – actively try “sell fear” election year 2011. so watch out! the situation complicated, yet bank sector stay flexible efficient; number non-performing loan increase, system go generate current profits. despite deteriorate quality loan portfolios, bulgarian bank manage keep considerable capital buffers, give provision bgn 4.5 billion allocate october. be country among 27 eu member-states, apart bulgaria, circumstance could proud remarkable 18% capital adequacy total liquidity ratio nearly 22%? once i would like point outcome accidental come blue. all achieve far result long-standing consistent effort make bulgarian national bank create cushion maintain stability system, common sense effort every one you. thank much this! the crisis could make u turn away strategic task face us, i.e. competitive, provide service need individual businesses, innovative stand lead among eu member-states meet demand future. in one rapidly develop area – payment systems, bulgaria mark significant progress 2010. the merger two important operator borica bankservice accomplished. on 1 february, launch operation national bi review 169/2010 1 component target2 (target2-bnb). the connection national bank community target2 important step integration euro area payment system, provide participate bank opportunity execute real-time euro-denominated transfer exceptionally low price. in parallel launch target2 development large payment area, system process customers’ payment euro – bisera7-eur – start 1 february. the system process euro-denominated payment line sepa standards. with implementation target2 bisera7, bank customer disposal reliable secure infrastructure process small large payment euro. this proper opportunity invite who, one reason another, yet avail advantage entail join two system so. the direct broad everyday contact general public bank system banknote coin relate service provide individual businesses. this year’s great event area commencement operation bnb cash centre sofia. our cash centre one state-of-the-art facility storage process banknote coin within european system central banks, meet high requirement security convenience service bank cit companies. through bnb also meet obligation regard currency distribution destruction unfit currency. in newly open cash centre bnb continue provide customer standard currency-related services. however, proper time share often receive bnb complaint citizen bank refuse exchange damage bulgarian banknote customer receive banknote atm cash withdrawal transactions. this necessitate conclusion bank strictly observe bnb requirement quality banknote coins. we expect bank pursue necessary measure part full implementation bnb ordinance no. 18. the cash service company already operate full-scale provide high-quality cheap competitive services. those yet fully avail definitely losing. a i believe one agree, bnb’s supervisory policy hardly describe “regulatory comfort”, unjustified critic recently try define it. the bulgarian bank system one strictly conservatively regulate one within whole european union. the consistent anti-cyclical policy pursue bnb initially stimulate accumulation capital resource liquidity potential successfully face crisis, late (since 2008) implement number measure aim support liquidity ease lending. in 2010, supervision proceed “fine tuning” regulation bnb’s careful approach process underway credit institutions. in come year, continue phased-in implementation new requirement recommendation eu acquis committee european bank supervisors, take consideration best practices. the adoption new ordinance principle formation remuneration banks, would recognize risk take them, forthcoming within days. last least, day like also speak concerns. the crisis, besides else, evoke negative public attitude relation banks. although lev bulgarian taxpayer spend bail bank would unfair place bulgarian bank next continue receive capital support many government central banks, aware attitudes. a short list run like this: “… bank one blame crisis; besides show commitment problem business hard times”; “… interest rate tax bulgaria high”; “… bank enjoy regulatory comfort,” etc, etc. 2 bi review 169/2010 bi review 169/2010 3 have get sufficient evidence expect attitude dissipate time soon? and response? there one side problem, majority population lack basic financial knowledge. others responsible enough manage money. i agree feel indignation lack objectivity much criticism commercial banks. but can’t change people. the important thing anything possibly give client maximum correctness. you could step play important role streamline business practice regard service clients. “he works, make mistakes” mistake however own rectify prompt manner. our analysis show vast majority instance signal complaint receive bnb theoretically could resolve there, branch division banks, need get far head office executive director institutions. i would like emphasize bnb state position relation commercial bank customer long become hot topic media. allow conclude speech literally words, i use speak exactly 4 year ago (back then, 2006, bank upswing nobody talk crisis difficulty repay loans): “…it interest consumer bank industry establish two side process long-term relation base transparency financial service pricing, strict observance obligation parties.” in conclusion, allow me, behalf bnb govern council behalf, congratulate everyone occasion professional holiday, banker’s day – 6 december! i wish successful 2011 year much health family well balance sheet bank running! happy banker’s day, dear colleagues! kwesi bekoe amissah-arthur: new primary dealer system ghana open address mr kwesi bekoe amissah-arthur, governor bank ghana, stakeholder workshop new primary dealer system, organise bank ghana ministry finance economic plan (mofep), accra, 9 december 2010. * * * i happy join workshop result collaborative effort bog mofep enhance financial market ghana. efficient effective financial intermediation crucial country’s development imperative necessary infrastructure put place. begin workshop, therefore, work reform primary dealer system start introduce new guideline control system. primary dealer financial intermediary promote investment issue securities. in develop security market primary dealer license long period demonstrate participant. however, ghanaian wholesale market start different note. in addition license brokerage firms, bank discount house exist time make automatic primary distributors. it envisage wide coverage, bank could promote retail distribution government securities. in march 1996, consultation dealer market, bank ghana stop retail market treasury bills. it envisage inception wholesale auction primary market would stimulate broaden increase competition evolution efficient dynamic secondary market. despite interventions, market yet exhibit dynamism characterize financial market advance economies. a number weakness account inability primary dealer system produce desire objectives. the proper function deregulate financial system implementation indirect monetary control require substantially liquid inter-bank market government securities. the reason happen include: – lack commitment primary dealer undertake government security transaction line business – weak financial strength license brokerage firm require wide net work reach non-bank public – 80% government security take hold banks. these see investment rather trade stock, therefore tend hold stock security maturity – government security see bank institution compete product offer clients. a number initiative introduce market infrastructure facilitate security trade among primary dealers. these include: – central security depository provide custodial service investor government securities. this bring end issue certificate government security – electronic bid system auction government security primary market replace manual system submission bid bi review 169/2010 1 2 bi review 169/2010 – ghana inter-bank settlement system (gis) facilitate settlement government securities. i wish encourage discus propose guideline dispassionately contribute positively fashion efficient primary dealer system dynamic economy requires. thank come i wish success discussions. k c chakrabarty: prospect economic growth policy imperative india address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, inaugural plenary national conference leadership, confederation indian industry (cii)-suresh neotia centre excellence leadership, kolkata, 10 december 2010. * * * the assistance provide dr m saggar preparation address gratefully acknowledged. mr harshvardhan neotia, chairman, cii-suresh neotia centre excellence leadership, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, let begin thank organiser invite deliver address theme topical considerable relevance. my objective give realistic assessment prospect india’s economic growth, policy imperative achieve within reach, also ensure fall cliff attempt cross valley. our success depend groom innovative focus leadership every level society. there several successful business leader audience dais today “second national conference leadership”. the cii belief order succeed india’s mission achieve sustain growth competitiveness, quality leadership human resource management play significant role one key requirement achieve business excellence. the cii-suresh neotia centre excellence leadership facilitate big way growth objective development leadership deliberation policy imperative necessary grow rapid pace. i sure institute would soon turn premier institution global fame develop business leader india emerge market also. my talk today would two parts. in first, i would focus (1) upsurge economic growth since 1980s acceleration 2003–04 2007–08, (2) impact crisis v-shaped recovery followed, (3) near term growth prospect challenge india world face multi-speed recovery (4) long-term growth prospect india. part ii would contend spite growth success remarkable near term growth prospects, growth sustainability india would critically hinge follow three things: (1) ability make growth process inclusive, (2) improve governance, (3) develop leadership walk life. there slack aspects, result india harness full long-term growth potential. however, opportunity exist india step high growth rate still higher. i the transformation high growth phase the high growth phase indian economy start 1980–81 economy clearly break know “hindu rate growth” 3.5% represent low-level equilibrium trap indian economy. average real gdp growth rate indian economy improve 5.6% 1980s distinctly high average 3.6% 1950s, 4.0% 1960s 2.9% 1970s. what cause structural shift? in view, four factor particularly important. first, high growth 1980s help industrial de-licensing trade liberalization. there clear improvement growth rate mining, register manufacture electricity period. second, high fiscal deficit fuel fast growth, fiscal deterioration spill twin gap back gulf crisis, precipitate bi review 169/2010 1 balance payment crisis 1991. gross fiscal deficit (gfd) average 6.7% gdp 1980s, compare 3.8% 1970s. this also result increase monetization deficit net rbi credit centre increase 2.1% gdp 1% 1970s thus impinge monetary policy efficacy. third, save investment rate economy pick since second half 1970s, lay foundation high growth 1980s. gross domestic save rate improve 21.2% 1978–79 15.7% 1974–75, lead improvement household’s financial rate increase 6% 3% period. correspondingly, gross investment rate improve 21.3% 16.5%. however, save rate investment rate stagnate 1980s till 1986–87, especially public sector save deteriorate 1982–83. fourth, structural transformation gather pace decade, service like trade, hotel restaurants, transport, communication move 6% p.a. growth trajectory, real estate surpass 7% growth bank insurance grow astound 10.6%. a result, clear break past, non-agricultural sector generally grow 4–5.5% range, record 7.1% growth latter half 1980s. the high growth phase start 1980s last three decades, pace 1980s maintain 1990s accelerate next decade. the average growth rate 1990s 5.7% statistically different 1980s, qualitatively good effort make reign fiscal gaps. the gfd/gdp ratio average low 5.9% 1990s. the current account balance payment also show remarkable improvement period mark india start reap gain globalization. yet, industrial growth disappoint period average 5.7% period; low 6.4% record precede decade, mining, register manufacture electricity growth decelerated. the growth 1990s mainly drive service sector grow 7.1% p.a., impressive activity service segment exception storage. growth trajectory shift still high decade 2000–01 2009–10. real gdp growth average 7.3% catapult indian economy status second fast grow economy amongst g-20 members. industrial growth recover average 6.8% decade. register manufacture grow 8.7%, though electricity decelerated. service sector post growth 8.0%, communication sector steal show annual average growth 25.3%, bank insurance grow 10.8%, construction 9.2% hotel restaurant 9.1%. high service growth change structure economy. include construction, service sector account almost 65% gdp, compare 34% start plan era. the share industry double 20% 11% six decades, share agriculture ally activity fall 15% 55%. the impact crisis & v-shaped recovery for three year 2005–06 2007–08, indian economy grow astonish pace 9.5% global financial crisis cause global downturn. it could leave india alone decoupled. notwithstanding couple decouple theorists, obvious india substantially globalized. it trade good service account 48% gdp economy substantially depend large capital inflow sustain high growth spillover global financial crisis inevitable. inherent resilience arise india’s large domestic demand, stable financial system, high domestic save rate, prudent monetary policy fiscal improvement follow frbm act, 2003 along unprecedented counter-cyclical fiscal monetary policy help india cope global crisis good others. the economy decelerate next two year still grow 6.7% 2008–09 7.4% 2009–10. this spite fact cyclical correction industrial growth already begin start 2008–09 even lehman strike financial markets. 2 bi review 169/2010 monetary policy reaction nimble sizeable period. the repo rate low 425 bps 4.75% 9%. the reverse repo rate cut 275 bps 3.25% 6%. the crr slash 400 bps 5% 9%. slr low 24% 25% first time 11-years. large liquidity impart ms unwinding, open market operations, stand facility unconventional liquidity support measures. all action take within space 7-months. the move coordinate fiscal space include large tax cut expenditure stimulus. this portray rare exemplary monetary-fiscal coordination enable economy limit downturn, also assay v-shaped recovery. industrial growth bounce back since june 2009 move back double-digit trajectory august 2010. the recovery soon spill service sector, though economy face new shock monsoon failure. the resilience indian economy still evident high rural income great diversification rural activity help agriculture record positive 1.2% growth year one severe droughts. on back breezy industrial growth resume service sector buoyancy, output gap completely close q4 2009–10, thus complete v-shaped recovery. the near term growth prospect challenge india post 8.9% growth first two quarter current fiscal year. purely statistical estimate potential growth, may appear case growth surpass potential. however, important understand growth trajectory push high low base. with favourable base effect wan away, may short-run difficult step growth without overheat economy. the near term growth prospect remain encourage even see slight adjustment growth number ahead arise unfavourable base effects. we begin see capacity pressure emerge select industries. it important manage demand supply condition see investment response kick maintain price stability. adjust base effects, moment economy neither appear overheated, appear face slack. the inflation comfortable level trend down. the risk growth remain either side. on one hand, new spell quantitative ease advance economy increase uncertainty future output inflation gap risk new short term asset price bubbles. on hand, central bank advance economy try boost short term inflation expectations, risk un-anchoring long-term inflation expectations. we need watchful uncertain environment needed, take speedy corrective response ahead. however, direction change relative weight reaction function may require ahead remain unclear moment. the level capital flow recent period line absorptive capacity, potential volatility bear mind policy-makers well private agent plan risk management. it without significance world global imbalance currency battle come fore, india manage impossible trinity without significant intervention capital controls. this many way reflect new maturity level indian economy augur well growth prospects. the long-term growth prospect india’s long-term growth prospect remain encourage large uncertainty band ahead. with capital stock grow 8–9% p.a, work force grow 1.9% p.a. total factor productivity growth exceed 3% p.a., india grow 8% more. conventional time series method base past data suggest potential growth rate 7.5–8% indian economy. however, issue india move 10% growth trajectory ahead. we may think difficult short-term must bi review 169/2010 3 also realize long-term sustenance society, need grow 10% next 20 years. the issue whether cannot, must collectively ensure happens. we also see growth inclusive job-oriented otherwise sustainable. only would able meet rise aspiration new generation. we ever great risk social cohesion collapse growth fall here. herein lay challenge leadership various walk life. herein lay policy imperative need deliver tough goal. india demographic dividend support growth ambitions. the share work age population 20–59 year may rise 49% 2000 55% 2025 stay still high 53% 2050. india’s old age dependency may 12% 2025. this stark contrast age population many oecd countries, dependency ratio rise fast. in japan dependency ratio set rise 30% 2005 70% 2050. old age dependency ratio eu country also rise fast. they project go 26% 53% 2050. india’s growth story also potential benefit rapid urbanization. the share urban population total also rise rather rapidly. it 20% 1971, climb 29% 2001 project rise 37% 2016. however, demographic dividend urbanization great promise potential nightmare future depend upon do. for example, 20 million indian potentially join workforce every year, create job opportunity rate roughly 7 million annually last three decade high growth. we need step focus reap best demographic dividend rapid urbanization. this would require increase resource allocation resource generation activity like education, health, urban rural infrastructure. it would require effort bridge energy demand-supply gaps, new investment renewable energy step mineral exploration. we need remove factor might constraint future growth. ii what policy imperative need push potential macro-economically sustainable growth rate up? a i mentioned, i would discus three set policy imperatives. make growth process inclusive india remarkable growth story last decade right. however, growth process inclusive. there several indicator would leave u uncomfortable current growth process. accord unite nation’s development program (undp)’s human development index (hdi), 2010, india place rank 119 amongst 169 countries, clearly sync india’s economic strength. almost compete emerge market economy include malaysia, russia china, sri lanka, thailand, philippines, indonesia vietnam good hdi rank us. india’s relative position improve much years, rank 77 amongst 95 country 1980 rank 95 amongst 118 country 1990. this may surprise consider spend le 3.5% gdp education, rank 117th amongst 142 country compare poorly country like lesotho cuba spend 14% gdp education botswana spend 10%. we spend 1% gdp public health service rank dismal 181 amongst 188 country rank term hdi indicators. small country like kiribati marshall island spend 14% gdp cuba spend 9%. most oecd country spend 6–9% gdp public health services. rapid growth make dent poverty, perhaps enough. over quarter population still life poverty line. base national sample survey (nss)’s 61st 4 bi review 169/2010 round, poverty ratio 27.5% 2004–05, 28.3% case rural area 25.7% case urban areas. however, ratio compare well 1993–94 36.0% all-india level, 37.3% case rural area 36% case urban areas. 42% india’s population earn le us$1.25 per day ppp basis. accord estimates, half country’s wealth share 10% population. however, india’s income gini coefficient 36.8%, compare favourably emerge markets. a per late round nss, unemployment rate 2007–08 8% current daily activity status. india’s health education statistic disappoint even develop country status. an inclusive growth process go far behind income redistribution. it embrace long-term growth framework view ensure segment population get exclude growth dividends. the process go far beyond poverty reduction strategy mind build four pillar – (1) empowerment poor provision health, education skill formation, (2) financial inclusion improve reach institutional finance poor (3) entitlement food nutrition (4) asset creation, especially house water, electricity sanitation poor get shelter able work therein around generate steady source income live sustainable livelihood. i see financial inclusion hold key inclusive growth. india’s remarkable growth story cannot sustain absence rapid stride financial inclusion. the target priority sector lending, banks’ linkage self help group (shgs), introduction kissan credit card (kcc), regulatory nod business facilitator (bc)/ business correspondent (bc) model, introduction no-frill account several step facilitate reserve bank promote financial inclusion. however, lot need done. a many 145 million household 43% india’s population still access banking. regional disparity compound problem. the report committee financial inclusion (chairman: dr. c. rangarajan) state 95% farmer household north-east access formal finance. at all-india level 49% farmer household indebted, though level indebtedness formal source le 27%. about 10% population life insurance coverage. over 90% village still bank branches. bank today work micro-finance institution many part country quest reach excluded. however, challenge remain gigantic would need provide mainstream lend institutions. capital formation agriculture start pick again, though mainstream lend institution could support process. the gross capital formation agriculture ally activity increase rs1,38,597 crore 2008–09 rs78,848 crore constant (2004–05) prices. this 76% increase good 51% increase case industries. however, still miss growth relation potential agriculture sector holds. india’s yield compare poorly relation world standards. india’s yield foodgrains improve marginally last 10 year 1798 kgs/hectare 2009–10 1704 kgs/hectare 1999–2000 compare poorly global average 4168 kgs/ hectare. the yield paddy egypt high 9731 kgs/hectare yield wheat uk 8281 kgs/hectare. while yield lot endowments, also function technology, investment institutional arrangements. not yield gap explain different initial endowments. one need good understand reason foodgrains yield u.p 56% punjab case bihar 42%. in maharashtra 24% punjab. agri business leadership need partner state intervention step productivity keep view regional conditions. only generate supply response push agricultural growth up. bi review 169/2010 5 improve governance lead good delivery model over last decade, growth theorist development expert realize governance go long way explain growth. good governance refer good order workable arrangement cover wide array institutional arrangement include regulatory legal framework must ensure cost-effective delivery model entire range product services. in india, create many institution direction last two decades. however, still compare well term governance indicators. in term world bank governance indicator develop kaufman, kraay mastruzzi, india rank 46th percentile 2009 base range indicator considered, imply half 210 country study score good governance. our governance deficit reduce fast decision-making speedy implementation type project engage in; safety nets, social infrastructure, road, transportation power telecom projects. strike fruitful public-private partnership hold key improve governance. on one hand, enable environment business need improve further. on other, business leadership need focus closely investment project delivery bridge wide chasm plan investment actual capital formation grass-root level. accord world bank database 2009, take average 30 day complete procedure legally start operate business india put rank 113 amongst 182 nations. in 29 country take week le start business. new zealand top chart 1 day. in australia take 2 day singapore 3 days. similarly, take india 271 hour prepare pay taxes, rank 114 amongst 182 nations. india score even bad bankruptcy resolution. on average take 7 year india resolve insolvency settlement distress asset courts. on score, india rank 155 amongst 156 nation world bank database, ahead mauritania whereas trouble ireland take 0.4 year 54 country take 2-years less. if one us, whether public private sector individual work capacity, governance delivery mechanism would improve. we start create marvel infrastructure, sometimes take u decade complete infrastructure project. there dearth finance fund infrastructure expert infrastructure finance industry tell commercially viable project requisite clearance input availability suffer lack debt finance. there dearth initiative undertake step infrastructure investments. the viability gap fund (vgf), enhance finance infrastructure finance companies, takeout financing, model concession agreements, annuity base fund examples. what require today commitment speedy implementation. we still glare gap infrastructure. we still 9% energy shortage. large transmission distribution losses, estimate nearly 40% absence adequate competition impact electricity industry. at least 7% output lose due electrical outages. a result, india’s per caput electricity consumption 542 kwh 4% unite state 1.5% iceland. our infrastructure deficit reduce slow pace need accelerate implementation plans. a lot may achieve term golden quadrilateral project nhdp phase iii, road deficit remain large term ambitious need target create 20 km road every day. business leadership integrity vision make difference governance. there several area governance improved. this range safety net delivery corporate governance dynamic businesses. we easily push growth least 1-percentage point improve governance. we improve lot economic parameter include fiscal deficit also. what need aim delivery mechanism speed project implementation walk life. 6 bi review 169/2010 provide leadership while economist recognise governance matter growth, little recognition role leadership same. leadership issue leave management experts. yet, mind, leadership play vital role growth development society. the right leadership ensure number thing include inclusive growth, green growth, good governance, entrepreneurship, economic stability, peace, social cohesion. all ultimately act force multiplier deliver high growth, economic transformation. what need good political leadership, corporate leadership, managerial leadership social leadership. in walk need leader transform workspace. without leadership, may grow inertial pace time drift eventually. take simple case provision education services. our prime minister, dr. manmohan singh, recognise centrality literacy growth development strategy ask “knowledge century” third people remain illiterate. we also dubious distinction third illiterate across globe reside india. there enough leader country inside outside corporate world join national literacy mission, take challenge remove illiteracy social responsibility. the quintessential bengali genius amartya sen highlight lack access basic education prime cause underdevelopment. in view, pity could still implement article 45 constitution require u provide free compulsory education till age 14 within first 10 year become republic. this land raja rammohan roy, swami vivekanand, sir syed ahmed khan, maharishi mahesh yogi sarvpalli radhakrishna. have lose leadership quest greed, bonus bureaucratic power? can innovative solution provide reasonable economic basis provide basic education all, create institution excellence different stream education? presently, country 300 million adult illiterates. the drop-out rate primary elementary education level fall support sarva siksha abhiyan mid-day meal schemes, still remain 25% 40%, respectively. today almost rural habitation serve least one primary school. however, 40% primary school still toilet boundary walls. the quality education right primary high education stage leaf lot desired. the business leadership need step public policy need create workable space private sector invest education. such investment need flow profitable ib schools, bridge gap illiteracy technical skill education. if india truly emerge world’s lead knowledge economy, business leadership need partner technical education skill development. if labour supply augment vocational education training, big gainer would business leader themselves. industrial train institute (itis) long preserve governments. these need come ppp mode. of nearly 7 million enter workforce year, itis able supply le 10% it. the total number it bpo professional employ india rise nearly 0.2 million per annum currently. we enough supply trainers. so leadership need grapple best create iits well itis time. business leadership also look inwards. in era, business leadership frequently look bank debt restructuring, history throw many example corporate leadership innovatively work solution own. take case u airline industry. it face roller-coaster ride last 90 year existence. at inception, even though threat hijacker terrorists, find difficult sell ticket people think airplane inherently dangerous. till 1978, industry also overregulated government, full deregulation follow bring new bi review 169/2010 7 8 bi review 169/2010 competitive pressures. i would urge read book co-author anthony j. mayo nitin nohria harvard business school, mark rennella, former research associate title “what airline industry can teach u leadership”. the author write introduction book that, “leaders change agent see opportunity promise others see defeat.” at stage aviation’s business life cycle – start-up, growth, maturity, decline, rebirth – new type leader emerged. they may represent different leadership archetype industry go life-cycle stages, believe winners, rather fall trap look bailouts. friends, do reasonably well last decade three. but much better. so not? it context i draw attention need inclusive growth, good governance good leadership. we also need focus high investment agriculture rural infrastructure, education skill development, good health services, scale infrastructure investment fast execution project speedy delivery. these would work take u 10% sustainable growth path, would need look beyond narrow business interest so. an enable environment stable macro-economy vibrant financial system exists, improve governance necessary condition. we elephant tiger within us. we need leadership take u high growth, take everybody along one u partner effort share fruits. share thoughts, i leave deliberate upon various aspect leadership policy imperative necessary future sustainable inclusive double digit growth. thank you! duvvuri subbarao: mint road milestone talk
