 marion williams: what store barbadian economy enter csme address dr marion williams, governor central bank barbados, barbados employer confederation, st michael, 16 march 2005. * * * mr. chairman president, dr. hensley sobers; member executive council; mr. harry husbands, executive director, barbados employer confederation; ms. shirley farnum, permanent secretary, ministry labour social security; mr. vincent burnett, deputy chief labour officer; mr. raull harris, executive director, barbados chamber commerce industry; mr. trevor king, executive director, tvet; distinguish guests, lady gentlemen. i please opportunity speak employer barbados bec’s annual luncheon topic csme. i am, however, little alarm may expect something crystal ball address i position tell really store u csme. let say economics probability economist never say sure anything future. they advise high, low medium probability event occur certain outcome likely. i afraid precisely hear me. one basic reason creation csme become clear future small country small entity rapidly globalise world become increasingly difficult. in negotiations, organisation little time patience deal myriad small countries. secondly, one want heard, clear size make difference willingness others listen. the significance give view great large therefore able somewhat negotiate influence. in addition, trade without barrier single economic space possibility growth expansion enhance hurdles, legal, administrative, regulatory, etc. lessened. a single market offer member good term operating, great freedom barrier offer third country. for reason caribbean little option form single market. we create great single economic space great market beneficiaries. a aware, requirement proper function csme removal restriction free movement goods, services, person capital right establishment. the intention reduce economic vulnerability regional economy provide avenue expand trade investment opportunities, thereby low consumer price improve standard live across region. enhance level competitiveness result extension gain specialisation production fortify region’s position global economy. there will, however, loser gainers. csme influence sphere economic activity across barbados, potentially translate significant gain efficient business entities. it already contribute demise le efficient companies. the financial transaction underpin free movement good service intensify great trade, facilitate removal capital account restriction countries. however, gain expect offset losses, lead good resource allocation net welfare-improving outcome country, without doubt region whole. we already remove barrier trade good services. we make stride removal barrier movement persons, long difficult road ahead witness frequent dialogue topic. in term financial liberalisation, remove barrier movement capital form equity capital area financial liberalisation addressed. bi review 20/2005 1 the productive sector at sectoral level; date, integration process csme prove especially challenge industry barbadian economy. already, contraction output manufacture sector deterioration current account position. effort bring barbadian business international standard therefore necessitate restructure production processes, possible redirection resource area country may demonstrate comparative advantage. it easy speak general term restructure production process grind need translate actual implementable change production. some weak entity already drop result competition, important nurture remain entity – presumably competitive one - assist hold open environment. several suggestion table assist manufacture sector become competitive. these include development specialty products, particularly command high price international market emphasis high value-added products. understandably, right establish anywhere region, industry gravitate location abundant resources, low energy cost competitive wages. high production costs, relate high wage rates, dearth abundant natural resource place barbados disadvantage vis-à-vis caricom counterparts, production goods. this mean high level productivity require barbados. it also suggest may look capital - labour ratio retool enterprise make great economy make great use state-of-the-art equipment. at time, barbadian see opportunity operate competitively elsewhere caribbean, seize it. this option open potential investors. we know, grind however, tremendous challenge nationalism still strong caribbean, despite csme, hurdle cross. meanwhile, investor want enter wide caribbean long competitive environment prospect good, provide course, affordable macro level. on hand, barbados always strong supplier services. a well-educated workforce, good infrastructure favourable business environment, translate significant gain provision services, many entity already move supply service cross-border. we see construction sector especially. in addition, consultancy service every form description provide rest caribbean barbadian decades. we must not, however, believe may comparative advantage service – i say, “may” – competition le stiff trade goods. we must compete aggressively compete sector. in addition, globalisation overtake regionalism, also simultaneously compete entry company third country outside region provision services. the technology permit difficult exclude them. we ignore peril. employment with labour set move freely within region csme, implication employment situation barbados come increase focus. while production expect gravitate towards lower-wage jurisdictions, labour would theoretically attract higher-wage jurisdictions, barbados generally acknowledge one. this would indicate potential surplus supply demand barbadian job market, least short-run, could push wages. however, also note that, least theory, integration regional labour market ensure time, equilibrium reach labour supply demand across region. a number factor could affect analysis, comparative cost live barbados oppose regional jurisdictions. furthermore, give category labour currently allow move csme principally high skill levels, barbados perhaps heavily endow jurisdictions, possible could net outflow labour barbados – provide barbadian prepare accept low wage elsewhere. 2 bi review 20/2005 the external sector the contraction activity productive sector also implication external account country. this particularly worry extent fall-off production accompany significant rise retain import region. indeed, steady deterioration barbados’ export performance genesis provision duty-free access caricom good early 1990s result increase competition domestic market, seemingly impair local producers’ export capacity. import particular trinidad grow tremendously. however, judge shop barbadian trinidad, shopper buying, trinidad-produced goods. if so, may ask possible purchase good directly – sourcing? surely reputation nation traders! the challenge balance payment compound liberalisation capital account require csme. the removal exchange control restriction capital account transaction within union essentially constitute removal restriction rest world, give country within area exchange control extra-regional capital transactions. however, absence capital controls, capital flight possible differential domestic interest rate interest rate abroad. unbridle outflow could therefore put maintenance barbados’ current fix exchange rate regime risk. consequently, capital account liberalisation process ongoing, proceed cautiously regard certain type transaction order avoid significant disruption arise unregulated short-term capital flows. liberalisation also implication independence monetary policy. whereas, domestic economic circumstance might indicate need keep interest rate low, regional rate high, context open capital account, pressure raise rate order keep money home, even though domestic cost situation would suggest interest rate keep low reduce cost operation businesses. on hand, many change associate csme, e.g. enhance ability company establish commercial presence anywhere region, could result increase capital flow barbados, provide maintain encourage attractive investment climate. we already see inward flow respect bank system. under csme regime, current trend financial sector likely reinforced, cross-border provision financial services, well integration financial markets, become even reality. this produce number benefit consumers: widen range financial service available consumers, low cost service generally promote competition great efficiency day-to-day transaction take place within barbadian economy. however, full advantage take benefit context full liberalisation. it therefore important judge far fast liberalisation process take place without create domestic disruption excessive loss foreign exchange reserves. the spate merger acquisition take place recent year influence need corporation benefit economy scale. with large corporation dominate almost every sector field finance, regulator guard attempt financial institution abuse right privilege associate csme engage anti-competitive practices. however, consolidate supervision policy harmonisation form integral part csme process, anticipate potential problem keep bay. merger acquisition evident bank insurance industry – may abate i think over. at level security trading, i expect see continue strong activity. hopefully, within next year two, see great harmonisation stock exchange region, similar list rules, similar take-over criterion and, importantly, trade single book. i consider establishment single stock exchange create opportunity development caribbean numeraire currency. certainly, one book one currency transaction denominated. if nothing – u dollar – default. if take conscious step create regional numeraire currency – could bi review 20/2005 3 equivalent value u dollar eliminate conversion difficulty actually create single transaction currency region. i think also use regional credit rat agency become increasingly important. we already one caribbean information credit rat service (caricris). in order encourage surplus country invest deficit country important potential investor know value investment. the recently establish regional rat agency help establish value corporation across region investor barbados easily rely specialist field value quality company strength balance sheet company – say – st. lucia dominica. a number step kind set institution facilitate regionalism take governments, government relate institution private sector. these kind tripartite initiative need ensure appropriate framework smooth function csme property enabled. in order csme function effectively, need harmonise, i would go far say, “unify”, rule guideline govern conduct business across region. the caricom secretariat start financial sector frame financial service agreement. this important step set guideline within sector operate. however, need minimise and, preferably, eliminate difference legislation, criterion establishment various sectors, order eliminate regulatory arbitrage reduce corporate legislative shop within caribbean. i strongly feel chamber commerce across region must strongly involve process. this means, implication, employer confederation well. i believe distinction make single market single economy. yes, quickly become single market – however, order u see single economy economic corporate rule legislation need closely harmonised. in sense, fortunate, basis system british – though recent year many country model canadian legislation - is, english-speaking caribbean. however, harmonisation within french spanish-speaking caribbean little complex. the implication csme employer human resource professional many. it important hr department work within organisation ensure high standard set excellence rewarded, process good candidate show worth entire level performance lifted. reward mediocrity way reward high performance, breed complacency lead low level productivity. we keep lift bar employee know expect them. in way, workforce able hold retain job competition face free movement labour. it well-known fact emigrate usually will work hard. barbadian must aware this, instead try keep out, must prepare work harder. i take opportunity speak training. in context csme, train must futuristic. we need look firm today, wish get there. if productivity requirement mean great state-of-the-art equipment, must train person fields. i constantly say technologically challenged. when high-tech gadget buy fail – seem people fix them. hr trainer must therefore conscious train requirement make u globally ready – globally ready csme ready. we need use internet more, use journal - find right area train delivered, encourage investment training. this one sure way labour force prepare compete csme. if aim sky may land treetops. aim treetop may get ground. i aware employer especially human resource professional wish focus issue culture assimilation within enterprises, application grind rule base give best candidate job – especially today’s environment, candidate may barbadian national. however, always deal issues, new. my advice important challenge face barbados improve competitiveness. i believe employer hr professional focus get desire response employees. 4 bi review 20/2005 in organisation development pay-for-performance appraisal considered. this may, first, appear nothing csme. however, motivation, hence get best, get best employee mean improve competitiveness – back good u order flourish within cmse – improve competitiveness. we need put system place ensure employee aim high level productivity, include reduce work stoppages, reduce absenteeism close control wage costs. this, couple nurture culture great entrepreneurship, key get best csme. already, give reduction rate tax $40,000 $37,500 tax relate concessions, likely significant increase disposable incomes. last year, tremendous surge spending. net domestic asset bank system, comprise credit government credit private sector, rise 50%. we look situation disposable income rise even 2005 tax benefit given. ask “is really scope give wage increase top that? what happen disposable incomes? what happen spending?” i hesitate incur wrath unions, i economist number stare face. i suggest put employee put barbados first competitiveness important – good future generations. conclusion in conclusion, several step still take ensure hat csme become opportunity convince barbadians. however, initiative lap officials. yes, liberalisation external capital account is. however, restructure productive sector make competitive another major challenge face country go csme, require combine effort. with judicious action policy-making level, support input public sector, challenge met. on balance, csme produce net benefit barbadian economy provide harmonise framework policy formulation, well large market, great opportunity employment, investment, production trade. one provide barbados economic bargain power necessary combat external threat overcome resource constraints. however, what’s store will, large extent, depend willingness seize opportunity present us. we chart future csme – one sector group alone – every group, sector organisation determine want set get there. what store u caricom largely determine effort make initiative take influence outcome want. bi review 20/2005 5 zdeněk tůma: the interrelationship monetary policy, price stability financial stability speech mr zdeněk tůma, governor czech national bank, european bank financial forum 2005, prague, 22 march 2005. * * * mr. president, excellencies, governors, distinguish guests, it honour open central bankers' forum. a main part conference program concern financial sector challenge opportunity “new europe”, central bankers' panel necessarily reflect close, particularly topical, issue financial stability relationship reasonable monetary policy conduct. while colleague discus mainly particular issue financial stability, i, privilege chairman panel, would like frame discussion use general historical context. bear perspective mind, i would like point interrelation ultimate goal monetary policy, price stability, financial stability. first all, let start definition financial stability, simply assume price stability need explanation. to brief possible, financial stability define soundness financial system, is, resilience various shocks. what i understand sound financial system think system that, firstly, enable individual payment want moment like, and, secondly, enable individual smooth consumption across time save borrowing. in respect, financial stability issue, arise nineties, completely new one. indeed, significant importance since bank emerged. the long year commodity money system (so call “golden standard”) could characterise year money supply, i.e. supply gold, exogenous even central bank's control. consequently, monetary policy relatively easy do, establish parity central bank banknote gold, role central bank lender last resort relatively constrained. under circumstances, financial stability naturally high importance, commercial bank attempt “run” bank could deadly. moreover, could cause stampede run others bank bring whole system end, central bank's ability provide additional currency would constrain gold reserves. to protect themselves, commercial bank central bank establish clear house provide, case run particular participate bank, currency other. that fact financial stability remedy, course, product time. after second world war abandonment “golden standard” change thing completely. the introduction fiat money change monetary policy framework dramatically, force financial stability issue take back seat central bank considerations. there two main reason financial stability le worry. first, use fiat money role lender last resort limit anymore. the central bank could lend commercial bank much want borrow, print new money. there need hold parity anything. second, many central bank face serious trouble order meet ultimate target, price stability, within new fiat money environment. therefore policy focus shift huge effort concentrate find new appropriate policy framework. the situation even complicate due fact aforementioned point closely interdependent. to illustrate point, let's assume inflationary pressure cause redistribution disturbance financial system lead redistribution wealth lender borrowers. the central bank either establish appropriate framework deal inflation yet, even worse, inflation view undesirable phenomenon. on hand, central bank ready fulfil role lender last resort. but save commercial bank imminent bankruptcy increase inflationary pressures. at end cause kind inflationary trap. it surprise time financial stability main concern central bank. a central bank learn second half eighty deal properly inflationary disturbances, price stability broadly achieve again. consequently, interest financial bi review 20/2005 1 stability issue increase nineties. in opinion, two main reason it. first all, central bank learn one important rule: role lender last resort something central bank ready fulfil, fact optimal, never practice. second all, financial system end completely incomparable pre-world-war-ii system. nowadays, live global world and, although capable minimise impact inflationary disturbances, type shock arising. to sum up, main message learn history price stability ultimate goal monetary policy contradiction effort achieve financial stability. indeed, one hand, price stability necessary condition achieve financial stability, inflationary disturbance potential cause serious damage financial system; hand, sound financial system enable monetary policy smooth action order achieve price stability. lady gentlemen, thank attention. 2 bi review 20/2005 jean-claude trichet: interview il sole 24 ore english translation interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, frankfurt, 16 march 2005. * * * [question] international competition grow past years. europe's competitor long unite state japan. many emerge economies, especially asia, highly competitive. there lively debate go many circle europe's economic decline. [answer] i believe europe need redouble effort become competitive. failure would costly. the ecb fully subscribe substance lisbon agenda (the aim turn european union competitive market world 2010 – il sole-24 ore editor's note) european commission's wish press direction, line recent report issue put together former netherlands prime minister wim kok. a good deal done, believe great deal still done. [question] everyone stress need introduce structural reforms. [answer] the lag build europe unite state term productivity growth since mid-1990s partially due lack structural reform. it intention play difficulty reform economy persuade society need sometimes unpopular measures, also know new reform help boost economic growth, european prosperity employment. in sense, ecb back government social partner effort introduce measures. [question] the ecb prefer look euro area whole, member country situation. some large country particularly behind race great productivity. [answer] you right. the govern council ecb look region whole, way federal reserve system unite state look u economy rather economy massachusetts california. that said, individual european economy asset liabilities. [question] in connection, view italy? [answer] italy numerous qualities, include inventive creative productive sector dynamic small medium-sized enterprises. but i pretend also weak points. among i could mention increase unit labour cost, help economy's competitiveness past years. [question] for long time italy able stay competitive devaluation currency. now, euro, strategy long pursue economic difficulty apparent. [answer] the birth euro put end intra european currency crises, exchange market interest rate market tension bond market risk premia. it enable italy, well eleven economies, enjoy historically low cost money. this considerable advantage fully recognised. before introduction single currency, explain monetary union indicator competitiveness, example unit labour costs, would important monitor order ensure success individual national economies. it important introduce economic reform today precisely reduce unit labour cost appropriate labour productivity progress. [question] but many country grow concern international competition time implementation economic reform also trigger uncertainty welfare front. some day ago european textile industry call european commission levy duty chinese goods. what think option? can introduction duty make lack flexibility exchange rate? [answer] i course respect division responsibility amongst european institutions: commission council make judgment. a regard ecb see bi review 20/2005 1 international trade important element contribute global growth prosperity. since world war ii open trade function effective win win game. and true rapid development big emerge economies, particular asia, new important challenge industrialise economy call equally rapid adaptation europe new global deal. [question] in recent week ecb stress fact europe much use make new technology could help boost economy's productivity. can explain reason behind concerns? [answer] there number sign suggest it revolution yet materialize european labour productivity progress. in unite state occur mid 1990’s disappearance so-called “robert solow paradox” (“computers find everywhere productivity data” – il sole-24 ore editor's note). so convince fresh effort need europe take full advantage it revolution foster research technological innovation. scientific technological progress today remarkable call renew production process manufacture sector also service industry. i train engineer, point view i amaze i see fast scientific progress recent years. [question] yet europe make considerable effort field past years. some country forefront term internet mobile phone use. why believe euro area still lag behind? [answer] we suspect it revolution take time materialize europe reckon goods, service labour market still flexible, case le flexible economies. we convince le flexible economy company benefit le late scientific progress. moreover, i would add europe unfortunately yet heart technological scientific innovation. so, sense, renew effort research, innovation economy knowledge, time make economic fabric flexible. [question] but country europe manage good others. [answer] that true. there country virtuous cycle economic reform, it revolution increase productivity, growth employment take root. i would mention scandinavian country ireland particular. from point view, need look outside union: there lack reference point europe euro area take effective benchmark country great difficulty pursue reform. [question] many people europe convince current context – economic context also social context – flexible stability growth pact would useful. that issue heart debate among eu's member state right now. [answer] this important issue. you know position ecb’s govern council express already year ago. the proposal improve efficiency preventive arm pact good one support beginning. but think far corrective arm pact concern important fully preserve nominal benchmark 3% deficit integrity excessive deficit procedure. the commission proposes. the council decide. it was, is, duty say think take account crucial importance stability growth pact cohesion economic monetary union. in case, whatever decision faithful mandate maintain price stability. [question] in context low growth low output, fact population age play important role too. be factor ecb take consideration? [answer] that important feature. in many euro area country see gradual increase le dynamic le active part population, general lead fall consumption investment resultant negative effect economy. that another reason reform health pension system labour market crucial. in countries, specific policy adopt correct demographic trend. 2 bi review 20/2005 [question] of course, low growth productivity also impact inflation. [answer] of course. low growth productivity mean high unit labour costs. cost-generated inflation tend rise, certainly make ecb's task easier, give job maintain price stability within monetary union. [question] on subject inflation, ecb estimate euro area's non-inflationary potential growth rate 2.0% 2.5%. can confirm estimate? [answer] the ecb rely field also assessment market economists’ consensus analysis conduct major international organizations. we notice estimate revise downwards recently. if i mention figure today, i would say number estimate get close 2% 2.5%. [question] draw conclusion structural analysis european economy's problems, allow ask one question economic climate. what ecb's forecast growth europe 2005? be monetary institute optimistic? [answer] we neither optimistic pessimistic. rather realistic humble front fact figures. the ecb's economist revise downwards growth projection 2005 (from 1.4%-2.4% 1.2%-2.0% – il sole-24 ore editor's note) consequence slowdown second half 2004. there recently sign great dynamism investment internal demand. we clear picture situation figure first quarter 2005. i would say time stand diagnosis continue moderate growth euro area. bi review 20/2005 3 david dodge: inflation target - canadian perspective remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, national association business economics, washington dc, 21 march 2005. * * * good afternoon. three year ago, i last address group, i speak conduct monetary policy presence economic shocks. in remarks, i make pass reference bank canada's inflation-targeting framework. today, i happy accept invitation return talk depth use inflation target monetary policy anchor. the invitation timely, give bank canada's inflation-targeting agreement canadian government renewal next year. at bank, always reflect framework, decide work well improve. against backdrop, watch interest debate take place unite state - inside outside federal reserve - whether institution join rank inflation-targeting central banks. a part debate, minute february fomc meet show colleague feed discussion merit inflation target last month. accord minutes, argument make adoption explicit inflation target. those favour speak target anchor inflation expectations, add clarity monetary policy decision making, help communications. those oppose say benefit adopt target unlikely large, adopt target might bias constrain policy, might appear - i stress word "appear" - inconsistent fed's dual mandate promote price stability maximum employment. before i proceed remark today, i want make absolutely clear purpose weigh debate within federal reserve. i would presume tell feed do. rather, i want talk canadian experience inflation targets. however, so, i address argument raise fomc meet i mentioned. i begin discuss bank canada's legislate mandate, inflation target help u meet objective mandate. i talk choice make establish refine particular framework. i'll discus benefit attribute - least part - inflation targeting. and i conclude touch issue still face u look future. our mandate objective let start bank canada's legislate mandate. it interest compare mandate one spell federal reserve act, give nature fed's mandate often cite one reason adopt explicit inflation target. the piece legislation govern bank feed contain clear differences. but term conduct monetary policy, similarity striking. our mandate broadly set preamble bank canada act. the preamble draft 1934 and, note, substantively amend past 70 years. the preamble call u "regulate credit currency best interest nation." it go say bank mitigate "fluctuations general level production, trade, price employment, far may possible within scope monetary action, generally promote economic financial welfare canada." by comparison, recent revision federal reserve act call feed maintain growth credit money supply "commensurate economy's long-run potential increase production, promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates." the fed's mandate bite specific state directly monetary policy aim u.s. economy operate full capacity. but main point central bank reference mandate production, prices, employment. indeed, key goal central bank conduct monetary policy provide favourable condition maximum, bi review 20/2005 1 sustainable long-run growth, recognize monetary policy alone sufficient bring growth. so question is, what best way operate monetary policy order provide condition sustainable growth, bear mind word mandate: "so far may possible within scope monetary action"? over years, central bank try various framework attempt answer question. first, central bank try fix exchange rate gold; late try fix exchange rate countries. some central bank try target credit growth monetary aggregates, many rely solely judgment. all framework problems, i go today. but time, become clear best way monetary policy promote sustainable economic growth anchor expectation future purchase power money. what learn bitter experience many country - include canada unite state - monetary policy chase short-term goals, mistake made, uncertainty increased, fluctuation economic activity aggravated. focus domestic price stability - however term define - best contribution monetary policy make economic stabilization sustainable long-term growth. indeed, predecessor gordon thiessen put it, "focusing price stability help u guard sort systematic [policy] error often occur try aim directly output employment."1at end 1980s, bank canada face question pursue price stability way would allow accomplish three things: first, help anchor expectation future purchase power money; second, give bank guide conduct policy; third, help u explain markets, politicians, canadian public action could expect central bank. by 1991, bank government canada agree inflation target right framework pursue objective. we consider target inflation best way achieve high, sustainable growth output employment. to clear, inflation target end itself. rather, best mean fulfil commitment promote economic financial welfare canada. the canadian version inflation target let say word particular choice make year shape inflation-targeting framework. a central bank want target inflation run independent monetary policy must allow currency float. a know, monetary authority cannot control domestic external value currency. we one instrument, one target. thus, inflation target, naturally operate float currency. once bank government agree concept inflation targeting, need make choice put concept practice. our goal price stability come define low stable inflation. like many central banks, choose target annual increase consumer price index (cpi). initially, focus inflation reduction. so announce target would decline gradually - 3 per cent midpoint 2 4 per cent target range end 1992 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent range end 1995. the target remain since. let take key decision make 1991, rationale behind choices, set detail framework. first all, choose cpi target? the key reason widely understand measure inflation familiar canadians. choose well-known indicator target make easy explain action accountable canadians. however, movement price particularly volatile component cpi cause index fluctuate sharply. so use measure core inflation operational guide. this measure strip volatile component effect change indirect tax rest index, give u good understand trend inflation. 1 g. thiessen, "can bank change? the evolution monetary policy bank canada 1935-2000," the thiessen lectures, (ottawa: bank canada, 2001), p. 79. 2 bi review 20/2005 second, range? while emphasize 2 per cent target, range - many central bank - monetary policy operate long variable lags. if try target inflation precisely could "instrument instability;" words, would adjust policy interest rate sharply frequently, would lead great instability economy. further, measure inflation volatile specific price adjust. but clear, range represent zone indifference - aim achieve 2 per cent target. third, give must always forward look conduct policy, time frame would choose achieve target? from beginning, say demand shock push inflation away target, would conduct policy return inflation target period 18 24 months. this research suggest take 12 18 month change interest rate impact output, 18 24 month impact prices. of course, always uncertainty lag involved, i'll say late on. to sure, always time large swing relative price economy - energy price good example. under inflation targeting, objective try offset stifle relative price movements. our experience clear inflation target well-anchored expectations, type relative price shock one-off effect price level, fee ongoing inflation. before i leave section, i want emphasize two point inflation-targeting framework. the first operate symmetric way, make clear everyone so. by this, i mean worry much inflation fall target rise target. this tremendously important point. when demand good service push canadian economy limit capacity, inflation poise rise target, bank raise interest rate cool economy. just importantly, economy operate production capacity, inflation poise fall target, bank low interest rate stimulate growth. whatever direction demand shock, bank canada respond appropriately. this symmetry answer charge central bank target inflation expense growth. on contrary, pay close attention sign deviation target promote timely action response positive negative demand shocks. this keep economy operate near full capacity thus keep inflation low, stable, predictable. the second point i want stress inflation target anchor helpful term bank's accountability. if inflation persistently deviate target, commit explain reason so, return target, long expect process take. our experience inflation target now let turn experience inflation targeting. just canada pioneer float exchange rate, also among first adopt inflation targeting. and country do so, result unambiguously positive. indeed, claudio borio put it, "no country embrace inflation target regret so."2back 1991, canada several compel reason move inflation targeting. compare today, inflation still relatively high. further, bank canada federal government want minimize possibility wage-price spiral develop wake introduction good service tax. we recognize importance general public financial market understand actions. and inflationary pressure build towards end 1980s, saw lack monetary anchor lead rise inflation expectations. a look canada's record since 1991, term inflation economic growth, i tell benefit hop would come inflation target have, fact, materialized. we expect inflation would become stable target framework - so, sooner anticipated. we expect credibility would increase inflation 2 c. borio, "wrap-up discussion." the future inflation targeting, (sydney: reserve bank australia, 2004): p. 278. bi review 20/2005 3 expectation would become well anchor target - also happened. indeed, short-term expectation quickly become anchor target, although longer-term expectation take bite time fall line. together mark improvement canada's fiscal position mid-1990s, excellent track record inflation add credibility. private sector forecast inflation canada average close 2 per cent target far future. we expect set clear paradigm operate inflation target would bring benefit - did. internally, focus inflation bring increase discipline clarity monetary policy deliberations. but importantly, transparent operational paradigm allow market analyst good predict react different economic outcomes. financial market analyst pay attention evaluation prospect economy inflation assess future path policy interest rate. appropriately, rely word communication guidance. empirical evidence show inflation target unqualified success canada. inflation average close 2 per cent remain within target range since adopt targets, rare exception due mainly large swing price oil commodities. further, evidence inflation target successful macroeconomic stabilizer, help smooth peak valley business cycle. our symmetric approach inflation target crucial regard. because guard inflationary deflationary pressures, business individual make long-range economic plan increase confidence. scarce economic resource long waste try hedge threat runaway inflation. and paradigm make clear guard deflationary pressures, canada avoid serious threat deflation. throughout shock experienced, canadian inflation expectation remain remarkably well anchor 2 per cent target. at time consider adoption inflation targeting, hear many argument framework hear today unite states. some argue inflation target could constrain ability act, would take away ability apply judgment conduct policy. our experience show concern groundless. let illustrate couple recent examples. in immediate aftermath 9/11 terrorist attacks, low interest rate quickly decisively underpin confidence, could profoundly shake attacks. when major loss confidence materialize next months, able reverse course withdraw monetary stimulus. our inflation-targeting framework restrict ability act. indeed, paradigm clear, financial market able understand make rapid rate adjustments. another example reaction continue realignment world currency past two years. the canadian economy adjust sharp movements, external value dollar, also foreign demand many good services. inflation target give bank important guideline deal currency appreciation, allow u maintain focus macroeconomic stabilization time various sector economy deal exchange rate shock. our paradigm give u flexibility apply judgment face considerable uncertainty period. the future inflation target before i close, let say word future inflation target canada. a i note beginning, current agreement federal government renewal 2006. so useful think element framework would want change, area change might considered. from central bank's point view, basic arrangement aim inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent target range serve u well, along use cpi target. the cpi may perfect indicator inflation, readily recognize understand measure, likely represent best option targeting. however, give volatility inherent index, bank emphasize core inflation measure operational purposes. i would expect element framework remain place. but good public policy demand continue necessary research confirm remain best options. 4 bi review 20/2005 also, bank canada continue recognize importance communication transparency conduct monetary policy. inflation target helpful tool anchor expectations, effectiveness greatly enhance central bank communicate well. and symmetric approach inflation target allow bank make convince case policy actions, even difficult economic conditions. but i want suggest question answer go forward. one question face u whether 18 24 month appropriate time horizon monetary policy bring inflation back target various type shocks. one type shock consider major movement asset prices. do type movement asset price contain information future inflation beyond typical policy horizon? and so, it? this suggest way try target asset prices. rather, question whether would ever appropriate lengthen time horizon return inflation target. a similar question apply exchange rate shocks. globalization appear alter way economy adjust movement exchange rates. this apply adjustment real economic activity shock, well direct pass-through exchange rate movement prices. this raise question whether 18 24 month short time horizon monetary policy deal exchange rate shocks. on hand, reduction persistence inflation see inflation target would suggest may instead appropriate shorten policy horizon. give success date handle shock within 18 24-month horizon, change framework lightly. but need think hard appropriate time horizon deal various shock inflation target evolve future. conclusion let close emphasize key points. there doubt mind inflation target right monetary policy framework canada. through symmetric approach keep inflation low, stable, predictable, lay groundwork solid, sustainable growth output employment. in so, fulfill commitment "promote economic financial welfare canada," spell bank canada act. with inflation targeting, policy focused, communication clearer, canada's inflation expectation solidly anchored. during period consumer price inflation low appear stable, may tempt conclude inflation anchor unnecessary. in opinion, reach conclusion would huge mistake. on contrary, particularly important time, face large terms-of-trade movement shocks, central bank anchor keep monetary policy focused. from perspective, inflation target best anchor we've seen. of course, i'm say inflation target end monetary policy history. and, i love good debate. so i hope remark today may help add context ongoing discussion unite states. and i tell canada continue watch, great interest, debate unfolds. bi review 20/2005 5 sir k dwight venner: issue concern eastern caribbean central bank caribbean region whole

addition, charm persuasiveness dear friend, mcallister abbott put matter beyond doubt. the abi bank ltd show innovative institution. in addition, respond regulatory concern central bank fully realize business finance, innovation must balance prudence, risk undertake must properly take consideration. i consider timely opportunity give time live in, comment issue concern eccb region whole. it also opportunity share view approach challenge central monetary authority oecs. i would go far say define time region, seek grapple external domestic challenge complex nature. there also great desire among people information knowledge event affect life time, near distant future. the possession information particularly accurate credible give considerable advantage not. in economic financial spheres, information critical conduct business provision certain types, example, accounts, legally require publicly certified. the use information certain circumstances, insider trade legally prohibit punishable fine imprisonment. company present statement performance annual general meet shareholders. government present estimate revenue expenditure legislature, elect representative people shareholder country, budget public document. individual present income financial statement tax authority fairly assess make contribution, exchange government provide service law order, sanitation, education, etc add quality life. all country member international community, and, particular, imf transmit organization official publication document entitle “international financial statistics” national accounts, balance payments, fiscal, monetary price statistics. these figure obviously critical importance country two ways. firstly, good policy make timely accurate statistics, progress country accurately assess reliable statistic make judgment? secondly, foreign domestic investor access accurate data, make serious decision potential investment opportunities? in develop emerge market economies, tv radio stations, newspaper business magazine keep public well inform commercial, financial economic affairs. in churn information, analysis commentary, individual business firm present increase choice save investment. in environment, business rise fall base performance markets, ability manage resources. while speculation abound mostly base review analysis, matter cursory, take accurate credible statistic produce publish set period official publicly acknowledge institutions. bi review 19/2005 1 information critical part era speak information age three distinguish economist receive nobel prize work subject area. it background outline external domestic environment exist, define domain theatre action operate, point goal objective set and/or set us, review policy tool disposal meet objectives. in case external environment, live accept increasingly globalise world. barrier trade finance remove across international community, spread technology basic science materials, well information communication technology literally create global village. this trend inevitably present challenge country different ways. free trade regime impact traditional agricultural export commodities, banana sugar whose preference gradually removed. in financial arena, proliferation standard codes, effort oecd negative impact embryonic offshore finance sector. they also pose challenge indigenous domestic bank make somewhat difficult correspondent relationships. fluctuate output world economy, particularly country trade with, mainly usa, canada, uk europe direct impact economic performance. the true case fluctuation major currencies. we link u dollar fluctuation currency, euro, sterling canadian dollar implication u currency union. a major factor impact performance economy price oil recent time unprecedentedly high levels. it major import, price pass almost every item consumption production. finally, geopolitics international system, particularly fight terrorism carefully examined, could potentially impact major foreign exchange earner, tourism. domestically treat fundamental issue small size, term land mass population. the question pose is, give resource have, standard live possible sustainable long period time? the imbalance expectation resource country show balance payment external account budget domestically. not many, country, could like u get away run twin deficit period time, almost self correct creditor external domestic withdraw support stage. in fact, us, chairman federal reserve, alan greenspan express concern current situation. antigua barbuda, well country currency union face situation, i urge vigourously addressed. the oecs country understand rest regional community need regional integration. while big country like jamaica trinidad tobago felt options, small island understand mean survival. this define moment sense embark new venture, caribbean single market economy, csme succeed oecs bloc must step plate, define interest assert leadership. we must, therefore, define satisfaction acceptance unique coherent space call oecs, least economic sense continuous coterminous. we two concept engage mind regard, first oecs economic union, eastern caribbean currency union single financial space. the difference two absence bvi currency union us u dollar legal tender. the oecs highly integrate area treaty basseterre, 1981 establish organisation indicates. in article 3 (2), set number arrangement implement would result formation new state. the founder accept small state three override advantage arrangement – • to take advantage economy scale scope share vital services; • to mitigate risk spread several countries; 2 bi review 19/2005 • enhance capacity negotiate third country group countries. the result oecs much high level integration caricom common court, common currency, central bank stock exchange, directorate civil aviation, joint pharmaceutical procurement system, joint diplomatic representation, common project education health, well joint regulation telecommunications. we need focus achievement use platform take advantage csme arrangement like ftaa. we also need see individual island contribute whole instead assume bad off, one gain someone else’s expense. we need different mindset addition multiplication see superior subtraction division. have establish concept domain must identify objective entity. this require convergence regional national goals. at regional level oecs economic development strategy, oecs development charter, objective set special meet head november 2002. those were: • a sustainable growth rate 6%; • an unemployment rate le 6%; • a poverty rate le 6%; • maintain achieve human development index goal consistent millennium development goals; • the transformation economy internationally competitive entities. at national level, objective glean manifestos, development plans, medium term economic strategy papers, public sector investment program budgets. the policy available achieve objective - • monetary • fiscal • trade • international economic relation • income • structural • social • environmental let occasion confine monetary financial policies, give occasion gathered. the eccb assess situation domestically internationally identify consistent objective set oecs head two major objective also consistent purpose bank set article 4 eccb. these stability development. under stability bank two goals, namely – monetary stability financial stability. monetary stability tie performance exchange rate. we choose fix exchange rate regime, manage successfully maintain 2.7 ec u dollar since july 1976. this require u maintain high level foreign exchange reserves, presently 96% currency circulation. this legal limit 60% approximately equivalent four month import benchmark three months. in order parity maintained, focus attention performance balance payments, fiscal debt ratio countries, competitiveness currency assess real effective exchange rate. the monetary council therefore set number benchmark fiscal debt area member government request adhere to. bi review 19/2005 3 financial stability relate safety soundness bank system effective regulation non-bank financial intermediaries. this require appropriate legislative legal framework capacity effectively regulate financial system. let put two stability condition way ordinary layman would understand. if currency devalued, ability purchase good abroad decrease price good go due inflation. also, hand, wage price increase fast productivity become le competitive. the monetary council recommend government establish tripartite committee comprise representative government, private sector trade union monitor wages, prices, employment productivity. with respect financial stability, whereas case devaluation lose ability purchase good services, case, bank close lose money. a proper legal regulatory environment therefore vital maintenance stability. stability therefore spell follow head appropriate responsibility assign different institutions: • the central bank responsibility maintain external domestic value currency; • the central bank conjunction government responsibility ensure safety soundness financial system; • the bank responsibility ensure safety obligation depositors; • the government responsibility keep obligation salaries, service debt repayments. without stability, growth development difficult achieve, much le maintained. this bring two fundamental premise i take great pain bring attention government citizens, continue every available occasion. number one bank lend money. they lend deposit them. it therefore depositor money risk. secondly, government provide service money take tax citizens. if government provide particular service follow several procedures. firstly, decide full cost recovery, is, cost $100 provide, charge $100. it outsource service external firm provide it. the firm charge full cost plus, unless government subsidise part service. it provide service free cost consumer. in case subsidize free provision, question would be, pays? the simple answer tax payer. there is, course, another route cost share country oecs, thus bring unit costs. these issue important, inform citizen reality, is, free meal someone pay someone hold responsible, also developmental cost implications. with respect costs, expense run many service pass individual tax payer business firm either directly indirectly impact negatively productivity competitiveness. this high cost government mean le disposable income individual high run cost businesses. the implication get citizen mode depend government everything get creative spirit create wealth jobs. we must always remember nation aggregation individual citizen nation experience difficulty citizen also suffer one way other. in rectify problem level equity share pain, basic fundamental problem still remain treat with. to give basic example, suppose individual earn $10,000 month able spend credit $15,000 month. at end year he/she would debt total $60,000. at point creditor would say stop extend credit start pay back. if repayment period one 4 bi review 19/2005 year, individual would live $5,000 month, quite drop $15,000. of course, might give time. the moral example hold individuals, firm governments. speak directly question development, eccb see role area money capital market development stability condition treat with. we analyse gap system proceed along line establish market institutions, put place regulatory framework, remove legal administrative barrier creation single financial space. in area market following: • a common market ec dollar foreign currencies; • an ibm provide liquidity banks; • a rgsm provide market government securities; • a security market shares; • a secondary market primary mortgages. with respect institution established: • the eastern caribbean security exchange depository registry; • the eastern caribbean home mortgage bank. we work eastern caribbean enterprise fund follow eastern caribbean unit trust. a number support institution eastern caribbean institute bankers, eastern caribbean banker association, eastern caribbean institute accountant also established. we need close liaison oecs bar association hope vibrant oecs business council create push development private sector region. we need support government people create highly sophisticate internationally competitive financial sector, pave way achievement goal objectives. we confident correct path proceed political governments, innovativeness private sector, societal consensus people across oecs, succeed. however, conclusion, must remember success come work dictionary. bi review 19/2005 5 sir k dwight venner: be oecs economic union viable option st kitts nevis context globalisation advent csme? text 3rd lecture public education programme sir k dwight venner, governor eastern caribbean central bank, university west indies, st kitts, 10 march 2005. * * * lady gentleman we meet could describe define moment st kitts nevis rest oecs particular, caricom general, seek respond fundamental change take place international system one hand, domestic circumstance confront u other. it vital importance member community, government, private sector, trade unions, civil society public large understand change occurring, choice make, consequence choices. this would involve carry research gather information issue wide dissemination discussion them. each sector country define elaborate general specific interests, prepare enter discussion negotiation party come common compromise, strategic position lead progress all. to get comprehensive view situation must start, speak, sit examine particular and, like, peculiar situation objective way possible. this mean must set objective model devoid party politics, subjective impression historical prejudices. we must carefully examine regional international environment exist. finally, must carefully objectively examine option domestically various kind external associations. st kitts nevis probably one small state international community population 41,830, physical size 104 square miles. it gross domestic product ec$984.4 per caput income ec$17,577. the balance trade show export ec$161.5 import ec$383.4 m, give rise deficit ec$221.9 m. this ameliorate somewhat inflow tariff receipts, direct foreign investment remittances. for u oecs, always interest compare basic statistic among ourselves, small, medium-sized large countries. another interest factor comparison basic resource endowment expectations. this pose particular dilemma u caribbean system liberal democracy geographical position western hemisphere. be western hemisphere, choice standard live align north america sub-saharan africa bangladesh. our liberal democratic system lead government make generous gesture remain power, opposition party raise bar new promise order unseat them. a certain dynamic unleash could many case lead certain level instability public finance economy. i speak generic way oecs economy st kitts nevis representative. the structural issue small size lead concentration resource use, high unit cost diseconomies scale, high level risk low negotiate capability third party group countries. the point illustrate use number real examples. however, one revealing, analysis population relation capacity supply critical service itself. if take total population subtract seventeen (17) (60) arrive potential labour force. further subtraction make sick incarcerated. there usually certain level unemployment case substantial underemployment. have arrive proxy active labour force, one evaluate education skill level group. the number arrive population total 42,000 st kitts nevis even 150,000, case st lucia small. this labour force responsible total output country. bi review 19/2005 1 the country able enjoy certain lifestyle base produces. the conclusion analysis small population, highly skilled need be, well technologically advance order high level output. since domestic market small, output exported. the structure trade pattern end extremely skew export highly concentrate one two sectors, import widely spread large range consumption, intermediate capital goods. be export competitive, therefore, vital existence small economies. cost factors, however, loom large economy scale scope. the tax base small country definition small, citizen small country pay, average, high tax large countries, spread tax large number people. the level efficiency use resource small country must therefore high small country order productive sector competitive. the cost infrastructure reflect high debt service therefore high taxes. if one assume private sector naturally carry high tax burden individual citizens, reflect cost competitiveness. this bring one two fundamental point i would like make occasion. it simply this, government provide service pay citizens, is, tax payers. when government provide service proceed along several paths. firstly, charge full cost recovery, service cost $40 provide, fee. secondly, outsource service provide private firm. in case, full fee also pay unless government provide subsidy. thirdly, government provide service free charge. in case subsidy charge, question asked, pays? the simple answer is, taxpayer. there free lunch. the dynamic issue reside fact whenever public service receive increase salaries, cost service increases. a correspond factor, course, cost effective delivery service order support competitiveness economy. government find default, pressure multiparty competitive political system, take much afford to. this even possible give vulnerability economy natural disaster, hurricanes, income volatility. physical social safety net costly insurance cost spread small population high. this spring two factors. firstly, small physical space external shock affect whole system. hurricane devastate whole island economic activity concentrate completely destroyed. also, mono-crop mono-activity economy, change external arrangement removal trade preferences, case sugar banana significant impact. the picture portray small country, st kitts nevis, like, one great vulnerability outside shocks, lead concentration economic activities, high unit cost operation, population dynamic make difficult provide management public private sectors, make provision government service high-cost venture. what external circumstance face st kitts nevis small country oecs. the general name circumstance globalisation. globalisation particularly new phenomenon certainly, late 19th century first world war, significant amount movement good capital also people throughout international system. this come abrupt halt 1913 movement good capital resume 1950s. major technological change mean communication containerisation use large ship aircraft transport good passengers,

arrangement involve regional countries, others usa pacific nation participants. in latin america caribbean, africa, regional group see one strategy manage process globalisation. there specific issues, affect country new era. they – • the erosion trade preference implementation new trade regimes, wto, ftaa, efa, csme; • the adoption new standard code adapt international institution effect embryonic off-shore financial sector; • the impact terrorism could effect main foreign exchange earner, tourism; • the impact price oil demand china india, turmoil middle east; • the performance u international economies, impact local economy; • the impact high interest rate currency movement u dollar vis-à-vis major currency domestic economies. in light global circumstances, general specific, option face st kitts nevis extension oecs country define movement. there five option choice face u – • to operate splendid isolation; bi review 19/2005 3 • to open completely international economy; • to absorb large hemispheric country; • to raise level participation oecs full economic union option imply term share sovereignty; • to integral part csme single unit. these option include two extreme polar positions, is, splendid isolation complete openness. the option absorb large hemispheric country, as, unite states, canada venezuela may may practical option give preference party have. the two regional choice complementary depend choice sequence. the first option put forward indicate extreme choice presume st kitts nevis would match resource want depend rest world finance, good services. the illustration presented, particularly respect export import would indicate viable option. the polar extreme complete openness would could result flood st kitts nevis market goods, service labour outside way would apply extreme shock polity, economy society. while globalisation would tend lead direction, clear even major economy like usa much capable withstand shocks, exactly rush establish open regime. in case absorption large country – usa, canada venezuela – even population st kitts nevis full support option, country listed, i suspect, would serious misgive context geopolitical repercussion arrangement. we next come csme involve removal substantial restriction country caricom movement goods, services, capital labour across regional borders. the critical question relate st kitts nevis’ participation either single entity member consolidate oecs economic union bloc. let address issue way. all matter involve economic exchange new dispensation, whether globalisation csme require economic negotiate capacity. economic capacity define term large domestic markets, high level domestic output, good economic policy management. negotiate capacity require skilled cadre political, public service business actor clearly define goal principle support societal consensus goal principles. if one put argument way, large country advantage small one term economic capacity respect large market potentially large domestic output. small country may redress disadvantage good economic policy management practices, well negotiate capacity. st kitts nevis oecs country would seem severely disadvantage area make participation csme arrangement ftaa, challenge proposition, ability respond globalisation, matter grave concern. again, i say, define moment u st kitts nevis member oecs seek identify define interest first all, decide strategy must undertake achieve objectives. with respect caricom csme, group country constitute oecs net importer good services, export commodity service third country order acquire foreign exchange income buy imports. unfortunately, unlike eu, compensate mechanism redistribution support development effort oecs countries, balance trade inequality region. this serious problem could lead much resentment country oecs, particularly freedom movement labour allow sort adjustment. the argument advance quite simple. the best option st kitts nevis country oecs access csme unify bloc advance interest enhance economic negotiate capacity. the associate argument csme’s success depend prior parallel establishment consolidate coherent oecs entity. both historical contemporary circumstance combine 4 bi review 19/2005 support arguments. the fragmentation caribbean region separate sovereignty follow demise west indie federation lead small states, oecs delay independence establish sub-regional arrangements, give concrete expression treaty basseterre (1981). there apparent conceptual approach oecs which, give small size, characterize conscious effort support regional initiatives. this quite different large country always seem think options. the treaty basseterre embrace ethos sentiment, serious read treaty illustrative intention mean country expect advance welfare peoples. the preamble, well annex a, agreement establish east caribbean common market, speak volume regard intent method implementation. first, preamble, state clearly affirmation achieve economic social development people enunciate agreement establish eastern caribbean common market. it offer strategic approach critical issue set following: “ … inspire common determination strengthen link unite effort resource establish strengthen common institution could serve increase bargain power regard third country group countries;…” it finally express fundamental resolve phrase “ … determine satisfy legitimate aspiration people development progress; …” it important note, contrary misconceptions, oecs treaty antagonistic wide regional movements, seek incorporate actively solicit cooperation. article 2 (4) state “any state territory caribbean region may apply become full associate member shall admit unanimous decision authority. the nature extent right obligation associate member shall determine authority.” this clause apply caribbean state, could include barbados, trinidad tobago, guyana jamaica. it discriminatory clause. let u speculate current oecs member decide collectively undergo radical adjustment transformation process achieve 10 per cent per annum real compound growth rate next five years, csme regional arrangement make progress. would dazzle growth performance influence barbados, trinidad tobago apply membership oecs, close arrangement bilateral basis? this shock speculation make simply assert may be, thing equal, potential growth dynamic within collective oecs economic union, could accelerate current rate economic growth transformation individual economies. this may place oecs rest caricom much strong economic position. the fact matter eccu achieve basic economic objective provide platform growth development. in monetary sphere achieve stable currency, low inflation, safe sound bank system. a programme money capital market development seek put place institution market create single financial space. the issue economic union address fundamental advancement place conjunction single financial space. economic union upper level hierarchy integration arrangements. the literature set follow level hierarchy: • a free trade area good subject restriction member countries; • a custom union member apply common external tariff third countries; • a common market free movement factor production; • economic union coordination economic policies; • full political union could either unitary state federation. the oecs country virtually free movement goods, virtually free movement capital ecse rgsm, common currency central bank, imply bi review 19/2005 5 coordination monetary policy. the status oecs, therefore, lie somewhere common market economic union. the situation, therefore, impediment creation single financial space removed, freedom movement labour legislated, oecs country would create new economic entity command natural resources, large collective market size. coordination peer pressure would result good policies, thing equal. negotiate capacity would increase attraction private capital loan much good term would real possibilities. the concept new entity would require notion domain distinctive qualities. the objective set oecs head government 2002 growth, 6 percent; unemployment le 6 per cent; poverty le 6 per cent; maintenance improvement human development index economic transformation could place context individual target country. the economic union identifiable entity could establish range policy instrument would facilitate achievement objectives. these would span area monetary, fiscal, trade, international economic relations, income, structural, social environmental. all policy require coordination order effective. new political arrangement require economic union single financial space realisation economic goals. economic transformation major objective, require country union level, convergence policies. at levels, improve allocation resource essential increase output. the establishment economic union, creation single financial space create viable option st kitts nevis, country oecs. the enlargement economic space, add significantly output domestic market size, lock convergence coordination policies, provide good platform economic transformation current circumstance permit. the trajectory one could see unfold would consolidation tourism industry lead sector across economic union multidestination tourism critical element tourism strategy. the tourism sector would create linkage across economic union agriculture, light manufacture handicraft major beneficiaries. information communication technology would critical element strategy supporter industry dynamic sector right. finance critical innovative sector proceed programme money capital market development. the eastern caribbean security exchange slat cut edge instrument place economic currency union forefront drive sustain economic growth. it de facto regional exchange objective move currency union, caricom international community. the exchange attract significant interest wide region beyond even economic union single financial space established. the prospect would, therefore, quite promise support arrangement put place. the oecs economic union would critical institution increase promise csme. the oecs would serve pilot successful integration arrangement would solve economist refer large number problem caricom. that is, fifteen state would become eight, new oecs bloc would large enough command leverage process. the trinidad tobago manufacture sector export 60 per cent product oecs whole, provide substantial employment country. the oecs would position negotiate reciprocal arrangement trinidad tobago. also, negotiate third countries, consolidate oecs would increase bargain power caricom, well capacity draw resource rest world. in conclusion, would fair say joint collaborative arrangement commit to, successful enhance prospect stability development. the time appropriate another leap faith safeguard future development countries. oecs economic union probably viable option time, advance towards csme. 6 bi review 19/2005 joseph yam: can euro benchmark asian monetary co-operation? remark mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, keynote discussion: “the euro: stabilise factor international monetary system. can euro benchmark asian monetary co-operation?” paris europlace financial forum: euro market global investment strategy, hong kong, 21 march 2005. * * * it great pleasure morning take part keynote discussion euro host paris europlace. one great benefit live international financial centre opportunity share something life culture part world without leave one's city. we always fortunate hong kong enjoyment fruit european - particularly french - civilisation. we currently enjoying, part "the year france china", superb impressionism exhibition hong kong museum art: together excellent performance international art festival, grow popularity al fresco dining, help create european atmosphere hong kong spring. and, i see streets, i get impression strong euro effect sale european fashion. today's forum therefore seem fit well european spirit sweep hong kong, i congratulate organiser put together lively topical programme. it particular pleasure present together christian noyer, governor banque de france. he make thoughtful remark first question discussion. i intend comment second question: "can euro benchmark asian monetary co-operation?" but i address question, need ask another question: ready asia close monetary co-operation? we are, i think, aware considerable difference political systems, cultures, historical backgrounds, economic, financial monetary system country region. i think largely accept difference great difference various economy make euro zone. nevertheless, important overstate them. nor overlook regional integration already progress trade, financial monetary spheres. let briefly outline three form integration. about half total trade asia region intra-regional trade. trade integration largely market-driven, process stimulate sign various free trade agreements, will, turn, encourage trade integration region. now true slightly half trade within non-japan asia process trade gear towards meet import demand outside region, particular develop economies. but reliance demand develop economy decreasing, likely continue decrease. trade integration within region therefore likely grow. financial integration region show mix picture, say high low depend exactly mean financial integration, clear. in term foreign direct investment, degree regional integration seem high look available figure source destination fdi within region. the strike example various economy region source fdi china, destination fdi japan. but term financial intermediation within region - mean flow save investments, fdi, banking, debt equity channel - degree financial integration high all. the substantial, growing, volume domestic save invest overseas go mainly, gross basis, develop rather regional markets. there is, course, traffic direction, much volatile, potent, demanding, time predatory nature, sometimes - saw late 1990s - difficult cope with, put mildly. there common desire among economy within region reduce dependence recycle domestic save develop markets, therefore reduce vulnerability financial shocks, promote great regional financial intermediation. a number regional initiative implemented, notable asian bond fund project, collective initiative 11 central bank monetary authority develop bond market region. a great deal emphasis also place get one's house order, practise sound macro-economic policy build robust institutions. some attempt make financial infrastructure integration: hong kong, particular, operate u dollar bi review 19/2005 1 euro clear system open linkage jurisdiction international systems. but say that, far, facility serve domestic need far regional needs. this is, i think, reflection rather moderate level financial system integration region. to take bank illustration, may well quite considerable integration across border immediate neighbours: hong kong mainland china, example, new zealand australia. but, region whole, kind integration le strike presence bank develop markets. for example, number u european bank hong kong roughly equal bank region. similar observation may make equity markets. in decline order, come monetary integration. there have, fact, recent effort monetary co-operation. these begin 1995 collection emeap bilateral swap facility provide u dollar liquidity secure u treasury securities. in 1997 idea asian monetary fund aired, come nothing. then, 1999, come collection asean+3 bilateral swap arrangement chiang mai initiative. these cannot say amount effort towards monetary integration. and, fact, idea may throw around time time, really formal discussion among asian authority i aware towards monetary union. why case? i think mainly obstacle union appear daunting, special consideration apply asian case throw many difficult questions. these "special considerations" big matters, conveniently divide three broad categories: economic, technical political. let give brief outline. the economic issue concern viability asian monetary union. this would involve replacement regional currency single one, imply single monetary policy participant states. a key concern, therefore, whether would work. or whether pressure would intense make asian monetary union unworkable outset. at heart question degree real economic convergence potential members. use maastricht criterion reference point degree nominal convergence among asian economy suggest asia far ready cope single monetary policy. in 2003 six asian economy able keep budget deficit 3% gdp, five government debt level le 60% gdp. only five economy inflation rate within 1.5% three economy low rates. a long-term interest rates, six bond yield within 2% three economy low interest rates. perhaps fundamentally, degree real economic convergence among asian economy lot low european economy prior formation monetary union. one measure income dispersion, 2003, per caput gdp japan us$34,000, philippine le us$1,000. real convergence matter complementarity similarity production economic structure reduce likelihood so-called "asymmetric" shocks, shock hit member state different way call different monetary policy response - something possible monetary union. for emerge market economies, financial disturbance increasingly prevalent source asymmetric shocks: best illustration recent year asian financial crisis, differ effect - variety response - among economy region may, some, main argument union. it tempt conclude lack nominal real convergence among asian economy serious barrier viable asian monetary union. however, suggest full convergence necessary pre-requisite successful monetary union, act form monetary union will, itself, force great convergence among members. a governor noyer say presentation, introduction euro increase correlation business cycle european economies, lead homogenous monetary transmission mechanism. while lack economic convergence among asian economy may make asian monetary union challenge prospect, interest note quite number government region already choose sacrifice monetary policy autonomy exchange rate stability. hong kong, mainland china, malaysia choose fix exchange rate external currency, u dollar, regional economy operate manage floats. there indication economy consider use renminbi reference currency currency regimes, although hard peg renminbi still possible full convertibility achieved. it might 2 bi review 19/2005 also case that, asian economy diverse european economies, flexible way compensate loss independent monetary policy, example, high degree price flexibility fast adjustment economic shocks. it may seem premature turn technical issue surround asian monetary union, devil detail. the first set technical issue involve exchange rate arrangement themselves, include transitional arrangement prior introduction single currency. for example, would asia adopt basket peg choose anchor currency? if basket, would weight individual currencies, would basket include external currencies, u dollar? if regional currency choose anchor, way deutschmark effectively anchor exchange rate arrangement lead european monetary union, would yen renminbi? alternatively, could asia move straight single currency? it increasingly argue that, world liberalise markets, viable exchange rate system either hard peg (like hong kong's currency board) free float. soft peg nature vulnerable self-fulfilling speculative attacks, demonstrate europe 1992, mexico 1994-5, asia 1997-8. europe able move gradually system fix exchange rate capital control prior introduction single currency. but high degree capital mobility number key asian economy would make gradual transition way difficult. a set technical issue concern set of, mandate for, asian central bank. this would require agreement monetary policy objective, country representation, decision-making process central bank. most important, institution would need design national interest keep check order deliver efficient monetary policy make regional level. the lesson europe agreement reached, i say issue quite daunting. relate question whether asian government political devolve monetary policy single central monetary authority. asia disparate europe political systems, often note le tradition cross-border institution-building regions. it quite striking, example, approach free trade agreement far rather piecemeal, europe grow develop strong centralise common market. indeed, one serious political obstacle often point lack embryonic supranational body within asia launch asian monetary union efforts. these disadvantage must, course, recognised. but, hand, remember european monetary union unify force - common interest bring country together. all "special considerations" point conclusion asia yet ready implement monetary union. in process discuss them, may well turn asian monetary union non-starter. but mean yet ready talk monetary union. after all, take europe half century move idea monetary union reality. despite general consensus obstacle union region great europe 50 year ago, i feel asia take quite long. i offer make bet this, mainly i think many u room around long enough see many year really take. but one reason make think asia take long successful model look to, bring main question: "can euro benchmark asian monetary co-operation?". my answer question resound "yes". the creation euro show effective monetary union achieve voluntary co-operative way country different economic, political cultural traditions. while, i suggest discussion "special considerations", may different way achieve similar goal asia, euro provide precedent, point reference, large realm experience expertise, - i would certainly agree - benchmark enterprise monetary co-operation might wish embark region. bi review 19/2005 3 jean-pierre roth: be still growth track?summary speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, general meet schaffhausen regional association industry commerce, stein rhein, 18 march 2005. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * after economic downturn witness second half 2004 begin 2005, question arise whether switzerland remain growth track. jean-pierre roth belief anticipate gdp growth range 1.5% year. owe favourable international economic situation, economy europe likely pick again, also benefit swiss export industry. at time, assume domestic demand continue grow moderate pace. the decline important economic data last months, however, suggest economic growth first half 2005 remain weak. this notwithstanding, involve risk decline corporate consumer confidence, turn would jeopardise economic development. it also doubtful whether weak dollar high oil price already full impact whether yet unfold. base considerations, national bank decide leave three-month libor rate 0.75% mid-march. it relatively easy decision make govern board inflation prospect entire three-year forecast period improved. consequently, interest rate hike become le critical, great leeway support economic recovery expansionary monetary policy. a soon recovery process way, national bank continue normalisation monetary policy. this way ensure price stability medium term prevent economy overheating. bi review 19/2005 1 tom k alweendo: crime money launder - challenge address mr tom k alweendo, governor bank namibia, african bank congress, johannesburg, 8-10 march 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like thank organizer event invite give address topic crime money laundering. the choice topic appropriate challenge money launder pose bank sector africa. financial crime money launder increasingly become global phenomenon threat global bank sector, potential become threat civil political spheres. money launder conventionally define process carry disguise conceal nature source entitlement money property criminal activities. although country come different money launder definition statutes, important useful definition recognize crime nature act society such, launder proceed unlawful activity contravention law follow launder encompass definition. a new dimension constitute money launder respect terrorism, whereby legitimate clean money commit finance unlawful activity. the definition money launder encompass unlawful activity would well inclusive would provide law enforcement wide legal arm. the combat finance terrorism, unlawful act, jurisdiction provide separate legislation link mainstream national anti money launder laws, especially respect detection. the anti money launder legislation promulgate jurisdiction criminalize act money launder define above. this essence mean law make act money launder criminal offence launder money derive criminal act constitute commit crime punishable law. in addition, anti money launder law place requirement report institution report suspicious transactions, failure constitute offence institution and/or officer institution. the meirium-webster dictionary describe crime “act commission act forbid omission duty command public law make offender liable punishment law”. this definition pre-supposes existence public law set detail act omission national legislator consider punishable law. law therefore design protect u ensure safety aspects: physical, financial, psychological social. the extent money launder globally estimate $500 billion $1 trillion. the wide range estimate highlight difficulty associate obtain accurate data problem. this case limit number country set anti money launder regime run therefore able provide appropriate statistics. the problem lack accurate money launder statistic africa compound setting-up anti-money launder regime gain momentum now. it take time africa build accurate statistic money launder would source actual case investigate finalized. further, good understand national money launder activity require concert national research study money launder typology commonly practice country. in regard, worth mention institute security study south africa initiate number research study aim document extent money launder africa, especially southern africa. however, sufficiency integrity statistic provide institute good national source supply information. it therefore imperative national effort determine extent money launder must improve statistic important convince legislative political process need legislative change necessary effective combat money laundering. bi review 18/2005 1 the anti money launder law protect right individual provide articulation crime is, act crime punishment thereof. legislators, consultation constituent legislation crime, lay foundation basic individual human right attainment inner individual self fulfillment. crime criminal act work towards erode basic individual rights. despite enactment law design curb crime act crime, evil still take place case increase. the law enforcement agency world overwhelm sheer size sophistication criminal employ perpetrate illegal deeds. the effort crime prevention compound globalization create one may say global economy organize crime group individual generate huge sum money drug trafficking, financial crime, corruption, intellectual property crime, terrorism human trafficking. crime money launder indeed global problem require concert global response. in order protect respective financial system destabilize effect crime money laundering, imperative act respond scourge unprecedented resolve commitment combat it. everybody has, therefore, responsibility combat money laundering, negative impact unique way create far range negative consequences. by tackle money launder would attack criminal weak vulnerable point - money sources. in past year since start criminalization money launder enforcement anti money launder law 1970s vigorously 1980s 1990s, evidence court case report suspect transaction give indication common money launder typology realm drug trafficking, organize crime, corruption, illicit deal weapons, human trafficking, fraud theft. the act successful money launder fuel perpetration crime provide criminal avenue conceal deed law enforcement agency ultimately provide reward criminality form money would appear legitimate. the concealment cycle proceed money launder involves, firstly, distance criminal illegal proceed (money property), obscure money trail, hide origin eventually posse would appear clean money. the role play globalization ict concealment process money launder aptly describe follow quote central bank thriller “nest vipers” linda davies: “the money scream across wires, provenance fade maze electronic transfer shift it, hide it, break manageable wad would withdraw re-deposited elsewhere, obliterate trail”. the linkage money launder crime denote everybody individual affect money laundering. crime erode basic individual liberty threaten right life entitlement property. the consequence crime money launder bad business, development, general rule law. government therefore get real reason spearhead combat money laundering. another reason money launder combat leave unchecked, would lead accumulation economic power organize crime. this development potential erode political social system base elect representation know today. in words, social consequence allow money launderers operate unchecked could spell disaster stability rule law. the financial sector, particular bank sector, sectors, need operate crime money launder free environments. bank deal people’s money therefore rely heavily reputation probity integrity. without public confidence law abide citizenry would difficult bank conduct business form now. in instance bank may condone active party money laundering, end result legitimate business would avoid banks. it also conceivable money launder perpetrate high scale would complicate ability bank manage operation risks. this bank able predict movement launder money. bank also aware consequence business money launder unwittingly fraudulently use conduit money laundering. in jurisdiction national anti money launder law promulgated, non comply bank institution subject hefty fine instance bank license know withdrawn. 2 bi review 18/2005 a central banker, concern regard money launder would immediately would erode effectiveness management monetary policy. money launder grand scale potential change demand cash, make interest rate exchange rate volatile cause high inflation rate country. money launder also bad economy development undermine legitimate business, competition reduce tax revenue national authority launder would operate underground outside tax net. money launder thus bad economy nationally internationally. regulatory supervisory agency good reason participate combat money launder contained, would defeat objective weaken institution supervision. the combat money launder revolve around ensure ability national international agency find, freeze forfeiture launder money. this presuppose existence appropriate national international law capacity implementation laws. in addition, wide scope affect stakeholder anti money launder effort require unprecedented level co-operation national international levels. another important aspect money launder tendency need perpetrator operate cross border scheme purpose concealment and/or take advantage uneven development national anti money launder regimes. this require country develop anti money launder regime move tandem term speed standard detection law enforcement. the international community national agency indeed recognize need combat money laundering. to end first pre-requisite combat money launder place appropriate national legislation. appropriate national legislation craft local circumstance mind recognize need take account international nature money laundering. to end, participation multi-lateral agency unite nations, eu, au, etc. important formulation international instrument necessary combat money laundering. anti-money launder international instrument essential ensure international community react money launder global problem. the international instrument provide forum bring national effort money launder international loop. to mention few, follow important international instrument international community crafted: basel declaration 1988; un convention against illicit traffic narcotic drug psychotropic substance 1988; fatf 40+9 recommendations, 1990, numerous revisions; un convention transnational organize crime, 2000; un convention corruption; un international convention suppress finance terrorism. these various international instrument critical success fight money laundering. in addition, various multilateral organization instrumental advance cause fight money laundering. the imf world bank active provide resource capacity build technical expertise. national jurisdiction encourage ratify international instrument provide basis ensure appropriate national anti-money launder law international cooperation. critical international cooperation attendant national legislation pertain extradition criminal operate cross border money launder schemes. without robust extradition laws, criminal would loophole global sphere would allow evade law enforcement agency particular jurisdiction. the existence membership regional anti-money launder group important contribute harmonization law standards. in africa, number anti money group create provide need impetus ensure africa whole move towards uniform approach regard money launder problem. it important note legislative gap may exist international national level exploit money launderers make national anti-money launder regime ineffective. in line need formulate appropriate national legislations, need formulate standard anti-money launder practice institution provide maximum effectiveness national international levels. the g7 create financial action task force (fatf) craft 40 + 9 recommendation aim provide international standard anti money laundering, improve national system combat money laundering, strengthen role financial system strengthen international co-operation. bi review 18/2005 3 the combat money launder presuppose existence capacity resource national level. in africa, real challenge compete demand regard procurement utilization scarce resources. the resource scarcity critical law enforcement spheres, since national jurisdiction le efficient law enforcement agency case overwhelm demand enforce national laws. another important ingredient effective combat money launder need political commitment, well support affect industry general populace. it worth note au multilateral agency african nation members, number effort make ensure africa lag behind. in africa, number regional anti-money launder body create comfort see support regional group receive respective authorities. the creation necessary anti-money launder institution financial intelligence center issue african authority busy work on. financial intelligence center important detection money launderers link money flow perpetration specific crimes. the pressure african bank sector subject compliance national international anti-money launder requirements, make want compliment bank sector africa live requirement despite cost involve instances. in one way another bank africa work ensure compliance important aspect customer due diligence improve institutional capacity ensure system personnel gear discharge responsibility report institutions. the challenge africa regard ensure effective anti money launder immense innovative think may necessary respect majority african economy cash based. this may entail set entirely home grow standards. the combat money launder assume urgent impetus national international level result scale money launder begin assume, especially respect finance terrorist acts. the effort make combat money launder begin bear fruit take center stage jurisdictions. no one want leave behind mainly due consequence situation – lag behind might find difficult transact business rest comply world. in term set effective infrastructure necessary combat money laundering, one conclude africa international community begin get upper hand criminals. a word caution despite positive developments, criminal constantly devise elaborate evasive mean circumvent anti money launder efforts. i would like conclude emphasize money launder crime affect every individual, business government. it create important concern unchecked potential fuel crime ultimately erode individual right citizen affect national international economic performance. the combat money launder require first foremost craft appropriate law creation national international capacity coordination thereof. all presuppose need political commitment levels. i thank attention 4 bi review 18/2005 lars heikensten: introduction monetary policy speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, riksdag committee finance, stockholm, 15 march 2005. * * * allow usual begin thank invitation. i think go without say hear highly valuable feature open discussion monetary policy keen safeguard. it also hope hear help spread knowledge monetary policy issue wide audience, especially since broadcast live television. a customary first hear year i intend begin look back development last year. a know, inflation turn sharply low riksbank’s target 2004. when happen natural debate monetary policy arise public domain. it hardly exaggeration say discussion past year unusually lively. i comment debate detail i october, may reason touch upon today. subsequently i intend present current assessment inflation outlook explain interest rate decision make yesterday, i round general reflection swedish monetary policy condition operates. a look back 2004 development 2004 sweden’s economic performance past year characterise high growth couple markedly low inflation. economic growth last year actual fact considerably high normal; past 25 year growth high six occasions. even though demand general grow strongly 2004 cannot say employment. we yet see clear turnaround labour market. the riksbank’s monetary policy decision 2002 2003, relevant inflation outcome 2004, initially guide measure underlie inflationary pressure bank use recent years, und1x. in 2003, though, bank shift focus period measure und1x exclude energy prices. inflation accord measure average 0.9 per cent 0.8 per cent, respectively, 2004. in term cpi, inflation 0.5 per cent. the fact cpi inflation turn significantly low two measure essentially fairly extensive monetary ease begin end 2002 continue 2003 2004 keep households’ mortgage interest expenditure. so inflation 2004 low? in order get good picture one cause need go back turn year 2002-2003. at time inflation push unusually high electricity price rise record levels. the riksbank’s view temporary effect; electricity price would fall back inflation rate would therefore come year, did. a regard cpi und1x inflation, mean twelve-month change – change relation correspond month year early – fell steeply early 2004. so drop inflation start 2004 partly expect recoil temporary increase year before. (figure 1). the riksbank thus anticipate early 2003 cpi inflation would undershoot target 2004. inflation also depress low import prices. import producer price develop weakly couple years, although rise 2004 partly hike commodity price push price intermediate goods. a regard consumer prices, inflation import good turn unexpectedly low time. the surprisingly low import price could result swedish importer producer buy low-cost country great extent before, something difficult capture measure normally use gauge development world market prices. the low outcome likely also attributable condition sweden, include increase competition many sectors, least retail trade. bi review 18/2005 1 this bring third factor contribute low inflation, namely productivity, grow strong expect riksbank forecasters. (figure 2). this side unexpectedly weak labour market conditions, turn dampen domestic price wage pressures. neither cause high productivity growth fully understood. one possible hypothesis large-scale it investment many sector end 1990s begin pay off. another theory argue sweden highly open economy thus strongly influence currently rapid integration low-cost country world trade. a regard development productivity import inflation considerable uncertainty strength durability present tendencies. the riksbank unemployment a i say early natural debate monetary policy arise inflation deviate considerably target. on occasion debate fuel rise unemployment 2003-2004. when i autumn i devote lot attention issue riksbank could unemployment situation. the discussion continue since then. it important remember riksbank’s objective price stability. we try fulfil objective set interest rate level enable general level demand grow line economy able sustain long run without give rise inflation, ensure economic agent confidence bank meet inflation target. so indirect influence general level demand employment. and poor expect employment condition past two year due development demand. on contrary, demand prove surprisingly strong. nonetheless course maintain employment could somewhat high riksbank keep interest rate lower, something would possible give know inflation. it difficult object assertion, course riksbank’s critic keep come back it. but assessment could could do must base know decision made, know now. one way try approach issue compare assessment action players’ forecast opinion policy time question. the inflation report publish today show economic inflation outlook riksbank base monetary policy 2002-2003 way significantly different hold lead forecaster swedish economy period. (figure 3). if anything seem riksbank one successful forecasters, perhaps rather one least unsuccessful, although also remember forecasts, unlike others’, base assumption unchanged repo rate. part recent monetary policy debate see forecast compare national institute economic research (nier). it turn out, however, nier’s view appropriate repo rate path differ marginally riksbank’s. (figure 4). on average nier recommend repo rate barely 0.2 percentage point lower. give effect one generally expect monetary policy, inflation 2004 would marginally close target follow nier’s recommendations. nor would slight impact employment. the point difference opinion regard future inflation stance monetary policy small relation drop inflation rise unemployment. to sum up, conclude low inflation outcome 2004 cannot attribute monetary policy contrary consensus view time. instead, essentially result development practically nobody manage foresee. another possible conclusion would conduct dramatically different monetary policy inflation turn much close target 2004. for example, riksbank would probably cut repo rate rapidly sharply begin 2002. such stance would likely cause something stir. inflation high time nobody predict kind dramatic decline would justify substantial rate cut. to give idea sentiment time, one country’s lead trade union representative warn u take inflation target lightly. 2 bi review 18/2005 ha policy asymmetrical? one recurrent feature recent discussion claim riksbank concern high inflation low inflation. it say inflation since introduction bank’s target – 1995 onwards – turn somewhat target average. personally, i understand fear central bank could ”overly zealous” fight inflation, especially country experience high-inflation regime, case sweden. such risk also one argument favour open riksbank scrutiny promote policy clear possible. an open debate good opportunity scrutinise bank appear best antidote introvert exaggerate inflation-fighting perspective. have say that, though, i think every reason object recurrent interpretation low inflation expression excessively hawkish stance part riksbank. firstly, large part period question monetary policy guide measure underlie inflation und1x, policy first foremost evaluate term measure, accordance bank’s clarification 1999. und1x inflation average 1.9 per cent since 1995, undeniably quite close target. (figure 5). the fact cpi inflation period low – 1.4 per cent – mainly due sharp decline see general level interest rates, partly low-inflation environment secured. furthermore, ten year may short period ass policy, least number year involve adjustment one regime another, sweden’s case. another way approach issue study episode inflation undershoot riksbank’s target. that mainly happen three occasions. on first these, 1996-1997, high level interest rate previous year without doubt contribute drop general level demand low inflation. the period also characterise occasionally heat debate monetary policy. the reason riksbank decide keep policy tight time credibility inflation-targeting yet established. the two subsequent periods, 1998-1999 2004, completely different. on occasion repo rate relatively low year time general level demand grow fast. the main factor generate low inflation change supply side economy: deregulation, low import price surprisingly rapid productivity growth. the bank’s policy hardly call question conduct 1996-1997; retrospect criticism came, largely pattern recent times, i mention earlier. if one want argue riksbank systematically conduct excessively tight policy one reasonably able show forecaster call bank’s policy strongly question formulated. so, opinion, whole fairly natural explanation inflation average somewhat target past ten-year period. it riksbank consider deviation target le serious deviation target; instead, partly undergo adjustment high-inflation low-inflation regime, affect policy large measure first three episodes, partly inflation different occasion depress supply factor neither others able predict. allow conclude retrospective part speech underline i value open, lively debate monetary policy. i previously point committee would happy come often open form discussion one. if committee’s member idea improve material present, would interest hear them. the riksbank also consider initiate annual forum monetary policy debate, assessment policy discuss background regular independent evaluation forecast – participant general debate – produced. the current assessment cyclical upswing continue with i shall look forward briefly discus assessment economic inflation prospect late inflation report decision take yesterday regard repo rate. bi review 18/2005 3 a usual i shall begin brief look international situation. economic growth abroad remain high. there many indication international economic activity continue strengthen period ahead resource utilisation gradually pick up. high productivity growth weak resource utilisation keep cost development number industrialise countries. couple increase integration low-cost country world trade contribute low global inflationary pressures. in period ahead, price pressure expect remain modest even though increase economic condition improve reduction spare production capacity. that mean market interest rate also anticipate rise today’s unusually low levels. there positive signal emanate u economy euro area, notably germany, see somewhat weak growth expected. (figure 6.) overall, growth sweden’s export market forecast largely previous inflation report. the swedish economic recovery begin 2003 predict continue forecast period. in 2004 robust international demand swedish export contribute high economic growth. manufacture activity appear enter slightly slow phase. indicator data point continuation firm, healthy growth, albeit somewhat low rate early 2004. growth domestic demand assume increase contribution aggregate demand net export diminish. (table 1). in 2005 business investment private consumption anticipate account majority pick-up demand. compare december inflation report forecast gdp growth 2005 revise marginally 3.2 per cent, mainly due high investment increase service trade. towards end last year investment economy grow expect much suggest fast increase continue early 2005. despite last year’s robust productivity growth number employ fell second consecutive year. the fact firm able boost output sharply without hire new staff due rise productivity average work time. it reasonable believe, though, continuation strong gdp growth result high employment forecast period. different indicator labour market also suggest turnaround way. for example, number temporary employee rise since summer 2004 number new job vacancy report swedish employment office rise annual term period november-january drop almost two year row. there reason expect average productivity growth economy decrease somewhat economic upswing continues. nevertheless, riksbank’s assessment remain last increase rate productivity growth, bank’s forecast come year therefore relatively high long historical perspective. the forecast domestic cost pressure year revise somewhat compare assessment december basis new data 2004. resource utilisation swedish economy low last year. in particular, demand labour still limit even though indicator labour shortage show upward tendency. indicator manufacture also suggest capacity utilisation pick recently. the riksbank’s overall assessment resource utilisation rise – albeit low level – continue increase spare resource put use. the inflation outlook a i mentioned, domestic import inflation low past year. domestic inflation expect low point time rate price increase domestically produce good recent month also broadly line bank’s previous forecast. in spite this, forecast domestic inflation year next year revise down. one reason downward pressure price retail food trade anticipate great previously assumed. how big effect difficult say, though, significance general inflation rate long term. over long horizon, domestic inflation expect rise gradually cyclical upswing continue resource utilisation pick up. import inflation recently turn low anticipate previous inflation report. there several reason this, i touch upon earlier. for instance, increase import low-wage country appear lead great downward price pressure previously forecast even though projection optimistic price development import goods. the 4 bi review 18/2005 price-dampening factor also estimate affect import inflation period ahead, forecast therefore revise year next. the effect factor result fall price import good past year expect gradually subside, however. it reasonable believe rise global resource utilisation lead high international price pressures. in addition, gradual pick-up domestic resource utilisation mount cost pressure forecast contribute large price increase import good service well. all all, forecast domestic import inflation mean forecast und1x inflation revise compare inflation report december. (figure 7.) both import inflation domestic price pressure expect low mainly near term also latter part forecast period. the downward revision come year due change assessment economic prospects, rather number specific factor result high competition world market sweden. but cyclical upswing continue firms’ cost increase, still assume gradual rise inflation. in main scenario, base unchanged repo rate come two years, cpi und1x inflation expect target two year ahead. the annual average inflation low throughout forecast period, however. allow context briefly say something fact weak price development recent period cause word ”deflation” reappear media, often form eye-catching headline. there always reason keep risk deflation mind, since fall general price level sometimes associate considerable problem economy. it important, however, ascertain whether subdue price development result weak demand due positive change supply side economy. at moment doubt latter dominant factor. if pair jean become cheap dollar fallen, price plasma tv halve production increase china, price food go competition retail food trade toughened, something essentially happy about. but sharp fall demand situation would completely different course. so risk see could cause inflation deviate path main scenario? there number risk inflation assessment focus time, e.g. twin deficit u economy, development swedish krona, productivity growth. in addition, new risk emerge connection specific factors, development food prices, create great uncertainty inflation affect period ahead – least short run. compare previous inflation report main scenario occasion take account downside risk inflation great extent; e.g. increase international, well domestic, competition forecast somewhat big impact swedish price previously assumed. there arguments, however, could nevertheless entail underestimation inflation much overestimation. that shown, instance, late price data release last friday, inflation outcome february actually little high forecast inflation report publish today. individual monthly figure inflation difficult forecast, however, next month forecast could easily overshoot outcome. in main scenario productivity also assume follow normal cyclical pattern, like effect international competition argument suggest pattern may imply underestimation overestimation future trend. the overall assessment different risk factor risk outlook balanced, i.e. risk inflation turn high main scenario large risk inflation turn lower. thus, balance risk change assessment. inflation come two year low, come line target end forecast period. some consideration the point departure discussion future path repo rate assessment inflation prospect come year i presented. allow context point riksbank conduct monetary policy accord mechanical rule, even though sometimes seem perception. there also aspect inflation one two year ahead must take account set repo rate. bi review 18/2005 5 last year encounter similar situation today, bank's forecast suggest inflation would undershoot target almost entire two-year period ahead, even though estimate target two years’ time. one reason decide cut rate – reason still valid today – saw demand grow strongly already. so, monetary policy appear desire effect. this development reinforce business investment seem begin pick earnest private consumption also stronger. in words, economic activity already firm gdp growth judge sustainable long term. give that, rate cut would probably mean practice would tighten policy quickly future. so question try avoid excessive fluctuation real economy interest rates. another, partly relate aspect also reason consider make decision repo rate low inflation due large measure markedly weak price development certain product result increase competition, e.g. retail food trade textile industry. it probably always prudent fully counter highly loose policy would drive domestic demand. should price outlook change, may find excessively high price pressure established, may prove difficult break. it remain see long effect inflation price cut certain product last. this argument, too, essentially say involve ambition avoid excessive swing interest rate real economy. yet another factor discuss time executive board rapid growth household debt increase house prices. a number commentator begin highlight risk area. we previously conclude development cause great concern. even though largely remain assessment, gradually become clear development credit house price one argument loose monetary policy. a rate cut follow fast hike could bring problem effect household indebtedness consumption. the inflation assessment i present early indicate inflation line target end two-year period normally focus. at time issue i discuss give cause certain amount caution interest rate policy line bank’s clarification monetary policy 1999. all all, argument i put forward advocate leave repo rate unchanged, also decision take yesterday. a usual reason underline even though assessment today condition course change period ahead. a lot happen: imbalance unite state could result financial unease sharply curtail international economic upswing, credit debt development sweden may prove considerably worrisome foresee today. we may also find overestimate underestimate impact inflation change competitive pressures. so, claim medium riksbank close door particular course action future mislead usual. conclude remark allow conclude general reflection condition monetary policy operate regard expectation one it. even though development since shift policy regime early 1990s remarkably good has, know, neither stop inflation occasionally deviate sharply target prevent output employment fluctuate somewhat. what important realise always go fast change economy inflation cannot foresee fully offset short run. no central bank therefore full control inflation economic activity time. what monetary policy normally able achieve ensure inflation number year fairly well line inflation target. this also improve chance ensure stable development demand economy. that turn help smooth fluctuation cyclical component unemployment, even though relationship demand unemployment always especially strong, demonstrate particular recent developments. it important realise monetary policy, matter stabilisation policy general, cannot use permanently raise growth reduce unemployment. if aim achieve permanently high employment rate low unemployment, essentially question instead 6 bi review 18/2005 try influence structural component unemployment, i.e. component depend fluctuation demand good service economy. and require completely different measure monetary policy. example include improve business climate make labour market efficient possible. it vital discus evaluate monetary policy, also important discussion economic policy development whole base realistic view monetary policy accomplish. if so, discussion likely help u effort conduct monetary policy best way possible. thank you. 1. forecast und1x different time actual outcome annual percentage changesources: statisticssweden

population - lower-income family community - economic indicator relate market may offer insight influence local economic social programs. for example, accord 2003 study brook institution, number people live high-poverty neighborhood decrease 24 percent 1990 2000. much dramatic improvement occur cities, detroit, decrease 75 percent. in addition, report find concentrate poverty decrease among racial ethnic groups, percentage african-american live high-poverty neighborhood decline 30 percent 1990 19 percent 2000. these data present encourage picture improvement economic condition low-income family communities. the data also reveal gain homeownership among low-income minority populations. the federal reserve board's 2001 survey consumer finance (scf) conclude that, 1998 2001, family low

lecture charles goodhart1 able talk confidence feature particularly distinguish uk’s approach inflation targeting. today 20 countries, every habitable continent, formally operate variant inflation target many adopt part framework, actively share experience best practice, i suspect aspect approach would find counterpart somewhere else world. but charles’s focus monetary policy committee’s (mpc) personal engagement produce publish inflation forecast still seem capture essence uk’s approach. today i want talk role forecast come play help mpc take communicate decisions. in sense committee really ‘own’ publish forecast go name? how much use make models, model use? how far forecast appear drive interest rate decisions? and evidence help make policy le predictable? finally i want end comment issue raise forecast mean communication. why mpc always involve forecast the mpc’s early involvement forecast process firmly root kind committee is, well nature remit given. the objective uk monetary policy express term annual inflation target since 1992, responsibility achieve target initially lay treasury, act bank’s advice. in 1997, part wide range restructure bank england’s role, decision interest rate delegate bank’s new mpc. it nine member – five internal bank official four external member choose relevant knowledge experience – individually, publicly, accountable meet inflation target. the government remain responsible set annual inflation target, within context legislation require bank england achieve ‘price stability subject support government’s objective output employment’. under current remit, mpc require achieve 2% consumer price inflation ‘at times’. if inflation deviate target 1 percentage point, mpc write public letter chancellor explain why, bring back. these arrangement remain relatively novel unusual uk constitutional terms. prior 1997, longstanding objection bank england independence concern arrangement would inconsistent ministerial duty answer house common major matter policy. a high level transparency openness mpc decision critical aspect meet expectation parliamentary public accountability well effective way enhance credibility monetary policy. in fact great openness monetary policy part package change make restore credibility uk’s exit erm 1992. the bank play part introduce new quarterly inflation report, 1997 widespread respect objectivity 1 goodhart, c (1999) ‘recent development central banking: special feature monetary policy committee european system central banks’ jean monnet lecture, dublin european institute, 1999. bi review 17/2005 1 professionalism. against background, 1998 bank england act require new monetary policy committee sign bank’s inflation report. in practice, mpc’s sign far formality, though inflation report formally remain bank’s report. it surprise committee expert whose external member base bank devote least 60% time monetary policy get deeply involve prepare debate forecast sign off. it may remarkable nine economists, labour burden individual accountability, far succeed sign 31 edition inflation report, find way deal inevitable range views. the nature role forecast nowadays forecast two relate role monetary policy process. first, help committee set monetary policy organising, inform focus discussions. and second, provide transparency committee’s think play key part public communication strategy.2 help mpc make decision monetary policy need forward looking, interest rate act lag. no monetary policymaker avoid take view future. that view need coherent disciplined, inform best information available. but also need reflect realistic appreciation massive uncertainty inherent forecast. the mpc spend many hour discuss projection go inflation report text accompany them. although process somewhat streamline since charles’s day (when committee spend gruelling ten meet quarter forecast top usual monthly decision meetings) forecast round probably still large single commitment committee’s time. why? an important reason forecast occasion agree set projection inflation outlook. it come provide organise framework assess relevant information, opportunity deep discussion economic developments. since i committee, spend least half allot forecast time debate long term issues, effect structural change labour market relationship house price inflation consumption. sometimes outcome discussion material influence think risks, even direct impact central projection relatively minor. what role formal economic model play forecast? no set economic projection – least one own committee nine expert – ever outcome purely model-based operation. judgement always play large role – although different people frame judgement le model-based ways. but difficult make forecast without use models: provide organise framework ensure intellectual account consistency generate baseline projections, consider alternative scenario risks. what sort model committee find useful? in peer review bank’s use economic models3, adrian pagan suggest economic model may involve trade theoretical consistency (good economics) data coherence (a good fit); goal ensure position efficient frontier two. any model use principle frontier – want able move along frontier use different sort model different purposes. 2 charles give five argument ir responsibility mpc itself: transparency, discipline, good inform mpc, good forecast accountability (in order). i think fit within taxonomy. 3 pagan, a (2003) ‘modelling forecast bank england’, bank england quarterly bulletin spring 2003. adrian pagan commission produce postscript, follow introduction new bank england quarterly model. this publish late year. 2 bi review 17/2005 for example, if, i suggested, want use model facilitate discussion fundamental economic issues, clearly need model rich economic structure – structure reflect committee’s view way economy works. the bank’s new quarterly model (beqm)4 develop function much mind. but also use small model rich economic structure look specific issue part suite models. we also want quantify likely impact inflation output range piece data news accurately possible. the number matter, empirical performance important, too. we work hard ensure beqm well dimension, also, within suite, develop statistically base models. we may use model – stand alone forecast tool – inform judgement make use beqm. let say word main model suite. the motivation beqm project help ‘intellectual framework’ role forecast. without lose empirical performance, want improve upon previous main model’s articulation underlie structure economy, make explicitly consistent committee’s beliefs.5 this make possible light recent advance economic understand – particularly emphasis provide coherent micro foundation macroeconomic model – sheer computational power (both term compute power technique applied). beqm large scale model standard academic research, small scale compare traditional macro-econometric models. compare latter, also general equilibrium model emphasis internal consistency. household firm optimise – forward-looking use available information efficiently. unlike previous model, thing add up: flow add stocks, profit allocated, on. there high degree simultaneity way model solved. it long make sense, easy, consider model equation equation. this provide great degree discipline committee member staff, force confront full implication judgement explicitly. if someone want change one economic relationships, need say why, acknowledge possible implication behavioural relationships. if, example, want assume trend rate labour productivity growth changed, model require u recognise implication demand supply. fast productivity growth increase productive capacity, income also grow faster. so might mean demand now? this definite advance – provide general equilibrium mechanism new model fact reflect idea world works. but also make demand discussion. there easy fixes, difficult accommodate view differ model’s paradigm. a example, model firmly root rational expectation tradition. and assume monetary policy credible. both perfectly reasonable, arguably essential, model assumptions. the fact new model make explicit intellectually helpful. but doesn’t make easy provide answer question expectation credibility. what agent base decision simple rule thumb? beqm feature allow u accommodate question forecast – ad-hoc way require substantial degree judgement. we still learn exploit beqm’s possibilities. but clearly represent move towards ‘pagan frontier’, offer high degree theoretical coherence without lose empirical performance. a number central bank work similar model – ecb, bank canada, frb, norge bank bank finland – well imf. the international model community exemplary forum exchange idea experiences, learn – continue learn – lot experience others. no model everything. all model oversimplify drastically. the trick identify appropriate degree simplification task hand. so committee never prepare rely one model. this lead attempt develop suite models. 4 harrison, r, nikolov, k, quinn, m, ramsay, g, scott, a thomas, r (2005) the bank england quarterly model. 5 for description previous model, see economic model bank england (1999). bi review 17/2005 3 the suite take two forms. one range model complementary core forecast model. these hold magnify glass particular part economy, allow u take account influence wide range factor detail could accommodate main model. these (sub-) model might gear towards analyse particular policy issue (e.g., supply chain price models, future development household corporate gearing, productivity growth distribution sector). or might also provide interface short-term conjunctural analysis, 2-3 year forecast. second, set statistical models. the mpc attempt process huge amount information monthly decision. the committee already us data-driven forecast (for example, forecast us many variable forecast a-theoretic way, statistical model produce near term forecast key data cpi, small model filter ons first releases, handle inevitable data uncertainty associate early releases6). but herculean task absorb analyse data. so, respond need mpc, also suggestion pagan, staff process develop evaluate model gear towards empirical forecast accuracy find way combine forecast statistically efficient way. this much work progress, aim help mpc form judgement likely outturn uncertainty surround them. handle uncertainty disagreement even arm range economic model aid structure discussion enforce degree intellectual discipline, possible group nine individually accountable economist reach sufficient agreement publish forecast describe reflect best collective judgement? an important part answer lie use formal technique capture uncertainty risk. these antedate mpc. the bank england start publish fan chart inflation projection february 1996, follow early experiment might call ‘trumpet charts’.7 the motivation purely illustrate uncertainty inherent economic projections. while trumpet consist single shade area around central projection, correspond average absolute

while width fan bear relation size forecast error past decade (the distribution past forecast error provide benchmark calibration), main feature – moment underlie distribution – change forecast reflect committee’s best judgement balance risk around outlook inflation output degree uncertainty. while many central bank publish fan charts, mpc still relatively unusual base policymakers’ subjective view distribution risks, rather staff view historical/statistical measure past errors. the mpc’s approach construct fan chart help member come agreement substantive issues, retain individual views. this risk often major difference opinion amongst member lie. and member may able agree collective view overall outlook include degree uncertainty balance risks, might slightly different reasons. to sure, time difference view central projection significant handle within ambit fan chart (few) occasion inflation report include material illustrate minority view. but, mpc’s preface inflation report notes, fan chart reflect committee’s best collective judgement likely path output inflation uncertainty surround central projections, recognise member may slightly different view underlie assumptions. forecast interest rate decision how influential forecast process come actual business take decision interest rates? one yardstick might whether mpc likely change rate inflation report months. there necessary reason so: information accrue relatively evenly year, committee go decision take process every month. on hand, mpc might likely change rate systematic full review inflation outlook, rather response news month. on argument, ready-reckoners may give rough indication impact new data may be, substitute full analysis. so non-inflation report month mpc may sometimes decide ‘wait-and-see’ – postpone possible interest rate change evidence accumulated. a happens, market economist tend think interest rate change likely inflation report months. since 1998, reuters ask group economist (initially around 20-30, 40 more) attach probability range different outcome interest rates, calculate mean mode expect interest rate change across individuals. panel b

on face it, evidence might suggest re-evaluation outlook undertake quarterly forecast become influential. but number possible explanations. most obviously, could reflection shock come along last 4 years. these may require few change policy rate pre-2001 period. alternatively, require adjustment rate might big early days, mpc inclination change rate small steps, perhaps good reason proceed cautiously, large desire adjustment might require frequent changes: 16 change first period, 7 back-to-back, second period, 4 14 change happen consecutive meetings. the turnover committee’s membership since 2000 might provide different kind explanation. the present committee contain one member (the present governor) outset, early member serve short terms. might latter day tendency towards change rate forecast reflect generally le activist approach set rates? table 1 provide unscientific guide committee members’ degree activism: arrange ‘activist members’ (identified vote proportionately frequently rate change) top.9 if personal preference play role, might expect see relationship activism ‘mpc vintage’ – mpc member respond shocks, behaviour affect common factor, would clusters. keen mpc watcher doubt find support view personality matters. but, general, member vote rate change associate early year committee, consistent idea mpc may need respond frequently period.10 9 we exclude first 7 month mpc’s existence allow possibility first rate change reflect necessary adjustment reach mpc think right level interest rates. 10 there are, course, also possible explanations, e.g. member view consistently adrift rest committee, lead believe rate significantly low/high, may repeatedly – unsuccessfully – vote change without ‘activist’ sense want change rate frequently response news. 6 bi review 17/2005 table 1: mpc members’ vote statistic january 1998 (current member red)1 % month vote rate change % change vote ir month number meet attend since jan 1998 time membership willem buiter 79 36 29 1997-2000 sir alan budd 65 30 17 1997-1999 john vickers 61 29 28 1998-2000 charles goodhart 52 36 29 1997-2000 sushil wadhwani 51 37 37 1999-2002 christopher allsopp 49 44 37 2000-2003 deanne julius 46 47 41 1997-2001 stephen nickell 41 50 58 2000-date mervyn king 39 41 87 1997-date david clementi 37 43 57 1997-2002 ian plenderleith 33 44 54 1997-2002 sir andrew large 34 40 29 2002-date kate barker 33 53 46 2001-date sir edward george 30 45 67 1997-2003 richard lambert 29 67 21 2003-date marian bell 28 56 32 2002-date charles bean 28 60 54 2000-date rachel lomax 25 80 20 2003-date paul tucker 24 63 33 2002-date 1 up include february 2005 mpc meeting. ha publication regular forecasts, see bear close relationship decision take process, help make policy decision predictable? the test whether market le likely surprise interest rate changes, give full knowledge relevant economic news. we run simple statistical test two measure ‘market surprises’. one base reuters poll economists. the surprise measure difference actual repo rate change mean expect repo rate change. the surprise measure bite along yield curve: change imply three-month forward libor rate.11 both measure suggest interest rate surprise become significantly small post-2001 period previously (table 2 panel c), consistent improve policy predictability. but, intriguingly, also tentative evidence surprise inflation report month tend relatively large.12 what make that? 11 more precisely, imply 3-month libor forward rate constant horizon 3-months, constant horizon calculate linear interpolation adjacent future contracts. the result largely invariant use six twelve month horizons. 12 this could, course, entirely drive expectation would move non-inflation report months: extreme, distribution surprise month degenerate (i.e. one expect change rate actually happened) statement surprise big inflation report month different statement rate expect change months. the close distribution come degenerate, weight attach interpretation. but average surprise variance significant. bi review 17/2005 7 on close inspection, find seem relate decision inflation report month – publication report week later, minute week (panel e show market reaction policy decision is, average, significantly big reaction report minutes). this might imply rethink preparation inflation report counts. but, announced, decision (and accompany press notice, rate changed) provide information market need understand committee’s approach. this would consistent fairly high degree policy predictability. it worth emphasise observe tendency interest rate change coincide publication inflation report imply interest rate change tie mechanical way central projection inflation. the assessment risk always material factor determine policy, well important aspect presentation forecast. for example late inflation report publish central projection show inflation rise gently steadily 2% target, assume nearly flat profile interest rate three years. but report note balance risk downside single key near term risk areas, household sector. this provide nuanced background mpc’s february decision hold rate unchanged. forecast public communication all inflation target central bank use forecast communication tool. they provide coherent statement policymakers’ think economic outlook policy stance. together minute policy meet (in case publish individual vote two weeks), help discharge committee’s democratic duty explain itself, well support credibility help anchor inflation expectations.13 the inflation report play central role committee’s communication. since august 2003 governor front regular inflation report press conference, mpc’s appearance front treasury select committee (loosely) link inflation report cycle. this bring much debate question: much information central bank provide? academic tend press case transparency, practice central banker cautious, (though much predispose openness would twenty year ago). don kohn14 argue “more necessarily always better, step way central bank need take account potential cost well benefit great transparency”. in particular argue publication kind information could make difficult policymakers job, discussion possible path future interest rate see particularly hazardous, appear “as firm pre commitment intend be”.15 arguably first order issue central bank transparent inflation target framework. the objective policy clear, outside commentator access enough information work future direction rate themselves. nevertheless closely relate debate transparent inflation target central bank interest rate forecast based. an obvious reason want direct information ‘preferred’ path get direct evidence interest rate strategy. (how quickly rate rise? what advantage ‘wait-and-see’ approach?) 13 a mishkin put ‘.[h]aving secretive central bank inherently undemocratic…[b]asic democratic principle require central bank

publish forecast two different interest rate assumptions. on one – constant rate assumption – interest rate hold constant entire forecast horizon. on other, interest rate evolve line rate expect financial markets. until august 2004, presentation emphasise forecast base constant rates. since last august reverse presentation, emphasise market rate assumption.16 the constant interest rate path obviously stylise assumption, convey limit information future policy intentions. the message mpc make interest rate decision one time, make mind future path rate consistent inflation target. the market interest rate path condition assumption, mpc’s prediction future rates. the difference that, extent market rate curve embody market’s guess mpc take rates, forecast predicate market rate easily interpret comment view. so much significance read change condition assumption? do switch market rate represent tentative step towards provide guidance future direction policy? the fact interest rate historically low 2003 early 2004 bear matter. many academics, notably lars svensson, argue persuasively use unrealistic condition assumption make difficult public interpret mpc’s read economic outlook. a charlie bean point out,17 certainly true interest rate way ‘normal’ level reasons, expect increase decrease substantially forecast horizon – long time horizon forecast, force argument has. our decision shift focus presentation market rate couple decision publish forecast three years, rather two, previously case. this reflect change policy horizon – require meet 2% target ‘at times’. but provide useful context interpret gradient inflation forecast two year horizon, hence clear indication future policy, economy evolve line central projection. the shift use market rate assumption modest

association indian primary dealer association india, mumbai, 11 march 2005. * * * friends, i thankful fix income money market derivative association india (fimmda) primary dealer association india (pdai), organisers, invite deliver keynote address today. i pleasure closely associate fimmda pdai since inception. reserve bank india take active interest development fix income market role fimmda become increasingly important regard. it play pivotal role design documentation repos, commercial paper certificate deposits, finalise daily/annual valuation methodology fix income securities. rbi consistently seek view various g-sec market relate issues. it also involve standardisation market practice fix income securities/money market instruments/fixed income derivatives. it emphasise importance best practice otc interest rate derivative market circulate guidance note best practice member regard. we, rbi, understand need continue collaborative relationship fimmda pdai. it spirit i look forward deliberation today sixth annual conference organise jointly fimmda pdai. i somewhat reluctant elaborate subject day, namely, road map fix income derivative market, keynote address several reasons. my view regard articulate seminar publish bi paper title “issues challenge development debt market india”. the subject subsequently updated, elaborate improve upon comprehensively friend former colleague dr.rakesh mohan, address gather last year dubai. dr. mohan already indicate “road ahead”, i fully endorse. moreover, one wait free frank discussion subject conference, distinguish person several perspective participating. let assure rbi look forward deliberation conference suggestion make be, extent possible, examine various technical group rbi set recently. it intention place report group money market, government security market forex market public domain soon. hence, subject sixth annual conference well-timed significant us. to justify presence here, let take opportunity mention recent development keep view deliberation conference. first, provision fiscal responsibility budget management act, 2003, reserve bank participating, normal circumstances, primary market government security start 2006-07. the technical group i refer currently work operational, technological institutional aspect this. hence, market perspective implication development best articulate conference today. second, twelfth finance commission make certain recommendation would mean state government would approach market instead obtain loan government india. several operational issue address management borrow programme state governments, future. we convene conference state finance secretary 8th april 2005, address dr. c. rangarajan, chairman, economic advisory council prime minister former chairman, twelfth finance commission, discus issues. the road map conference would indicate regard helpful discussion policy formulation regard debt-papers state governments. third, central government budget propose special purpose vehicle (spv) raise resource investment infrastructure. the issuance debt-paper relatively long maturity, outside government india’s normal borrow programme, yet another recent dimension add debt-market development country. bi review 17/2005 1 finally, several legislative change anvil provide new opportunity development fix income markets. for example, long await government security bill advance stage processing. the finance minister, budget speech, announce intention government bring amendment rbi act bank regulation act amendment relate statutory pre-emption could implication fix income markets. in context, useful recognise stake rbi fix income derivative market arise account several reasons. first, rbi monetary authority concern transmission monetary policy. second, must recognise indian conditions, neither close economy open economy. in reality, open economy careful management process open critical growth stability. third, reserve bank india, central bank, financial stability one increasingly important consideration important subset financial stability determine stability external sector. fourth, government security market, currently dominant segment fix income markets, also legitimate concern central bank, since provide benchmark interest rates. the government security market, setting, policy signal although rate largely market determined. fifth, reserve bank india regulator bank also primary dealers, together constitute large holder government papers. hence, significant linkage rbi’s prudential regulation fix income markets. finally, economy like attempt structural transformation, rbi developmental role also, apart regulator money markets, government security market forex markets. it context reserve bank india go close interactive mode organisation like fimmda pdai. rbi’s developmental role context self regulatory organisation (sros), perhaps worth explore length. a good begin may report advisory group security market regulation, 2001 (chairman: shri deepak parekh) make certain observation self regulation sros rbi. the relevant extract section 2.4 read follows: “further, slow evolution association mutual fund india (amfi) sro mean continuation substantial regulatory burden sebi. in regard, group suggest sebi assist amfi develop full-fledged sro. similarly, money government security markets, fix income money market derivative association india (fimmda) primary dealer association india (pdai) operate industry level associations, gradually take role sros. there yet regulatory oversight rbi emerge sros. however, facilitate association emerge full-fledged sros, rbi engage consultative process, need intensified. on part, promote integrity markets, fimmda pdai need establish comprehensive code conduct best practice security transaction also mechanism enforce codes. the rbi play supportive role here”. there recent review (december 2004) recommendation advisory group constitute stand committee international financial standard code publish january 2005 rbi bulletin. an extract “report progress agenda ahead” useful, though, disclaimer says, assessment professional staff rbi necessarily view reserve bank: “the proposal accord legal status sro fimmda examine detail rbi find feasible present. however, fimmda establish code conduct undertake relate responsibility appropriate industrial body. accord self-regulatory status pdai non-issue since pdai member also member fimmda”. there several concept address report cited, particular, `industry body’; `self regulatory organisation’ `legal status sro’. there considerable merit debate concept relevance fimmda, keep view way forward contemplate conference today. self-regulation long history work effectively. some early sign self-regulation evident utterance hippocratic oath medical professional time graduation. almost thousand year ago, maghribi trader probably one first self-regulatory scheme base market incentive regulate trade. the maghribi jewish trader live abbasasid caliphate (centered baghdad) first half tenth century, emigrate north africa. they operate business associate handle business deal abroad. merchant could never sure agent actually hand entire 2 bi review 17/2005 proceed business do abroad behalf. court generally unable verify agents’ claim action track agent abscond merchant’s money. the maghribi trader solve problem organize coalition serve grapevine information honest dishonest agents. any agent treat member unfairly could never hope business members. in europe, eleventh twelfth centuries, rural folk move town cities, new class merchant emerge meet demand grow urban population. it period basic concept institution modern western mercantile law (lex mercatoria) formed. the self-regulation evolve significantly since linkage regulatory authorities, often sound legal basis, establish mainly financial sector. self-regulation generally impose low cost official regulation whenever shift feasible. sros posse flexibility adapt regulatory requirement rapidly change business environment. they provide intimate knowledge market products. self-regulation, typically involve unique combination private interest government regulatory oversight them, effective efficient form regulation complex, dynamic ever-changing financial service industry. the role self-regulation and, indeed, existence, differ country country, across market sector across develop emerge markets. in complete form, self-regulation encompass authority create, amend, implement enforce rule conduct respect entity subject sro’s jurisdiction, resolve dispute arbitration means. the advantage self-regulation clear, especially term minimise cost regulation well cost compliance regulation financial sector, improve quality regulation. however, number issue particularly financial sector often cited. for instance, well-known observation “regulatory capture”, is, regulate entities, organise form, tendency capture regulator protect interests. it also argue sros protect interest member conflict interest system. in regard, i find model effective regulation, bring report sro consultative committee international organization security commission may 2000, useful. perhaps issue also address conference part way forward. let thank organiser give opportunity wish conference success. bi review 17/2005 3 alan greenspan: future social security programme economics retirement testimony mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, special committee aging, u senate, washington dc, 15 march 2005. * * * mr. chairman, senator kohl, member committee, i please today discus issue population age retirement. in doing, i would like emphasize view i express necessarily represent federal reserve board. the economics retirement straightforward: enough resource must set aside lifetime work fund consumption retirement. at rudimentary level, one could envision household actually store good purchase work year use retirement. even better, resource would otherwise go produce store good could divert production new capital assets, would produce even great quantity good service late use. in latter case, would raise output per worker hour, traditional measure productivity. the bottom line success retirement program availability real resource retirement. the financial system associate retirement plan facilitate allocation resource supply retirement consumption good services; produce good services. a useful test retirement system society whether set realistic expectation future availability real resource and, hence, capacity deliver postwork consumption without overly burden standard live working-age population. in 2008, lead edge must surely large shift work retirement nation's history become evident baby boomer become eligible social security. accord intermediate projection social security trustees, population 65 year age old approximately 26 percent adult population 2030, compare 17 percent today. this huge change structure population expose financial retirement system severe stress require adjustment historical precedents. indeed, retirement, generally, relatively new phenomenon human history. average american life expectancy century ago, example, 47 years. relatively citizen able enjoy many postwork years. one consequence sizable baby boom cohort move workforce retirement inevitable slow growth gross domestic product per caput relative growth output per worker. a ratio worker population declines, must ratio output population, assume change growth productivity. that result simply matter arithmetic. the important economic implication arithmetic that, few worker relative dependents, worker's output support great number people. under intermediate population projection social security trustees, example, ratio worker total population shrink 7 percent 2030. this shrinkage mean that, 2030, total output per person 7 percent low would current population structure persist. the fact great share dependent elderly rather child put additional burden society's resources, elderly consume relatively large share per caput resources, whereas child consume relatively little. this inevitable drop growth rate per caput gdp relative growth productivity could cushion increase labor force participation, would boost ratio worker population. increase labor force participation seem natural response population aging, american live long also generally live healthier. rate disability elderly declining, reflect improvement health change technology accommodate physical impairment associate aging. in addition, work become le physically strenuous demand intellectually, continue century-long trend toward conceptual le physical economic output. despite improve feasibility work old ages, american retire young young ages. for example, 1940, median age retirement men 69; today, median age 62. in recent years, labor force participation among old american pick bi review 17/2005 1 somewhat, far early determine underlie cause increase. rise pressure retirement income grow scarcity experience labor could induce increase labor force participation elderly near-elderly future. in addition, policy specifically encourage great labor force participation would also lessen necessary adjustment consumption. worker near retirement accumulate many year valuable experience, extend labor force participation year could sizable impact economic output. another way boost future standard live increase saving.1 we need additional save decade ahead finance construction capital stock produce additional real resource need redeem retirement claim baby boomer without severely raise claim tomorrow's workers. however, almost measure, require amount save would necessary sufficiently large raise serious question whether able meet retirement commitment already made. much make shortfall private defined-benefit plans, gross underfunding currently $450 billion, although significant percentage $1.8 trillion asset private defined-benefit plans, modest compare underfunding publically administer pensions. at present, social security trustee estimate unfunded liability indefinite future $10.4 trillion. the shortfall medicare calculate several multiple one social security. these number suggest either large tax increase require meet shortfall benefit par back. because benefit cut almost surely least part resolution, incumbent government convey future retiree real resource currently promise available retirement fully forthcoming. we owe future retiree much time possible adjust plan work, saving, retirement spending. they need ensure personal resources, along expect receive government, sufficient meet retirement goals. conventional advice personal-finance professional one aim accumulate sufficient resource provide overall replacement rate 70 percent 80 percent retirement. under current law, social security promise replacement rate 42 percent worker earn economywide-average wage every year career 56 percent low-wage worker earn 45 percent economywide-average wage.2 assume tax cap current 12.4 percent payroll, revenue sufficient pay 70 percent current-law benefit middle century. thus, average worker, replacement rate 30 percent would payable contemporaneous revenues, assume benefit reduction apply proportionately across board. for low-wage worker, payable replacement rate would 40 percent. assume goal still replace 70 percent 80 percent pre-retirement income, average worker middle century aim replace 45 percent pre-retirement income, rather today's 33 percent, combination private employer pension benefit personal saving. the require increase private save would le extent social security tax increase part solution. however, avoid change replacement rates, social security tax rate would increase current 12.4 percent 18 percent middle century. *** once determine level benefit reasonably promise, must ensure real resource future fulfill promises. when evaluate ability meet promises, focus solely solvency financial plan is, judgment, mistake. focus solvency within social security system, without regard broad macroeconomic picture, ensure real resource fulfill commitment 1 additionally, could borrow abroad, would build capital stock. in doing, however, would also build liability foreigner would finance future. 2 the replacement rate ratio social security benefit wage year precede retirement. 2 bi review 17/2005 there. for example, build asset social security trust fund, thereby achieve solvency, offset effort reduce save elsewhere, real resource require meet future benefit forthcoming economy. in end, accomplish little prepare economy meet future demands. thus, address social security's imbalances, need ensure measure take finance future benefit commitment represent real addition national saving. we need, effect, make phantom "lock-boxes" around trust fund real. for brief period late 1990s, common commitment emerge that. but, regrettably, commitment collapse become apparent that, light le favorable economic environment, maintain balance budget exclude social security would require low spend high taxes. last year, social security tax revenue plus interest exceed benefit $150 billion. if fund remove unify budget "locked up" congress make adjustment rest budget, unify budget deficit would $564 billion. a reasonable hypothesis congress would, fact, respond take action pare deficit. in case, end result would low government dissaving correspondingly high national saving. a simple reshuffle unify account lock-boxes would have, itself, add government savings; high tax low spend would accomplish important objective. the major attraction personal private account construct truly segregate unify budget and, therefore, likely induce federal government take action would reduce public dissaving raise national saving. but important recognize many variety private account exist, significantly different economic consequences. some type account virtually indistinguishable current social security system, congress would unlikely view truly off-budget. other type account actually transfer fund private sector unencumbered private assets. the congress much likely view transfer fund latter type account raise deficit would react take measure low it. *** failure address imbalance promise future retiree ability meet promise would severe consequence economy. the recent projection office management budget show spend social security, medicare, medicaid rise 8 percent gdp today 13 percent 2030.3 under exist tax rate reasonable assumption spending, projection make clear federal budget unsustainable path, large deficit result rise interest rate ever-growing interest payment augment deficit future years. but important, deficit percentage gdp simulation rise without limit. unless trend reversed, point deficit would cause economy stagnate worse. close gap solely rise tax rate would problematic; high tax rate rarely achieve comparable rise tax receipts, level require taxation could severely inhibit economic growth. in light sober projections, i believe thorough review commitment - least adjustment commitment - urgently needed. the necessary adjustment become ever difficult large long delay. no change easy. all program 3 the projection medicare medicaid view highly uncertain. health spend grow fast economy many years, growth fueled, large part, significant increase technology. how long trend continue extremely difficult predict. we know little rapidly medical technology continue advance innovation translate future spending. technological innovation greatly improve quality medical care can, instances, reduce cost exist treatments. but technology expand set treatment possibilities, also potential add overall spend - cases, great deal. in implement policy, need cognizant uncertainty - especially inability identify upper bind future demand medical care - counsel significant prudence policymaking. the critical reason proceed cautiously new program quickly develop constituency will fiercely resist curtailment spend tax benefits. a consequence, ability rein deficit-expanding initiatives, late prove excessive misguided, quite limited. thus, policymakers need err side prudence consider new budget initiatives. program always expand future resource become available, cannot easily curtail resource late fall short commitments. bi review 17/2005 3 budget exist majority congress president consider value society. adjustment thus involve make tradeoff among value alternatives. the congress must choose alternative value context limit resources. in so, need consider distributional effect policy change also broad economic effect labor supply, retirement behavior, national saving. the benefit take sound, timely action could extend many decade future. 4 bi review 17/2005 ben s bernanke: the global save glut u current account deficit remark mr ben s bernanke, member board governor u federal reserve system, sandridge lecture, virginia association economics, richmond, virginia, 10 march 2005. the reference speech find board governor federal reserve system’s website. * * * on dimension u.s. economy appear perform well. output growth return healthy levels, labor market firming, inflation appear well controlled. however, one aspect u.s. economic performance still evoke concern among economist policymakers: nation's large grow current account deficit. in first three quarter 2004, u.s. external deficit stand $635 billion annual rate, 5-1/2 percent u.s. gross domestic product (gdp). correspond deficit, u.s. citizens, businesses, government net raise $635 billion international capital markets.1 the current account deficit steep upward trajectory recent years, rise relatively modest $120 billion (1.5 percent gdp) 1996 $414 billion (4.2 percent gdp) 2000 way current level. most forecaster expect nation's current account imbalance decline slowly best, imply continue need foreign credit concomitant decline u.s. net foreign asset position. why unite states, world's large economy, borrow heavily international capital market - rather lending, would seem natural? what implication u.s. current account deficit consequent reliance foreign credit economic performance unite state trade partners? what policies, any, use address situation? in remark today i offer tentative answer questions. my answer somewhat unconventional i take issue common view recent deterioration u.s. current account primarily reflect economic policy economic development within unite state itself. although domestic development certainly play role, i argue satisfy explanation recent upward climb u.s. current account deficit require global perspective fully take account event outside unite states. to specific, i argue past decade combination diverse force create significant increase global supply save - global save glut - help explain increase u.s. current account deficit relatively low level long-term real interest rate world today. the prospect dramatic increase ratio retiree worker number major industrial economy one important reason high level global saving. however, i discuss, particularly interest aspect global save glut remarkable reversal flow credit develop emerging-market economies, shift transform economy borrower international capital market large net lenders. to clear, locate principal cause u.s. current account deficit outside country's borders, i make value judgment behavior either u.s. foreign resident governments. rather, i believe understand influence global factor u.s. current account deficit essential understand effect deficit devise policy address it. of course, always, view i express today necessarily share colleague federal reserve.2 the u.s. current account deficit: two perspective we find helpful consider, background analysis u.s. current account deficit, two alternative way think phenomenon - one relate deficit pattern u.s. trade second focus saving, investment, international financial flows. 1 a u.s. capital outflow three quarter total $728 billion annual rate, gross finance need exceed $1.3 trillion. 2 i thank david bowman, joseph gagnon, linda kole, maria perozek board staff excellent assistance. bi review 16/2005 1 although two way view current account derive account identity thus ultimately two side coin, provide useful lens examine issue. the first perspective current account focus pattern international trade. you probably aware unite state experience substantial trade imbalance recent years, u.s. import good service abroad outstrip u.s. export country wide margin. accord preliminary data, 2004 unite state import $1.76 trillion worth good service export good service value $1.15 trillion. reflect imbalance trade, current payment u.s. resident foreigner (consisting primarily spend imports, also include certain type payments, remittances, interest, dividends) greatly exceed analogous payment u.s. resident receive abroad. by definition, excess u.s. payment foreigner payment receive give period equal u.s. current account deficit, which, i already noted, track equal $635 billion 2004 - close $618 billion value u.s. import exceed exports. when u.s. receipt sale export current payment insufficient cover cost u.s. import payment foreigners, u.s. households, firms, government net must borrow difference international capital markets.3 thus, essentially definition, period u.s. net foreign borrow equal u.s. current account deficit, turn closely link imbalance u.s. international trade. that nation's import currently far exceed export widely understand concern many americans, particularly whose livelihood depend viability export import-competing industries. the extensive attention pay trade imbalance medium elsewhere tempt observer ascribe grow current account deficit factor change quality composition u.s. foreign-made products, change trade policy, unfair foreign competition. however, i believe - i suspect economist would agree - specific trade-related factor cannot explain either magnitude u.s. current account imbalance recent sharp rise. rather, u.s. trade balance tail dog; part, passively determine foreign domestic incomes, asset prices, interest rates, exchange rates, product fundamental drive forces. instead, alternative perspective current account appear likely useful explain recent developments. this second perspective focus international financial flow basic fact that, within country, save investment need equal period. in unite states, countries, economic growth require investment new capital good upgrade replacement old capital. example capital investment include construction factory office build firms' acquisition new equipment, range drill press computer airplanes. residential construction - build new home apartment build - also count part capital investment.4 all investment new capital good must finance manner. in close economy without trade international capital flows, fund investment would provide entirely country's national saving. by definition, national save sum save do household (for example, contribution employer-sponsored 401k accounts) save do business (in form retain earnings) le budget deficit run government (which use rather source saving)5. 3 for simplicity, i use term "net foreign borrowing" refer finance current account deficit, though strictly speak finance involve sale foreign domestic asset well issuance debt security foreigners. a illustrate data footnote 1, u.s. gross foreign borrow much large net foreign borrowing, gross borrow must sufficient offset deficit current payment also u.s. capital outflows. 4 this definition capital investment ignore many le tangible form investment, research development expenditures. it also ignore investment human capital, educational expenses. use inclusive definition investment could well change perception u.s. save investment trend quite substantially. i leave topic another day. 5 the bureau economic analysis treat government investment - road schools, instance - part national save national income accounts. thus, strictly speaking, national save reduce government deficit net government investment, entire government deficit. the difference domestic investment 2 bi review 16/2005 a i say, close economy investment would equal national save period; but, fact, virtually economy today open economies, well-developed international capital market allow saver lend wish make capital investment country, own. because save cross international borders, country's domestic investment new capital domestic save need equal period. if country's save exceed investment particular year, difference represent excess save lend international capital markets. by token, country's save le amount require finance domestic investment, country close gap borrow abroad. in unite states, national save currently quite low fall considerably short u.s. capital investment. of necessity, shortfall make net foreign borrow - essentially, make use foreigners' save finance part domestic investment. we saw early current account deficit equal net amount unite state borrow abroad period, i show u.s. net foreign borrow equal excess u.s. capital investment u.s. national saving. it follow country's current account deficit equal excess investment saving. to summarize, i describe two equivalent way interpret current account deficit, one term trade flow relate payment one term investment national saving. in general, perspective one take depend particular analysis hand. a i already suggested, economist offer explanation high rise level u.s. current account deficit country's foreign borrow emphasize investment-saving behavior rather trade-related factor (and i today). along lines, one commonly hear u.s. current account deficit product precipitous decline u.s. national save rate, recent year fall level far adequate fund domestic investment. for example, 1985 u.s. gross national save 18 percent gdp, 1995 16 percent gdp; 2004, contrast, u.s. national save le 14 percent gdp. those emphasize role low u.s. save often go conclude that, part, u.s. current account deficit "made u.s.a." independent (to first approximation) development part globe. that inadequate u.s. national save source current account deficit must true level; indeed, statement almost tautology. however, link current-account development decline save beg question u.s. save declined. in particular, although decline u.s. save may reflect change household behavior economic policy unite states, may also part reaction event external unite state - hypothesis i propose defend momentarily. one popular argument "made u.s.a." explanation decline national save rise current account deficit focus burgeon u.s. federal budget deficit, 2004 drain $400 billion national save pool. i discus link budget deficit current account deficit detail later. here i simply note so-called twin-deficits hypothesis, government budget deficit cause current account deficits, account fact u.s. external deficit expand $300 billion 1996 2000, period federal budget surplus project remain so. nor, matter, twin-deficits hypothesis shed light number major countries, include germany japan, continue run large current account surplus despite government budget deficit similar size (as share gdp) unite states. it seem unlikely, therefore, change u.s. government budget position entirely explain behavior u.s. current account past decade. the change pattern international capital flow global save glut what account rapid increase u.s. current account deficit? my prefer explanation focus i see emergence global save glut past eight ten years. this save glut result number developments. a i discus detail later, one well-understood source save glut strong save motive rich country age populations, must make provision impend sharp increase number retiree relative number workers. with slowly grow decline workforces, well high capital-labor ratios, many advance economy outside unite state also face apparent dearth national save affect qualification, however, government investment imply adjustment national save cancel out. bi review 16/2005 3 domestic investment opportunities. a consequence high desire save low prospective return domestic investment, mature industrial economy group seek run current account surplus thus lend abroad.6 table 1. global current account balances, 1996 2003 (billions u.s. dollars) country 1996 2003 industrial 46.2 -342.3united state -120.2 -530.7japan 65.4 138.2 euro area 88.5 24.9france

(data first three quarter 2004 imply current account deficit rise last year additional $140 billion annual rate.) in principle, current account position world's nation sum zero (although, practice, data collection problem lead large statistical discrepancy, show last row table 1). the $410 billion increase u.s. current account deficit 1996 2003 must therefore match shift toward surplus equal magnitude countries. which country experience change? a infer table 1, swing toward surplus occur industrial country whole (although individual industrial country experience large move toward surplus, see). the collective current account industrial country decline $388 billion 1996 2003, imply that, $410 billion increase u.s. current account deficit, $22 billion offset increase surplus industrial countries. a table 1 shows, bulk increase u.s. current account deficit balance change current account position develop countries, move collective deficit $88 billion surplus $205 billion - net change $293 billion - 1996 2003.7 the available data suggest current account develop emerging-market economy swing $60 billion surplus 2004. this remarkable change current account balance develop country raise least three questions. first, event factor induce change? second, causal relationship (if any) exist change current-account development unite state industrial countries? third, extent movement toward surplus developing-country current account differential impact unite state relative industrial countries, account difference? in view, key reason change current account position develop country series financial crisis country experience past decade so. in mid-1990s, develop country net importer capital; table 1 shows, 1996 emerge asia latin america borrow $80 billion net world capital markets. these capital inflow always productively used. in cases, example, developing-country government borrow avoid necessary fiscal consolidation; cases, opaque poorly govern bank system fail allocate fund project promise high returns. loss lender confidence, together factor overvalue fix exchange rate debt short-term denominate foreign currencies, ultimately culminate painful financial crises, include mexico 1994, number east asian country 1997-98, russia 1998, brazil 1999, argentina 2002. the effect crisis include rapid capital outflows, currency depreciation, sharp decline domestic asset prices, weaken bank systems, recession. 7 the statistical discrepancy also increase substantially, $96 billion net. a asset accumulation develop country may le completely measure industrial countries, significant part change discrepancy may represent additional movement toward surplus developing-country current accounts. bi review 16/2005 5 in response crises, emerging-market nation either choose force new strategy manage international capital flows. in general, strategy involve shift net importer financial capital net exporters, case large net exporters. for example, response instability capital flow exchange rate, east asian countries, korea thailand, begin build large quantity foreign-exchange reserve continue even constraint impose halt capital inflow global financial market relaxed. increase foreign-exchange reserve necessarily involve shift toward surplus country's current account, increase gross capital inflows, reduction gross private capital outflows, combination elements. a table 1 shows, current account surplus important source reserve accumulation east asia. country region escape bad effect crisis remain concern future crises, notably china, also build reserves. these "war chests" foreign reserve use buff potential capital outflows. additionally, reserve accumulate context foreign exchange intervention intend promote export-led growth prevent exchange-rate appreciation. country typically pursue export-led growth domestic demand think insufficient employ fully domestic resources. follow 1997-98 financial crisis, many east asian country seek stimulate export high domestic rate save and, relative historical norms, depress level domestic capital investment - also consistent, course, strengthen current accounts. in practice, country increase reserve expedient issue debt citizens, thereby mobilize domestic saving, use proceed buy u.s. treasury security assets. effectively, government act financial intermediaries, channel domestic save away local us international capital markets. a relate strategy focus reduce burden external debt attempt pay obligations, fund come combination reduce fiscal deficit increase domestic debt issuance. of necessity, strategy also push emerging-market economy toward current account surpluses. again, shift current account east asia latin america evident data region individual country show table 1. another factor contribute swing toward current-account surplus among non-industrialized nation past year sharp rise oil prices. the current account surplus oil exporters, notably middle east also country russia, nigeria, venezuela, rise oil revenue surged. for example, table 1 shows, collective current account surplus middle east africa rise $40 billion 1996 2003; continue swell 2004 oil price increase yet further. in short, event since mid-1990s lead large change collective current account position develop world, imply many develop emerging-market country large net lender rather net borrower international financial markets. of course, develop country group increase current account surplus industrial country reduce current account accordingly. how occur? little evidence support view motivation save decline substantially industrial country recent years; indeed, i note already, demographic factor lead industrial country try save more, less. instead, requisite shift collective external position industrial country facilitate adjustment asset price exchange rates, although pattern asset-price change somewhat different 2000. from 1996 early 2000, equity price play key equilibrate role international financial markets. the development adoption new technology rise productivity unite state - together country's long-standing advantage low political risk, strong property rights, good regulatory environment - make u.s. economy exceptionally attractive international investor period. consequently, capital flow rapidly unite states, help fuel large appreciation stock price value dollar. stock index rise industrial country well, although stock-market capitalization per caput significantly low country unite states. the current account position industrial country adjust endogenously change financial market conditions. i focus case unite states, bore bulk adjustment. from trade perspective, high stock-market wealth increase willingness u.s. consumer spend good services, include large quantity imports, strong dollar make u.s. import cheap (in term dollars) export expensive (in term foreign 6 bi review 16/2005 currencies), create rise trade imbalance. from saving-investment perspective, u.s. current account deficit rise capital investment increase (spurred perceive profit opportunities) time rapid increase household wealth expectation future income gain reduce u.s. residents' perceive need save. thus rapid increase u.s. current account deficit 1996 2000 fuel significant extent increase global save great interest part foreigner invest unite states. after stock-market decline begin march 2000, new capital investment thus demand finance wan around world. yet desire global save remain strong. the textbook analysis suggest that, desire save outstrip desire investment, real rate interest fall equilibrate market global saving. indeed, real interest rate relatively low recent years, unite state also abroad. from narrow u.s. perspective, low long-term rate puzzling; global perspective, may le so.8 the weaken new capital investment drop equity price much change net effect global save glut u.s. current account. the transmission mechanism changed, however, low real interest rate rather high stock price become principal cause low u.s. saving. in particular, past years, key asset-price effect global save glut appear occur market residential investment, low mortgage rate support record level home construction strong gain house prices. indeed, increase home values, together stock-market recovery begin 2003, recently return wealth-to-income ratio u.s. household 5.4, far peak value 6.2 1999 long-run (1960-2003) average 4.8. the expansion u.s. house wealth, much easily accessible household cash-out refinance home equity line credit, keep u.s. national save rate low - indeed, together significant worsen federal budget outlook, help drive lower. a u.s. business investment recently begin cyclical recovery residential investment remain strong, domestic save shortfall continue widen, imply rise current account deficit increase dependence unite state capital inflows.9 accord story i sketch thus far, event outside u.s. border - financial crisis induce emerging-market country switch international borrower international lender - play important role evolution u.s. current account deficit, transmission occur primarily endogenous change equity values, house prices, real interest rates, exchange value dollar. one might ask current-account effect increase desire global save felt disproportionately unite state relative industrial countries. the attractiveness unite state investment destination technology boom 1990s depth sophistication country's financial market (which, among things, allow household easy access house wealth) certainly important. another factor special international status u.s. dollar. because dollar lead international reserve currency, emerging-market country use dollar reference point manage value currencies, save flow develop world direct relatively dollar-denominated assets, u.s. treasury securities. the effect save outflow may thus felt disproportionately u.s. interest rate dollar. for example, dollar probably strengthen latter 1990s would principal reserve currency, enhance effect u.s. current account. most interesting, however, experience unite state recent year nearly unique among industrial country one might think initially. a show table 1, number key industrial country unite state see current account move substantially toward deficit since 1996, include france, italy, spain, australia, unite kingdom. the principal exception trend among major industrial country germany japan, saw substantial increase current account balance 1996 2003 (and significant increase 2004). a key difference two group country 8 in point possible effect strong global save real interest rates, i mean rule factors. for example, low risk premium result increase macroeconomic monetary stability likely play role. 9 greenspan (2005) note strong correlation u.s. mortgage debt u.s. current account deficit. bi review 16/2005 7 country whose current account move toward deficit generally experience substantial house appreciation increase household wealth, germany japan - whose economy grow slowly despite low interest rate - not. for example, wealth-to-income ratio rise since 1996 14 percent france, 12 percent italy, 27 percent unite kingdom; country see current account move toward deficit, already noted. by contrast, wealth-to-income ratio germany japan remain flat.10 the evident link rise household wealth tendency current account shift toward deficit consistent mechanism i describe today. economic policy implication i present today somewhat unconventional explanation high rise u.s. current account deficit. that explanation hold one factor drive recent development u.s. current account substantial shift current account develop emerging-market nations, shift transform country net borrower international capital market large net lenders. this shift develop nations, together high save propensity germany, japan, major industrial nations, result global save glut. this increase supply save boost u.s. equity value period stock market boom help increase u.s. home value recent period, consequence low u.s. national save contribute nation's rise current account deficit. from global perspective, development economically beneficial harmful? certainly benefits. most obviously, develop emerging-market country bring current account surplus reduce foreign debts, stabilize currencies, reduce risk financial crisis. most country largely successful meet objectives. thus, shift economy borrower lender status provide least short-term palliative problem face 1990s. in long term, however, current pattern international capital flow - persist - could prove counterproductive. most important, develop world lend large sum net mature industrial economy quite undesirable long-run proposition. relative counterpart develop world, worker industrial country large quantity high-quality capital work. moreover, i already noted, population country grow slowly age rapidly, imply ratio retiree worker rise sharply come decades. for example, unite states, every 100 people age 20 64, currently 21 people age 65 older. accord unite nation projections, 2030 population unite state include 34 people age 65 100 people 20-64 age range; euro area japan, analogous number 2030 46 57, respectively. over remainder century, population major industrial country age much quickly unite states. in 2050, example, number retiree 100 working-age people unite state 2030, 34, number retiree per 100 working-age people project increase 60 euro area 78 japan. we see many major industrial country - particularly japan country western europe - strong reason save (to help support future retirees) increasingly limit investment opportunity home (because workforce shrink capital-labor ratio already high). in contrast, develop country young more-rapidly grow workforces, well relatively low ratio capital labor, condition imply return capital country may potentially quite high.11 basic economic logic thus suggest that, long term, industrial country group run current account surplus lend net develop world, way around. if financial capital flow "natural" direction, saver industrial country would potentially earn high return enjoy increase diversification, borrower develop world would fund make 10 these data annex table 58, oecd economic outlook, vol. 76, 2004, p. 226. the late year data available 2003 germany unite kingdom, 2002 france, italy, japan. 11 china important exception generalization develop country young populations. the country's fertility rate decline since 1970s, elderly dependency ratio expect exceed unite state midcentury. 8 bi review 16/2005 capital investment need promote growth high live standards. of course, ensure capital flow develop country yield benefits, develop country would need make progress toward improve condition investment, i discus bit. a second issue concern us international credit unite state industrial country external deficits. because investment business equipment structure relatively low recent year (for cyclical reasons) tax financial system unite state many country design promote homeownership, much recent capital inflow develop world show high rate home construction high home prices. high home price turn encourage household increase consumption. of course, increase rate homeownership household consumption good things. however, long run, productivity gain likely drive nonresidential investment, business purchase new machines. the great extent capital inflow act augment residential construction especially current consumption spending, great future economic burden repay foreign debt likely be. a third concern pattern capital flow arise indirect effect flow sectoral composition economy receive them. in unite states, example, growth export-oriented sector manufacture restrain u.s. trade imbalance (although recent decline dollar alleviate pressure somewhat), sector produce nontraded good services, home construction, grow rapidly. to repay foreign creditors, must someday, unite state need large healthy export industries. the relative shrinkage industry presence current account deficit - shrinkage may well reverse future - impose real cost adjustment firm worker industries. finally, large current account deficit unite states, particular, require substantial flow foreign financing. a i discuss today, underlie source u.s. current account deficit appear medium-term even long-term nature, suggest situation eventually begin improve, although return approximate balance may take time. fundamentally, i see reason whole process proceed smoothly. however, risk disorderly adjustment financial market always exists, appropriately conservative approach policymakers guard developments. what policy option exist deal u.s. current account deficit? i downplay role u.s. federal budget deficit today, i disagree view, sometimes heard, balance federal budget would largely defuse current account issue. in particular, extent reduction federal budget result low interest rates, principal effect might increase consumption investment spend home rather low current account deficit. indeed, recent study suggest one-dollar reduction federal budget deficit would cause current account deficit decline le 20 cent (erceg, guerrieri, gust, 2005). these result imply even could balance federal budget tomorrow, medium-term effect would likely reduce current account deficit le one percentage point gdp. although i believe plausible near-term change federal budget would eliminate current account deficit, i stress reduce federal budget deficit still good idea. although effect current account rein budget deficit would likely relatively modest, least direction right. moreover, good reason bring federal budget deficit, include reduction debt obligation service taxpayer future. similar observation apply policy recommendation increase household save unite states, example create tax-favored save vehicles. although effect saving-friendly policy u.s. current account deficit might dramatic, direction would right. moreover, increase u.s. national save current low level would support productivity wealth creation help society make good provision future. however, i argue today, key reason large u.s. current account deficit external unite states, imply purely inward-looking policy unlikely resolve issue. thus direct approach help encourage develop country re-enter international capital market natural role borrowers, rather lenders. for example, develop country could improve investment climate continue increase macroeconomic stability, strengthen property rights, reduce corruption, remove barrier free flow financial capital. provide assistance develop country strengthen financial bi review 16/2005 9 institution - example, improve bank regulation supervision increase financial transparency - could lessen risk financial crisis thus increase willingness country accept capital inflow willingness foreigner invest there. financial liberalization particularly attractive option, would help permit capital inflow find highest-return us and, ease borrow constraints, spur domestic consumption. other change occur naturally time. for example, pace emerging-market country accumulate international reserve slow increasingly perceive reserve adequate move toward flexible exchange rates. the factor underlie u.s. current account deficit likely unwind gradually, however. thus, probably little choice except patient work create condition great share global save redirect away unite state toward rest world - particularly develop nations. 10 bi review 16/2005 alan greenspan:

summertime lull, i expect healthy employment gain come quarters, albeit possibly large month-to-month variations. despite growth employment, however, unemployment rate decline relatively slowly, strengthen job market attract people back labor force. consumer spend well maintain recession, i mention earlier, continue growth household expenditure complement expect increase business spend 2005. some observer express concern rise level household debt, federal reserve follow development closely. however, concern debt growth allay fact household asset (particularly house wealth) rise even quickly household liabilities. indeed, ratio household net worth household income rise smartly currently stand 5.4, well long-run average 1 i thank board staff member william wascher charles fleischman excellent assistance. bi review 15/2005 1 4.8. with real disposable income rise past quarters, consumer good financial shape - positive indication household spending. one caveat future recent rapid escalation house price - 11 percent 2004, accord repeat-transactions index construct office federal house enterprise oversight - unlikely continue. a plausible scenario house price either move sideways rise slowly next years, eventually bring rate return house line relatively low prospective rate return currently observe virtually assets, real financial. if increase house price begin moderate expected, result slowdown household wealth accumulation lead ultimately somewhat slow growth consumer spending. that said, residential construction remain reasonably strong 2005, support grow population, rise employment incomes, mortgage rate remain historically low. however, homebuilder hard press much exceed record level start see 2004. thus, residential investment seem likely make diminish contribution overall economic growth. investment nonresidential structures, office build industrial commercial space, appear poise improve year several year doldrums, though full recovery sector await decline office vacancy rate increase factory utilization rates. you may hear story fellow who, ask hit head hammer, reply felt good stopped. a couple hammer pound u.s. economy 2004 (not volition, course) sharp increase energy price widen trade deficit, subtract significant amount growth last year. high energy price large trade deficit likely remain u 2005, unfortunately. however, small comfort may take likelihood problem worsen year rate last year. by magic output growth accounting, long energy trade situation deteriorate substantially year, i expect will, net effect provide boost year's growth relative last year's. on energy front, increase non-opec production, moderate rate increase oil consumption china, (i say finger crossed) possible reduction geopolitical uncertainty may help limit increase crude oil price year. moreover, although natural gas price rise recently, inventory natural gas appear plentiful, major shortfall appear imminent. with respect trade, may reasonably hope cumulative past decline real exchange value dollar plus economic growth abroad least begin stabilize u.s. trade balance. the inflation forecast present challenges. my guess core pce inflation 2005 slightly high 2004 rate 1.6 percent, though likely remain within i think "comfort zone" 1 2 percent. i briefly comment factor bear inflation forecast. first, although core inflation exclude direct effect energy prices, energy price exert indirect effect core inflation rate raise cost non-energy industries, air travel trucking. rise commodity price increase import price (the result weak dollar) likewise raise cost production well price pay directly consumers. these factor contribute pickup core inflation 2004. i expect net inflationary effect cost driver le 2005 2004. specifically, although energy commodity price probably remain high, unlikely continue rise last year's pace, consequently contribute le core inflation year last year. (the principle illustrate man stop hit head hammer or, least, hit gently.) another consideration producers' markup price cost remain relatively high, leave scope firm absorb cost increases. the course dollar likewise challenge - probably impossible - predict. however, despite decline dollar past two years, core import price exclude fuel rise 2-1/2 percent second half 2004 increase could well continue moderate.2 the pass-through effect decline dollar import price remain remarkably low, thing considered. 2 a defined, core import price exclude semiconductor computers, whose price tend fall rapidly, well energy. 2 bi review 15/2005 although moderate rate increase nonwage cost help inflation front 2005, i acknowledge considerable uncertainty surround prediction. the potential volatility energy prices, commodity prices, (to less extent) import price dramatically demonstrate recent year unexpectedly rapid increase - decreases, matter - producers' nonwage cost mean rule out. cost increase large sustain would, course, create inflationary pressure. lag effect inflation nonwage cost increase occur 2004 also possible, particularly firm demand increase price power ability producer pas high costs. i assure federal reserve monitor closely development affect producers' costs. the second principal factor affect inflation outlook degree slack economy - so-called output gap. research board elsewhere suggest measure output gap real time quite treacherous undertaking, particularly economy near full employment. the natural rate unemployment probably good think zone rather single number, however. in particular, inflation appear rise sharply discontinuously economy reach specific rate unemployment capacity utilization instead respond gradually variation degree resource utilization (in economics lingo, phillips curve fairly flat). thus, relatively modest error estimate output gap may prove harmful. my judgment slack remain u.s. economy, although slack diminish growth continue long-run trend. evidence labor market yet potential include subdue wage growth, failure thus far labor participation rate increase cyclical lows, relatively large number people say work part-time economic reasons, impression glean survey anecdote supply potential employee occupation remain plentiful. measure industrial capacity utilization historical norm also consistent presence underutilized resources. a resource slack progressively eliminated, however, labor productivity growth settle near longer-run trend 2 2-1/2 percent, increase unit labor cost may begin put upward pressure prices, offset possible moderation nonwage costs. a third factor determine inflation long-term inflation expectations. if inflation expectation well anchored, sense public confidence inflation remain low long run, central bank's task actually keep inflation low become easier. for example, presumably well-anchored inflation expectations, increase oil price last year appear second-round effect - is, firm household apparently view inflation bulge associate oil price increase temporary build high expect inflation rate wage prices. likewise, stable inflation expectation probably help explain low observe rate exchange-rate pass-through domestic prices. of course, benefit flow well-anchored inflation expectation make keep inflation low (and thus validate expectations) important. on whole, inflation expectation appear stable. for example, accord university michigan's survey consumers, since 2003 median expect inflation next five ten year fluctuate narrow range. on hand, spread ten-year nominal ten-year inflation-indexed bond yields, know inflation compensation, rise 30 35 basis point since time last year. i incline believe rise inflation compensation signal near-term increase expectation headline inflation, although part increase may also reflect change risk liquidity premium market inflation-indexed debt. worth note also inflation compensation period five ten year future - measure long-run inflation expectation - remain essentially flat past year. in summary, caveat mention today firmly mind, i look 2005 good year u.s. economy: real growth 3-3/4 percent slightly better, core pce inflation range 1-1/2 2 percent, slowly decline unemployment rate. private-sector forecaster bite pessimistic i am, much. for example, blue chip consensus forecast release yesterday look real growth 3.6 percent year, bite projection, overall inflation, measure consumer price index (cpi), 2.2 percent. if adjust distinction overall core inflation fact that, technical reasons, cpi-based inflation measure tend high base pce price index, blue chip inflation forecast slightly high mine. indeed, difference projection hardly meaningful give wide error band economic forecast general - lead u naturally question could go wrong relatively sunny outlook i describe today. unfortunately, unless prepare extend bi review 15/2005 3 meet several hours, i cannot give detail analysis risk forecast. many thing could go wrong, course, murphy warn us, something almost certainly will. some obvious possibility include oil supply disruption send price crude much higher, slowdown foreign economic growth reduce demand u.s. exports, realization le economic slack remain i currently believe, would increase risk high inflation. not risk forecast adverse, course; example, growth rate labor productivity surprise u upside almost every year past decade could again. the lesson economic forecasts, consequently policy plans, provisional. new event new data must trump preconceive notion future evolution economy policy. i conclude comment monetary policy, remind i speak member federal open market committee. a i discuss today, baseline forecast u.s. economy 2005 indeed beyond year appear quite favorable. in particular, past quarter evidence recovery self-sustaining become persuasive, inflation pressure appear contained. the labor market yet reach potential, improvement front past year half substantial, slack resource utilization continue reduced, albeit slowly. for time now, federal open market committee indicate expect remove policy accommodation pace likely measured. the "measured pace" language always intend indicate committee's provisional view policy likely evolve, give economic forecast make meet understand transmission mechanism monetary policy. in short, language always mean convey policy forecast, policy commitment. however, event, committee's policy expectation largely realized, view result good. with economy strengthening, inflation stable, federal fund rate still relatively low level, point expectation committee continue remove policy accommodation measure way. of course, light imprecision economic forecast certainty economy face new shocks, pace policy interest rate normalize necessity sensitive unexpected event data. because well-anchored inflation expectation critical achieve federal reserve's mandate goal maximum sustainable employment price stability, i think particularly important policy react need maintain price stability. one may reasonably ask process remove policy accommodation stop. this question straightforward answer. in particular, helpful, view, imagine existence fix target fund rate toward policy inexorably march. instead, correct procedure set policy require fomc continually update forecast economy, conditional relevant information provisional future path monetary policy. the fund rate reach appropriate sustainable level when, first, outlook consistent committee's economic goal and, second, slope term structure interest rate approximately normal, best determined. with definition mind, one search indication "neutral" fund rate likely give point time. for example, fact far future short-term interest rate recently decline fairly significantly suggest that, view market least, neutral fund rate may somewhat low today past.3 the important lesson, however, neutral policy rate depend current prospective economic conditions. accordingly, neutral rate constant fix objective change economy economic forecast evolve. 3 the one-year nominal rate nine year ahead imply treasury term structure fall 1-1/4 percentage point since recent peak may 2004, 5-1/2 percent today. this rate may think sum market's expectation short-term interest rate nine year plus variable term premium. disentangle two component difficult, indeed part downward trend far future short rate plausibly reflect decline term premium. overall, however, seem likely market expectation future short-term rate decline past years. 4 bi review 15/2005 ardian fullani: modernisation payment system albania address mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, meet business company utility services, tirana, 25 february 2005. * * * good day everybody! thank presence, allow regard today’s meet work table, invite stay away standard conference slogans, orient discussion concrete issue solution relate product bank payment area. more concretely, i would like table presence debate advantages, benefit group interest participate meet would use modern payment instruments. i think object today’s meet part new vision: modernization payment system give real contribution reduce cash informal economy. the presence meet government members, business managers, whether public private, provide periodic service small value large number, presence bank system directors, make provocative right beginning, simple question either business bank system: much long people go stay meaningless queue pay monthly bills? i emphasize already make first step modern payment world, important step finalize mid year, automate electronic clear house project completed. in ambition ensure up-dated payment infrastructure, it’s pleasure state even bank system effort numerous significant progress make direction. however, i believe still far away basic standards. i think reason find lack tradition, old inheritance, presence informal economy, objective subjective causes. assess recent developments, i deem room bank system great understand business represent today meeting. from viewpoint infrastructural problems, i think that, spite specific aspect member bank system, cooperate each-other, create unique network, capable face use successfully cash inflow windows. proactive role bank primary one. bank wait individual knock door submerge public product services. bank refine technology offer much possible qualitative product service clients. on hand, allow attract attention utility business bank payment products, already carry out, expect carry short period time: establishment automate electronic clear house, refer “clearing” system. the completion joint project bank albania bank system significant impact increase bank payment popularity. upon realization investment modern up-to-date technology, overall time realize payment whole territory country bank window plan last long two days, whereas service cost envisage decrease. the project enable provision service quality safety european level, whereas company “utility” service country public main beneficiaries. geographic extension system bank services, i think, another qualitative development bank system recent years. for come years, bank plan extension, make bank service tangible reality, even small

already part large international network card provide card payment inside country abroad, either albanian citizen foreigner – already become tangible reality. another initiative mention direction initiation cooperation bank establish joint network use plastic cards. i think creation joint settlement network national interbank card payments, extension card penetration scale presence payment terminal point sale – word creation “unique card” whole system, i think, major challenge bank system follow completion clear system. i deal essential bank system developments, inter alia, make clear advantage bank term payment service provision. they institution license country provide payment service efficiently safely. this advantage base good knowledge legislation, development level infrastructure, capable human resource modern technology. any organization outside system regard long-term one. however, i take advantage opportunity stress even government render contribution direction. a payment system always remain sterile case authority manage impose use fiscal case invoice sales. to open sincere, businessman encourage small client use modern form payments, oblige use fiscal recorder activity. otherwise, would much convenient businessman transfer income sale directly bank account, merely minimize risk hold large quantity cash. therefore, i think active, propagandistic effects, also find applicable formula use efficient leverage impose implementation fiscal legislation. the channel public administration salary account open bank system first successful step welcomed, follow well movement direction. come back idea state beginning, i think presently invoice collection windows, pension kiosks, payment envelope bag – become out-dated. these practice estimate expression mentality overcome, pose risk keep u away european standards. my opinion that, short period time, may make detachment public “queues pay” completely reality. finally, leave room discussions, i would like present briefly even benefit overall economy, business present meeting, well beneficiary client have: benefit albanian economy: reduction cash informal economy; growth deposit volume credit economy; further strengthen consolidation domestic bank system; achievement international standard practices, improve image albania domestic economy. benefit business: growth

public: increase payment possibilities, avoidance queue default interest; reduce need cash payment mean increase personal security; good management households’ economy. however, i hope proper

there doubt bank incur operational cost due outsource policy. however, think cost small manageable, especially relative australian banks' annual gross revenue, profits, potential cost bank failure,

aware interest home host supervisor diverge, divergence lead difference style substance supervision regulation. moreover, difference likely manifest sharply pressure circumstance distress bank brings. such difference include: • different statutory objectives. for example supervisor depositor protection main objective, others soundness stability. • how capital allocated. each supervisory authority

suppose i start explain i choose title talk today. gresham's law usually state simply 'the bad currency drive good' refer time transaction use coins. if buy one pound's worth merchandise two coin – one know contain one pound's worth gold another gold shave – would pas second coin keep first one. in way, transaction would take place use inferior transaction medium superior one would play minor role. note occur inferior superior transaction medium accept price, modern parlance, price signal get users. have introduce quaint historical economic law, i would like put aside moment move main subject talk today, regulation retail payment system. a probably aware, payment system board reserve bank, i chairman, charge act parliament responsibility efficiency, competition safety payment system. this quite daunt task, involve u enormous amount research consultation payment system issues, controversy payment system provider and, less extent, payment system users. most u reserve bank come background economics hence predisposition favour free market sceptical attitude towards intervention market unless clearly define economic rationale it. after much analysis discussion, come view time ago was, fact, overwhelm case regulation part market, competition, was, would lead optimal outcome term public benefit. in remark afternoon i would like set and, process, i hope become clear i introduce talk refer sir thomas gresham famous law. there five basic way make payment australian retail payment system: cash, cheque, credit card, debit card (eftpos) electronic transfer. when look method payment evolving, saw credit card grow fast mean payment. this initially somewhat surprise credit card transaction expensive mean payment – is, involve large payment user payment system provider payment system. in effect, happen expensive way pay drive cheap way and, process, raise average cost australian retail payment system. why possible? we conclude asymmetry price signal (and capacity act them) face two class payment system user – cardholder merchants. for cardholders, price signal receive credit card transaction free, could even result receive payment form 'points'. furthermore, cardholder able act signal party choose method payment point sale. merchants, hand, receive signal credit card expensive way make payment (via merchant service fee pay bank). but merchant power influence method payment transaction – hand cardholder. thus, incentive system design encourage decision-maker choose form payment expensive perspective society whole. now could argue merchant could refuse accept credit card first place. but would big decision, fact merchant felt would forgo many sale take path (particularly competitor not). they feel much bargain power vis-à-vis credit card scheme banks. and recent reforms, power 'pass on' merchant service fee customer, is, bi review 20/2005 1 employ 'user pays' principle insist customer use expensive mean payment pay use cheap one. merchant power result reforms, case reluctant use public become accustom old system thus often resist transition 'user pays'. in short, asymmetry price signal still despite effort redress imbalance 'empowering merchants'. it asymmetry heart process whereby expensive mean payment expand expense le expensive. the mechanism allow asymmetry exploit system fee bank payment system pay one another – commonly know interchange fees. in case credit cards, fee pay merchant's bank cardholder's bank transaction. these fee play important role determine price charge merchant cardholder payment services, yet subject normal competitive force operate markets. to extent competitive force work all, perversely two effects: • encourage high-interchange-fee mean payment grow expense low-interchange-fee one; • tend push interchange fee compete systems, down. in respect, australian experience unique. there many example around world two effect evident. i would like illustrate process draw three examples, two unite state third australia. i use u examples, example exist elsewhere, simply legal case unite state shine spotlight interchange fee intensely case elsewhere, many country interchange fee remain closely guard secrets. competition between credit card scheme the first example relate interchange fee mastercard visa credit card system unite states, past decade series competitive increase fee (graph 1). there incentive scheme raise interchange fee order encourage bank issue card high fee provide issue bank revenue. the issue bank turn use revenue attract cardholder away scheme low fee offer cardholder attractive price 'reward points'. once one scheme raise interchange fee give advantage attract issuer cardholders, respond way. the result competition amongst scheme see fee increase 1.3 per cent 1994 1.65 per cent today – perverse outcome anyone economics background expect competition low prices. i might add three time average level interchange fee australia follow reserve bank's reform 2003. 2 bi review 20/2005 graph 1 of course increase u interchange fee pay somebody. and, first instance, somebody merchant, since interchange fee build merchant service fee (what merchant's bank charge process credit card transactions). not surprisingly, average merchant service fee increase broadly line increase interchange fee since mid 1990s. the end result merchant bear extra cost competition credit card schemes. but, course, story stop here. ultimately, high merchant cost flow high price customer merchants. this cost bear consumer whether use credit card not. competition between debit card scheme there similar story competition two type debit card system unite states. in one system, operate mainly regional networks, transaction authorise pin (the pin-based systems), other, operate visa mastercard, transaction authorise signature (the scheme-based systems). the interchange fee pay merchant's bank issue bank much high scheme-based system pin-based system (graph 2). a result, issue bank switch scheme-based system share market increase 45 per cent 60 per cent past decade (graph 2). the pin-based scheme retaliate extent, interchange fee double decade, although still well scheme-based systems' interchange fees. once again, interchange fee encourage growth relatively expensive payment system expense lower-cost system, force lower-cost scheme raise price charge merchants. bi review 20/2005 3 graph 2 there interest additional twist story, concern question merchant america allow happen? why resist strongly inroad profit cause expansion expensive system? partly, course, could pas cost consumer form high prices, additional factor work. this 'tie-in' arrangement impose visa mastercard force merchant accept credit card also accept debit cards. by mid 1990s, merchant become upset rule take credit card scheme court – become know wal-mart case – argue rule breach anti-trust laws. in april 2003, case finally settled, visa mastercard agree abolish rule, reduce interchange fee, pay damage $3 billion merchants. credit debit card australia this bring back i started. in australia, prior bank's recent reforms, average interchange fee $100 transaction pay credit cardholder's bank 95 cents. in australian eftpos/debit card system,1 interchange fee flow opposite direction cardholder's bank pay around 20 cent per transaction merchant's bank (graph 3). give flows, clear card issue bank want issue credit card rather eftpos card – receive $1.15 $100 transaction. 1 debit card use make purchase via eftpos system withdraw cash atms. in follow account australian case, i employ widely-used term eftpos rather debit card. i ignore type debit card – visa debit – separate set characteristics, separate regulatory review. 4 bi review 20/2005 during mid 1990s, australian bank work hard develop reward scheme (largely finance interchange fee receipts) encourage cardholder use credit cards. reward points, together interest-free credit, mean many cardholder pay 1 per cent value transaction credit card. not surprisingly, big shift towards credit cards, transaction number grow 20 30 per cent around five years, eftpos growth fell le 10 per cent per year. a u experience, higher-cost payment system displace lower-cost one, community's resource devote make payment increased. graph 3 one longer-term aim reform reduce distortion payment system cause pattern interchange fees. if large difference fee credit card eftpos system continue, hard see long run bank would continue put resource promote eftpos system. this think merchant oppose eftpos reform extremely short-sighted. without propose reforms, could see gradual wither away eftpos system, merchant would face large large proportion sale take place use higher-cost credit card system. back gresham's law it pretty obvious gresham's law fit account, i hardly need spell out. instead bad currency drive good, high-cost mean payment drive low-cost one. to take obvious example, credit card offer service merchant – irrevocable payment – debit card, yet cost merchant lot more. to cardholder, credit card offer – 50 day free credit – yet cost less, cardholder often receive payment use it. clearly, second condition gresham's law met, namely price signal decision-maker reflect underlie costs, “user pays” principle applied. this tendency competition favour high-cost product bi review 20/2005 5 seem feature card-based system around world explain increase attention give system competition regulators. before i finish, i would like reassure part retail payment system, normal law economics lead normal results. the cheque provide best illustration this. all world cheque – universally acknowledge relatively high-cost mean payment – decline, replace efficient form electronic payment. the important reason bank end payment chain charge customer cost write deposit cheques. so “user pays” principle work well case, course, interchange fees. at reserve bank, favour retail payment system provide user wide choice option wide range providers. each payment method strength weaknesses, user able choose suitable payment method particular type transaction. in case price transaction enable manner contribute efficient low-cost retail payment system, case not. the best way improve efficiency usually increase competition rather regulate, i think i show part retail payment system construct way competition increase cost reduce efficiency. in areas, regulation required, reserve bank payment system board continue task improve efficiency, competition safety retail payment system. 6 bi review 20/2005 jean-claude trichet: the success euro impact european company speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, congress small-sized enterprises, organise confindustria, bari, 18 march 2005. * * * signore, signori, è per un grande piacere contribuire oggi al dibattito sulle sfide poste alle imprese italiane ed europee dalla crescente concorrenza internazionale. circa centoquaranta anni fa italia, francia, belgio e svizzera diedero vita all’unione monetaria latina al fine di accrescere la concorrenza, gli scambi commerciali e, ultima analisi, il benessere. l’unione si fondava sull’accettazione reciproca delle monete oro e argento dei rispettivi paesi. l’esperimento tuttavia fallì. dopo un lungo periodo di forti oscillazioni del valore relativo delle monete, accompagnate da elevata instabilità macroeconomica nei paesi aderenti, l’unione monetaria latina venne sciolta al termine della prima guerra mondiale. quale lezione possiamo trarre da questa prima esperienza? e quali sono state le carenze di questo progetto? a mio avviso mancavano quattro elementi fondamentali: stabilità politica, un mercato comune, criteri di convergenza e una banca centrale comune. per la realizzazione dell’unione monetaria latina non era stato svolto alcun preparativo sul piano macroeconomico e fiscale, né era stata creata una banca centrale comune che mettesse atto le più basilari misure di controllo valutario congiunto. a ottantacinque anni dalla fine dell’unione possiamo affermare di avere imparato dall’esperienza passata. in un quadro caratterizzato da stabilità politica, quaranta anni di integrazione economica, commerciale e finanziaria hanno aperto la strada all’unione monetaria europea. stabilità dei prezzi e solide politiche di bilancio hanno costituito il fondamento dell’unione monetaria negli ultimi sei anni e vanno pertanto preservate anche futuro. quest’oggi mi soffermerò primo luogo su quelli che considero principali successi dell’euro per le imprese europee e, più generale, per cittadini europei. in estrema sintesi, stabilità macroeconomica, integrazione finanziaria ed efficienza economica rappresentano importanti conquiste dell’unione monetaria, indispensabili al fine di promuovere la crescita economica e la creazione di occupazione da parte delle imprese europee. in secondo luogo, mi soffermerò sulle aree che necessitano ancora di riforme volta migliorare la competitività e quindi favorire una crescita economica sostenibile. la stabilità monetaria e un contesto economico più aperto, efficiente e concorrenziale richiedono importanti iniziative complementari da parte dei responsabili delle politiche economiche nazionali. mi riferisco al bisogno urgente di completare il processo di attuazione delle riforme strutturali, principalmente nei mercati del lavoro, dei beni e servizi e dei capitali. inizio os illustrare principali successi dell’euro realizzati finora. lady gentlemen, it great pleasure today order contribute debate challenge italian european enterprise currently face respect increase global competition. to enhance competition, trade ultimately welfare, 140 year ago italy, france, belgium switzerland give birth latin monetary union. this monetary union base mutual acceptance other’s gold silver coins. that experiment failed. after long period strong fluctuation relative value gold silver, combine high macroeconomic instability across member countries, latin monetary union finally dismantle end world war i. can learn something early experience? what missing? in view four key miss ingredients, namely, political stability, common market, existence convergence criterion common central bank. no macroeconomic fiscal preparation make start latin monetary union, common central bank place exert even simple measure joint monitor currency issues. 85 year end regime clearly learn lessons. bi review 20/2005 1 in framework characterize political stability, history 40 year economic, trade financial integration pave way european monetary union. the stability orient macroeconomic framework, base price stability sound fiscal policies, basis economic monetary union (emu) past six years, keep framework place future. today i first discus detail i see main success euro european enterprise general european citizens. macroeconomic stability, financial integration economic efficiency key achievement emu. these achievement utmost importance enhance last growth employment creation european companies. secondly i reflect area still require reform order raise competitiveness ultimately economic growth sustainable manner. monetary stability open, efficient competitive economic environment require important complementary initiative national policy makers. i refer urgent need complete process structural reforms, chiefly labour, product capital markets. let start key success euro date. success euro six year start emu, already count success number fronts. first, success euro technical success. the integration money market enable smooth implementation single monetary policy early january 1999. the transformation european financial market bring euro remarkable. the global trend close financial market integration witness past decade receive distinct additional boost introduction euro emu countries. the introduction euro dismantle barrier cross-border trade enhance risk share opportunity diversification. the elimination exchange rate risk increase depth breadth financial market boost financial innovation. government bond yield become nearly perfectly correlate euro area. there also evidence close integration stock market euro area elsewhere1. the euro particularly significant impact european market corporate bonds, considerable increase number medium-sized firm place issue outside home country. financial deepen course benefit italian market well. in italy, 1999 2003 volume fund raise directly financial market firm issue shares, bond instrument grow 31 billion 65 billion euro. over period amount italian households’ financial wealth hold form corporate security increase 22 36% gdp. financial integration facilitate consolidation financial structures, thereby increase cross-border corporate linkages. in recent years, large flow foreign direct investment among euro area country exemplify intensification corporate linkages. the second key success euro relate convergence long-term market interest rate towards best performer term credibility low interest rates. in countries, include italy, convergence mean significantly reduce finance costs, thereby provide environment favourable growth employment. thank stability orient macroeconomic policy framework, focus price stability sound fiscal policies, - two miss element latin monetary union - risk premia decline inflation expectation stabilize low levels. today, euro area economy benefit benchmark long-term market interest rate 4%, level issuer never see last fifty years. in italy 10-year interest rate spread versus best performer fell 4.5 percentage point begin 1996 0.3 percentage point begin 1998 0.2 percentage point end 2004 [see chart 1]. these two major achievement must maintain today’s future economic policy making. 1 robin brook marco del negro (2002), “international stock return market integration: regional perspective”, imf work paper wp/02/202. 2 bi review 20/2005 a third point i would like mention improve resilience euro area economy financial crisis euro bring about. also respect, european corporation and, amongst them, italian enterprise largely benefit single currency. italy well many european country experience several episode large exchange rate interest rate volatility 1970s mid-1990s. without single currency, event recent year - turbulence follow september 11 terrorist attack swing global exchange stock market - would trigger major turbulence europe whole many euro area economies, include italy. this, course, mean external factor long important drive force determine economic performance emu country recent years. however, euro area economy prove resilient external shock 2001-2003 downturn, mainly cause correction stock market price financial instability, external shock downturn early 1990s, mainly drive exchange rate volatility. fourth, let highlight convergence inflation rate low level across euro area country thank adoption stability-oriented macroeconomic policies. a remarkable convergence among euro area member state take already place 1990s, trigger preparation emu, process continue year start emu. measure standard deviation, dispersion inflation rate halve period 1999-2004 respect year precede monetary union. low stable inflation fundamental achievement euro area whole well italy. italian inflation 4% 1996 country part euro area average equal 2.3%. in subsequent year italy saw significant reduction inflation gap vis-à-vis euro area average, despite many adverse shock hit italy euro area recent year [see chart 2]. between 1999 2004 italy inflation average 2.4% euro area inflation 2%. between 2001 2003 italy saw sizeable increase perceive inflation [see chart 3]. the concept perceive inflation aim measure change inflation rate consumer think occur recent past. usually observe good correlation behaviour actual perceive inflation, mean consumer relatively correct perception change purchase power. in italy country pattern actual inflation perceive inflation start diverge introduction euro. while feature ignored, since consumer decide spend depend perceive real income, important acknowledge temporary phenomenon, last year half gap actual perceive inflation narrow significantly. notwithstanding many adverse shock hit euro area past years, price stability prevail euro area. the success single currency deliver price stability stabilize inflation expectation euro area explain european institutional framework principle follow european central bank. first, european central bank independent clearly define mandate give treaty pursue price stability. second, ecb provide make public arithmetical definition price stability correspond inflation rate close 2%. third, medium-term orientation nature concept monetary policy contribute solid anchor medium long term inflation expectations, line definition price stability. the best contribution monetary policy provide economic growth maintain price stability. price stability ensure transparency relative price mechanism, thus enhance efficiency resource allocation. stable low inflation support private consumption via positive impact real value households’ income wealth. price stability reduce borrow cost individual firms. a know, inflation erode purchase power nominal return long-term loan contract bonds. in case high uncertain inflation, saver lend liquid fund would require high rate return borrowers, order compensate high risk relate uncertainty future inflation. this inflation risk premium imply economy high inflation, le investment project profitable. in circumstances, capital accumulation low could situation price stability potential output growth rate consequently reduced. bi review 20/2005 3 the challenge economic growth let turn issue still need addressed. the economic monetary union secure macroeconomic stability, promote financial integration lead convergence inflation interest rate low levels. the key question naturally arise following: why economic growth, nonetheless, remain subdued? in introduction i already hint answer refer need complete structural reforms. let elaborate urgency. the first message i would like convey need raise economic growth sustainable manner common challenge euro area country euro area whole. the need introduce supply side changes, aim boost potential output growth common challenge european countries. over last decade real gdp growth average 2.1% euro area [see table 1], significantly 3.4% growth rate us. the second point i would like make competitiveness key driver sustainable growth. in recent year euro area company face strong external competition, especially low-cost producer dynamic asian economies, also new eu member states. it reason unit labour cost important indicator, particularly single currency area. let u look italy example many others euro area. in italy nominal unit labour cost total economy especially manufacture sector - export orient sector - grow significantly fast euro area whole. let mention couple figures. over last six years, italy cumulate growth rate unit labour cost manufacture sector equal 15.7% euro area average 3.1% [see table 2a]. what drive strong rise unit labour costs? on one hand cumulate growth rate compensation per employee equal 16.7%, hand cumulate growth rate labour productivity equal 1.1%. there seem something wage mechanism prevent compensation development follow closely productivity developments. besides problem, protract weak labour productivity growth need relate intrinsic difficulty use labour capital efficiently, possibly due lack innovation. why happening? a number recent comprehensive reports2, notably banca d’italia, istat, confindustria, various italian think-tanks, emphasize broad range institutional economic factor behind italian labour productivity-competitiveness problem. some discuss conference today tomorrow. these factor include rigidity product labour markets, feature financial system corporate governance, low spend research development. all factor certainly work effort italian enterprise increase size improve competitiveness renew product reallocate resource towards new, dynamic sectors3 [see chart 4]. the lack innovation might partially relate small-size firms, continue predominant feature italian industrial system. in regard business environment continue create obstacle firm-size expansion entry new efficient firms, thus hamper productivity growth. the cost open close business well time require complete legal process involve enforce contract remain well-above euro area average4 [see table 3]. these consideration bring third final point: structural rigidity slow european firms’ response structural change production process. a result, contrast flexible economy international sphere, many economy europe fully reap benefit technological advance last ten fifteen years. many european country adapt economic, social legal framework order face new challenge trigger rapidly transform world economy. 2 banca d’italia (2004), “relazione del governatore sull‘esercizio 2003”, roma, may 2004. banca d’italia (2005), “bollettino economico”, n.44, march 2005. pierluigi ciocca, (2003), “the

implement structural reform transmit european policy-makers last february european commission propose “partnership growth jobs”5 core renew lisbon strategy, put forward program priority actions. these priority action summarize three key headings: (1) extend deepen single market; (2) build good infrastructure, motivate investment research development facilitate innovation; (3) attract people employment, improve flexibility labour market invest human capital good education skills. let elaborate priority list. the objective extend deepen single market would imply eliminate market entry barrier national regulation continue hamper competition. this objective would also require improve national european regulation term simplification, well shape legislation effort reduce burden administrative costs. the need foster knowledge innovation would require effective public expenditure favourable incentive company engage innovation research development. the need attract people employment would imply many country “re-thinking” current mix tax benefit systems, continue provide disincentive take work work long hours. furthermore, measure make wage growth reflect strongly regional sectoral productivity difference would certainly helpful. the european central bank strongly welcome proposals. they fully line views. indeed, driver success innovation, productivity enhancement employment growth measure direct achieve results. some european country ahead process adopt change show reform able deliver high output employment growth. not would reform raise potential economic growth, would also make european economy flexible thereby strengthen resilience economic shocks. this turn would facilitate pursuit stability orient macroeconomic policies. conclude remark lady gentlemen, gather discus way ahead order increase competitiveness economic growth. in conclusion, let stress maintenance price stability, low medium long term market interest rates, thank stability, financial integration key success economic monetary union well fundamental condition enhance sustainable economic growth, employment creation welfare. in order reap full benefit single currency cope global competitive pressures, truly dynamic economic environment need put firmly place. be assure european central bank back drive towards reform motion europe since lisbon consensus

review 19/2005 meir sokoler: the time come new bank israel law lecture dr meir sokoler, act governor bank israel, scholarship award ceremony technion, haifa, 17 march 2005. * * * first, i would like thank invite address distinguish gather eminent institution technion. many year ago i student economics here, i remember excellent student august institute wonderful experience outstanding instruction i received. i sure hear bank israel, country's central bank. it appears, however, many israeli know much it, apart fact print israel's money. a month ago 6-year-old israeli primary school write governor. in carefully draft letter child learn write, asked: "mr. governor bank israel, i hear bank israel print country's money. why print money poor people, road schools?" it might seem natural young child would know answer question, transpire many citizens, adult well children, ask u question one form another. at first glance question seem justified. you might think operate banknote print machine hour would solve economy's problems. in fact, israel's government act mid-1980s. till bank israel print huge quantity banknote sort purposes, highly commendable. the results, however, disastrous. the value note time erode rapidly, catastrophic economic consequences. what lead bank israel print many banknote time? why allow rapid increase money supply monetary base? didn't know would create high inflation would rapidly erode purchase power currency? it clear governor bank time, bank's economists, many people outcome obvious. this something know hundred even thousand years, certainly since first central bank establish - sweden establish begin seventeenth century - start print note serve legal tender. until 1985 bank israel independent, print money, government's request, finance government's deficit, upper limit (they call lend government money, even government actually pay back). in 1985 - milestone israel's economy, introduction economic stabilization program significantly low inflation, 15 percent 20 percent year, high level advance economy - bank israel law amended, government prohibit ask bank print money it. this legislative change (known non-printing law) one introduce since establishment bank 1954. in contrast us, many advance emerge economy change central bank law last two decades, move direction several major aspects: • price stability set major objective interest policy. this mean central bank full control rate money printed, case mean control short term rate interest, know central bank interest rate, cost money. in addition, central bank must help area long-term growth, long price stability maintained. • secondly, independence central bank use policy instrument achieve target clearly specified. the central bank must complete freedom exercise discretion regard various instrument available control money supply economy thereby meet price-stability target. • thirdly, entity decide central bank's policy define - monetary council comprise professional independent business political establishment. • fourthly, framework report transparency central bank's policy vis-à-vis government, legislature public determined. in context communication public important mean increase effectiveness policy. bi review 19/2005 1 in israel, main target bank israel's interest-rate policy area inflation, since begin current decade sphere maintain price stability. hence - since banknote print sparingly, start governorship late professor michael bruno, period office successor professor jacob frenkel dr. david klein, continue newly appoint governor professor stanley fischer - purchase power banknote pocket maintain long term. this relatively novel experience u israel. the annual inflation rate since 1999 average 1.7 percent, i.e., close 2 percent midpoint target range one three percent. you probably remember begin 1980s, two- even three-digit inflation, reach 500 percent year. it important remember banknote pocket part money supply monetary base: rest money current accounts. it true old law objective mentioned, apart preserve value currency (or modern terminology, maintain price stability) - objective high rate employment, high level investment - without price stability specifically grant priority. however, contradiction focus price stability one hand objective regard employment investment other. quite opposite: price stability sine qua non sustainable economic growth long-term high employment buoyant investment. this said, remove possible doubt law change specify price stability bank israel's prime objective. it worth note experience abroad show specific mention price stability major purpose central bank increase credibility, great credibility, freedom support objective long-term growth without jeopardize price stability. in area independence use monetary instrument would well worth introduce order israel, formalize bank's freedom action. another considerable change require field relate exchange-rate regime. since law pass 1954, reality change completely: foreign-currency control, bank israel intervene foreign-currency market almost ten years, exchange rate determine market force supply demand. this situation reflect new law. with regard monetary council, bank israel favor establishment body would make decision interest policy would also bear responsibility it. the establishment council desirable part system check balance independent central bank. at time tremendous importance creation mechanism ensure appointment suitable people council must bear mind: must axe grind, cannot come business sector, government, politics. turn issue transparency reporting, bank israel already publish half-yearly inflation report explain interest policy public, results, implication development previous half year, describe policy likely adopt future. the bank israel continue cooperate fully prime minister's office ministry finance discussion devote entirely draft new bank israel law. this legislation, firmly found principle outline above, propel israel economy along path towards join family modern country economies. the importance israel lie ensure existence proper framework government bank israel operate macroeconomic strategy intend create long-term growth employment sine qua non raise residents' standard live level welfare. such strategy provide necessary resource correct framework promote welfare policy weak section population leave cold. to summarize: bank israel today practice inconsiderable degree independence. this independence derive change economic think experience gain set implement interest policy israel world wide. the legal environment bank israel operates, however, outdated amend make compatible new reality. if enact new central bank law israel, join many country do successfully. 2 bi review 19/2005 jean-claude trichet: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, brussels, 14 march 2005. * * * madame la présidente, madame et monsieur le membres de la commission economique et monétaire, j’ai l’honneur de paraître devant votre commission aujourd’hui dans le cadre de notre dialogue régulier. comme vous le savez, j’attache beaucoup d’importance à no rencontres trimestrielles qui permettent à la banque centrale européenne d’expliquer s décisions et de répondre à tout le question que se posent le parlementaires. me collègues et moi-même considérons ce rencontres fréquentes comme essentielles au bon fonctionnement de l’union economique et monétaire. ich möchte meine ausführungen mit einer beurteilung d aktuellen wirtschaftlichen und monetären entwicklung beginnen. sodann werde ich zu fiskalpolitischen und strukturpolitischen fragen stellung nehmen. abschließend möchte ich ihnen einige überlegungen hinsichtlich d folgeaktivitäten zum eu aktionsplan für finanzdienstleistungen vorstellen. economic monetary development after positive development first half 2004, modest growth rate economic activity observe second half. real gdp euro area estimate grow quarter-on-quarter rate 0.2% third fourth quarter. take year whole, real gdp growth – working-day adjust basis – +1.8% 2004, mark significant improvement 0.5% see 2003. the composition demand growth fourth quarter offer positive sign regard outlook economic activity. in come quarter consumption growth could benefit anticipate development real disposable income. investment expect continue benefit favourable finance conditions, robust earn great business efficiency. euro area export continue benefit strong world economic growth. accordingly, expect continue relatively moderate economic growth euro area 2005 2006, reflect ecb staff projection publish early month, broadly line available forecast international private sector organisations. nevertheless, outlook economic activity continue surround uncertainties. on external side, high volatile oil price persistent global imbalance pose downside risk growth. a regard exchange rates, confirm position – express euro rise sharply – move unwelcome undesirable economic growth. on domestic side, uncertainty surround evolution private consumption, favourable finance condition recovery corporate earn could lead high investment growth currently projected. turn price developments, evolution oil price increase indirect tax administer price significant impact consumer price inflation course last year. for 2004 whole, annual hicp inflation 2.1%. more recently, annual inflation rate decline quite substantially, fall 1.9% january 2.4% december, largely result base effect development indirect tax administer price countries. eurostat’s flash estimate annual hicp inflation february 2.0%. in come months, annual inflation rate likely fluctuate around 2%. look ahead, still little evidence strong underlie domestic inflationary pressure build euro area. wage increase remain moderate recent quarter trend continue context moderate economic growth. accordingly, ecb staff projection put average annual hicp inflation 1.6% 2.2% 2005 1.0% 2.2% 2006, broadly unchanged eurosystem staff projection publish december. this consistent forecast recently release international private sector organisations. however, risk price stability medium term remain upside, require continue vigilance. such risk continue associate mainly oil price developments, uncertainty bi review 19/2005 1 regard future increase indirect tax administer prices, potential second-round effect stem wage price-setting behaviour. in respect, development long-term inflation expectation need monitor closely. our monetary analysis also call vigilance regard upside risk price stability medium term long term. after moderate first half 2004, m3 growth strengthen significantly since mid-2004, reflect stimulative effect monetary dynamic historically low level interest rate euro area. a result persistently strong growth m3 past years, substantially liquidity exist euro area need finance non-inflationary economic growth. the exceptionally low level real interest rate also stimulate private sector demand credit. in context relatively contain underlie inflationary pressures, ecb leave key interest rate unchanged since june 2003. the low level nominal real interest rate provide significant continue support economic recovery. at time, upside risk price stability remain. cross-check indication monetary analysis support case continue vigilance regard risks. fiscal policy stability growth pact i would like make remark fiscal policies. while progress fiscal consolidation correction excessive deficit envisage euro area countries’ update stability programmes, consolidation number country needed. with respect stability growth pact, discussion need bring convince conclusion outcome safeguard fiscal discipline. the fiscal framework enshrine treaty stability growth pact cornerstone economic monetary union, crucial economic rationale overall cohesion emu. a committee economic monetary affair european parliament knows, since begin discussion ecb make view clear. improvement implementation stability growth pact, particular preventive arm, would welcome. but corrective arm weakened. the credibility excessive deficit procedure mean deter correct excessive deficit need fully preserved. this necessary order anchor expectation fiscal discipline, fundamental macroeconomic stability cohesion euro area also enhance confidence foster growth prospect member states. the lisbon strategy let turn forthcoming mid-term review lisbon strategy. the lisbon strategy design 2000 push forward structural reforms, europe urgently need order maintain high level prosperity. structural reform raise european economies’ growth potential. they also enable country face challenge technological change, globalisation age populations. in addition, structural reform increase countries’ resilience economic shocks, contribute improve management public spend make easy maintain price stability. five year lisbon, however, broad agreement progress structural reforms, particularly national level, unsatisfactory. this deny notable area impressive progress implementation structural reform across europe. however, much remain do meet challenge european country still face. in particular, eu need increase employment labour utilisation, especially context age populations. at time, productivity need raised. against background, ecb support commission’s proposal push forward lisbon strategy focus reform effort national european level “delivering stronger, last growth create good jobs”. such economic environment would facilitate achievement lisbon agenda’s social environmental objectives. through maintenance price stability, ecb continue support lisbon process provide vital element foster sustainable output growth well support employment social cohesion. the ecb also support national government determine close exist implementation gap, must do order reap full benefit reforms. this also improve consumer business confidence short run. in regard, ecb see use 2 bi review 19/2005 benchmarking important instrument foster implementation reform survey best practice across member states. benchmarking, base sensibly define quantitative indicators, regard welcome driver public debate, raise public awareness structural reform implement successfully eu country important benefits. the post-financial service action plan strategy let turn ongoing structural reform process field financial services. since introduction single currency, financial integration level institutions, market market infrastructure make significant progress. this especially case wholesale markets, unsecured money market, government bond market relate derivative markets. this development also result impetus provide public measure take context financial service action plan (fsap), completed. at time, integration retail market yet sufficiently advanced. a regard post-fsap strategy, although ecb still process formulate view matter, already identify least three important elements. first, focus effective consistent implementation fsap national level. new legislative initiative community level keep minimum introduce strictly necessary. in respect, implementation lamfalussy framework represent unique opportunity achieve consistent regulatory supervisory framework financial services. indeed, experience far gain implementation framework security field broadly positive. it recognised, however, still scope improvement, instance regard strike right balance two level community legislation (core principle technical details). second, policy relate regulatory supervisory framework complement closely coordinate relevant policy financial services, instance competition policy. third, incentive provide private sector play role exploit opportunity offer public action. where appropriate, mechanism provide facilitate coordinate approach among market participants. moreover, eurosystem request single euro payment area (sepa) create euro area 1 january 2008, mean citizen enterprise could make payment throughout euro area single bank account, use single set payment instruments, easily safely national context today. in addition, national infrastructure migrate pan-european payment infrastructure end 2010. we appreciate commission’s support sepa project. the ecb also regular dialogue bank industry seek market participants’ support objectives. i ready answer questions. bi review 19/2005 3 v leeladhar: manage talent bank - think speech mr v leeladhar, deputy governor reserve bank india, occasion centenary celebration corporation bank, bangalore, 12 march 2005. * * * it give great pleasure midst today. a hundred year is, indeed, landmark event history institution corporation bank celebrate centenary, join rank ‘venerables’. the establishment corporation bank humble begin 1906 eventful period india’s economic history. it brave new era saw flurry activity host term ‘native’ bank set india, spurred, small measure, force resurgent nationalism

liberalization, bank india pressure change way business. they face increasingly competitive environment bank also non-bank financial institutions. explosive growth it change way individual interact bank way bank respond. in change scenario, success depend ability bank leverage human potential capabilities. this speech attempt reflect new challenge face bank management human resources. the period 1904 1913 saw bank set virtually every year – prominent amongst bank burma establish 1904, bank india, corporation bank canara bank 1906, indian bank 1907, bank baroda punjab sindh bank 1908, central bank india 1911 bank mysore 1913. the corporation bank come long way since heady day early 20th century. today, proudly state fulfil vision founder ‘not full measure, substantially’. it survive hundred turbulent years, today one agile psb player market. this possible small measure bank’s ability manage utilize talent potential. and bring u theme deliberation today - manage talent banks. in run hundred years, bank bank change substantially. a view matter retrospect, see two landmark event constitute strategic inflexion point history indian bank 20th century – one nationalization bank 1969-70 other, financial sector reform commence early 1990s. nationalisation generate force take bank elite class masses. it lead establishment substantial infrastructure across geographical expanse sub-continent importantly financial empowerment large section society substantially change indian socio-economic landscape. the second inflexion point bank financial sector reform initiative launch early 1990s. these reform herald dramatic shift way bank function operate india. the change environment internal compulsion arise great competition need improve market share / profitability give rise

thirdly, issue ownership. organization physical, financial property asset – ownership rights, however, extend people. in pre 1990s, employment bond work term ‘psychological contract’ ‘loyalty

enter business lexicon rather dramatic perhaps eponymous phrase, ‘the war talent’ pen mckinsey article. while article spur intense debate side argument, nonetheless bring issue fore concern management today special relevance public sector bank india. there however basic definitional issue. what understand talent? there consensus – time talent refer person expertise functional area – person

high year ahead. the recession mild precede expansion culminate two half year ago. the high rate cost inflation norway relative country break without production impact extent recession early 1980s around 1990. one main reason probably low inflation 1990s current monetary policy anchor expectation low stable inflation among economic agents. the need bring inflation main reason new zealand, first country so, introduce inflation target monetary policy end 1980s. canada, uk, sweden australia follow suit late 1990s. inflation target gradually become normal monetary policy system develop economies. in norway, government introduce inflation target 2001. the target set 2.5 per cent. in euro area, monetary policy orient towards price stability, define inflation close 2 per cent. inflation target prove sound system particularly well suit small, open economies. normally, interest rate set inflation target regime also contribute stabilise output employment. in period recession, prospect low fall inflation, interest rate reduce boost demand prevent inflation level low. during upturn prospect high inflation, interest rate increased. inflation target soft around edge exchange rate regime norway many country operate earlier. the system prove fairly robust disturbances. nevertheless, soft land norwegian economy several year high domestic cost inflation low level activity abroad must lead u believe output employment cannot show pronounce fluctuation future. we cannot expect interest rate impact one period next. the economy also expose unexpected disturbances. a result, cannot fine-tune economic development use interest rate, avoid large effect economy expose disturbances. experience seem indicate inflation expectation remain stable even inflation vary somewhat long interest rate use actively curb effects. give highly open economy, may accept somewhat wide variation inflation countries. the last time i here, almost exactly year ago, norge bank’s executive board decide reduce key rate 0.25 percentage point 1.75 per cent. since then, key rate remain historically low level. real interest rate also low. from december 2002 march 2004, key rate reduce total 5.25 percentage points. the interest rate decline ascribe number factors. in late autumn 2002, inflation start fall. the inflation projection also revise down. gradually new information outlook country norwegian economy indicate inflation might low. short-term interest rate fell close 4 percentage points. it would seem change real interest rate influence, also level real interest rates. between december 2002 march 2004, interest rate move high low level. the real interest rate low neutral interest rate. a real interest rate low neutral rate stimulate activity even effect interest rate fall exhausted. calculation seem indicate neutral real interest rate norway 2½ 3½ per cent, probably fall somewhat recent years. bi review 18/2005 1 it take time interest rate reduction impact inflation. we see effect monetary policy decision take two year ago. the interest rate affect inflation via krone exchange rate via demand good services. in particular, rise price domestically produce good service pick up. in addition, reduction interest rate probably contribute hold expectation future inflation even inflation low. if confidence monetary policy, economic agent expect inflation close target time. this provide basis company budgets. this contribute stabilise inflation. many company change price twice year. when change prices, probably take account expect rise prices. it important prevent inflation expectation fall become entrench low level. survey inflation expectation indicate expectation well anchor around inflation target long term. the first sign effect interest rate cut appear foreign exchange market. the interest rate differential country narrowed. it become attractive borrow le profitable invest norwegian krone. the movement krone exchange rate reverse depreciate 2003 2004. however, impact krone exchange rate considerably dampen external interest rate remain low. high price oil gas export good also contribute appreciation krone last year. the depreciation krone 2003 contribute restrain fall price import goods. the effect occur gradually. company importer may prefer observe change exchange rate time change sell prices. after several expensive wage settlement short period krone exchange rate high weaken profitability norwegian business sector, depreciation krone contribute curb decline activity employment. the recession short-lived. together private consumption fix investment petroleum sector, traditional export important factor underlie growth early stage upturn start first half 2003. price many important export good rise result strong growth new markets. growth norway’s total export exclude oil gas is, however, low import growth among trade partners. mainland fix investment gradually become important drive force behind upturn. investment pick industry growth strong expect towards end 2004. norge bank’s regional network register rise investment industries. petroleum investment particular appear grow fast pace projected. this may continue boost mainland output. in past years, household demand underpin low interest rates, high real wage growth high asset prices. accord preliminary national account figures, private consumption increase 4.3 per cent last year. house price inflation slow somewhat, remain high. house start 2004 high level several years. home refurbishment probably also rise sharply. overall, supply capital household increase sharply. debt accumulation slightly high 11 per cent 2004 considerably high growth household disposable income. this largely reflect sharp rise house price since mid-1990s. accord tn gallup’s consumer confidence indicator first quarter 2005, household still highly optimistic regard personal finance domestic economy. our regional network confirm view report strong growth company provide good service households. on whole, household consumption house investment project show fairly strong growth next quarters. despite strong upturn mainland economy, rise number employ fairly modest. productivity rise quite sharply first quarter economic growth pick up. normally, strong productivity growth gradually follow increase employment. the current upturn last two years. the fairly low level growth employment, measure number employed, must see light sharp decline sickness absence 2004 rise several years. the decrease sickness absence increase companies’ supply 2 bi review 18/2005 labour reduce need new employees. measure person-hours worked, employment growth solid last year. person-hours work increase 2.2 per cent 2003 2004. a corollary increase number person-hours work partly reduce sickness absence partly three work day 2004 compare 2003. an increase available person-hours increase competition rationalisation many sector lead higher-than-normal growth potential output last year. the economy therefore able grow fairly rapidly period without emergence bottleneck labour market. in business tendency survey, manufacture industry report high output volume capacity utilisation. average capacity utilisation manufacture sector close historical average. norge bank’s regional network report nearly half contact would substantial problem increase production excess plan levels. this may indicate approximate balance supply demand economy, capacity utilisation normal. a normal level capacity utilisation consistent output gap – percentage deviation actual potential output - close zero. growth demand output expect remain high near term. unemployment may fall somewhat quickly case past year. the output gap expect positive 2005. high demand companies’ good provide scope increase prices. experience show inflation directly influence level capacity utilisation norwegian economy. some rise price domestically produce good service attribute high margin business sector. the effect interest rate decline demand, output employment pronounced. it take time inflation pick up. this partly reflect low external interest rate high oil prices, moderate impact krone exchange rate. high import low-cost countries, competition improve efficiency norwegian production also keep inflation low level. initially, fall price import consumer good push underlie inflation. after period, rise price domestically produce good service also decelerated. this due particular increase competition good service markets. at time, wage growth slow result low capacity utilisation economy. a slow rise house rent also contributed. inflation measure cpi-ate reach low level first month 2004. inflation remain le ½ per cent summer pick autumn. inflation move primarily result slow decline price import consumer goods, depreciation krone since begin 2003 also contributed. in addition, rise price domestically produce good service stabilised, towards end 2004 tendency towards high rise price good services. at begin 2005, inflation measure cpi-ate low expected. price import consumer good fell expected. it uncertain whether price decline due abnormal seasonal pattern fall underlie inflation. the fall price may relate unusually warm winter, make difficult sell winter clothe sport equipment ordinary prices. on hand, indication price import consumer good foreign currency may fall somewhat previously assumed. the wide variation price import consumer goods, especially clothe footwear, may entail wide monthly variation consumer price figures. exclude change price clothe footwear, year-on-year rise cpi-ate 1.3 per cent february, 1.1 per cent january. change indirect tax particularly vat rate make difficult interpret recent price figures. the low level inflation begin year may due lag price adjustment follow indirect tax changes. among company regional network, share expect sharp rise sell price large share expect slow rise prices. tn gallup’s business sentiment survey give neutral impression. nevertheless, survey indicate expectation sharp rise price service sector. the nordic country also experience fall inflation. bi review 18/2005 3 inflation nordic country declined, relatively low sweden, denmark, finland norway. accord harmonise index consumer prices, inflation february around 1 per cent denmark, sweden norway, rise price remain unchanged finland, measure 12-month changes. by comparison, price inflation euro area close 2 per cent. a common feature low level inflation nordic country seem trend price import consumer goods, even though development entirely nordic countries. the upturn broadly based, effect le pronounce rogaland. demand increase sectors, particularly oil-related industry construction sector. the market outlook export-oriented oil-related industry next six month bright optimism great previous round interviews. domestically orient manufacture experience large fluctuation demand output extent. it appear growth investment increase period ahead: high level investment petroleum sector contribute high investment growth offshore supplier industry. there sign rise investment construction industry. "repatriation" also consider rogaland: gjestal spinneri spin company look possibility invest new facility oltedal, enable company transfer production uk norway. employment rising, mark increase construction sector. almost third enterprise report shortage supply qualify labour may constrain output growth. through past year, increase report high sell prices. one four manufacture enterprise expect high rise price year 2004. in retail trade, two three enterprise expect accelerate rise prices. the picture mix corporate service sector. profitability still improve considerably sectors. this reflect increase volume cost reductions. in adopt budget 2005, structural, non-oil deficit increase compare 2004. it therefore appear fiscal policy provide stimulus growth year. in national budget 2005, underlie rise expenditure central government budget project 5.2 per cent, somewhat low previous year somewhat low project nominal growth mainland gdp. a 2006, assume nominal growth general government expenditure approximately nominal growth general government revenue real tax level remain unchanged. growth euro area japan weak towards end 2004 project november inflation report. it appear take time structural change implemented, germany example, contribute increase output. in us, hand, economic growth remain firm capacity utilisation rising. even though development u economy favourable, high interest rates, among factors, gradually result increase household saving. at time, plan call low rise government spending. weak growth u demand may imply slow growth also countries. in addition euro area, economic growth expect slow uk sweden. on balance, assume growth among trade partner slacken year stabilise year ahead. growth asia, except japan, central eastern europe expect moderate remain strong. robust expansion china india particular push price oil important commodities. growth impulse norwegian economy may therefore somewhat strong overall outlook important trade partner would indicate. high demand commodity produce norway boost activity strengthen profitability norwegian enterprises. partly due high growth demand oil, average price brent blend rise almost usd 40 per barrel 2004. strong economic growth, particularly u china, result high energy consumption. so far year, price brent blend oil largely hover around usd 45 per barrel, although price rise usd 50 per barrel begin march. 4 bi review 18/2005 oil future price also increased. little idle production capacity opec countries, combine prospect low production non-opec countries, probably influence oil prices. at time, prospect continue strong demand growth important oil-importing countries, china emerge economies. on hand, u crude oil stock far large time last year previous year. petrol stock also relatively high. this reduce risk low stock high petrol demand push price crude oil, case last summer. planned, large-scale project result strong growth petroleum investment 2004. due persistently high oil price expectation oil price remain high, investment petroleum sector may reach record level year. the investment intention survey petroleum sector point high growth. the level expect remain high throughout projection period. activity petroleum sector spillover effect mainland economy, initially shipbuilding industry construction sector. the scale petroleum investment spillover effect highly uncertain. the last time petroleum investment show sharp increase, 1997/1998, growth substantially strong assumed. an upturn occur norwegian economy whole time. the unexpected increase petroleum investment contribute economic upturn substantially strong projected. if oil price rise remain current high level long period, petroleum investment may amplify cyclical upturn projected. inflation among trade partner expect low next years. it likely high price oil commodity continue push price good wage account small portion total costs. on hand, growth among main trade partner probably low idle resource utilise next years. particularly euro area, wage growth likely low result moderate economic growth high unemployment. overall, would appear international price impulse via consumer good norwegian economy remain negative year next. there indication growth import low-cost country declining. for example, china’s share footwear import norway increase 4 percentage point 20 per cent 2004. the share clothe import increase 2 percentage point 32 per cent. the decline price clothe footwear probably continue come years. price audiovisual equipment still fall result strong international competition high productivity growth. we assume effect structural change market gradually exhaust towards end projection period. external price impulse via consumer good expect increase pace unit labour cost among trade partners. the projection inflation report 1/05, publish 16 march, base gradual increase interest rate. this line financial foreign exchange market expectations. the krone exchange rate assume move line forward exchange rate. this imply krone remain fairly stable around current level year ahead. growth private consumption expect remain buoyant year next, primarily reflect low real interest rates, strong growth real disposable income continue rise house prices. in period ahead, high employment wage growth continue fuel household demand. on hand, household debt rise sharply. this imply normalisation interest rate increase household net interest expenses. after period, growth consumption may fairly low. however, assume household spread consumption time save ratio continue fall spite increase interest rates. growth house investment expect ease 2005. however, projection house start also high 2005. such high level house start several year probably mean dwell construct imply underlie demand. a result, house investment expect decline period. high interest rate weak development norwegian economy may also lead fall residential construction period. the upturn mainland fix investment broadly based. strong profitability, high capacity utilisation solid export growth contribute continue investment growth goods-producing industries. demand service expect continue grow period ahead attendant bi review 18/2005 5 increase investment service sectors. when growth economy gradually slow down, investment growth probably slacken. mainland export good service mainland norway also benefit solid global growth year. late period, continue loss market share result high cost level dampen export growth. unemployment expect decline year next. in subsequent years, growth demand output expect ease, unemployment may edge capacity utilisation approach normal level. with somewhat tight labour market year ahead rise inflation, wage growth may pick up. over past year, low consumer price inflation probably contribute keep nominal wage increase low imply labour market tightness isolation. low inflation result high growth household purchase power, even moderate pay increases. with path interest rate krone exchange rate line baseline scenario inflation report 1/05, inflation may increase gradually le 1 per cent today close 2 per cent mid-2006. under assumptions, inflation may stabilise around 2½ per cent three-year horizon. however, continue shift trade patterns, high import asia intensify competition retail trade, may prolong period low inflation. development krone exchange rate uncertain. the real krone exchange rate measure relative labour cost strong. historically, real krone exchange rate tend return average measure long period. should occur today’s situation, depreciation nominal krone exchange rate, inflation pick somewhat fast projected. if krone appreciates, hand, risk inflation move quickly projected. development line projection imply output gap increase 1¼ per cent 2006. a interest rate gradually increase normal level, growth private demand probably ease, capacity utilisation may bring stabilise. there uncertainty associate development demand output near term, partly interest rate low long period. high growth may rapidly trigger strong pressure economy. output growth norway high, capacity utilisation rising. it may appear growth become self-driven. the low interest rate probably contribute increase output gap inflation ahead. the operational objective monetary policy inflation close 2.5 per cent time. in conduct monetary policy, emphasis also place curb fluctuation output employment. the objective stabilise development output employment implies, isolation, high interest rate. this reduce risk capacity utilisation norwegian economy become high. high capacity utilisation could give rise bottleneck sector economy lead high rise property price household borrowing. this could source instability demand output somewhat long run. the objective bring inflation back target anchor inflation expectation nevertheless imply continue expansionary monetary policy. international interest rate rising, albeit slowly low level. there prospect continue low inflation period ahead. even capacity utilisation norwegian economy rises, appear little risk inflation rapidly move level high. inflation unexpectedly low first month year, light highly open economy must perhaps expect somewhat wide variation inflation countries. the projection assessment present inflation report 1/05 may whole imply key rate period, gradually, bring normal level. at monetary policy meet 16 march, norge bank’s executive board decide leave key rate, sight deposit rate, unchanged 1.75 per cent. the executive board weigh objective bring inflation back target stable inflation expectation risk output growth may eventually high. 6 bi review 18/2005 jean-claude trichet: european financial integration - view ecb speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, eurofi conference entitle “europe’s single capital market: time tackle tough challenges”, luxembourg, 10 march 2005. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, it give great pleasure accept invitation conference, address issue high importance ecb eurosystem. with mind, i would like express ecb’s view european financial integration. let start remind financial integration achieve effective interplay market force environment free competition, coordinate action private actor specific measure take public authorities. the ecb support complement steps. our support financial integration something see optional. on contrary, see issue great importance conduct activities. let give underlie reason behind stance. first, well integrate financial system pivotal smooth effective implementation monetary policy throughout euro area. in regard, i would also like mention ecb’s task promote effective operation payment systems, well interest smooth run security settlement systems. second, well integrate financial system help make euro area economy efficient reduction finance cost improve allocation financial resources. this likely conducive high sustainable non-inflationary growth. a study sponsor european commission conclude 2002 integration european union might generate additional gain 1% overall level real gdp decade so. third, european financial integration priority reiterate european council several occasions. the ecb’s support european financial integration therefore accordance article 105 treaty, state “the escb [– european system central bank –] shall support general economic policy community view contribute achievement objective community”. finally, interconnection financial integration financial stability. a deep financial integration may, extent, change interplay vulnerabilities, potential impact financial stability – natural interest central bank – take account. the ecb us available channel effort foster european financial integration. we try raise awareness need integration mean achieve it. we also advise shape legal framework. furthermore, ecb act catalyst collective initiative private sector. finally, appropriate, ecb take direct action. i late give several example different roles. i would like discus three major component financial system, namely institutions, market infrastructure. i address wholesale retail aspect three components, touch upon development deem success, well area effort required. institution follow adoption single currency, financial service action plan (fsap) represent next major stage integration process. now fsap near completion, i see post-fsap period “window opportunity” enhance financial integration. at time, i convince progress inextricably link improvement regulatory supervisory framework financial stability arrangements. in particular, institutional bi review 18/2005 1 arrangement must respond need great cross-border cooperation, view support integration time preserve financial stability. in area financial regulation supervision, key objective achieve high degree regulatory supervisory convergence across countries. this help reduce compliance burden financial institutions, thus address one large remain obstacle enhance cross-border activities. at time, well develop arrangement exchange information cooperation among supervisory authority become prerequisite effective supervision cross-border entities. in area financial stability, arrangement financial stability monitor crisis management need tailor fact liquidity solvency problem financial institution increasingly likely affect one country. the institutional framework bank especially important. give pivotal role channel fund eu economy, well integrate bank sector prerequisite achieve truly single financial market. in recent years, witness increase cross-border banking. the considerable competitive pressure global market increase saturation domestic market normally spur cross-border banking. policy-makers already launch important initiative step cross-border cooperation line growth cross-border banking. while challenge come period certainly remain, impressive progress already made. in area financial regulation supervision, extension lamfalussy approach bank sector establishment committee european bank supervisor (cebs) milestones. here, i would like emphasise crucial work perform cebs, develop common benchmark best practice consistent implementation eu bank directive well agree principle cooperation home host supervisors. in addition, forthcoming revision codify bank directive provide robust underpin great cross-border cooperation among authorities, especially large bank groups. the revise directive tighten requirement information exchange coordination consolidate supervisor host supervisors. it also assign consolidate supervisor coordinate role gather dissemination information group well plan coordination supervisory activities. follow two major reforms, effort focus effective implementation. a regard financial stability, significant increase cross-border arrangement response recommendation report economic financial committee (efc) financial stability crisis management. the important role financial service committee (fsc), responsible monitor implementation efc recommendations, fully acknowledge point. with regard crisis management, 2003 memorandum understand eu bank supervisor central banks, new eu member state adhere june 2004, great accomplishment. for first time, principle manage financial crisis may cross-border impact agree eu level. nevertheless, memorandum may sufficiently detail cover large cross-border bank group comprise several authorities, crisis management particularly complex. give potential far-reaching implication financial disturbance involve groups, development group-specific agreement could important avenue explore. another important issue involvement finance ministry crisis management framework. a high-level work group, comprise representative ministry finance, central bank bank supervisors, work concrete proposal cooperation arrangement three authority eu level. a regard financial stability monitoring, eu framework enhance considerably recent years. in context, i would like highlight stability assessment eu bank sector, perform escb’s bank supervision committee, comprehensive analysis potential vulnerability euro area financial system whole, carry part ecb’s financial stability review. in addition, cebs expect improve internal exchange information individual institution groups. 2 bi review 18/2005 market i turn second component financial system, financial markets. the introduction euro measure adopt fsap spur integration european financial markets. nevertheless, continue vary degree integration. wholesale money bond market tend relatively well integrated, unsecured euro money market reach fully satisfactory level integration. the integration market debt security significantly increased, although yet reach level unite states. in euro area, amount outstanding debt security issue non-financial corporation domestic currency represent around 5% gdp, compare figure 20% unite states. integration progress government bond market and, less extent, also corporate bond markets. the corporate bond market grow deepen substantially europe past years, although large gap unite state still exist regard outstanding volume. but new issuance 2003, accord best estimates, order magnitude side atlantic. the business underwrite corporate bond euro, hand, wholesale bank area become largely pan-european even international. the short-term security market europe slowly integrating. the market’s size commercial paper eu represent eur 1000 billion, two third size u market commercial paper. a i mention earlier, one ecb’s approach foster financial integration act catalyst initiative private sector. one example short-term european paper (step) initiative, set aci – the financial market association. it aim promote convergence practice prevail fragment european short-term security market market players’ voluntary compliance standard set step market convention. the govern council ecb decide support, principle, activity pertain introduction step label, would acknowledge adoption standards, first two year launch. it also decide produce publish step yield index well statistic volume ongoing basis. the ecb would like strongly encourage similar initiative promote financial integration europe. continue assessment wholesale markets, i briefly discus equity market. recent empirical evidence show degree integration increase here. for example, so-called “home bias” equity hold investment pension fund decrease substantially time. overall, however, market segment still one least integrated. a final comment wholesale markets, i would like say word development new credit markets. sometimes, market set pan-european context right start – might say “born integrated”. one example european market synthetic collateralised debt obligations. this development encouraging. however, existence cross-border activity, impact price volumes, always signal absence hurdle achievement full integration. factor segmentation may still exist, overcome innovative instruments. for example, securitisation market, originator need two-layer structure create pan-european transaction back well diversify multi-jurisdictional asset portfolios: first, asset must securitised domestic level, then, pan-european vehicle back several domestic securitisation transaction must set up. this complex procedure incur costs. i turn important retail market, namely mortgage credit market represent eu outstanding volume around eur 4 trillion. the lack integration manifest numerous ways. in national market borrower access full range mortgage products. moreover, negligible portion european mortgage credit grant across borders, technique loan origination service differ substantially country country. more half mortgage lend still finance retail deposits, although recent year capital market instruments, cover bond residential mortgage back securities, gain importance. these important asset category also use collateral eurosystem’s monetary policy operations. nevertheless, still exhibit high degree heterogeneity across country due difference legal, tax regulatory framework. bi review 18/2005 3 give size mortgage credit market, cost incur lack integration cannot ignored. in regard, ecb support private-sector european commission initiative encourage integration, follow-up report commission’s forum group mortgage credit. infrastructure integration financial market cannot take place without integrate payment, clear settlement infrastructure. this bring third component financial system, financial infrastructure, also give opportunity illustrate case ecb take direct action. target one example. have target operational first day monetary union, would mean transfer liquidity country liquidity surplus country liquidity deficit. consequently, would single several money markets, would make monetary policy far difficult implement. over time, target continuously increase market share large value payment euro. target's market share around 90% total traffic value compare 70% moment euro launched. at time, domestic component remain roughly three quarter total traffic value. however, ambition stop 1999. we currently build target2, due go live 2007 replace current decentralise system single technical platform. by way, eur 1.7 trillion settle every day, target already one two large wholesale payment system world, alongside fedwire unite states. with functionality introduce target2, also expect one most, most, sophisticated. target2 improve financial integration several respects. not increase cost effectiveness, also allow provision harmonise service level ensure level play field bank across europe. this support implementation single price structure domestic cross-border payments. moreover, target2 offer new functionality enable bank good integrate euro liquidity management. for example, participant able group account pool available intraday liquidity benefit member group accounts. in addition, target2 benefit user term consolidate information. whereas past institution’s head office able see information hold across various branches, target2 enable monitor process automatically data single location. the level integration target already achieve 1999 consider high security infrastructure today. owe single currency, significant process consolidation also take place security infrastructure euro area. at present moment, current configuration remain complex, significant number national exchanges, clear house central security depositories. further consolidation european infrastructure advisable. the ecb particular interest integrate security infrastructure us context collateralisation intraday credit operation payment system purpose monetary policy. in addition, major disruption security settlement system could undermine stability financial markets. there numerous private public-sector initiative way promote integration, efficiency, security european security infrastructure. the “standards security clear settlement european union” draw jointly escb committee european security regulator (cesr) important initiative. in communication “clearing settlement european union”, european commission recently outline action intend undertake improve clear settlement arrangements, welcome ecb eurosystem. in particular, agree barrier identify “giovannini group”, must eliminated. in addition, concur part clear settlement industry deserve careful attention competition policy point view. finally, order ensure smooth operation market guarantee financial stability, share commission’s view sound regulatory framework essential. 4 bi review 18/2005 in principle, ecb eurosystem also support adoption framework directive clear settlement, two main reasons. first, directive would complement market-led removal “giovannini barriers”, necessary condition competition able fully play role. second, implementation escb/cesr standards, well harmonisation measures, may require change national legal framework cannot make national supervisory authorities. we expect framework directive duplicate work escb/cesr. rather, line lamfalussy approach, directive stipulate high-level principle develop implement measures. we agree commission escb/cesr standard might form basis implement measures. last, least, light interest financial market infrastructure, commission invite recognise explicitly, responsibility task escb eurosystem, especially role oversight security clear settlement infrastructure. have cover wholesale aspect financial infrastructure, i turn retail aspects, important. take example mortgage market i cover earlier. a pan-european mortgage market cannot develop limitation make payment one bank another within euro area. in regard, eurosystem’s initial objective single euro payment area – sepa – citizen enterprise euro area 1 january 2008 onwards. accord commission’s regulation, price charge bank cross-border transfer must transfer within country. while price end-customer homogenise legislation, level service cannot influence legislation. what lack possibility use national instrument pan-european business well. a real sepa achieve payment make throughout whole area single bank account, use single set payment instruments, easily safely national context today. the ecb’s second objective sepa infrastructure end 2010. once national instruments, service standard gradually phase replace pan-european ones, national infrastructure abolish transform pan-european ones. consequently, decision relate next generation national system make pan-european perspective ensure compliance sepa. to encourage national implementation, respective national bank community translate sepa objective national transformation plans, allow bank infrastructure provider tailor strategy solution towards sepa. the ecb intend monitor progress assistance european payment council (epc). national bank community request provide national migration plan sepa course year. the epc initiative capability define pan-european scheme credit transfers, direct debit cards. however, since epc power enforce, would rely cooperation bank sector infrastructures. the ecb, cooperation eurosystem ncbs, stand ready facilitate implementation sepa objective foster full adoption project consider key achieve financial integration. conclude remark lady gentlemen, i explain ecb attache utmost importance progress european financial integration i talk various channel disposal foster it. in describe present state affairs, i also give main example ecb actively contribute european financial integration. at time, i make clear ecb expect continue effort private sector i mention substantial opportunity of, also challenge to, relevant public policy framework. the ecb demonstrate since first day existence credible solid anchor monetary stability. financial institution market participant know also count ecb domain financial integration strong pillar sustain effort facilitate success important european endeavour. thank much attention. bi review 18/2005 5 susan schmidt bies: bank secrecy act capital compliance issue remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, institute international banker annual washington conference, washington, dc, 14 march 2005. * * * good morning. i want thank invitation speak institute's annual washington conference. international bank organization play increasingly important role u.s. financial sector. foreign bank organization hold $3.5 trillion bank nonbanking financial asset unite state - make organization big financial hold company operate country. for two broad reasons, u.s. bank supervisor give great deal think foreign bank organization here. first, management complex international bank business create inherent risks, must mitigate sophisticate enterprise-wide risk management internal controls. international organization face difficult question management control across geographically disperse offices. they often operate new unfamiliar financial terrain, pose strategic challenges. and vulnerable terrorist financing, money laundering, customer fraud issue tend involve cross-border transactions. second, international bank organization regulate supervisor various national jurisdiction different legal, regulatory, supervisory frameworks. thus, supervision regulation organization require continuous coordination cooperation host- home-country supervisors. while bank operate globally, supervisory regulatory responsibility various operate unit organization still base law regulation sovereign states. comply diverse law regulation complex costly global bank organizations. today, i want touch two regulatory issue currently high list banker supervisors: bank secrecy act compliance basel ii implementation. compliance bank secrecy act since passage usa patriot act 2001, significantly amend bank secrecy act, compliance area major concern bank industry. in large part, bankers' concern center increase burden comply amend bank secrecy act, apparent lack consistency oversight supervision, law enforcement issues. the federal reserve recognize bank organization devote significant resource help government identify prosecute involve money laundering, fund terrorist activities, crimes. but recent event affect bankers' perception role critical area, raise serious question bank regulator government authority - notably law enforcement agency - expect bankers. today, i want provide background information describe federal reserve doing, coordination justice treasury departments, clarify expectation dispel misconception compliance bank secrecy act. but first i want emphasize important point bank secrecy act: implementation act traditionally accomplish partnership among banks, supervisors, law enforcement authorities. the law require report recordkeeping useful entities. further, law capitalize role bank payment systems. a collector financial information, bank good position identify questionable suspicious payment activities. for past decade, key obligation bank within partnership file suspicious activity reports, sars, accordance regulation issue u.s. department treasury federal bank thrift regulators. the agencies' rule require bank organization file sars alert law enforcement authority federal bank supervisor know suspect violation law, suspicious activity conduct at, by, bank, thrift, credit union. by file sars, bank organization put critical information hand proper law enforcement authority timely effective manner. since sar system start 1996, bank bi review 17/2005 1 organization file 1.7 million sars. that enormous amount cooperation information sharing. however, recent criminal investigation prosecution base bank secrecy act sar report violation attract significant industry attention. most importantly, case generate complaint financial industry increase burden bank secrecy act compliance, well uncertainty future requirement - particularly file sars. believe regulator law enforcement authority set zero-tolerance level sar-filing deficiencies, bank organization concern certain situation fail file sar could result criminal prosecution. banker tell u regulatory criticism criminal prosecution base sar-filing deficiency produce collateral consequences. for example, bank tend avoid customers, money transmitter check cashers, present perceive heighten risks. yet close account type business effectively denial bank service many category legitimate customers. bank organization also begin file "defensive" sars effort avoid criticism judgment whether activity illegal suspicious, avoid sanction fail file particular sars. the treasury department's financial crime enforcement network (fincen) report defensive file threaten clutter sar database information cannot properly analyze due volume. bank regulator fincen recognize process fraud money launder detection control reasonably expect perfectly detect every transaction. but, financial institution expect sound anti-money-laundering compliance program. this must include well-defined process identify suspicious activities, process tailor risk complexity business line. bank provide sufficient train line staff, compliance officers, internal auditors, legal staff keep employee alert suspicious activities. further, questionable activity detected, bank must respond promptly effectively, work appropriate law enforcement authority bank regulators. i sure aware interagency effort develop issue new, enhance bank secrecy act examination guideline procedure within next months. the federal reserve federal bank supervisors, active participation fincen, draft more-detailed uniform examination guideline procedures. we reach industry stage project. once procedure completed, work hard educate examination force industry guideline procedures. these effort intend good ensure consistency bank secrecy act anti-money-laundering supervision program bank regulator fincen - entity within u.s. treasury statutorily responsible implement bank secrecy act. in addition, federal reserve federal bank supervisory agency recently sign memorandum understand fincen share critical information bank organizations' compliance bank secrecy act. by provide pertinent bank secrecy act information fincen, add additional staff fulfill responsibilities, federal reserve regulator good coordinate supervision enforcement efforts, thus reduce potential unwarranted compliance burdens. fincen also commit provide banker regulator information emerge money-laundering scheme guidance continually improve bank secrecy act compliance. the federal reserve also work senior justice treasury official ensure understand effort bank regulator ensure compliance bank secrecy act. we want awareness compliance effort consistent throughout criminal justice system industry regulator continue build partnership law enforcement authorities. i would like move discussion basel ii implementation. basel ii implementation basel ii represent fundamental change bank capital determine regulatory purposes. the advance approach require bank organization make significant investment improve risk-management process measurement minimum regulatory capital good reflect institution's unique business mix, risk appetite, control structure. 2 bi review 17/2005 internationally active bank organizations, particular, understandable concern prospect national supervisor across expanse global operation ask multitude question basel ii implementation, demand considerable amount data, apply framework differently, take action increase costs. inevitably, find institution calculate capital different approach various jurisdiction operate. to help national supervisor coordinate achieve great consistency implementation basel ii within individual countries, basel committee, know, establish accord implementation group (aig), head colleague nick le pan, canada's superintendent financial institution vice chairman basel committee. nick today address recent effort aig great issue home-host supervisory coordination depth. i want assure u.s. supervisor sensitive need coordinate efforts. we best make compliance manageable global bank organization improve coordination effort foreign supervisors. these initiative include enter write supervisory cooperation information-sharing arrangement financial institutions' supervisor country share cross-border bank operation unite states. however, strive minimize burden regulate institutions, cannot eliminate it. a critical point audience, true bank secrecy act issue well, regulator commit apply rule foreign-owned organization apply domestic ones. foreign-owned u.s. bank hold companies, banks, thrift meet criterion mandatory basel ii institution require follow advance approaches. u.s. bank hold companies, banks, thrift own foreign organization meet criterion - include great majority institution represent audience - choice either follow current capital framework unite state "opt in" advance basel ii approaches. if decide opt in, meet qualification requirement domestic organizations. the new basel ii rule expect take effect january 1, 2008. to qualify date, supervisor banker substantial work accomplish. currently, review submission receive various bank organization part quantitative impact study, qis-4, ass effect basel ii rule bank capital levels. this summer, agency issue notice propose rulemaking (npr) basel ii. we also issue comment, amendment exist capital framework. thus, banker able compare two alternative evaluate appropriate u.s. operations. in run-up 2008, institution subject new rule require conduct year parallel calculations; is, institution perform dress rehearsal, will, demonstrate design basel ii system sound also rule practically implemented. a know, federal bank agency unite state state small number large, internationally active bank organization require follow advance approach calculate capital basel ii. a year half ago, propose set threshold $250 billion total bank asset $10 billion foreign bank assets. the criterion forthcoming notice propose rulemaking unlikely differ materially levels. at time, u.s. regulator - especially among u spend great part career banker - sensitive competitive implication two set rule bank industry. regulator recognize basel i enhance basel ii standardize approach well suit need domestic-focused community bank organizations. accordingly, seriously consider make target adjustment exist regulatory capital rule look way enhance risk sensitivity without increase regulatory burden. the staff agency draft advance notice propose rulemaking (anpr) suggest possible change exist capital rules. this advance notice publish close publication basel ii notice propose rulemaking. finally, institution consider adoption advance approach early possible date begin define detail implementation plans, identify gap placeholder discussion supervisors. in regard, u.s. bank agency recently issue guidance describe expect implementation process work unite state step bank organization could consider. to sure, several important implementation issue still need work out, focus enhance risk management bi review 17/2005 3 basel ii (especially advance approaches) mean bank organization view basel ii preparation checklist mentality. rather, move ahead many fronts, look make fundamental change need good risk identification, measurement, management, control. by so, bank organization position succeed implement accord timely basis. throughout process, critical regularly communicate primary supervisor whether plan "opt-in" advance approach timeframe compliance. regular communication help supervisor allocate resource support qualification process. it also help supervisor focus implementation efforts, identify issue need addressed, provide prompt response questions. 4 bi review 17/2005 v leeladhar: basel ii accord implication speech mr v leeladhar, deputy governor reserve bank india, bankers’ club, mangalore, 11 march 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, pleasure share think subject currently engage attention bank community, india worldwide. let first admit upfront although i moment wear regulator’s hat, yet i commercial banker part professional career. so, banker still goad put bankers’ shoe evaluate regulatory options. i good appreciate nuance practical stand point, therefore shall try put banker’s perspective rather regulator. manage risk increasingly become single important issue regulator financial institutions. these institution year recognize cost ignore risk. however, grow research improvement information technology improve measurement management risk. it’s natural therefore, capital adequacy bank become important benchmark ass financial soundness strength. the idea bank free engage asset-liability management long back level capital sufficient cushion potential losses. in words, capital requirement determine risk profile bank. the initial capital accord 1988 hugely successful 100 country accept benchmark. one major reason success framework simple. it bring uniformity attempt make regulatory capital requirement consistent economic capital. reserve bank india introduce risk asset ratio system capital adequacy measure 1992, line basel accord 1988, take account risk element various type fund balance sheet item well non-funded balance sheet exposures. in fact, rbi norm capital adequacy 9% stringent basel committee stipulation 8%. shortcoming present accord however, present accord criticize inflexible due focus primarily credit risk treat type borrower one risk category regardless credit worthiness. the major criticism exist accord stem • broad brush approach – irrespective quality counter party credit • encourage regulatory arbitrage cherry pick • lack incentive credit risk mitigation technique • not cover operational risk a time passed, major international bank begin use sophisticate model measure risk. this need felt upgrade basel framework. therefore, basel committee bank supervision think desirable present accord replace risk-sensitive framework. three pillar the new basel accord foundation three mutually reinforce pillar allow bank bank supervisor evaluate properly various risk bank face realign regulatory capital closely underlie risks. the first pillar compatible credit risk, market risk operational risk. the regulatory capital focus three risks. the second pillar give bank responsibility exercise best way manage risk specific bank. concurrently, also cast responsibility supervisor review validate banks’ risk measurement models. the third pillar market discipline use leverage influence market player bring. this aim improve transparency bank improve reporting. bi review 17/2005 1 issue challenge have give brief overview current propose new framework, i shall move implementation challenge bank especially develop country like india. here, i would skip methodological detail technical nitty-gritty associate new accord, concentrate instead profound implication bank industry. issue and challenge while second opinion regard purpose, necessity usefulness propose new accord - technique method suggest consultative document would pose considerable implementational challenge bank especially develop country like india. capital requirement: the new norm almost invariably increase capital requirement bank across board. although capital requirement credit risk may go due adoption risk sensitive model - advantage offset additional capital charge operational risk increase capital requirement market risk. this partly explain current trend consolidation bank industry. profitability: competition among bank highly rat corporates need low amount capital may exert pressure already thin interest spread. further, huge implementation cost may also impact profitability small banks. risk management architecture: the new standard amalgam international best practice call introduction advance risk management system wide application throughout organization. it would daunt task create require level technological architecture human skill across institution. rat requirement: although credit rat agency india, level rat penetration low. a study reveal 1999, 9640 borrower enjoy fund-based work capital facility banks, 300 rat major agencies. further, rat lag indicator credit risk agency poor track record respect. there possibility rat blackmail unsolicited rating. moreover rat india restrict issue issuers. encourage rat issuer would challenge. choice alternative approaches: the new framework provide alternative approach computation capital requirement various risks. however, competitive advantage irb approach may lead domination approach among big banks. bank adopt irb approach sensitive adopt standardize approach. this may result high-risk asset flow bank standardize approach, would require less capital asset bank irb approach. hence, system whole may maintain low capital warrant become vulnerable. it consider whether quest perfect standards, lose universally accept standard. absence historical database:

serdengeçti, governor central bank republic turkey, occasion open turkish derivative exchange, i̇zmir, 3 february 2005. * * * lady gentleman distinguish guests, it indeed great pleasure address today occasion open turkish derivative exchange, begin new era turkish economy. today, i focus change process turkish economy within framework uncertainty risk factors. i also talk development derivative market within process, include function economy especially monetary policy. my remark base macro framework rather micro one. dear participants, when look turkish economy, clearly see risk management derivative markets, risk managed, well institutionalize risk management culture establish economy fail reach satisfactory level yet still weak financial real sectors, although constantly agenda since 1980s. the question ask point risk management principle could establish economy modern sense functionality derivative market could achieve proper sense. at point, two factor come foreground: the important principal factor underline economic social aspect chronic inflation uncertainty presence cause turkey thirty years. this period seriously damage economy. for instance, money capital market fail develop, long-term financial resource remain limit possible develop markets, occupy significant share capital market develop countries, namely provision house financing. moreover, economy fail achieve sound integration international market short-term vision prevail fields, include social arena. furthermore, chronic inflation trigger volatility basic economic indicators, include growth employment, well variable exchange rate interest rates. the excessive volatility economic fundamental result continuous increase uncertainty crises. thus, economic crisis, uncertainty jump high level. uncertainty volatility cause vicious circle make risk management almost impossible. dear guests, at point, let elaborate concept uncertainty risk, key role development derivative market great significance policy practitioner economic agent act decision-makers. although word “risk” refer literal mean uncertainty daily use, fact two concept differ effect economic agent events1. risk measured. case course result event neither cannot measure predict refer risk uncertainty. in words, intangible aspect event define uncertainty. due intangible nature uncertainty, result extent effect cannot predicted. probability cannot attribute uncertainty. uncertainty inevitable result unmanageable. there exist market avoid uncertainty. 1 knight, f.h. (1985), “risk, uncertainty profit”, chicago, university chicago press, chapter 2 7. bi review 17/2005 1 on hand, risk refer part future effect event measured. risk calculated; result risk explain certain probabilities. in context, risk predictable manage results. there exist market risk management. in turkey, high volatile inflation main source uncertainty last 30 years. concept uncertainty risk become indistinguishable. hence, impossible implement risk management establish risk management agent slippery slope. at point, i would like emphasize technical matter. a known, volatility price derivative markets. when uncertainty high, volatility increase significantly. this make price difficult circumstance price reach high levels. hence, risk management become almost impossible. this one underlie reason poor risk management country. the fact future uncertainty high recently due macroeconomic instability keep general level interest rate upward trend. a result, factor prevent smooth operation derivative markets. the second factor lead poor development risk management derivative market turkey high public deficits, cause fragility public finance. a aware, past, capital accumulation base public resource turkey. however, result increase public deficits, capital provide public sector private sector extend private sector public sector. in context, market develop “government securities” issue public debt become important market, us almost resource economy due increase public debt well high real interest payable. such framework, words, environment fiscal dominance rather high allow neither emergence new financial instrument finance private sector, deepen financial markets. moreover, portfolio diversification, simple element risk management; could achieved. the significant point process that, outcome structure financial market policy implemented, lot risk exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, price risk default risk assume public. in scenario, private sector feel need manage risks. in words, individual institution leave risk management government process create vicious circle. in conclusion, uncertainty cause chronic inflation high public debt create public deficit hind development risk management therefore, derivative markets. dear participants, i glad say today start solve problem past. the turkish economy still undergo structural change process significant progress made. let outline process change turkish economy three main points, serve guideline necessary step take future. the first point make great progress fight inflation, primary source uncertainty well establish last macro-economic stability. today, inflation single-digits. more importantly, survey measure expectation reveal public recognize inflation controllable price stability definitely achievable target. the tight fiscal policy implement process establish macroeconomic stability contribute enter growth period base solid foundation arise private sector; reduce role private sector decrease fiscal dominance establish stability impact expectations. parallel this, follow developments, capital accumulation process undergo change well. the source growth long public sector, private sector. a rise productivity come foreground sectors. we establish economic structure measurement criterion global market apply. in scenario, ease uncertainty bring risk management risk instrument foreground. from on, economic unit assume manage risk every sound market. this basic concept underlie development derivative market world. secondly, i would like focus concept relatively new country; namely institutionalization, accountability, transparency and, context, importance communication 2 bi review 17/2005 policies. both institutionalization policy implementation transparency government agency implement program share public play key role ease uncertainty economy. the third point regard change process turkish economy i would like share increase confidence, actually outcome issue i mentioned. to clarify point, public confidence economic policy implementation favorable expectation result policy improve continue improve. the concrete indicator confidence inflation target become credible nominal anchor economic agents. in words, commonly use reference. the existence strong nominal anchor economy, use reference, help shape economic variables. accordingly, volatility economic fundamental variable gradually decreases. a i already emphasize begin speech, point great importance respect resolve price difficulty arise excessive volatility. moreover, today happy see economic unit able foresee long term able carry longer-term transactions. these development drastic step determine benchmark interest rate price derivative operations. thank macroeconomic stability structural transformation process, reach point make risk management sound healthy environment. the turkish derivative exchange important pillar complementary element process. in presentation hold several anatolian cities, grand national assembly council minister meet since 2001, we, central bank, point significance derivative market indispensability markets. dear guests, now briefly consider phase uncertainty process development risk management turkey, i would like give overview development process world. first all, let remind although conduct transaction future market date back long time ago, development take long time. regard issue, i would like share information i believe interesting. aristotles’s write inform u first record account derivative contract trace 2500 year back ancient greek thales miletus, spring olive harvest winter. we know rice future trade japan 17th century future grain trade holland 18th century. the development financial derivative exchange accelerate parallel need hedge increase exchange rate risk collapse bretton wood system 1970s, last approximately 30 year provide system fix exchange rate system. at outset process, many people severely object establishment derivative market claim would encourage volatility increase speculation manipulation markets. this much remind “it possible turkey” “it right time,” comment i hear whenever try implement something new. the nobel prize win economist milton friedman’s speech open foreign exchange option market chicago mercantile exchange autumn 1971 contain important information us2. a friedman point out, financial instrument relate foreign trade complementary british case show financial service may well become profitable export item. within framework, argue development derivative market, normally expect exist natural evolution markets, another country usa important increase trade investment enable export service well. thus, claim development derivative market would support development 2 friedman, m. (1971), “the need future market currencies”, the future market foreign currencies, prepare international monetary market chicago mercantile exchange, inc. pp. 6-12. bi review 17/2005 3 financial activity country, would bring additional income export service sector enhance effectiveness monetary policy. dear guests, today transaction volume derivative market much transaction volume spot markets, trade exchange good trade realize day. in 2004, volume daily derivative transaction global foreign exchange market, exclude over-the-counter markets, u dollar 1.2 trillion, equal 65 percent total market turnover3. dear participants, today bring in, importantly, institutionalize risk management principle initiate development process derivative markets. this process great importance respect overall economic activities. it bear mind process sometimes arduous time-consuming also self-fulfilling process. even take long time, sooner late derivative market establish country. i please say i happy witness effort develop derivative market achievement well significance entire economy important step turkish economy. at point, i would like share expression frequently reiterate initial stage fight inflation, suppose tough long-lasting process: “even thousand-year long journey start single step4.” dear guests, a i mention before, derivative market one component economy “ought present anyhow natural evolution markets”, put forward friedman. at stage, i would like draw attention magnitude significance function perform change bring economy markets, also evaluate within framework experience countries. the inform subject, derivative market embrace derivative instrument become widespread. consider three-dimensional nature function financial markets; time, risk information, time dimension create risk concern future, whereas information dimension facilitate accurate decision take future predict few errors. within framework, first function derivates market ensure management risk wide spectrum range financial instrument foreign exchange rate interest rate commodity prices. the second function provide economic agent correct information price form market. at point, let clarify certain point regard float exchange rate regime, implement turkey since 2001 almost eighty country world now. this exchange rate among first contract operative turkish derivative exchange, well significance within context risk management, primary function derivative markets. a emphasize time since first day float exchange rate regime turkey, regime exchange rate determine supply demand conditions. the level exchange rate shape economic developments, external shocks, expectation fluctuation risk premium applicable them. neither central bank authority commitment target whatsoever regard level exchange rate. 3 bank international settlement (2004), “triennial central bank survey foreign exchange derivative market activity april 2004”. 4 chinese proverb. 4 bi review 17/2005 at point, i would like underline two point miss hold opinion start float exchange rate regime could implement turkey, risk regime high, would much volatility foreign exchange markets, economy, especially foreign trade would adversely affect result these. the first point fix foreseeable exchange rate regime implement - like past-, economy similar economy, capital movement free exchange rate risk disappear, assume public sector central banks, monetary authority. consider whole, environment economy relatively fragile structure, elevate loose fiscal policy governments, may even costly economic unit assume exchange rate risk float exchange rate regime. the second point presence derivative market would enable foreign trade firms, float exchange rate regime, act exchange rate fixed. in words, development widespread use derivative markets, level foreign trade would differ float exchange rate regime fix exchange rate regime, exchange rate risk would cease factor influence level foreign trade5. although market newly found turkey, i would like address point, often come international literature i believe might arise turkey come periods. leave aside fact speculative transaction frequently make derivative markets, especially foreign exchange market, market allege increase risk volatility economy. however, derivative market create new risk economy; instead, allow management imminent risk. the origin think common misperception regard transaction carry speculative purposes. especially foreign exchange markets, level exchange rate determine future transactions, spot market transactions. a transaction derivative market affect one-to-one supply demand-side liquidity, equally affect price form spot markets. in case, speculative transaction might observe derivative market expect drastic impact spot markets. furthermore, i already point several speeches, two group speculator markets. the first group buy price go up, expect price rise sell price go down, expect price decline even more; describe group bad speculators. this type speculator mostly see turkey. also process fight inflation, group hold asset foreign exchange, line old habits; thus continue buy foreign exchange high rates, belief turkish lira would depreciate anyway, use instrument whatsoever risk management; turkish lira appreciate float exchange rate regime due market conditions, group criticize stability program policy implemented. this group speculators, despite increase volatility certain extent, cannot remain market long, generally lose money. the second group good speculator, hand, line his/her forecasts, sell bull market buy bear market. leave aside problem cause volatility, group contribute stability markets. within framework, possible see member group market. in effective market, possible make profit continuously guide bad speculation, price form market approach price indicate economic variables. consequently, speculation much effect price create effective market; contrary, may make positive contribution market increase liquidity. hence, speculation threat derivative markets, guide activate spot market increase liquidity. another important point regard derivative market market enhance predictability spot markets, form basis, help perform effectively, enable expectation economic unit future measure reflect prices. a matter fact, price derivative market actually price expect spot market future. 5 baron d. (1976), “flexible exchange rates, forward market level trade”, the american economic review, vol. 66, no. 3, pp. 253-66. bi review 17/2005 5 consequently, derivative market contribute predictability cash flow economic agent profit loss arise risk volatility reduce excessive volatility spot markets, one hand, offer opportunity economic agent risk management, hand. in way, fragility firm sector arise deterioration balance sheet restore economy whole strengthen shocks. at stage, i would like highlight one point float exchange rate regime. in turkey, firm cautious imbalance foreign exchange denominate asset liability balance sheets. under float exchange rate regime, firm foreign currency-denominated income domestic currency-denominated expenditure, vice versa, restore imbalance balance sheets, words, eliminate exchange rate risk face with. in order achieve this, firm observe risk management principle employ derivative market instruments. firms, especially production firms, allocate resource production reduce financial risk balance sheets. this also make important contribution enhance competitiveness firms. a 2003, 92 percent world’s large 500 non-financial firm protect risk derivative instrument reinforce importance instruments6. moreover, i would like point benefit derivative instrument depend size firm use by. derivative instrument beneficial firm decision use instrument largely shape goal firm rather size. here, i would like touch upon point information transmission function derivative markets. derivative market offer economic agent chance price expectation future. thus, thank derivative markets, expectation become measurable prices, information concern future share economic agents. this structure enable effective resource allocation mechanism effective financial market economy whole. besides contribution effectiveness resource allocation mechanism, development derivative market help financial sector grow. hence, derivative market contribute increase national income employment indirectly encourage effective resource allocation provide value added. derivative market introduce new investment instrument financial intermediary system, broad sense, financial system. this, turn, increase number instrument investor use order diversify portfolio thus deepen financial markets. if analyze diversity investment instrument mean country, see thank derivative markets, real sector financial sector investor able manage risk diversity line world market structure help country integrate world markets. here, i would like draw attention large number study stress favorable effect presence sufficiently developed, deepen efficient derivative market foreign direct investments. dear participants, in addition benefit derivative market provide economy, bear extra importance complementary element financial market term interaction monetary policy thus central bank. a known, establish financial stability one important factor consider central bank set price stability primary objective. in framework, derivative markets, help sustain financial stability contribution reduce volatility markets, support central bank maintain financial stability. the second contribution derivative market monetary policy central bank thank function risk management provide information, expedite activate transmission mechanism use monetary policy give direction economy. 6 international swap derivative association, news release april 9, 2003. 6 bi review 17/2005 central bank adopt long-term perspective target try affect long-term movement economic variable decision take. in framework, crucial central bank much information long-term nature economy future possible. hence, derivative market play crucial role enlarge information set use monetary policy via information provide future. the critical point derivative market enable enlargement information set require central bank make decisions, one hand, improve flow information future course monetary policy need economic agent make contribution term assure predictable monetary policy, hand. dear guests, in framework interaction monetary policy derivative markets, i try outline main points, i clearly state development turkish derivative exchange make outstanding diverse contribution monetary policy. transaction turkish derivative exchange play key role inclusion quantitative forward-looking information central bank reports, especially transition full-fledged inflation target 2006. before i finish, i want mention issue concern future derivative market turkey. a new era start operation turkish derivative exchange. the main goal come period carry arrangement concern function derivative market utmost care bear mind market act catalyst whole economy. moreover, measure take order direct bank firm towards transact markets. example country show u strong positive correlation transaction volume liquidity rise derivative market presentation issue, introduction market train given. it confirm train program aim enable economic agent perform effective risk management use derivative instrument fuel development derivative market many country malaysia, singapore, hong kong, mexico, brazil, chile japan. take example consideration, see train institutional individual investor bear great importance turkey well, derivative market new concept. the central bank provide kind support development market also continue give support on. however, crucial especially non-governmental organization fulfill liabilities, introduce turkish derivative exchange participant provide necessary training. dear participants, to conclude, i would like emphasize drastic step take today inauguration turkish derivative exchange, line recent favorable development country. i hope step bring new opportunity future. thank you. bi review 17/2005 7 jaime caruana: basel ii - review ongoing work keynote address mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, 20th annual general meet isda (international swap derivative association), barcelona, 16 march 2005. * * * mr moulds, mr pickel, ms. sebton, distinguish guests, it honour invite join meet today furthermore pleasure welcome international swap derivative association spain. it appear ingredient stimulate memorable conference. the agenda ambitious address late topic ever-evolving derivative markets. the speaker distinguished, deeply experienced, represent wide range perspective institution forefront financial services. and, course, i must commend selection marvellous location annual meeting. barcelona undergo fantastic transformation, gateway world city celebrate ancient innovative. i hope take time outside session explore blend old new. a walk “gothic” quarter serf window past. a visit creation antoni gaudì – conference hall name – offer vision catalan modernism architecture. select barcelona venue isda’s discussion offer u chance well celebrate ancient innovative, old new, financial services. this conference, example, address sophisticate product bank finance risk management practices, legal developments, technological advance emerge support new businesses. at time, discussion barcelona remind u must always monitor control fundamental – traditional – risk involve activities. credit risk, market risk, operational risk always u various forms, although increase complexity recent years. what change dramatically, however, ability measure monitor risk comprehensively predecessor ever could. we have, moreover, improve ability manage transfer risks, i would like share today think work underway financial community regard. there three topic i would like address intervention. i begin share first, personal capacity, think regard need standard evolve keep pace times, whilst ensure new standard unduly burdensome hind firms’ ability innovate. in respect, i’d like look forward address work ensure new international capital standard - basel ii - remain flexible able adapt emerge practice risks. many strong interest effort committee undertake consider best apply basel ii certain trading-related exposure use late tool develop industry. while work still ongoing, i would like share status report effort. finally, i highlight work undertake promote smooth consistent transition basel ii, include plan conduct review calibration framework, well effort field supervisory co-operation validation, key message come initiatives. the evolution standard regulatory burden allow begin share personal think topic capture attention recently: the view, hold least financial service sector, tide regulation rise high water mark. in conversation around world, i hear similar concern bankers. some point long debate take place account bi review 17/2005 1 profession. others point regulatory reform underway, transpose implement committee’s work basel ii, new capital framework. it say industry recognise work do areas. however, i sympathy sense much change today. i understand keep pace change absorb resource require attention. in sense, especially relation work basel ii, i see merit concentrating, least while, complete current regulatory work, ensure quality consistency implementation. let expand little point. financial service provider often compete ability create value offer new product service customers. a one example, isda represent institution among active private negotiation derivative instruments. these instrument initially tailor unique set circumstance may involve novel feature risk-taking risk mitigation. the challenge, therefore, ensure rule support encourage firm effort improve ability manage business pursue new opportunities. that constant responsibility legislators, standards-setters, supervisors, also industry. we must review ensure rule implement fairly line intentions. some reform underway represent effort ensure rule keep pace achievement industry already made. on note, i would argue basel ii much align supervisory practice closely industry’s late advance promote improvement management risk within industry itself. but i sympathise sense wide range standard evolve parallel represent drain limit resource firm keep pace changes. i agree must find way balance danger try ward time resource take adapt new circumstance new rules. and i want work make sure labour undertake merely exercise compliance new rules, rather represent honest effort strengthen practice long-term prospect growth innovation. from perspective chairman basel committee, i say committee’s main focus near future complete current work implement basel ii sound, consistent, effective manner. this allow u period digest framework designed. at time, always say basel ii evolutionary approach. this mean move target. we design stable framework believe stand test time. but always clear detail may need change time ensure remain relevant ongoing evolution bank market risk management practices. indeed, text basel ii framework publish june 2004, committee re-iterated intention maintain active dialogue industry ensure new framework keep pace with, apply to, ongoing development financial service sector. the framework already provide bank great degree latitude develop new measure exposure risk new mean address them. but supervisor – bank – still responsible evaluate whether framework address risk exposure sensible manner line sense sound best practice developed. status work trade book there two area bank supervisor recognise work could already commence. one find prudentially sound treatment basel ii exposure “double default,” risk borrower guarantor default obligation may substantially low risk one party defaulting. the area concern apply basel ii certain exposure arise trade activities. this bring second topic. a know, already spend close three-quarters year study set issue depth. because bank security firm great interest potential solution particular issues, basel committee work jointly international organization security commission (iosco) consult industry representative supervisor 2 bi review 17/2005 matters. i must say co-operation iosco area mutual interest fruitful beneficial experience, work conduct positive collaborative spirit. also regard, i must extend thank isda member faithful active participant discussions. isda member volunteer considerable data, time, energy work hand. a may already know, five specific area focus, namely first, treatment counterparty credit risk over-the-counter derivatives, repo-style security finance transactions; second, treatment double-default effect hedge transactions, relation trade book, also bank book, exposures; third, short-term maturity adjustment, internal ratings-based approach, trade book-related items; fourth, limit number improvement current trade book regime, especially respect treatment specific risk; fifth, design specific capital treatment unsettle fail transactions. i report informally i personally highly satisfy progress joint basel committee iosco work group achieve date, reflect small way cooperation industry prepare data response discussions. i expect committee release proposal six-week period public comment next month proposal release final form summer. however, intensive work continue prior discussion meet basel committee iosco’s technical steer committee toward end march begin april. so i cannot yet comment solution may propose approve committee iosco. i tell set, guide principle, goal apply basel ii exposure manner reflect best possible sound practice already use practice appear prudent broadly acceptable many kind bank markets. some industry representative raise concern find way apply basel ii trade book exposure might lead revision exist “market risk amendment” capital framework approve 1995. understandably, industry representative express concern might disrupt banks’ effort prepare basel ii, address mainly credit operational risk. the member committee share concern decide undertake work prudential treatment certain trading-related exposure basel ii. we intend overhaul capital rule trade book exposures, rather seek address narrowly handful concern relate either potential inconsistency could arise new treatment bank book asset relate limit number issue arise since adoption market risk amendment. the implementation basel ii with that, i would like turn third topic report effort smooth path exist capital standard new basel ii framework. on regulatory side, supervisor work national authority transform framework enforceable rule regulations, within context jurisdiction’s process. this work well underway basel committee member jurisdictions, also many country well. on supervisory side, let mention three area particular devote resource promote seamless transition new framework. calibration first, verify basel ii calibrate appropriately. the committee long state intention conduct work re-confirm new framework meet objective broadly maintain aggregate level capital requirements, keep incentive adopt advance approach offered. bi review 17/2005 3 in order establish common data set base review, committee decide begin recalibration exercise autumn year. in addition, national field test already underway jurisdictions, period time bank calculate capital requirement parallel 1988 accord basel ii. we recognise test review demand resource bank supervisors. yet i must emphasise neither bank supervisor able evaluate calibration new framework – hence effectiveness – bank participate fully seriously initiatives. only provide data u need ensure basel ii function intend create unintended side effects. consistent coordinate implementation second, supervisor work avoid unexpected outcome developing, advance, good understand various jurisdiction apply basel ii. this also helpful develop consistent set expectation across countries. in world business bank increasingly international, need supervisor cooperate strive consistent principle would exist even basel ii not. but basel ii, need even pronounced, especially internationally active bank wish adopt one advance approach credit operational risk provide basel ii. in fact, many ways, basel ii act catalyst enhance co-operation. the committee find way avoid need firm endure redundant uncoordinated review system process develop benefit basel ii. the accord implementation group, chair nick le pan, canadian superintendent financial institution vice-chair committee, already undertake number practical exercise encourage supervisor many country inside outside committee’s membership consider review system process firm operate across borders. the aig, group known, identify two key lesson bank consider may help ease transition basel ii. one lesson detailed, comprehensive, clear firm’s plan move one advance approach risk management, good able supervisor ass evaluate plan le intrusive manner. but second lesson take one step further: also important bank share plan broadly branch subsidiary worldwide. already host supervisor find local manager may unfamiliar parent organisation’s plan basel ii: understandably tend make host supervisor le confident quality organisation’s plan readiness move basel ii. moreover, increase need ask questions, may duplicate question home supervisor host supervisor asking. if bank already develop sufficiently detail transparent plan application basel ii, substantial portion hard work already done. share plan home host supervisors, manager throughout bank’s operation locations, require much effort. instead, bank even good position focus run business confidently still implement plan carefully future. validation one great challenge – bank supervisor – basel ii framework need validate system process use generate parameter serve input irb approach credit risk. although validation foremost responsibility banks, supervisor must thorough understand validation order ensure overall integrity bank’s activity area. in recognition importance validation committee recently publish six principle validation guide future work. we also publish work paper called: “studies validation internal rat systems” let mention principle briefly. firstly, set understand validation fundamentally assess predictive ability risk estimate use rat credit processes. secondly, stress primary responsibility validation lie bank itself, supervisor’s responsibility review bank’s process outcome – point i think agree important. 4 bi review 17/2005 the remain principle relate process itself. we note validation likely ongoing, iterative process require ongoing, iterative dialogue bank supervisors. then fourth principle reflect single validation method, universal tool validation, even though technique may converge time. we also highlight, fifth principle, validation encompass quantitative qualitative element – validation purely technical mathematical exercise, also include assessment control qualitative factors. finally, stress view validation process outcome subject review within bank, party independent responsible design implementation processes. i think principle set clearly supervisory expectation are, provide useful steer industry. our work validation accelerate come months, although focus share catalogue information approaches, try develop prescriptive method. a state principles, primary responsibility validation lie bank themselves. close dialogue industry work will, course, great importance. in turn conclusions, i would like use opportunity make brief comment perspective governor banco de españa. although i talk work underway aig implementation, probably also aware similar work conduct europe, committee european bank supervisors, seek promote consistency convergence application basel ii eu. a i say occasions, i believe basel ii represent great opportunity eu – single market - lead way international convergence, i hope seize opportunity. certainly, progress make cebs far encourage respect. conclusion come back point i make earlier, even consider ongoing work trade activity basel ii, i believe vast majority effort undertake bank supervisor alike today relate basel ii focus implement good rule already developed. i believe committee’s main focus near term. it important well remember basel ii mean exercise compliance. it goal improve quality risk management across bank sector; strengthen resilience financial system; promote sustainable economic growth good consumer business alike. i look forward continue work enhance effort make goal reality. bi review

without interruption 50 quarters. unemployment fall around 10½ % 1992 6½ % 1997, 4½ % late reading. inflation fell first half 1990s, since 1997 has, average, close government’s target. all is, course, well known. but may le familiar quarter-to-quarter change output growth inflation recent year exhibit strikingly different pattern previous decades. both output growth inflation le variable (chart 1; table 1). inflation also seem become le persistent. by that, i mean that, whereas past rise fall inflation tend protracted, recent fluctuation inflation short lived. work undertake bank england economists,2 summarise table 2, suggest – least statistically – apparent change occur around time uk’s introduction inflation target 1992. the policy debate – inside outside bank – recently refocus

(2004), ‘uk monetary regime macroeconomic stylise facts’, mimeo, bank england. bi review 16/2005 1 economic analysis help u match various real-world story puzzle see data. inflation firms’ price-setting behaviour in medium-to-long run, average rate inflation determine rate nominal expansion permit monetary authority. but short horizons, decision take business – particular, wage price – affect quarter-to-quarter fluctuation inflation and, generally, demand pressure fee inflation. economic policymakers draw number way think influence inflation dynamics. there model can, uniquely, capture richness real world. but surprise though may some, one way think firms’ price-setting behaviour would familiar anyone run business. namely, firm charge mark up, profit margin, marginal cost various input – labour, capital, raw intermediate materials, etc – mark cost vary accord current prospective demand conditions. this represent schematically, indeed crudely, diagram 1. the key feature demand rise firm utilise capacity fully add labour force, cost price tend rise. that might involve old-fashioned ‘cost-push’ inflation, firm raise price maintain margin face increase (marginal) costs. or firm might initially able temporarily raise margins, labour cost late ‘catching up’. in either case, firm wage bargainer influence think go happen inflation future. again simplifying, two feature add diagram bridge firms’ so-called ‘output’ – wholesale – price retail price bank targets. first, well input produce firms, import directly consume households. second, distributor – including, obviously, retailer – add another mark up, reflect cost desire profit margins. change economy affect link (stylised) chain bear inflation dynamics. the challenge separate cyclical, temporary, factor structural influence period alter firms’ cost margins. that important policymakers, form view medium-term outlook inflation need distinguish short-lived persistent influences. monetary regime change the monetary framework one structural influence. one encourage feature post-1997 landscape that, well inflation track target fairly well, expectation inflation well anchor target (chart 4). uncertainty future inflation also fallen3 (chart 5 ). it different past. a characteristic share various monetary regime try uk government 1970s 1980s one could easily judge rate inflation authority try achieve – or, therefore, much idea outlook inflation. a fear one distinguish economist early generation, “every business venture [risks being] transform speculation monetary policy”.4 in circumstances, may well seem reasonable assume recent inflation outturn good basis guess near-term path inflation. and give evidence, firm household could also forgive act assumption authority would slow respond excess demand upward pressure inflation. by contrast, current regime seems, far least, enjoy high credibility. in consequence, set prices, firm might well place weight policy deliver inflation line target recent inflation outturns. if so, might part explanation much low persistence inflation i describe earlier. in words, shock economy cause inflation deviate target, firm may nevertheless set price basis return target fairly quickly – would, course, help bring inflation back target. in similar 3 tucker p. m. w. (2004), ‘risk, uncertainty monetary policy regimes’, bank england quarterly bulletin, spring 2004, page 84-96. 4 simons, h. (1947),’rules versus authority monetary policy’, a positive program laissez-faire other essays, chicago. 2 bi review 16/2005 vein, firm household might expect bank tweak policy fairly promptly response shift demand. in case, influence demand shock wage price setting, inflation, would plausibly somewhat weak past. but sound monetary policy important change economic environment. that much apparent even brief examination real-economy influence firms’ cost prices. i shall discus three: labour market, finance markets, competitive condition product markets. labour market for businesses, workforce account major part input cost (chart 6). firm general – economy aggregate – therefore profoundly affect transformation uk’s labour market past quarter century. the key influence well documented.5 in particular, industrial relation legislation alter way union operate, union membership fall (chart 7). unemployment social security benefit progressively reformed, increase incentive work. use part-time worker increase (chart 8), part due expansion service sector, perhaps also flexible idea work patterns. the mechanism via employer employee find – job search – improved, help investment employment exchange perhaps recently internet. in combination, development provide condition unemployment fall past decade without add inflationary pressure. during transition, supply capacity economy accordingly increase would otherwise achieved; give increase real aggregate demand would put le pressure otherwise supply, would weak effect firms’ cost prices. that mean, however, fee demand pressure inflation permanently weaker. instead, apparently flat relationship, illustrate chart 3, unemployment wage inflation is, least part, probably symptom sustainable level unemployment gradually fallen. that effectively mpc assume make judgment outlook inflation. we reasonably confident direction change, size. that illustrate current conjuncture. over past years, least two influence work. first, year enjoy improvement ‘terms trade’. that meant, simply put, aggregate price good service produce export rise relative aggregate price imports. this increase purchase power households’ income (chart 9), may dampen wage pressure labour market tightened. to extent explanation give weight, would tend temporary factor, point upside risk earn growth look ahead. a second apparent feature environment work way round. anecdotally, role migrant labour increase various sector – partly associate enlargement eu’s single labour market. if continued, new resident continue help meet particular skill shortages, labour supply available uk business would increase, imply economy could potentially accommodate strong aggregate demand otherwise. however, available data really enable u get beyond anecdote speculation. finance another important input firm finance – work capital investment. here too, seem change – range term source finance available firm household – could potentially influence extent cyclical fluctuation output inflation. one characterisation past would firm household depend bank loan external finance; bank loosen tighten credit condition sharply different phase 5 see, example, nickell s. quintini g.,(2002), ‘the recent performance uk labour market’, oxford review economic policy, vol. 6(4), page 26-35. bi review 16/2005 3 business cycle, rein back economy suffer downturn arrears loss mounted. for uk, well document small-firm finance early-90s recession.6 although stability output growth recent past happily deprive u proper test, reason think cyclical swing availability finance may somewhat le mark past. in first place, great stability bring new monetary regime may make difference. compare past, le risk monetary authority delay response incipient inflation point force slam brakes, effectively engineer recession quell inflation expectation process contribute sharp spike unemployment, loan default bank losses. a stable macroeconomic environment may also, reduce risk new entrants, one amongst number influence foster competition. there perhaps circumstantial evidence in, example, decline margin personal loan (chart 10). that would tend reduce credit constraint face households. a increase availability loan product enable homeowner borrow free equity houses. broadly similar change underway business finance, competition also come outside bank sector firms’ access rich capital markets. the proportion uk non-financial firms’ debt account bond rise around 15% 1990 30% (chart 11). our large firm access international commercial paper, bond asset-backed markets; derivative market manage financial risks. for small firms, compare decade ago, seem expansion asset-based finance option enable utilise collateral effectively.7 take together, rich supply menu may leave firm household somewhat le expose severely credit ration economic downturn; may enhance ability cope cyclical economic fluctuations. if help dampen effect shocks, output growth inflation may vary little le otherwise, monetary policy may need respond le aggressively past keep economy stable path. but, again, difficult disentangle cyclical durable changes. a topical example risk premium price financial instruments. to pick one indicator, corporate credit spread fall years, level last prevail mid-90s (chart 12). in degree, seem likely reflect relatively benign global macroeconomic environment together balance--sheet strengthen corporate sector number major industrialise countries. but, conceivably, also reflect good diversification risk – facilitated, example, rapid growth new instrument credit derivative great cross-border investment savings. if – risk premia systemically low – would tend reduce firms’ cost capital increase households’ financial wealth. alternatively, price risk may temporarily low, possibly low.8 the upshot cannot yet confident durability macroeconomic implication change see financial environment. mark up it commonplace competition intensified. this associate ‘globalisation’. the fact familiar. world trade grow relative world output (chart 13). a wide range emerging-market economies, notably asia, become material participant world economy. some uk business relocate part production, outsource firm operate market cheap labour costs. partly reflect developments, although also increase specialisation, share import uk business investment consumption steadily rise (chart 14). 6 ‘the finance environment small firm last decade’, finance small firm – an eleventh report, bank england, 2004. 7 hewitt, a. (2003), ‘asset finance’, bank england quarterly bulletin, summer 2003. 8 see, example, section 2 ‘financial stability conjuncture outlook’ financial stability review, december 2004. 4 bi review 16/2005 these development make market contestable. a effective competition policy. an example recent year car market, price converge prevail continental europe. the internet, e-commerce, also bring great contestability, make lot easy business check price compete suppliers, consumer compare price across different retailer (table 3). over time, force would expect reduce firms’ margin – least sector previously especially competitive. so long process adjustment underway, inflation would tend low would otherwise imply give set demand conditions. in addition, margin become thinner, firm might become aggressive control cost face fluctuate demand, might weaken pas demand shock inflation. the new monetary framework might reinforce effects. over recent years, handful business manager comment that, inflation high highly variable, use easy implement – ‘get away with’ – price increases. in low inflation environment, easy business customer consumer distinguish relative price change increase general price level. that foster great flexibility efficiency economy; one contribution low stable inflation potentially make broad economic welfare. one strike example distribution sector. anecdotally, competition uk retail intense. this seem manifest aggregate data two phases. a document recently mpc colleague steve nickell,9 retailers’ margin compress year around turn century. since then, seem crush cost measure deliver rapid productivity growth. in part, appear achieve disintermediating wholesale distributors, whose margin continue fall (chart 15). at macro level, effect was, period, open gap producer output price inflation retail good price inflation (chart 16). in words, structural change distribution sector reduce fee demand pressure retail price inflation. look ahead, one downside risk mpc’s central projection cannot rule process go. the current conjuncture policy monetary regime change, labour market reform, financial innovation, technological revolution, globalisation – heady combination, unavoidably add challenge discriminate cyclical structural influence form view macroeconomic outlook. but equally unavoidable policymakers must try that. that bring current conjuncture policy. my take present follows. in judgment, is, balance, likely degree excess demand economy. survey suggest above-average capacity utilisation. and corroborative evidence rise output price inflation relative costs, anecdote firm able pas cost increase (chart 17). give tight labour market, fit earn inflation relatively subdued? one possibility aggregate demand pick up, firm first place increase output make great use exist workforce capital. that would consistent anecdotal evidence firm hold labour early slowdown aggregate demand; pick private sector productivity growth past year (chart 18). look ahead, would also suggest degree upwards pressure earn growth. a reflect inflation report publish couple week ago, condition excess demand, combine likelihood strong import prices, point inflation gradually rise back towards 2% target next two year so. there many risk around central outlook but, take together, compare november i judge slightly le downside medium term. the recent rise cpi inflation suggests, example, stick 9 nickell, s. (2005), ‘why ha inflation be so low since 1999?’, bank england . bi review 16/2005 5 materially inflation target. and, i discuss earlier, puzzle apparent weak fee demand inflation reduce somewhat committee’s judgment performance labour market improve recent years. that leaf continue demand pressure likely fee inflation, look ahead. with monetary policy need set medium-term view, overall i conclude mpc’s late meet interest rate increase 25 basis point – small tweak reflect outlook. but, remark today emphasised, considerable uncertainties. two final think them. the first concern precision monetary authority achieve objective. in bad old days, probably clear economy experience unsustainable excess demand. in today’s world, discus excess deficient demand generally address much small deviation trend past, chart 19 suggests. in consequence, debate cyclical condition lie well within margin error sensible estimate underlie trend – especially give uncertainty structural change affect economy. in similar vein, – commentator – need keep perspective deviation inflation target. in november, year-on-year measure cpi inflation 1.1%. by january 1.6%. secondly, inflationary problem loom past, inflation expectation – amongst businesses, household financial market – increased, signal bring incipient rise inflation. today, appear enjoy well-anchored inflation expectations, affect price-setting behaviour way i touch on. indeed, modern economic model various kind – inside outside bank – tend assume policy credibility, anchor medium-term expectations. if so, medium-term outlook inflation would assured. in fact, credibility something assumed. it achieved, continually reachieved, policymakers – actions, reason explanation them. for reason alone, policy inevitably remain judgmental process – one mechanically tie particular model, one draw wide range inputs, include insight business contacts. learn is, accordingly, inherent mission. over next years, economy escape buffet shocks, learn quite lot. in meantime, notwithstanding uncertainties, make judgment explain them. 6 bi review 16/2005 chart 1: absolute change quarterly inflation 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0196019651970197519801985199019952000rpiconsumption deflatorpercentage pointssource: bank england ons table 1: average absolute change quarterly inflation gdp growth rpiconsumption deflatorgdp growth1960-19791.100.761.451960-19720.830.571.181973-19791.581.111.931980-19921.190.590.691993-20040.790.340.34 table 2: rpi inflation persistence 1947-19720.561972-19920.911992-2004-0.05 bi review 16/2005 7 chart 2: bank england repo rate two-week forward curve 3.03.54.04.55.05.56.06.52000200120022003200420052006nov 03 irfeb 05 irper centoutturnssource: bank england chart 3: earn growth unemployment 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0-6.0-4.0-2.00.02.04.06.01971 - 791980 - 891990 - 992000 - 2004lfs unemployment rate q1 (per cent workforce)average earningsin q4 (percentage change year earlier)1971198019902000 8 bi review 16/2005 diagram 1: inflation process demand pressureslabour costsoutput pricesother costsdistribution sectorcpi inflationimports (directly consumed) chart 4: inflation expectation 0.02.04.06.08.0198919921995199820012004per centindex-linked giltsconsensussource: consensus bank calculations. infer expectation five-year inflation five years' time bi review 16/2005 9 chart 5: imply volatility 3-month option 20-year swap contract 050100150200250199319951997199920012003basis pointsaverage since establishment mpcaverage prior establishment mpc2005 chart 6: uk labour share 6065707580195519611967197319791985199119972003percentage gdpsource: ons 10 bi review 16/2005 chart 7: percentage workforce trade union membership 2030405060197019741978198219861990199419982002per centsource: lf nickell, s. quitini , g.

2005. * * * i please join annual meet independent community banker america. in past years, i discuss many vary issue you, technological change future community bank unite states. today, i sense concern burden regulation high agenda. i think might therefore useful share view regulatory burden perspective bank regulator. a framework american bank date early day nation, long history has, i believe, teach u valuable lessons. foremost bank system play central role allocate resources, pool capital, fund foster economic growth. that role change financial system become complex diverse. we also learn leverage bank system initiator conduit painful financial real economic instability. we must keep historical lesson mind evaluation bank regulation explain tension appreciation central role bank play prosperity concern banks' potential effect economic stability. over years, tension reflect primarily "safety soundness" regulation, supplement bank supervision. bank supervision intend flexible carry case case; design limit--not eliminate--the risk failure. over past fifteen years, supervision focus ensure bank management place policy procedure contain risk management adhere policy procedures. supervision become increasingly le invasive increasingly systems- policy-oriented. these change induce evolve technology, increase complexity, lesson learn significant bank crises, mention constructive criticism bank community. regulations, hand, prescribe proscribe must do may do specific areas, reflect past events. many regulation thus backward-looking, adopt response specific problem often remain problem resolved. however, public comments, change market realities, internal program help u identify regulation long serve public policy objectives. we update remove regulations. in cases, market change innovation often require change regulations, even new regulations, ensure policy objective continue achieved. the need safety soundness supervision regulation greatly reinforce past century address market distortion unavoidable consequence special benefit provide banks, benefit promulgate tension bank contribution growth concern banks' role economic instability. these benefit access federal reserve's discount window; access payment system, especially fedwire; deposit insurance. these provisions, collectively often call bank safety net, design minimize potential asset problem bank system disrupt real economy, but, unavoidable byproduct, also provide important subsidy banks. by protect depositor counterparties, also reduce, eliminate, much market discipline constrain risk-taking nineteenth-century banks. while evidence federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 1991 reduce value bank safety net, bank safety soundness regulation supervision still must act supplement to, substitute for, market discipline safety net undermine the increase scale diversity nonbank financial institution suggest institutions, too, need subject bank-like supervision regulation, since risk-taking, contribute economic growth, also implication stability. however, clear leverage ratio indicia fund process market monitor bi review 16/2005 1 discipline nonbank entity far intensively banks. indeed, real difference bank entity difference make banks: creation safety net resultant need find mechanism substitute market discipline displace safety net. to sure, increasingly try make supervision regulation like discipline market would impose safety net, human be cannot duplicate market, adjust adroitly, hence turn rule insistence prudential policy procedures. traditional bank regulation well understand appreciated, least tolerated, bank management. but form regulation require congress last three decades. one class regulation concern mostly ensure bank institution serve community address possible instance discrimination and, recently, assist law enforcement. example regulation adopt carry provision equal credit opportunity act (ecoa), community reinvestment act (cra), home mortgage disclosure act (hmda), and, bank secrecy act (bsa). another class regulation address "consumer protection," agencies, direction congress, implement adopt rule design primarily provide consumer information protect (in cases, however, rule also involve substantive restriction certain practices). more generally, regulations, craft carefully, enhance market efficiency provide consumer complete, consistent, timely information; promote consumer awareness shopping; open way more-effective competition. that surely intention truth-in-lending truth-in-saving regulations, example. the factor make bank candidate supervision regulation--their central role finance process couple benefit safety net provide bank government--have also make bank prime candidate lawmaker select vehicle achieve desire social economic objectives. not bank deliver economic role expertise, also legislator often believe bank obligation special benefit provide them. in implement law land, cost-benefit calculation often require compromise modifications. the recently announce proposal federal deposit insurance corporation, office comptroller currency, federal reserve modify cra exam example. in addition, agency constantly struggle avoid unintended consequences, particularly limit extent rules, well compliance supervision, cause undesirable change credit availability bank behavior undermine objective rules. to effective regulators, must also attempt balance burden impose bank regulations' success obtain intend benefit discover permissible more-efficient way so. because understand regulatory change quite costly, recognize well important regulatory responsibility balance cost change desire benefits. but market static, change must make time time fulfill objective law implemented. basel ii all factors--unintended consequences, balance burden benefits, well need cost change--enter calculus implementation propose new basel capital accord. a know, although require adopt new capital rules, many community regional bank uneasy may leave competitive disadvantage 2008 adoption new rule large rivals. to gauge whether concern warranted, federal reserve study competitive implication basel ii implementation. some study complete make public; others publish come weeks. for business lines, study suggest competitive impact likely, others, type small business loans, appear unintended competitive advantage disadvantage might created. where concern appear valid, federal bank agency summer propose option simple revision current capital rule would mitigate unintended undesired competitive distortion engender new accord. moreover, past, competitive issue late arise cannot adequately foresee, federal reserve would make appropriate adjustment rules. 2 bi review 16/2005 hmda disclosure another example need cost change--and perhaps risk unintended consequences--can find new rule regard hmda disclosures. several factor substantially change structure residential mortgage lend past decade so. prominent among development information process technology permit more-efficient more-accurate risk assessment management. in addition, dynamic marketplace induce bank seek new lend opportunities. moreover, early hmda data collection lead many institution review and, cases, modify market underwrite practices. these development induce bank change policy simply make risky mortgage loan make credit available charge additional risk taken. bank make many loan higher-risk borrowers, justifiably seek compensation high risk high interest rates. an economist would suggest perfect market nominal rate loan would different, risk-adjusted real rates, is, rate deduction expect losses, would loans. such risk-based price consistent expand access credit. indeed, many receive higher-rate loan would past deny credit low rates. however, bank concern risk reputation might precipitate new hmda data rate charge higher-rate segment market. specifically, public policy intended--increasing credit availability le creditworthy, often minority, borrowers--banks might accuse unfairly discrimination fail connect risk price evaluate rate term risk measures. such concern understandable as, indeed, also concern race, gender, ethnicity characteristic reflective risk per se may still adversely affect cost credit borrowers. the adoption risk-based pricing, together element discretion often afford loan officer broke price credit, raise concern borrowers, fact, may treat fairly. the change market structure couple concern

throw support extend loan concessionary rate affect areas. so far, 43 billion baht approved. in addition, commercial bank also reduce interest burden customer affect outbreak violence 3 southern border provinces. the bank community willingly step help without undue regard balance sheet. on business operations, commercial bank give full cooperation set nationwide banknote operation centres, enable completion new system within short period 1 year. other also render support data management system (dms), large important project currently make progress significantly reduce burden report eliminate duplication wasteful use resources. lastly, i wish thank commitment cooperation develop interbank transaction management exchange system (itmx), important infrastructure modern payment system. the system provide standard linkage serve customer support interbank transaction e-clearing. this boost efficiency payment system line international best practices. more importantly, significant move government-owned payment system privately run system own operate commercial banks. this development, turn, provide basis system respond efficiently change environment commercial bank set appropriate fee consistent costs. i truly delight see cooperation work spirit fair collective responsibility, help enhance efficiency stability financial system. distinguish member bi review 15/2005 1 it well recognize today thai economy recovery path year sluggish performance. economic indicator point firm clear sign improvement, albeit extent skyrocket performance, one continuous recovery steady pace. the credit stand country also improve reputable credit rat agency moody's upgrade thailand's sovereign rat baa3 baa1; whilst s& p, bbb bbb+. i especially congratulate financial institutions, especially last year financial performances. bank sector operation profitable previous year reflect average return asset (roa) 1.33% industry. such achievement doubt product hard work perseverance. i recall, back 2001, i assume office, i dishearten earn result bank system. in year 2000, bank system incur loss one hundred billion baht (-106.49 billion baht) average roa negative 1.7% total assets. the first question come mind return bank industry profitability else system would survive. you may recall end year 2001, discussion bot. follow meeting, bank start gradually reduce deposit rate stop compete deposit high deposit rates. these important step help reduce bank cost gradually turn profits. you take pride way overcome tough time follow economic crisis. we start massive bank recapitalization high costs; deal tough debt restructure amount volume unknown thai history; move reduce cost re-engineering work process downsize work force; improve service find alternative source income, cease compete deposit offer high interest rate; succeed recapitalizating second round low cost initial round. these event combine show good carve result potential grow profitably. today, i say confidence bank industry long weak spot would pose systemic risk economy. although many analyst still consider npls number high, view, current situation much better. bank put lot effort solve npls problem. recently npls bank system come 11.03 %. a close look remain npls 576.8 billion baht, show 84.6 billion baht loan restructure await sign agreement fulfillment 3 month obligation reclassify normal loans. another 241.6 billion baht await foreclosure eventually become asset banks. the government plan amend asset management company (amc), enable amc buy npls commercial bank fair value. meanwhile, remain 250.6 billion baht restructure process banks. i trust effort 250.6 billion baht bring le 100,000 million baht 2% total loan portfolio year 2006. by time able announce world bank system strong competitive lead institution region. other challenge resolution npls, bank thailand also entrust upon responsibility develop financial system line international best practices, namely adoption basel ii framework. the basel ii emphasize adequacy capital accordance underlie risks. it main objective build confidence international investor ensure thai commercial bank increase access compete level play field international capital markets. i recognize work towards adoption basel ii framework burdensome, complicated, difficult, but, point benefits, every bank forthcoming meet new international standard. i would like record thank appreciation positive response issue. in addition move towards guidelines, important element achieve sound bank public acceptance, domestically internationally, "ethical management", term i prefer term "good governance". this board member senior management bank duty play role model others. bank failure past often associate unethical mismanagement lend relate parties, lend affiliate company family friends, lend inconspicuous group upon request influential powers. in cases, senior management also benefit return favour form share ownership debtor company. the board 2 bi review 15/2005 director bank duty prevent abuses. this must start process selection bank management must high moral grind integrity. i wish use term "professional" i see many professional take advantage organizations. i would like see bank select competent management high moral stand integrity manage institution. the board director must also conduct role model exercise restraint minimize exposure potential conflict interest. they must give special treatment relative friends, could potentially lead loss bank. the board director must provide leadership protection management face request influential powers. thai society place virtue kindness; people influential position often approach special help favours. often time request entertain without prejudice without knowledge action result bank's financial loss late on. the duty management exercise diligence care consider requests. if loan application meet bank's criteria, bank could extend loan case ordinary customers. otherwise, management make effort explain case influential party. such communication avoid problem promote mutual understanding. i do i work exim bank request party also understand point. in general commerce businesses, practice give special favour treatment influential people time time special discount complimentary offer pose unnecessary risk. but business financial institutions, loss ensue far great may lead collapse financial institution financial system large. therefore, imperative board member exercise great care prudence. in instances, board member might consider minor issue, board member, one cannot afford undermine one's integrity reputation. it board member overlook small matters, management may take opportunity time big cases, finance officer may also practice become widespread pose risk bank. board member therefore recognize critical importance office. board member bank merely board member company. they board member financial institution part financial system country. their responsibility far-reaching. the bank responsible efficient allocation resource scarce public save investment economically viable project enhance country's potential growth development. the board ensure adequate oversight allocation fund unproductive projects. this especially board member board bank own slate. more important oversight role management, board member must put position would compromise integrity accommodate request friend families, cultivate favour influential powers. if board member themselves, stop others same. unethical behaviour management bank, also touch issue lend activities, also issue excessive expenses. here management bank practice without undue regard i would call decent practices. if leave unchecked, practice could widespread throughout bank ultimately affect bank's cost profitability. here too, board must also exercise oversight safeguard interest organization. to effectively, board must exercise restraint reap undue benefit bank even small matters. for board member tempt benefit institutions, would immediately undermine authority manage subordinates. let give example i see take undue benefits. lately, i notice remuneration board member bank set unreasonably high level. some bank pay meet allowance relatively fair rate pay bonus (which seem appropriate). some bank pay relatively le meet allowance also pay fix bonus heavy responsibility (which still consider acceptable). some bank pay high meet allowance high bonus. and, interestingly bonus also pay flexible rate base yearly profit, inherently risky scheme compensation payment. the point remuneration board member vary profit bank, could create disincentive board member exercise oversight responsibility ensure bi review 15/2005 3 prudence soundness bank adequate provisioning, prevent management undertake excessive risk great prospect profits. typically, bank run operation normal course business without special effort already expect generate return business normal profits. if entire profit take base calculate bonus board members, would seem fair institution? furthermore, would board member explain employee basis computation bonus individual employees' salary, use board member calculate base total profits? i bring topic today intention disrespectful many senior board director financial community. i merely notice rapid escalation certain benefit board member bank rise point "excessive". my concern practice may bring subordinates, may undermine authority lead, supervise business vital financial system country. however, i intend issue guideline matter. but, i believe bring today lead significant improvement initiatives. there say venerable phra dhammapitaka (a highly respect venerable, master "buddhist economics") "the righteous path business one right customers, employees, social environment, shareholders, owner itself”. i subscribe principle honourable executive one right employees, organization (by excessively take benefit organization), (by reduce benefit deserve receive organization). in conclusion, i would like extend sincere appreciation thai banker association member bring back traditional gathering. i truly hope frank candid remark lead cancellation next year's event!! i would like emphasize i ill intention see financial system progress develop sound management ethical standard. there deep mean sense "good governance" western world. above all, country would financial system sound robust year come. thank attention. 4 bi review 15/2005 svein gjedrem: dialogue boundary introduction mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), conference “dialogue without boundaries”, karlstad, sweden, 9 march 2005. the chart pdf-format find norge bank’s website. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. the speech contain new assessment economic situation current interest rate setting. * * * introduction this year, norway commemorate centenary disolution union sweden. in retrospect, dissolution painless process. norway’s internal affair affect union sweden. historically, national monetary system central bank important part nation-building. the norwegian constitution 17 may 1814 provide national monetary system. this first include constitution november 1814 fear union sweden would bring work national monetary system halt1. in 1875, storting decide join currency union denmark sweden establish two year earlier. danish, swedish norwegian note coin circulate use legal tender three countries. open financial markets, close trade tie common labour market provide opportunity high economic growth prosperity. an example norwegian company norsk hydro, establish year dissolution union. substantial investment require foreign capital crucial company’s establishment. moreover, may worth note kinship norway sweden important context. kristian birkeland sam eyde, together swede marcus wallenberg, consider founder hydro. trade norway sweden considerable, fairly high degree labour flow two. in 1800s, law enact provide common market trade goods, 1888 sweden adopt protectionist stance. in 1897, sweden rescined law, lead severe setback norwegian exports. close tie norway sweden thus important. they also favour regional development, particularly region far national centre close economic hub neighbour country. monetary policy give particular weight regional considerations. but monetary policy safeguard monetary value long term seek stabilise economic development short medium term also contribute promote regional development. long-term economic development consumer price economic growth norway sweden move fairly similar path year around dissolution union begin 1970s. there several reason this. first, part influence international business cycles. second, close trade relations, even setback interwar period two world wars. third, country participate various fix exchange rate system long periods. after world war ii, adhere international fix exchange rate system bretton woods. during period 1900 1970, norwegian swedish economy grow average annual rate 3.2 3.3 per cent respectively. with norway’s emergence oil nation, change occurred. the norwegian economy continue grow pace. from 1970 date, norwegian economy expand 1 report no. 39 (1983): act norge bank monetary system bi review 15/2005 1 annual average 3.4 per cent. the development petroleum sector use petroleum revenue contribute relatively high growth also mainland economy. in sweden, however, growth fell annual average 2 per cent. business sector competitiveness norway after norway become oil nation, competitiveness business sector norway deteriorate relation sweden. first, wage growth norway somewhat high sweden. second, value norwegian krone swedish krona appreciate sharply. the rise labour cost local common currency particularly high mid-1980s 1997. hourly labour cost swedish manufacture worker average 8 per cent high norwegian manufacture worker 1980 measure common currency. in 2004, however, hourly labour cost swedish manufacture worker almost 20 per cent lower2. competitiveness norway’s manufacture industry close 20 per cent weak average past 30 years. norwegian pay close 138 norwegian krone 100 swedish kronar 1970. today, pay little 90 norwegian kroner. the appreciation norwegian krone make le expensive buy good service sweden. during long periods, exchange rate seem influence change price export good import good two countries. in 10 year 1983, norwegian krone show particularly strong appreciation swedish krona. this occur time norway experience far favourable development price export good relative import good case sweden. norway’s term trade improved. in 1970s, sharp rise oil price contribute this. in practice, appreciation norwegian krone swedish krona occur swedish authority devalue currency norwegian authorities. the authority devalue basket currencies. in sweden, palme government’s devaluation 16 per cent october 1982 particularly strong. finland respond devalue currency 6 per cent. in norway, industrial leader industry organisation also press favour devaluation norwegian krone. norway’s finance minister rolf presthus characterise swedish decision serious setback nordic cooperation3, choose change value norwegian krone. in much 1970s 1980s, economic policy norway sweden lack long-term approach credibility. this contribute wide swing production employment. with policy low interest rate devaluation, inflation become entrench high level. frequent devaluation period follow 1976 could prevent weaken manufacture sector long run. on contrary, prove self-reinforcing. the wide fluctuation culminate borrow spree start mid-1980s, first norway sweden. the borrow spree succeed deep economic crises. both norway sweden abandon fix exchange rate policy 1992. important reason free capital flows, deep financial market hence surge cross-border capital movements. sweden switch inflation target 1993 among first country introduce system would late become norm small medium-sized economies. the riksbank succeed fairly quickly anchor inflation expectation keep inflation low stable sweden. norway follow suit march 2001. with float exchange rates, exchange rate may adapt change growth prospect change term trade. since end 1990s swedish krona depreciate norwegian krone. during period, norway experience considerable rise price 2 source: the technical report committee income settlements, report no. 1, 2005, preliminary version. the estimate take account actual hourly wage indirect costs. 3 aftenposten, october 1982 2 bi review 15/2005 export product oil aluminium, partly owe high demand china. sweden, hand, influence slow rise price good ict products. the close trade relation norway sweden benefit countries. even petroleum export sweden rise sharply 1970s, norway still run trade deficit sweden. we need good sweden build petroleum sector, increase wealth enable u increase good import sweden. norway thus maintain import share traditional good sweden export share sweden declined. weak business sector competitiveness norway relation sweden probably one important factor. look ahead, feature observe past 30 year may change. there imbalance cost level norway sweden. the cost differential cannot sustain long term. the high cost level norwegian business sector adapt situation develop petroleum sector phase use petroleum revenue mainland economy. after period, able cover small share import use current petroleum revenue draw capital petroleum fund. the norwegian cost level dampened, also compare sweden. competitiveness may long run bring back level prevail end 1960s norway become oil nation. during period adaptation, may start 5 10 15 years, flexible exchange rate, fall norwegian krone swedish krona, play important role. where stand today? tariff barrier trade good low. the eu/eea agreement also provide increase trade services. during 1990s, capital mobility increase level high 100 year ago. free capital flow free trade pave way high economic growth prosperity, also entail challenges. competition increase many industries. labour-intensive process transfer new eu member state baltic countries. some multinational company streamline various production process distribution centralise location. saab acquire general motor volvo ford. in periods, give rise unrest among local authority employees, example traditional manufacture city trollhättan. in norway, many large multinational company close operation home establish main office warehouse stockholm malmö/copenhagen area. both norwegian cost level population density disadvantage use regard structural developments. sweden partly respond strong international competition continue develop new improve exist product processes. the country also become nordic financial centre home country four large financial conglomerates. a mention norwegian economy benefit good price export product proximity petroleum activity provide norwegian manufacture advantages. however, oil dependence lack diversification industry structure source concern regard long-term development conclusion monetary policy’s important contribution provide economy nominal anchor. today, inflation target norm small medium-sized economies. exchange rate fluctuate, several way hedge fluctuations. after sweden switch inflation targeting, country experience solid output growth low stable inflation compare previous decades. since 2002, inflation fall sharply norway sweden. between december 2002 march 2004, key rate reduce total 5.25 percentage point norway. during period, key rate sweden low 2.25 percentage points, low level. two year start low interest rate norway, sign inflation move up, albeit slowly. the interest rate cut pronounce impact demand, output employment. bi review 15/2005 3 we cannot expect interest rate impact one period next. the economy also expose unexpected disturbances. a result, cannot fine-tune economic development use interest rate, avoid large effect economy expose disturbances. the experience norway sweden may indicate inflation expectation remain stable even inflation vary somewhat, long interest rate use actively moderate effects. with highly open economies, may accept somewhat wide swing countries. 4 bi review 15/2005

governor bank albania, anti money launder workshop, tirana, 22 june 2005. * * * dear participants, the subject today’s workshop is, well know, matter great concern worldwide. the way fight money launder (ml) counter finance terrorism (ft), impact u only, also neighbour country citizen company perform trade financial relations. in last years, issue devote considerable time effort you, albanian authority international organisations. besides meet exchange opinion general issues, i want use opportunity share think importance existence culture ml institution represent. i refer case banks, mean non-bank financial institution well. follow that, consideration ml valid also ft, i convince awareness public, complete. with term “culture” anti-money launder (aml), i refer existence bank structure responsible aml relate procedures. i aim need existence bank, real concern positive pressure make sure structure procedure apply real meaning, throughout institution single employee. at time, i mean real willingness bank careful proactive role inter-institutional relationships, aim leave away formalism qualitatively improve process aml. i focus detail issues, i proceed. prior proceed details, allow put your’s position. i feel i this, since i one you, executive director commercial bank head association banks. we share common concern speed quality legal requirement aml approve implement practice. i still believe law good requirement applicable practice represent affordable cost subjects. i must say exist law aml, need revise considerations. at time, often discuss concern way process implement endanger go opposite direction major objective reduce informal economy bring cash circulation. while banks, regulated, transparent supervise institutions, play important role objective, sole institutions. a le important role play institutions, especially tax collection institution services. special attention pay supervision market segment bank system within scope law. the term execute different payments, household company level, favour usage bank instrument (like electronic cards, wires, etc.) transaction (where involve big amounts) payment cash completely forbidden. there exactly transaction may represent big risk money launder illegal activities, include fraud tax evasion. i believe preference hold cash money deep society’s mentality also link relatively low level average salary country. a result, one say appropriate level confidence money circulate cash, hand many people, hence represent relatively low level ml risk. we also discuss cost encounter adopt full compliance requirement regulatory legal framework. an effective system aml, mean advance system information technology, especially part deal database clients, aggregation information single point network, enable continuous monitor filter bank transaction. for institutions, especially branch subsidiary strong financial institution, cost substantial difficult absorbed. bi review 49/2005 1 furthermore, witness somehow difficult dialogue institution implement law. i must say though problem exist almost jurisdiction, include develop countries. but attitude toward abidance law, constructive discussion problem quick reaction implement changes, facilitate solution different problems. dear bank directors, i like though consider issue bankers, contribute process, spite above-mentioned difficulties. furthermore, history show cost deal difficulties, whatever size normal times, easily exceed instance unusual event link scandal ml. firstly, i want say must careful allow difficulty distract focus heart issue, ensure time bank clean represent place dirty money creator benefitors enter. if act like this, negative consequence unimaginable. we put danger reputation single financial institution entire financial system; unwillingly, become instrumental crime reach goal use money generate illegal activities; place reputation sound client difficult position; lose confidence front honest market player darken positive image front international partner partner clients; go face future high cost bank business, represent loss client (which prove fatal), also difficulty expand activities; also expect subject penal action trigger regulatory framework. the damage multifold exceed quantitative advantage volume business may “outright” acceptance business offer. in end, rigorous application aml requirements, protect institution potentially large damage. this key element duty, feature good banker. by active aml, simply job. any negligence mean requirement job. we need emphasize key element process, strong commitment understand implement it. it important commitment come high management structure bank. if commitment missing, immediately show structure bank directly involve aml process, whose function negligible full formalism. within institution, commitment shown: preparation approval internal procedure aml (including know client), set proper entity appoint responsible person (on monitor aml implementation process) proper professional hierarchical qualities, rightly define right responsibilities, give moral material support, provide qualitative continuous train staff, especially direct contact client analyse ml risk profile keep positive pressure institution process implement continuously functioning. in one word, climate exist within institution issue (but only) favour instance responsible action take bank staff aml. in inter-institutional level, commitment active aml go beyond full compliance regulatory requirements. we must mindful role mosaic institution relevant implement aml program society. furthermore, sensitive helpful toward institutions, especially know difficulty face perform functions. more concretely, i believe bank industry non-bank financial institutions, give maximum contribution, suffice fulfil rigorously quantitative mandatory requirement law, focus also non-mandatory important requirements. for example, low number suspicious transaction currently report anti money launder directorate (fiu), number report transaction threshold require law, huge. in instance bank act accordance law requirements, compliance spirit law. a agree impossible bank totally know guarantee cleanness clients, must accept fact lack suspicious transaction report mean bank: • difficulty set structure ensure real analysis risk profile client; 2 bi review 49/2005 • doesn’t good understand problem adopt formalism fulfil law requirements; • take proactive role, understand relevant institution difficulty come forward reasonable acceptable solutions, accordance spirit law. if bank choose act formalism get widespread adoption entire financial system, i think really risk approach counterproductive financial industry firstly. it would somehow normal instance think low minimum threshold require law, possible solution avoid formalism capture potential case ml lie current threshold. hence, risk impose development much high cost compliance potentially formalism, consider difficulty exist analyse report information aml directorate. in context, i would like highlight formalism term law implementation unacceptable harmful. in case formalism base task performance make control structure become dormant inhibit positive progress. so crucial law regulation clear implementable possible order establish confidentiality facility implementation process. pass definition risk profile client, way would permit compliance spirit law. this approach base sound “know client” policy bank, standard requirement nowadays. this approach several advantages, one could mention improve capability tighten system prevent detect case ml. furthermore, allow good distribution focus financial human resources, result low compliance costs. at time, allow institution responsible implement law analyse information, focus full investigation transaction represent high risk ml. another delicate issue i would stress speech keep protect confidentiality give manage information suspicious transactions. our practice show problem issue complex. we case confidential information public press, next day filed. in another case, employee bank report suspicious transaction, call probe prosecutor office person actually involve ml. the report subject institution implement law, must define among certain procedure would eliminate occurrence case ensure protection confidentiality person file suspicious reports. a long element totally ensured, discussion matter risk purely theoretical one, without much practical values. in conclusion, governor, i must say i would encourage good cooperation among institution subject implement law aml. at time, bank albania supervisory institution licensee promote strong contribution bank anti money launder requirement implementation. in exert function, shall limit verification existence function internal structure procedures, deepen assess support management structure banks, give real implementation aml internal policies. the position central bank is, accord law, comfortable, play proactive role responsible central bank, show concrete implementation responsibility, intensify effort together actor interest enable good implementation law money launder prevention. allow close speech, thank co-organisers workshop, tirana office fsvc albanian association banks. i thank particular specialist commercial bank non-bank financial institution take part seminar, valuable contribution prevent money launder institutions. i thank particularly foreign experts, mr. farrell mr. burnside, accept share u valuable experience. i wish workshop also interest event. thank you. bi review 49/2005 3 zeti akhtar aziz: benchmark market index - milestone financial market progress speech dr zeti

towards market-determined exchange rate. second, since 1992 trade policy imbibe medium-term perspective. third, key aspect trade reform substantial reduction import tariff rate drastic rationalisation tariff structure, include dispersion. fourth, concert effort make dismantle panoply non-tariff barrier predicate upon balance payment reason gatt. fifth, reserve bank india undertake several measure ensure adequate timely availability bank credit trade finance competitive interest rates. sixth, policy thrust create appropriate institutional arrangement support vigorous export drive. these include export process zones, special economic zones, overseas bank unit technology parks. india engage constructively multilateral trade negotiation wto. within multilateral commitments, india forcefully articulate position reflect concern develop countries. in tune worldwide spread regional trade arrangement belief arrangement act prelude progressive multilateral trade liberalisation, india enter several preferential trade agreements. these reform trade policy regime unlock entrepreneurial energies. india’s merchandise export rise rate 20 per cent per annum, u dollar terms, recent years. a result, secular decline india’s share world export two per cent 1950 0.5 per cent 1980s halted. this share begin rise 1990s currently 0.8 per cent. the export strategy envisage double india’s share world merchandise trade 2008-09. service trade policy reform undertake since 1990s shed traditional focus merchandise trade encompass wide range tradable services, reflect india’s competitive advantage business services, technical professional services. the exim policy recent year select service special focus. india accept obligation article viii imf’s article agreement institute current account convertibility 1994. besides, bi review 49/2005 1 progressive liberalisation exchange control regime. foreign direct investment (fdi) permit host service order take advantage modern technology, restriction financial services, take account current stage development openness. further, increase availability speedy cost-effective money transfer arrangement bank channel post office result significant increase use formal channel remittance transfers. export service rise consistently 20 per cent per annum recent years. within service exports, software it-enabled service grow average rate 46 per cent annually since mid-1990s. over years, skill content indian labour rise traditional market middle east give way us, europe industrialise countries. for external sector, natural advantage translate significant inflow form remittance indian work abroad. workers’ remittance nearly four per cent india’s gdp provide considerable sustain support india’s balance payments. trade current account a discussion recent trend trade current account perhaps order. a distinguish feature india’s external sector development fiscal year 2004-05 expansion merchandise trade deficit five per cent gdp average little three per cent gdp 1990-2004. underlie expansion trade deficit surge oil import back soar international crude oil price pick investment demand well grow strength domestic industrial activity. this trend import may continue view possible strengthen upturn activity economy. however, intrinsic link merchandise import export emerge become entrench large expansion import also spur vigorous export growth. give recent experience, order trade deficit appear manageable stage consistent growth aspirations. despite large trade deficit, current account record modest deficit le one per cent gdp 2004-05 continuous run surplus three-year period, 2001-2004. the high trade deficit 2004-05 large extent accommodate net invisible surplus five per cent gdp, support buoyant service export sustain remittance migrant worker overseas. in fact, invisible surplus traditionally provide valuable support india’ balance payment recent years, take character permanent component current account. it context believe current account deficit sustainable enough headroom available accommodate even high level investment activity. from cross-country perspective, indian experience manage current account reveal unique features. first, lesson 1991 crisis bring forth policy ensure low current account deficit ensue years. this approach stand u good stead ward contagion asian crisis 1997-98. second, sustainability current account ensure policy choice non-debt flow emphasis consolidation reduction external debt. third, low current account deficit underpin shift international competitiveness favour software, it export workers’ remittance traditional exports. fourth, although fiscal deficit remain somewhat inflexible, allow spill current account. finally, current account deficit mirror image absorptive capacity, best assess business cycle rather discrete points. capital account since initiation gradual liberalisation capital account 1991, capital flow excess current account deficit (cad) except, 1992-93 1995-96, add reserves. it interest note stock external debt come steeply 28.7 per cent gdp end march 1991 17.4 per cent march 2005. the decline debt reflect policy-induced shift composition capital account favour non-debt flows. the level short-term debt continue low us$ 7.5 billion end march 2005. a regard composition capital flows, is, late, almost total shift favour private flows. the foreign direct investment increase le one per cent net capital flow 1980s 20 per cent net 2 bi review 49/2005 capital flow 2004-05. total portfolio investment flow account fiis, gdrs others us$ 8.9 billion 2004-05 top net inflow us$ 11.4 billion precede year. in brief, give adverse international experience unfettered capital account liberalisation, risk averse adopt policy active management capital account. the compositional shift capital account consistent policy framework, impart stability balance payments. the sustainability current account increasingly view consistent volume normal capital flows. the substitution debt non-debt flow also give u room manoeuvre since debt levels, particularly, external commercial borrowings, moderate raise event sustain pick demand external resources. there also cushion available foreign exchange reserves. since non-debt create flow dominating, emphasis encourage inflow foreign direct investment, enhance quality portfolio flow strict adherence may describe ‘know your investor’ principle. further, view entrepreneurial skill india evolve synergy global economy, overseas investment indian corporates receive positive response. further, prudential regulation financial intermediaries, especially banks, respect foreign exchange exposure transaction dynamic component management capital account well financial supervision. reserve management the adequacy foreign exchange reserve relevant consideration management capital account. first, adequacy view term trade need also short-term liabilities. second, merely long-term short-term debt term original maturity relevant reserves, profile external debt term residual maturity. a trade-related debt nature collateralised debt may le severe reserve requirements. third, addition portfolio flow may warrant comfort addition reserves. in fact, merit presume flow temporary till reason judge permanent. fourth, necessary recognise reserve provide cushion manage real external sector shock like oil prices. fifth, usually opportunity cost maintain foreign exchange reserves, must weigh financial non-financial cost associate volatile adverse exchange rate movements. finally, optimal level reserve difficult quantify, attention level reserve mean self-insurance essential. in final analysis, adequacy reserve need assess term medium-term perspective take account possible level current account deficits, composition capital flows, level international confidence ability country’s payment position pace quality growth. view perspectives, current level reserve continue comfortable. the essence portfolio management reserve rbi ensure safety, liquidity optimisation returns. the reserve management strategy periodically review rbi consultation government. in deploy reserves, attention pay currency composition, duration selection instruments. while set formula meet situations, rbi apply sound portfolio management principle risk management. exchange rate management a major success external sector management transition administer exchange rate regime flexible, market-based system. under new arrangement institute early 1993, day-to-day movement exchange rate market determined. india’s current exchange rate policy focus management volatility without fix target, allow underlie demand supply condition determine exchange rate movement period, orderly way. to end, rbi monitor closely development financial market home abroad, take monetary, regulatory measure consider necessary time time. the conduct exchange rate policy guide three major purposes: first, reduce excessive volatility exchange rates, ensure movement orderly; second, help maintain adequate level foreign exchange reserve third, help eliminate market constraint view develop deep liquid foreign exchange market. the policy aim prevent bi review 49/2005 3 destabilise speculation market facilitate foreign exchange transaction market rate permissible purposes. there wide consensus india’s exchange rate policy stand test time, despite several domestic external developments, include severe currency crisis characterise 1990s. recent international research viable exchange rate strategy emerge market lend considerable support exchange rate policy follow india. global economy india the debate india customarily contour public policy context increase global economic integration. more recently, however, debate rest world evidence challenge likely face global economy account progressively increase global integration indian economy. hence, merit look at, perhaps illustratively, global challenge integration move forward regard. over next half-century, population world age fast past half-century fertility rate decline life expectancy rises. in europe, demographic profile already tilt towards high age group 2050, project accelerate. projection suggest turn point 2010 2030 european union, north america japan experience substantial decline save rate relative investment may reflect large current account deficits. most high performer east asia china second stage demographic cycle. elderly dependency expect double country 2025. their work age population increase modestly first shrink. these projection suggest east asia could increasingly become important supplier global save 2025; however, rapid population age thereafter would reinforce rather mitigate inexorable decline global savings. india enter second stage demographic cycle next half-century, significant increase save rate share work age population expected. the share labour force population india expect overtake rest asia, include china, 2030. look ahead, rest world may increasingly rely china india supply labour capital could significantly influence evolution global economy. it evident china india give high priority generate employment poise substantial increase productivity. the global economy contend implication development prices, exchange rates, wage structure employment industrialise countries. over medium term, felt outsource grow rapidly may also cover high-end research development activities. in manufacturing, china emerge leader india catch rapidly. though agriculture heavily subsidise major industrialise countries, subsidisation would difficult sustain fiscal point view, since many country concern poise meet mount pension liability speak burgeon health care cost maintain deteriorate demographics. one sector industrialise economy continue show considerable strength dominance financial sector, partly attributable confidence factor financial market favour industrialise economy traditional international financial centres. it essential india carefully monitor development real financial sectors, frame policy tandem global development global integration continue positive sum game countries. financial integration on path integrate indian financial market global financial system, choose proceed cautiously gradual manner, calibrate pace capital account liberalisation underlie macroeconomic developments, state readiness domestic financial system dynamic international financial markets. unlike case trade integration, benefit country demonstrable, case financial integration, "threshold" term preparedness resilience economy important country get full benefits. a judgmental view need take whether country reach “threshold” financial integration approach cautiously, preferably within framework plausible roadmap draw embody country-specific 4 bi review 49/2005 context institutional features. in india, adhere cautious sure-footed approach reform far merit since enable u avoid policy reversal one hand build past strength other. the experience 1990s show approach financial integration stand test time. even embark measure pace financial liberalisation, ensure well-capitalised financial system international standards, low level loan delinquency. our financial market orderly smoothly function ability financial intermediary deal various segment financial market spectrum improve almost continuously. the optimism generate recent gain macroeconomic performance warrant balance consideration financial liberalisation. undoubtedly, contribute growth enhancement allocative efficiency use resources, promote financial deepen expand volume resource flow economy. at time important recognise risk financial system emanate stress macroeconomic fundamental associate fiscal deficit, inflation uncertainty international financial markets. turbulence domestic financial system tend amplify relate distortion generate undesirable fluctuation economic activities. further, also expose economy external shock fluctuation international business cycles. there could, therefore, trade-off initial stage consider financial liberalisation policy terms, trade-off take form choice measure premature financial liberalisation also appropriate sequencing, choice contextual often judgmental. in general, downside premature financial liberalisation would form financial instability associate social cost disruption significantly high develop economy like india. india make significant progress financial liberalisation since institution financial sector reform 1992 recognise internationally. external financial liberalisation, particular, expand fairly rapid pace. at stage, optimism generate impressive macroeconomic performance accompany stability give rise pressure significantly accelerate pace external financial liberalisation. it essential take account risk associate reset accelerate pace gradualist approach. first, india’s public debt fiscal deficit proportion gdp currently among high world, finance almost entirely domestic savings. there commitment fiscal consolidation medium term implementation fiscal responsibility budget management act, 2003. in interim, however, embark fast pace external financial liberalisation, possible spill-over effect fiscal deficit external sector need carefully evaluated. second, widely recognise financial instability lead high variability real activity and, asian financial crisis tellingly demonstrated, even cause interruption growth process. financial distress result macroeconomic welfare losses. resilience flexibility real sector economy essential deal surge capital flows, large reversal associate fluctuation financial price become inevitable accelerate liberalisation financial sector. at present, inflexibility price policy restriction domestic trade constrain response real sector. in general, therefore, low level system flexibility current juncture major constraint economic agent financial market participant respond highly accelerate financial liberalisation deal downside risks. third, adequacy foreign exchange reserve often cite consideration significantly accelerate pace financial liberalisation. foreign exchange reserve are, final analysis, cushion withstand cyclical unanticipated shocks. therefore, reserve adequacy may necessary condition sufficient one speed financial liberalisation. there clear recognition today net benefit financial liberalisation respect develop country would enhance complementary policy non-financial sector followed. finally, exist international financial architecture adequate prevent mitigate domestic external effect financial crisis large economy like india. the impact instability time crisis appear largely bear home domestic public sector rather global private sector. the issue set pace financial liberalisation revisit issue trade-off sustain growth growth rate could potentially turn volatile unstable. while necessary add pace growth, also equally important minimise risk bi review 49/2005 5 instability experience show desirable pace financial liberalisation often follow financial instability crises. thus, recent experience many country show period impressive macroeconomic performance generate pressure speedy financial liberalisation since everyone appear gainer liberalisation, cost instability may get generate bear country, government poor sections. avoid crisis ultimately national responsibility. the approach manage external sector, choice instrument time sequence policy matter inform judgment, give imponderables. conclusion over years, india’s commercial financial linkage rest world increase trade liberalisation openness capital account. this reflect transmission international impulse real sector domestic financial markets. trend international price significant influence domestic prices. indian corporates institution increasingly access international market consequent diversification benefits. while process provide important opportunities, also bring new challenge risks, necessitate fine-tune macro policy much broad canvas context. india is, thus, move focus manage external sector implement optimal integration domestic external sectors, global economy. thank you. 6 bi review 49/2005 jean-claude trichet: monetary policy emu - view challenge speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, zentrum für europäische wirtschaftsforschung (zew), mannheim, 24 june 2005. * * * introduction the subject organiser choose conference, namely “competition europe - europe face international competition” topical, also challenging. while presentation today focus directly issues, i address discussion economic differential within euro area conclude remarks. my main message today economic monetary union (emu) beneficial individual country comprise euro area. i begin present key macroeconomic development show great success emu project, term price stability low inflation expectations, also respect low macroeconomic volatility euro area. i argue high degree credibility, transparency predictability part monetary policy key condition success. nevertheless, stability-oriented monetary policy ecb alone make success euro possible. during transition euro fiscal policy discipline before. moreover, structural reform implement social partner contribute via wage moderation. one overlook contribution macroeconomic stability job creation simply positive effect diminish uncertainty hesitation regard reform project fiscal policy soundness. major adverse supply shock recent year also take account. finally, i discus issue inflation growth differential within euro area. i explain divergence similar size observe within unite states. moreover, inflation differential often normal welcome equilibrate mechanism within large currency area. similarly, persistent real growth differential may reflect normal healthy catching-up process. however, may also cause cross-country difference economic structure design economic policies. the first year euro - price stability well-anchored inflation expectation … when take close look development influence monetary policy, little doubt emu project great success, particularly remarkable background many sizeable economic shock hit euro area since introduction euro. when look euro area whole, regime shift towards great monetary stability take place second half 1990s. this associate emu project enshrine maastricht treaty, particular convergence process introduction euro. since ecb become responsible monetary policy euro area 1999, hicp inflation average 2%. this near “below close 2%” ecb aim medium term. let remind 1980s 1990s, average inflation rate 4%. inflation expectation also remarkably stable recent years. average long-term consensus inflation expectation fall 2.8% 1990s (1990 1998) 1.8% past six years. this fully line definition price stability. the low level short-term long-term interest rate currently observe provide substantial support favourable financial conditions. these low level would unthinkable without successful stabilisation inflation expectations. … also contribute low macroeconomic volatility a remarkable feature change economic performance strong decline nominal macroeconomic volatility. with convergence process 1990s, inflation volatility fell bi review 49/2005 1 strongly. the volatility quarterly hicp inflation euro area (measured standard deviation previous six years) fell around 0.6 percentage point late 1980s le 0.3 percentage point mid-1990s. since then, inflation volatility stabilise low level, spite major inflationary shocks. and average volatility long-term consensus inflation expectation also decline substantially, four-fifths, almost 0.5 percentage point 1990s around 0.1 percentage point recent years. low volatility actual expect inflation reduce consumer investor uncertainty thereby enhance welfare. stable inflation expectation high degree confidence part financial market participant monetary policy should, time, also lead reduction volatility longer-term interest rates, thus also low risk premia. indeed, past six years, substantial decline volatility long-term interest rate compare record past decade. in 1990s, example, standard deviation long-term interest rate (monthly data) around 2 percentage points; past six years, measure fall little ½ percentage point. it strike that, volatility long-term interest rate euro area still around twice high unite state 1990s, situation reverse last six years, euro area interest rate volatility observe unite states. anchor inflation expectation important low medium- long-term market interest rates. it also crucial reduce macroeconomic fluctuation response economic shocks. there hint persistence inflation recent year low before. it likely resulted, least partly, improve anchor inflation expectation may, turn, lead forward-looking behaviour part set price wages. le indexation wage price current past inflation would tend contribute low volatility employment output response macroeconomic shocks. importantly, achievement area monetary stability come cost high unemployment. on contrary, unemployment rate average around 8½% past six year therefore one percentage point lower, average, 1990s. annual employment growth (in term person employed) double average around ½% 1980s 1990s slightly 1% since start single monetary policy. average real gdp growth 1.9% past six years, close average 2.0% 1990s (1990-1998). moreover, visible sign cost term high real macroeconomic volatility; contrary, recent year volatility real variable also decline relative average observe 1980s 1990s. for example, standard deviation quarter-on-quarter percentage change real gdp growth fall around 0.5 percentage point 1990s around 0.4 percentage point last six years. the volatility employment growth also fall 0.3 percentage point 0.2 percentage point. all all, however, encourage structural reform notwithstanding, high degree monetary stability achieve stand contrast yet insufficient flexibility dynamism euro area economies. the latter phenomenon explain success emu accompany high real growth. in particular labour productivity growth weak since mid-1990s, unemployment many euro area country still far high. these problem need address step structural reforms. an inflationary monetary policy would certainly help - contrary, would make thing worse. the precondition credibility anchor inflation expectation let turn question able stabilise inflation expectations, thus interest rates, low levels. i discuss convergence long-term interest rate low level late 1990s recent presentation1, i attribute success shift credible policy regime. several institutional provision enshrine treaty well strategic 1 see j.-c. trichet, " monetary policy private expectations”, zolotas lecture bank greece, athens, 25 february 2005. 2 bi review 49/2005 decision govern council ecb necessary precondition credible monetary policy successful anchor inflation expectations. with regard key institutional provisions, ecb give clear mandate, namely pursue primary objective maintain price stability, independence fully guarantee treaty. furthermore, rule pursue sound fiscal policy enshrine treaty form maastricht criteria; stability growth pact implement principle via regulations. a regard key strategic decisions, govern council ecb design stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. this monetary policy concept base arithmetic definition price stability two-pillar approach involve economic pillar, also monetary pillar. our commitment monitor monetary development provide powerful support anchor long-term inflation expectations. the precise definition price stability euro area show full continuity national central banks’ early core definition price stability thus ensure inflation expectation new currency would credible national currency immediately set euro. finally, ecb opt high degree transparency. from beginning, key feature monetary policy strategy published. moreover, almost real time, monthly assessment govern council reason interest rate decision take present public press conference immediately follow first govern council meet month. all factor contribute high degree credibility enjoy ecb’s monetary policy thus price stability successful anchor inflation expectations. but credibility never gain all. it permanently preserve enhanced. that why, central bankers, vigilance always essence ecb pay utmost attention monitor inflation expectations. inflation growth differential among country euro area moderate … in recent month renew interest issue economic differential euro area countries. regional differential growth inflation standard feature large currency area around world. in euro area differential similar size observe within unite states. let provide figures. the degree inflation dispersion across euro area country characterise strong downward trend 1980s 1990s broadly stabilise since inception euro. inflation dispersion among euro area country (measured unweighted standard deviation annual hicp inflation rates) around 6 percentage point late 1990, amount slightly le 1 percentage point spring 2005. the average inflation dispersion across euro area country 1 percentage point since launch euro. this figure close dispersion observe across 14 u metropolitan statistical areas. the dispersion real gdp growth rate euro area has, since 1999, remain close historic average, without sign increase divergence emerge far. in period 1999 2004, average dispersion annual real gdp growth (measured unweighted standard deviation) around 2 percentage points, thus close average dispersion real growth rate since 1980s. by comparison, dispersion real growth across u state fluctuate around average 2½ percentage point 1990 2002, average dispersion real growth rate around 1½ percentage point across eight u statistical regions. … may reflect welcome adjustment process in monetary union, inflation labour cost differential across region country natural mean adjust relative price face asymmetric demand supply developments. the fact single monetary policy cannot address specific circumstance individual country imply flexible wage price need order deal regional shock disparity relative demand across regions. for example, region face shortfall demand relative potential supply loss cost competitiveness need exhibit low price cost domestically produce service goods. if wage price flexible respond quickly, support bi review 49/2005 3 employment purchase power thus contribute close demand shortfall. in addition, price wage change euro area average imply competitiveness country would increase vis-à-vis region and, result, external demand would also contribute close gap actual potential output. if labour product market rigid, however, shortfall demand lead swift adequate decline relative wage prices, unemployment region increase relate regional disparity could persist time. in context, i like make three remark concern euro area. first, change relative price within single currency area large frequent anticipated. the idea euro area area single currency prevent adjustment relative price clearly refuted. for instance, capacity german economy catch rapidly average euro area term cost competitiveness loss competitiveness associate german reunification impressive. strong increase relative unit labour cost first half 1990s contributed, lag, high unemployment. for example, 1992 1998, unemployment germany increase almost 2½ percentage points. in recent years, however, increase unit labour cost moderate, condition job creation clearly improved. this development also show wage price flexible sometimes thought. from point view, euro area flexible adaptable anticipate number observers. second, aforementioned process symmetric. in case existence positive inflation differential natural consequence economy outperform average term cost competitiveness reach rather low level unemployment. for economy inflation euro area average may natural way adust towards normal price level line average. this problem observed, instance, case netherlands possibly still relevant ireland. third, inflation differential necessary mean achieve relative price adjustment within euro area, case germany, also natural feature economy euro area view gradual convergence catching-up process regard average european gdp per capita. real growth differential may welcome reflect healthy catching-up process part le advance economies. indeed, since mid-1990s, country previously gdp per caput level significantly euro area average experience above-average real gdp growth rates. this particularly true ireland, spain greece. a healthy catching-up process zero sum game, win-win situation, country already productive benefit increase trade investment opportunities. crucially, emu increase chance achieve welcome outcome. a credible monetary policy anchor inflation expectation increase market transparency, thereby facilitate necessary adjustment relative price across different country sector presence economic shocks. in addition positive effect monetary stability, single currency enhance process financial trade integration within euro area. and also observe increase risk-sharing euro area countries. thus, euro single monetary policy contribute competitiveness euro area job creation, also real convergence. cross-country difference may also signal need change national economic policy i give three economic reason cross-country differential price labour cost change reflect welcome adjustment relative price within single currency area. however, one case differential advisable term national economic policies: economy already relatively low level cost competitiveness high unemployment face deterioration account high price cost inflation. in case, additional attention must give increase flexibility adaptability institution market structure national economy concern order allow appropriate adjustment mechanism function, redress relative deterioration cost competitiveness. there case last real growth differential reflect welcome catching-up processes, rather structural deficiency countries, lead low trend output growth persistently high unemployment rates. such divergence different country independent whether country share currency, case cannot address monetary 4 bi review 49/2005 policy. country show relatively poor performance term longer-term trend real growth job creation often also whose domestic economy le flexible. for country structural reform highly advisable. measure aim strengthen product market competition, labour market flexibility thus job creation would certainly welcome. they would enhance incentive firm invest real human capital offer new jobs. close monitor unit labour cost wage moderation also, cases, essential reduce excessively high unemployment. the successful structural measure are, job create current wage level le wage moderation thus need long run. however, sector area qualification unemployment high and/or competitiveness domestic worker threatened, wage moderation, important support job creation, thus consumption demand. let stress type measure - reform wage moderation - support employment even rather close economy. of course, measure would tend also enhance external competitiveness, positive effect depend latter channel. sometimes radically different equilibrate mechanism suggested. it argue euro area country experience relatively weak aggregate demand increase wage strongly order ensure high demand domestic goods. this would, however, counterproductive. high real wage unit labour cost area unemployment high would undermine job creation thus reduce demand supply even further. of course, full employment reached, real wage grow line productivity increases. all country economy benefit substantially emu a i speak mannheim, let emphasise economy credible currency euro germany benefit substantially integration euro area. the euro credible stable deutsche mark it. the purchase power german worker consumer enhance relatively cheap import country within europe beyond. employment support strong export growth, least euro area eu trade partners. market interest rate thus finance cost maintain previous low level historically low levels. the fact economy inflation somewhat low euro area average time see disadvantage. it support purchase power consumers, reflection increase cost competitiveness production economies. the success german export offer good illustration phenomenon. some observer argue traditionally low interest rate economy suffer result emu, interest rate comparative advantage relative country remove convergence process introduction euro. however, fact euro area country enjoy stable prices, low inflation expectation thus low finance cost also beneficial economy germany, least enhance trade financial integration. on top elimination exchange risk within euro area also beneficial euro area country include traditionally low interest rate economy past suffer lot materialisation risks. conclusion let conclude presentation come back subject conference. i explain today emu credible monetary policy benefit euro area country create great opportunity dynamic economy job creation. a good monetary policy necessary achieve lot - cannot, alone, guarantee full success. other condition also necessary. one cannot stress enough high degree competition function market economy crucial precondition job creation, high real wage and, generally, high live standards. law institution hind competition exist firm entry new competitor thus effective work market mechanism tend support excess prices, income profit sector protected. of course, cost protection bear consumer form overly high price unemployed form few opportunity new jobs. however, competitiveness firm great importance economies. in addition, need enhance function labour market provide incentive invest human capital order ensure “competitiveness labour”. bi review 49/2005 5 a single currency identical policy rate across euro area certain sense also enhance possibility good compare economic performance member state draw lesson national experience term economic structure policies. a single monetary policy imply last divergence unemployment level real growth trend cause predominantly different economic structure economic policy individual countries. moreover, income level easily compare across country use currency. monetary union thus make easy citizen identify best practice countries. this benchmarking benefit citizen euro area - much way consumer benefit increase competition firm form high quality and/or le expensive products. good promise practice policy good identify widely implemented, le successful ill-designed economic policy easy recognise. i fully aware easy implement structural reform consolidate government budget fact public opinion sometimes fully convince everybody would benefit reforms. the ecb, part, lecture anybody, consider part necessary process awareness raising, tireless explanation. we need explain citizen europe policy enhance competition, competitiveness flexibility contribute high employment ultimately improve prospect real wage developments, growth consolidation government budgets. 6 bi review 49/2005 tharman shanmugaratnam: build financial bridge asia middle east luncheon address mr tharman shanmugaratnam, minister education deputy chairman monetary authority singapore, inaugural asia-middle east dialogue, singapore, 21 june 2005. * * * your excellency distinguish guest friends, privilege address today important gathering, discus way strengthen tie two regions, asia middle east - two region world immense potential potential shape other’s future better. let use opportunity talk bridge build financial services, financial flow help shape inter-dependence middle east asia. i also touch education together, education build trust last relationship peoples. financial bridge asia middle east - economic underpinnings the economic underpinnings financial flow two region many way obvious. both asia middle east region upward trajectory economic growth. the economy asia middle east grow trend rate 7.5% 5% respectively. to put historical perspective - region world saw sustain growth exceed 5% period middle last century, except australia new zealand 19th century. no one expect growth linear continue unbroken, either asia middle east. there bump along journey, sometimes flash floods, sometimes cave-in. but basic trajectory upward. the growth story see aberration, flash pan growth asia middle east recede modest norm see much economic history world war ii. growth propel fundamentals. first, region abundance natural resources, benefit natural interplay industrialization demand natural resources. asia’s industrialization alone drive unprecedented global demand raw materials, energy commodities. china india alone contribute 35% increase global oil demand last 15 years. yes, huge inefficiency energy use, concern environment, address long. but basic interplay industrialization natural resource continue many year come. further, region open global markets, develop domestic demand economies. they diversifying, growth become balanced. asia reduce dependence manufacture export main driver growth, middle east seek reduce dependence energy exports. both region strengthen social, transport economic infrastructure diversify economies. the example around us, like india indonesia’s major energy transport infrastructure plans, bahrain’s financial harbour project, qatar’s education city. finally, appetite prosperity unshakeable among young generations. young people across region see economic growth brings, family themselves, communities. whether quest material spiritual fulfilment, young people know instinctively economic growth good job help fulfil needs. they want move ahead, educate themselves, give whole community pride achieve - science, business culture. these aspiration young probably big positive regions. they also bring u together long haul. bi review 47/2005 1 high save increasingly intermediate within asia middle east on financial side things, fundamental also solid regions. first, supply save asia middle east high region world. save rate asia expect remain region 35-40% gdp year come. likewise save middle east rise past decade expect average 32% gdp come years. (in 2004, current account surplus percentage gdp asia middle east 6% 14% respectively.) with asian official foreign currency reserve exceed us$ 2 trillion, middle east oil revenue top us$ 180 billion 2004 alone, management surplus save reserve region offer large business opportunities. it also offer scope share experience government investment agency central bank regions. besides official savings, also grow number wealthy individual two regions. asia alone estimate 2.3 million high net worth individual (hnwi; people least us$ 1 million financial assets), far behind u 2.7 million europe 2.6 million. asian hnwis control estimate us$ 7.2 trillion financial assets. the size group asia grow 7% per year, second middle eastern hnwi, 300,000 grow 9% per year. traditionally, asian middle eastern investor look developed, western market meet investment needs. but increasingly, look diversify asset globally. it interest new story, begin unfold asian markets. this post-9/11 story. increasingly, wealthy investor world look spread risk enhance overall return investment portfolios. we see search diversification improve return investment amongst sophisticate investor middle east asia. it provide opportunity market asia middle east offer wealthy investor high expect return acceptable risk. the demand side financial equation two region equally compelling. first, unprecedented demand fund finance infrastructure projects, across region. in southeast asia alone, us$ 461 billion expect spend next 15 year upgrade infrastructure. this even look china india. likewise middle east - reconstruction iraq qatar’s infrastructural plan expect cost us$ 100 billion. second, besides infrastructure finance, see huge growth potential consumer finance sector two regions. it drive rapidly expand middle-class, want good housing, car big-ticket item like middle class anywhere else world. for instance, india’s “consuming class” rise current 30% household 40% 2010. similarly china, “middle class” set double next 5 years. facilitate great financial flow asia middle east financial service therefore grow rapidly asia middle east. and scope great deployment save within two regions, investor region look improve returns. we see begin fruitful meaningful relationship financial sector cooperation. there much scope regional financial centre like singapore kuala lumpur provide gateway fund flow middle east asia. singapore mean complete financial centre middle east. that role play financial centre middle east. but complement work partnership financial centre middle east, asian centre like kl. we provide gateway take middle eastern investor southeast asia china, take investor region middle east. what facilitate spur financial tie build sturdy bridges? allow make three observations. first, wealth management industry play pro-active role help investor diversify portfolio introduce opportunity asia middle east. in doing, also help asian middle eastern capital market grow become deep liquid. we already see asset manager base singapore receive investment mandate investment agency middle east. and singapore’s capitaland middle eastern-owned arcapital bank recently set property fund aim invest japanese real estate, target asset size us$ 300 million. 2 bi review 47/2005 second, similarly bank sector. i expect see middle east bank financial institution set singapore asia go forward, counter-flow middle east time. some middle east bank already plan scale presence singapore service middle eastern entity interest operate asia, well help asian corporates operate middle east. there similar plan singapore-based financial institution step profile middle east seek tap middle eastern financial flows. such plan may give add impetus singapore conclude ftas middle eastern countries, include currently ongoing qatar kuwait. third, islamic finance area show considerable promise globally. we know size market - around us$ 200 us$ 300 billion globally, grow 15% per annum. effort make asian markets, grow islamic financial services. for example, malaysia award islamic bank licence foreign player encourage subsidiarisation islamic bank windows. it aim 20% total bank asset islamic 2010. singapore, international financial centre, also keen offer islamic financial services. we must, part comprehensive suite financial service offer global investor borrowers. shariah-compliant financial instrument allow issuer tap new source fund liquidity. but development islamic financial service market serve indigenous muslim populations. malaysia, instance, successfully launch global sukuk, islamic bonds, tap liquidity investor asia middle east. other issuer global sukuks also stop singapore road show tap singapore’s investor pool. it may long singapore corporate issue sukuk raise fund global investors. we also see already private fund manager asia middle east work together. recently, instance, ara asset management base singapore work partnership dubai islamic bank launch us$ 450 million islamic far eastern real estate fund underlie asset locate asia. fourth finally, foster people-to-people interaction financial sector. for instance, asian central bank include monetary authority singapore participate actively middle east finance central bank seminar share perspective issue mutual interest. tomorrow seminar organise jointly islamic financial service board islamic development bank tomorrow kuala lumpur develop 10-year master plan islamic financial service industry globally. in singapore, ma conduct course bank supervision capital market extend invitation asian middle eastern counterpart participate in. we must think many platform vehicle could facilitate people-to-people interactions, include involve think-tanks, universities, train institutes, private sector financial body like association bank example. there also financial stability dimension networks. a cross-border financial transaction increase, effective supervision require country foster great cooperation regulatory counterparts. the monetary authority singapore, example, discussion conclude mous uae’s emirate security commodity authority qatar’s financial centre regulatory authority provide train supervisory cooperation. i highlight early investment agency two region manage sizeable foreign reserves. there much scope investment agency touch base other, exchange knowledge global markets, share late reserve management techniques, help navigate one another’s regional hinterland appropriate. we could even co-invest specific investment opportunity arise. build educational bridge finally, remark education, bring young people together. we know much education matters, societies. it bedrock human development, mean whole society realise potential. but significance education address issue strengthen tie asia middle east. our long historical ties, go back 2nd century b.c., asset. singapore’s arab lineage run veins. but build bridge people 21st century, look back historical tie roots, rekindle reinvigorate tie trade. we work young. our young today grow know little bi review 47/2005 3 other. we give opportunity meet, find resonance other, strike friendships. if people young, build trust future. and trust make economic business relationship last. singapore, kuala lumpur asian city play grow role regard. for year now, create call “global schoolhouse” singapore. today, singapore 66,000 international student pursue different level education. at university level, today 16 best global institution provide programme diverse areas. top business school insead university chicago establish campus singapore. at singapore universities, already small middle eastern presence, 10 undergraduate 16 postgraduate student middle eastern country (including turkey, jordan uae). for come academic year, 31 iranian graduate student offer a*star international graduate scholarships, pursue master’s degree study nu ntu area biomedical sciences, physical science engineering. (the scholar select top iranian universities, include sharif university technology, university tehran, shiraz university isfahan university technology.) recently, al-azhar university, harvard equivalent islamic education, announce help singapore develop centre islamic learning. establish 988 ad, al-azhar old operate university world. it collaborate islamic religious council singapore (muis) run programme likely range introductory post-graduate course islamic studies. we bring student together formal degree courses, summer schools. middle eastern family come singapore holiday health services, young go school. middle eastern youth find singapore friendly, multicultural multi-religious city. they find english language environment educational programme combine best east west. they find friend singapore, southeast asia, china india. a area potential collaboration teacher train education research. for example, national institute education appoint abu dhabi educational zone uae advise set teacher train institute. we able exchange train material officials, well collaborate innovative project education. each initiative may small. but add soft infrastructure network create asia middle east, build endure economic business ties. conclusion to conclude, let say financial centre region play important role catalyse cross-regional flow savings, create multiplier effect asia middle east growth investment. we must also establish strengthen people-to-people links, contribute others’ effort develop financial sector skill build management capacity. and must start young, bring together, help dispel stereotype other, understand difference find share common. i suspect share far common generation them. amed provide vehicle jumpstart process. i hope potential area cooperation i highlight throw ideas, financial sector panel session late today well field education. thank you. 4 bi review 47/2005 mark w olson: revisit traditional path ownership remark mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, community development policy summit: explore benefit challenge ownership society, federal reserve bank cleveland, cleveland, ohio, 23 june 2005. * * * i’m please today discus benefit challenge ownership society. meet policy summit extremely useful forum exchange idea work toward common goals. and, goal u involve community development change years. we want create healthy, sustainable local economy provide good jobs, decent housing, educational opportunity everyone. at core community development activity understand individual ownership one important component economic social success, whether form purchase home investment education small business. immigrant instinctively understand america ownership society and, fact, come search ownership opportunity increase well-being family member home. immigrant community often create economies, establish relationship necessary support one another find work, start small businesses, pursue education, purchase homes. this model work generation newcomer unite states. it exemplify group find formula success base skills, culture, community norms. for many years, community development effort stymie federal policy provide one-size-fits-all program - focus house - community different needs. over last thirty year learn missteps. we understand effective community development involve comprehensive approach focus provide housing, also create program increase residents’ capacity make economic contribution community. such program would support entrepreneurs, provide job training, facilitate service transportation child care. federal policy design recognize importance local participation formulate neighborhood development strategies. successful strategy take account unique attribute neighborhood, include skill labor force, exist businesses, economic synergies, culture norm community. a federal policy evolved, role shift sole source fund direct appropriation provide tax incentive credit enhancement encourage private investment offset risk. the federal government also play important role create incentive private investment, encourage innovation, protect consumers. federal policy, properly implemented, smooth path ownership ensure market operate efficiently. in remarks, i discus two traditional reliable path ownership society: homeownership entrepreneurial pursuits. i offer view critical establishment ownership society change federal regulation policy time keep path ownership open minority lower-income individuals. homeownership own home one tried-and-true path wealth accumulation economy. the purchase home transform experience individual families. however, take payment put people path lead ownership. borrower must able sustain loan long term. part sustain loan pick right loan. over past several years, explosion new novel mortgage products, include mortgage allow homeowner skip mortgage payment (which result increase size mortgage balance) mortgage allow homeowner pay interest loan, principal, preset period begin life mortgage loan. many product useful financial tool homebuyers and, indeed, may help make homeownership accessible households. but extent new mortgage product promote homebuying decision bi review 47/2005 1 premise unrealistic rate home appreciation, raise concerns. some borrower may able sustain loan long time horizon pace home price growth moderates. in particular, payment novel mortgage adjust upward, homebuyer may able refinance mortgage unless home increase value. homebuyers need understand risk thus financial education, well payment, key ingredient create solid foot path homeownership. federal tax policy long promote homeownership offer homeowner mortgage interest deduction. study show benefit homeownership worth investment. homeowner stakeholder communities. they become involve citizen create quality life character define neighborhood.1 because benefits, federal policy recent year focus increase homeownership rate among segment society, minority low-income individuals, homeownership previously low. in late 1970s, congress pass two law that, together, change market dynamic home mortgage lender expand access home loan minority lower-income individuals. these laws, home mortgage disclosure act (hmda) community reinvestment act (cra) increase access homeownership make mortgage market transparent. congress enact hmda two assumptions. one mortgage market work efficiently information publicly available. indeed, data use identify credit demand underserved area unmet credit need might otherwise overlooked. the analysis conclusion draw data also encourage establishment partnership lender community organization meet credit needs. the second, perhaps familiar assumption upon hmda base regulator need data order improve compliance enforcement fair lend consumer protection laws. accordingly, hmda data first reference point fair lend examination conduct federal reserve bank regulators. the data help identify potential fair lend issue institution regulate federal reserve supervisory agencies. the recent amendment regulation c, hmda’s implement regulation, build theme transparency breed efficiency markets. the amendment require public disclosure price information form spread annual percentage rate loan rate treasury security comparable maturity. this rule design ensure data continue provide mean improve market efficiency, well monitor legal compliance fair lend laws. the new data offer public supervisory agency charge enforce fair lend law good screen tool previously available. thus, examination resource deploy strategically data allow agency determine, advance, lender loan product may require scrutiny. but, important, new data ensure marketplace develop changes, interest party information need ensure comprehensive fair lend reviews. in addition statute require collection public data mortgage lending, congress see fit promote market efficiency enact statute, cra, require federal regulator evaluate depository institution help meet credit need communities. the statute amend 1989 require evaluation make public. the public evaluation cra

strategic 1 see william m. rohe, shannon van zandt, george mccarthy (2001), the social benefit cost homeownership: a critical assessment research,(170 kb pdf) (cambridge: joint center house study harvard university). 2 bi review 47/2005 plan - characteristic institution neighborhood serf consider assign performance rating. when cra rule revise 1995, agency commit review 2002 ensure continue effectiveness. the review process take much long anticipated, progress made. the federal reserve, together office comptroller currency federal deposit insurance corporation, currently review comment joint proposal amend cra regulations. these amendment would eliminate data-reporting burden institution $1 billion assets, provide new evaluation method institution $250 million $1 billion assets, effectively define community development rural areas. in propose change cra, agency attempt balance compliance burden place small community bank community development need geographic area serve. the proposal design relieve data-collection burden smaller, large bank retain incentive institution participate community development activities. the propose community development test intend promote substance form give small institution recognition activity meet community development need without dictate whether activity form loan, investment, service. this flexibility intend help institution size category resource engage wide range investment activities, compete fairly large financial institutions. the proposal also attempt resolve persistent problem bank operate rural area census tract tend middle-income may contain distinct pocket lower-income individuals. although financial institution receive credit cra activity primarily serve low- moderate-income individual geographies, homogeneous nature rural census tract make credit activity difficult. in fact, 15 percent rural census tract classify low- moderate-income tracts, almost 60 percent rural county single low- moderate-income tract. the proposal suggest several alternative define constitute underserved rural area agency still review comment work determine alternative would best define type community development activity earn cra credit. anyone involve community development recognize importance hmda cra. these law design make mortgage market transparent, largely succeeded. since enactment, lender find line business previously tapped. new partnership establish lender community organization meet credit need identify use hmda data. in general, story positive community lender alike. still, challenge remain. at time regulatory policy encourage lender serve previously underserved individuals, technological advance loan-underwriting process allow lender price risk efficiently, expand access mortgage credit. this expansion occur largely subprime market positive negative effects. today, data show record high homeownership rate among low-income minority borrowers, yet report lend abuse increase foreclosure rate loom dark cloud otherwise bright horizon. even though subprime mortgage delinquency generally falling, default foreclosure associate mortgage may adversely affect neighborhoods. thus, encourage technology increase efficiency mortgage market, small yet significant segment market problem persist cannot ignored. foreclosure rate area increase dramatically since early 1990s - time frame subprime market experience rapid growth. a know, foreclosure affect borrower lose home; affect entire community. multiple foreclosure one neighborhood bring property value homeowner neighborhood. in addition, foreclosure cause negative consequence eventually affect even qualify borrower approve good loan responsible lenders. this phenomenon threaten continue viability homeownership path ownership society seek establish lower-income individuals. a regulator, i believe important tread lightly response market inefficiencies. predatory lend serious problem need address way preserve incentive responsible subprime lender worthy borrower imperfect credit become bi review 47/2005 3 homeowners. constrict market pinpoint might consider predatory lend return situation borrower limit access credit ideal solution. we want encourage, limit, mortgage lend responsible lender low- moderate-income markets. in effort provide proper incentive still protect consumer high-cost mortgage market, 1994 congress enact home owner equity protection act (hoepa). hoepa help curb predatory lend require disclosure limitation loan term home mortgage loan rate fee certain percentage amount. after series hearings, board 2002 extend scope hoepa regulations. by make high-cost loan illegal, rather mandate special consumer protection loans, market continue meet credit need higher-risk borrowers. periodic review regulation hoepa, hmda, cra essential maintain regulatory framework relevant dynamic marketplace. i believe change hoepa thresholds, together new hmda price data cra adjustment - whatever final form - continue provide depository institution incentive serve market fully possible build opportunity homeownership. entrepreneurship federal policy evolve area housing, also area economic development. i strike remark congresswoman stephanie tubbs-jones small business development conference sponsor federal reserve bank cleveland may 2002. she describe mission congress create jobs. have work capital hill many years, i tell outlook common among elect official thirty year ago. the understand sustainable community dependent creation good job availability decent, affordable house is, i believe, relatively new construct political discourse. economic development commonly understand essential component successful community development strategies. a role large industrial manufacture firm overall economy declines, small business become critical create job economic growth. in fact, small business administration report small business employ half private-sector employee and, importantly, generate 60 80 percent new job annually last decade. in ohio, small business proprietors’ income 2003 increase 10 percent, $22.3 billion 2002 $24.5 billion 2003. with number like these, easy understand economic development small business growth also open door ownership society. good job decent wage benefit provide basis upon individual begin save invest. an essential build block economic development investment, private investment provide enough capital stimulate economic growth community, public/private partnership become necessary. federal policy also help set stage last economic development establish fair transparent regulatory system. federal, state, local government promote economic development provide access capital offer various finance option new emerge businesses. in addition, financial institution community-based organization provide capital firm qualify programs. federal, state, local government also provide valuable technical assistance small businesses. provider advisory service offer business owner wide array programs, include business plan development, market strategy design, management strategy growth. at federal level, sba cosponsor small business development center offer several program provide valuable resource small business develop grow. the sba report last year 2.44 million entrepreneur receive business counsel technical assistance one agency’s advisory train programs. the department commerce’s minority business development agency (mbda) another example federal initiative support economic development. it create specifically foster establishment growth minority business provide fund network business development resource center throughout country provide minority entrepreneur one-on-one assistance. mbda recognize minority-owned business sector present huge growth opportunity, minority population expect grow 30 percent current 4 bi review 47/2005 population 50 percent year 2050. nonetheless, mbda recognize minority account 30 percent population, minority firm constitute 15 percent business employ 4 percent nation’s employees, generate 3 percent u.s. business revenues. these number reflect fact minority-owned business tend non-asset-based industries, service, construction, finance, real estate, insurance. mbda belief minority continue face systemic barrier access capital markets, agency dedicate remove impediments. the federal reserve also recognize importance information share create infrastructure support information flow. consistent mission promote economic growth, federal reserve promote small-business development, particularly underserved markets, community affair offices. these offices, locate federal reserve district around country, provide technical assistance, host workshop conferences, publish newsletter reports, sponsor research help educate market participants. for example, last fall community affair office federal reserve bank cleveland partner federal reserve bank new york, state local government, financial institution convene conference title “big idea small businesses.” conference ohio pennsylvania provide important information establish develop business well demystify lend experience entrepreneurs. all effort part government agency - whether federal, state, local - goal stimulate self-sustaining process economic development create good job lead upward mobility. most successful entrepreneur see opportunity context skill particular need community market identify. the exact recipe success one place determine government agency, community itself, government act supportive partner. conclusion in closing, i believe progress make policymakers field community development last thirty year remarkable. community development practitioner always understand value ownership build sustainable communities; however, public policy design flexibility nuance good achieve goal homeownership small-business ownership. community development strategy plant seed community grow help government private-sector provider capital promise even successful long term. i look forward hear idea suggestion come conference continue refine policy meet challenge ahead. bi review 47/2005 5 t t mboweni: south africa - land hope opportunity remark mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, anc breakfast meeting, johannesburg, 22 june 2005. * * * lady gentleman distinguish guest thank invite morning say word two south african economy. when i receive invitation morning, number question arise mind. the primary one whether governor central bank speak occasion organise political organisations. it vex question require serious answer. central bank governor demonstrate time commitment independence central bank political influence. in fact central bank independence also mean rebut attempt anyone include market participant influence decision interfere operational work. at time, central bank governor engage extensive communication markets, general population, government parliaments. so opportunity communicate seriously consider time permits, entertain whether political party, market participant organisation reputable. so political organisation wish invite function welcome so. we negotiate time. it background i accept invitation morning. south africa still much country transition. it country many hope opportunities. firstly, political system maturing. most certainly, political system entrench democratic value systems. people stand election within party - sometimes squabble badly privately medium endeavour elected, avail candidate local council chambers, provincial legislature national parliament. debate generally develop robustness. more often acrimoniously so. not place weak! secondly medium - fourth estate - lively mature too. public official private executive closely scrutinise check performance good corporate governance stand order move country forward. the medium question exposes. sometimes approach certainly questionable whole make good contribution society. there room improvement particularly financial journalism - matter attend journalism schools. but open democratic society

water, good public schools, good health services, good road streets, include traffic light work, safety security, employment opportunities, fairness justice system rest. there demand delivery everywhere. the public authority private company keep check time. our society move ahead indeed. of course demand socio-economic need also come responsibility care look “delivered”. how far economy concerned? how globalisation affect south african economy society? a know, south african economy primarily dependent gold diamond mine together agriculture many years. many african people drive land live peasant pastoralists mines, emerge factories, agriculture domestic service combination political repression, land dispossession yes, taxation. in 1960s, south african economy increasingly become industrialise service oriented. of course scourge colour bar society workplace use major instrument racialise everything. agriculture mine together contribute 20.4% gross domestic product (gdp). in 1990s decline 11.3%. today mine contribute 7.8% agriculture 3.6%. this major change structural make economy. the secondary sector contribute 27.8% gdp 1960s. although decline somewhat 24% currently, nevertheless testimony economy remain highly industrialised. another major change economy occur service sector. in 1960s, sector contribute 51.8% gdp today account 64%. again major structural change economy. clearly, mine agriculture major “losers” developments. but let u make mistake abandon sector still two-thirds gold grind still many viable mineral deposit country still fee agricultural activities. oh way: food come pick ‘n pay agriculture! sometimes people forget this. the structural change mining, agriculture extent manufacture economy heavily dominate service sector major implication job market. it mean skill require service sector much high case previously. many people make observation consequence bantu education system severely felt time past. there doubt one critical area focus south africa moment foreseeable future education broadly human resource development. this strategic nature. we focus provide resource train people area extreme need side side general education. we need engineers, accountants, pilots, course lawyers, actuaries, doctors, nurses, scientist specialise technical skill increasingly service sector drive economy. and i forget economists! mathematics education fundamental this. alongside structural change economy process global integration south african economy. whilst 1960s mainly extractive economy, 1990s south african economy fairly integrate broadly world economy. with sanction way, import export good service amount 44% economy. currently increase 55.6%. the manufacture sector, despite challenge time time saw export rise 29.6% 1990s 37.9% period 2000-2004. one notable feature globalisation south african economy find bank sector. south african bank percentage gdp average 77% period 1965-1994. in 2004, share gdp south african bank 109%. the equity market average r2 billion period 1970 1985., r21 billion per year period 1986-1993, annual turnover equity market r62 billion 1994 2004, annual turnover r1 trillion. market capitalisation jse increase annual average r40 billion period 1970-1980 r2 trillion 2004. 2 bi review 47/2005 further compel evidence globalisation find performance bond market. between 1970 1985, turnover market r8 billion, 1995 increase r2.3 trillion year 2004 turnover r8.4 trillion. finally foreign exchange market interest many people also see remarkable evidence globalisation. to cut long story short, 1987 average daily turnover market 1.1 billion u dollar course 2005 average daily turnover market 12 billion u dollars. so lot activity go there. the conclusion i come cop well globalisation. we see benefit yes also cost impact globalisation gold mine sector. let conclude say remarkable achievement two area i closely focus part job. this inflation budget management south africa. inflation far contain within inflation target. the government’s budget management example many country throughout world record budget deficit borrow le three percent gdp consistently. progress indeed made. the hope opportunity characterise south africa make happy south african historic juncture development humankind. president mandela remark somewhere ‘the sun never set glorious human achievement’ i agree that. i thank you. bi review 47/2005 3 jean-claude trichet: reflection international financial system speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, bundesbank lecture, berlin, 21 june 2005. * * * it honour invite give year’s bundesbank lecture address distinguish audience. it particular pleasure speak berlin, symbolise city historic peaceful re-integration europe. i would therefore like extend warm gratitude president axel weber board bundesbank invitation berlin evening. in lecture, i try take stock look ahead challenge economy face today, focus challenge global financial integration international financial system, architecture functioning. in view, international financial integration state international financial system far le abstract topic one might think first glance. they reflect one complex, intrigue powerful aspect phenomenon generally refer globalisation. this phenomenon represent key issue policy-makers europe beyond deal with. it therefore utmost importance understand significance issue role economic policy-makers, background i would like reflect international financial integration international financial system today. policy-makers often face specific concern economic uncertainty risk instability, need address concerns. monetary policy also play part. we create stable currency 307 million people. we create confidence currency. we anchor inflation expectation below, close to, 2%. we ensure monetary stability continent. in way, policy contribute address challenge future. they boost confidence ensure opening-up border turn something ultimately worthwhile term economic development institutional cooperation. in reflection today i describe recent development international financial system shape institutional setup system recent years. i turn current challenge face international community europe, implication challenges. international financial integration the clear example global economic integration trade, certainly true country. the label “made germany” recognise world stand high quality. but international trade process one party gains. each export correspond import, economy benefit mutually other. many good buy euro area make countries, far away consumers. transport cost decreased, technology become universal, information readily available low cost, taste converging. during last three decade tariff halve 230 trade agreement various country enter force. all development result steady open market europe worldwide. in early 1970s global export account one tenth world gdp, increase one quarter world gdp today. this reflection dramatic deepen global economic interlinkages recent years. in view, important bear mind regional trade integration hind global integration, fact one efficient way foster it. there also recent phenomenon le visible, even dynamic, namely global financial integration. by i mean integration local national financial market unify international financial market. only decade ago, realisation investment project largely contingent availability capital local economy. today opportunity raise finance well invest capital truly global. the substantial number bilateral investment bi review 47/2005 1 treaty liberalisation capital account encourage cross-border investment.1 while 1970s 80% country restrict access foreign capital, today 60% develop country industrialise country capital account still le closed.2 in 1970s, worldwide cross-border hold asset amount one tenth world gdp. since then, cross-border capital flow steadily increased, country accumulate foreign asset amount equivalent annual gdp entire world. in 2003, euro area resident hold foreign capital total value 7.6 trillion euro, figure somewhat high euro area’s annual gdp. but financial integration also intrinsically link real economy. over past 30 years, annual foreign direct investment (or fdi) worldwide grow around 8.5 billion euro (10 billion u dollars) almost one thousand billion euro (about 1200 billion u dollars). the value foreign-owned company around world - stock fdi - equal annual gdp euro area. take together, company would make economy approximately one third size euro area. each year produce good service value equivalent german gdp employ one half time german workforce. for europe, international linkage particular importance. european corporate business among dynamic world, provide half world fdi. at time, half world fdi invest europe.3 foreign-owned company contribute 10% 20% euro area gdp.4 a consequence, relationship euro area global economy today characterise financial linkage trade. we policy-makers aware linkage powerful fast transmission mechanism shocks. the benefit integration obvious - great variety good downward pressure price benefit consumer households. but benefit even substantial, production require human financial capital. a skilled workforce cannot unleash full potential without financial capital. europe’s impressive economic recovery world war ii would inconceivable without integration global economy concentration high-quality exports. today, many asian economy benefit global economic integration. investment appropriate technology enable country compete world market increase welfare substantially. this mean phenomenon appear national accounts. income disparity across world decline significantly.5 not surprisingly, benefit financial integration particularly clear open economies, record high average growth rate recent years.6 how ass recent development international financial system? we realise benefit outweigh costs. but cost adjustment, often front-loaded concentrate specific region sectors, need take consideration. the change structure global economy also require structural adjustment make local economies. we know ability country benefit global financial integration much depend quality institutional structural environment. all economies, include advance ones, euro area, adapt change need world economy. the european economy undergo continue undergo substantial structural changes, necessary beneficial secure europe’s place global economy. this structural adjustment continue major phenomenon come years. 1 accord unite nation commission trade development (unctad) bilateral investment treaty database, number bilateral investment treaty rise 1990s around

sustainability global financial integration. they argue financial integration go far, market turnover reach level unhealthy. each day, foreign exchange transaction carry value equivalent annual gdp france. financial integration regard potential destabilise global economy. but also oppose view. this view state global financial integration contribute high growth also reduce risk global economy. it state availability finance opportunity invest crucial stabilisation economic outcomes. let give two examples. the preference investor invest local asset rather diversify internationally, know economic literature “home bias”, yet disappeared. in world without transaction information costs, country hold portfolio. each country diversify investment country relative size financial markets. this would provide best insurance shock economy world, include economy country question, time would increase return countries. during last decade country indeed reduce risk position mechanism. however, world economy still far away theoretically optimal portfolio and, yet, strong empirical evidence economic stabilisation result risk-sharing. this take indication still scope reduction risk stabilisation income.7] the second example relate fact develop country cannot yet borrow internationally local currencies, resort foreign currency. foreign currency debt make country vulnerable exchange rate movements. for example, positive effect depreciation international competitiveness may outweigh government’s high debt service foreign currency bond deteriorate economic conditions.8 recent trend domestic international financial market point develop country also improve access different type finance. therefore, development integration financial market may contribute stabilisation economic outcome countries, would also benefit industrial economy trade partners. overall, i consider recent development international financial integration welcome, reflect trend towards efficient allocation resource and, way, support growth promote welfare global economy. they benefit recipient economies, also country origin, facilitate international risk share participation return abroad. however, rapid integration financial market across border without new risks. these risk include adverse market dynamics, unwarranted spillovers, challenge international financial stability. and bring second part

governance, require solid institutional foundation policies. these institutional foundations, often refer international financial architecture system, help prevent adverse financial pressure deal arises.9 therefore, key question policy-makers whether international financial architecture present sufficiently well-equipped deal task, whether adjust sufficiently fast ongoing change international financial integration. 7 bend e. sørensen, yi-tsung wu, oved yosha yu zhu: “home bias international risk sharing: twin puzzle separate birth”, 2005. 8 barry eichengreen ricardo hausmann: “other people’s money: debt denomination financial instability emerge market economies”, the university chicago press, chicago, 2005. 9 with regard international financial architecture, see example p. kenen, the international financial architecture: what’s new? what’s missing?, november 2001. bi review 47/2005 3 these clearly trivial questions, definite answer give benefit hindsight. it easy count crisis occurred, impossible count averted. however, without forget necessary note caution, i consider adjustment implement international financial system aftermath asian financial crisis altogether sufficiently important constitute system significantly different one prevail crisis. indeed, i would classify change implement international financial architecture since asian crisis major ones. let expand hypothesis. the asian crisis indeed severe. it estimate 600 billion dollars’ worth national income lose within first year crisis (1997-98).10 it important realise significant weakness various national financial system lack market orientation root crisis. these weakness include balance sheet mismatches, bank sector vulnerabilities, inadequate supervision. the asian crisis trigger shift market sentiment lead massive reversal capital flows.11 this change market sentiment spread rapidly across region, regions, make contagion major factor development crisis. with hindsight turn national authority international institution insufficiently aware risk perhaps also insufficiently equip deal materialised. the subsequent diagnosis origin crisis expose three major shortcomings: first, considerable information gap authorities, financial market participant international community; second, insufficient attention financial sector issue macroeconomic surveillance; third, inadequate involvement emerge country international fora. these shortcoming address recent years, lead important change approach international financial institutions, national authority market participants. the main thrust change strengthen market orientation improve international financial architecture. let briefly discus three set change turn. first, concern provision information, imf make large stride towards increase transparency recent years. the bulk bilateral consultation report publish fund push great dissemination key economic financial data. the fact that, nowadays, data foreign exchange reserves, external debt, balance payment flow well key data reliable available little lag important part transition towards market-led international financial system.12 it allow market participant price value risk regard particular borrower reliable effective fashion help stem spillover across markets. national authority also make considerable progress increase transparency, include display fiscal policy data. all major central bank make great effort increase transparency monetary policy framework consider clear communication essential effective monetary policy-making. nowadays, 15 20 major central bank publish bulletin inflation reports, often detail explanation policy decision background data. importantly, many country hit crisis recent year publish inflation reports, include mexico, korea, thailand brazil. this lead inform decision-making process markets, reduce adverse market dynamic contagion. market participant also embark process aim strengthen international financial system, include provision information. in view, important recent milestone agreement sovereign bond issuer private market participant voluntary code behaviour keep channel communication open good time facilitate collaborative solution case distress sovereign issuer, possible restructure debt. i launch idea speech washington september 2001. this agreement result “principles stable capital flow fair debt restructure emerge markets”, previously know “code conduct”, endorse end last year g20 10 javad k. shirazi: the east asian crisis: origins, policy challenges, prospects, june 1998. 11 in 1997 net private capital flow asia decline almost 100 billion dollar compare 1996. the 1996-97 swing flow asian country represent 11% gdp. 12 see t. padoa-schioppa f. saccomanni: manage market-led global financial system, p. kenen (ed.): manage world economy: fifty year after bretton woods, 1994. 4 bi review 47/2005 minister governors, meet berlin.13 we welcome fact sovereign issuer market participant develop pragmatic voluntary approach reinforce international financial system way take ownership important strengthen present financial system. the second important change since asian crisis concern focus international community financial issues, felt enough attention give financial sector surveillance. in meantime, imf bring financial sector issue forefront work, regularly include consultations. global market surveillance established, analytical tool understand crisis detection strengthened. the imf also establish so-called financial sector assessment program, aim promote soundness financial system imf’s member countries. an important part program imf’s assessment observance financial sector standard codes, endorse international community. in fact, imf produce separate report observance standard code by-product program. the imf’s nearly universal membership make well-placed carry important work, i think fact around 120 country already participate financial sector assessment program since launch 1999, plan participate it, clear evidence this. in order examine linkage financial macroeconomic stability across sector financial system global scale, financial stability forum create 1999. the purpose fsf promote international financial stability reduce risk stem international financial system. the fsf uniquely position fulfil task, member include, particular, major international financial institutions, international group set standard account regulation supervision financial institution (by i mean banks, security firm insurance companies), international committee central bank expert field financial market payment settlement systems, well executive, monetary supervisory authority major financial centres. in view, first serious attempt consider global financial system truly single system, integrate structural entity major importance institution authority - whether imf basel committee bank supervision international account standard board, instance - fully aware systemic implication orientation decisions. from standpoint, i consider financial stability forum global conceptual clear house, whose role likely important extent global financial system - drive technology globalisation - complex, universal integrated. the third shortcoming detect international financial architecture asian crisis inadequate involvement emerge country international fora. during development asian crisis, emerge market participation address set g20, saw inaugural meet berlin december 1999. the g20 establish order fully reflect new nature global economy, economy emerge economy play important role systemic standpoint. the g20 truly global forum. it enhance dissemination information bring together key industrial emerge country informal set aim reach consensus number topical issue relate international financial architecture. since establishment 1999, g20 instrumental implement standard code apply global level, lead example carry imf’s financial sector assessment program report observance standard code early stage. by now, two third imf membership participate reports, assess compliance internationally recognise standard codes. the g20 also contribute identification 12 major standards, global effort concentrating. these major standard include bank supervision, corporate governance, fiscal transparency, monetary financial policy transparency, security regulation. without kind global ownership new concept best practices, without reinforce transparency voluntary implementation principle stable capital flow fair debt restructure emerge market g20 delivered, present financial architecture would strong today. 13 see institute international finance (iif) et al., principle stable capital flow fair debt restructure emerge markets, november 2004. bi review 47/2005 5 these three major improvement - namely foster transparency major strategic driver, focus systemic conceptual approach, particular, financial stability forum, develop improve global ownership, particular, establishment g20 - contribute international financial system resilient before. the international financial system today good equip detect vulnerability deal shock 1997 1998. although success crisis prevention assess hindsight, absence international financial contagion past year important observation. one important lesson recent crisis private sector need play role crisis management. private sector involvement need order avoid moral hazard problem inherent large financial assistance provide official sector.14 furthermore, role private sector crisis management essential official support likely insufficient cover finance need crisis country time increase capital flows. there concrete achievement area private sector involvement, notably increase use collective action clause sovereign bonds. there remain number open issue international financial system need reflection. one issue role official sector crisis resolution. here, international community start emphasise importance clear rule official sector support. this do order strengthen incentive prudent risk management part policy-makers private sector investors. the imf establish framework, call exceptional access policy, large financial assistance programme set guideline order make imf lend predictable. it international community follow rules. another open issue lack clear guideline imf involvement process sovereign debt restructure event country face unsustainable debt situation. the case argentina example difficult debt restructure process, take long time complete cause uncertainty party concerned. argentina’s debt restructure process show international community still need good framework crisis resolution. authority cooperate imf international creditors. the imf, part, remain closely involve process, need take active role provide information. the imf currently undertake strategic review activities, set roadmap fund come years. in strategic review, imf contemplate measure make surveillance effective. i support recent effort put emphasis regional surveillance, order reflect strong regional focus trade pattern visible europe asia, also part world. i also support attempt review function international monetary system fund’s role it. specifically context, imf well-placed analyse issue like reserve accumulation evolution exchange rate regime emerge markets, take due account global implication. finally, important review financial position imf implication low lend activity fund’s operational budget. current macroeconomic challenge my reflection current state international financial system would incomplete without put context current global economic situation. first all, i note time complacency currently find challenge situation. the global economy expand comfortable pace, large global imbalances, actually widen recent years. these imbalance involve industrialise country whole, large aggregate current account deficit amongst them, particularly, unite states, whose current account deficit reach level see before. the increase current account recent year occur background decline national savings, turn attributable rise budget deficit household save rate fall level far zero. the finance current account deficit, call inflow magnitude around two billion u dollar every work day, take place largely asia. central bank region intervene heavily various reasons, prevent currency 14 see “managing financial crisis emerge market economies: experience involvement private sector creditors”, ecb occasional paper 32, 2005, overview instrument private sector involvement recent experience. 6 bi review 47/2005 appreciating, become large-scale purchaser u debt security recent years. while current situation rationalise observers, particular support strong growth region smooth adjustment path, clearly raise question regard sustainability recent development associate policies. japan europe also picture, japan post large current account surplus grow slowly, europe because, although balance current account, also contribute increase global growth - raise potential rate growth - thereby alleviate global imbalances. the orderly effective correction global imbalance one major goal international community. these imbalance represent major risk financial stability around world and, therefore, global growth. there individual national continental solution issue. i trust absolute need embark cooperative strategy comprise four major partners. the unite state tackle structural lack save reduce public dissaving increase household savings. europe augment growth potential structural reform order deliver growth, contribute effectively global growth. japan also increase growth potential implement structural reforms. and, fully-fledged member collective, cooperative, global endeavour, emerge asian economy would need accept orderly realignment currencies. i would underline four partner together would win strategy tackle global imbalance would also individually, them, best interest. this true china emerge asia, true america, true japan. this also true europe. we convince people structural reform necessary revitalise economy make fit global competition. moreover, enhance resilience shock inherent open economies. structural reform essential europe’s ability respond challenge arise ongoing deepen global division labour, rapid pace technological change, age population. in view, condition benefit integration there, make necessary structural adjustment full confidence long-term benefit economy. conclusion in conclusion i would like stress three points. first, view remarkable current global imbalance bring fore importance monetary exchange rate issue global economy, namely issue exchange rate configurations, reserve accumulation global liquidity. this underscore fact focus financial sector market institution issue expense macroeconomic exchange rate surveillance. this particularly true imf surveillance. second, scientific technological revolution, phenomenon globalisation structural change ongoing continents, least europe, call utmost vigilance permanent adaptation international financial architecture. we must keep constant check whether take systemic interaction various pillar international financial architecture consideration appropriate manner. much remain do regard and, i already said, time complacency. the ecb keen play role fully respect, participate actively g7, g20 financial stability forum, fully dedicate g10 group governors, also calling, necessary, larger, comprehensive, systemic view number important fields. for instance, suggest additional consideration financial stability context international account standard board, do satisfaction. third, work also remain do achieve full inclusiveness emerge economy economy transition international financial architecture. the g20, i said, emblematic illustration new feature, overdue. in field central banking, global economy meet gather central bank governor systemic industrialise emerge economy world another major example new inclusive handle issue systemic global. thank attention. bi review 47/2005 7 caleb m fundanga: investment opportunity zambian real estate business - role bank zambia paper present dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, international conference investment opportunity zambia - integrate african property markets, lusaka, 15 june 2005. * * * • the chairperson • distinguish guest • lady gentleman i feel greatly honour invite talk theme, “investment opportunity zambian real estate business: the role bank zambia.” from outset i wish express sincere gratitude business week organise important conference. you agree conference is, perhaps, first kind solely organise private sector look specifically issue investment zambian real estate sector. a may aware, investment real estate sector critical economic well country, since economic growth alone insufficient translate development, reflect good live standard include provision quality adequate infrastructure, as, real estate. real estate define include physical property bare land own individual organisation freehold non-freehold tenure. however, purpose discussion afternoon, i use term real estate mean physical property. my discussion therefore, structure follows: i. first, i look contribution zambian real estate sector gross domestic product (gdp) zambia. during discussion issue, i also look characteristic zambian real estate finance sector; ii. secondly, i explain role bank zambia real estate sector. lady gentleman in zambia, share real estate sector increase average 6.8% 1995 1999 9.4% 2000 2004. this welcome development, show real estate business contribute positively real gdp growth last six years. however, i strongly believe sector perform even good this, especially people good affordable accommodation, evidence emergence large unplanned residential areas. this challenge expert real estate business facilitate build house office accommodation reduce rental facility affordable level stem expansion unplanned residential areas. in spite growth share real estate gdp, zambian real estate finance sector still characterize inadequate long-term finance. prior 1990, sector dominate zambia national build society (znbs), follow liberalisation economy 1990s, unable meet demand real estate finance. much build society now, impact real estate finance still minimal. consequently, people construct nowadays funds. since build use meagre resources, quality structure leaf much desire project take long complete. this, part, explain mushroom shanty compound i allude earlier. what i say clearly show need new player real estate finance sector. to effect, i wish challenge private sector invest real estate finance business. have say that, role bank zambia enhance investment opportunity real estate business? a may aware, primary mission bank zambia formulate implement monetary supervisory policy ensure price financial system stability. bi review 46/2005 1 how tie real estate business? the relationship real estate business monetary policy financial system stability much debate issue among academic policy-makers, alike. the relationship bring fore important challenge involve policy design, financial regulation risk management. in zambia, however, like develop countries, difficulty quantify relationship due paucity reliable information property markets, thereby limit scope meaningful analysis input policy formulation. it therefore, critical improvement make quality real estate sector data enhance analysis policy response development sector. there doubt rate inflation still high zambia compare neighbours, like tanzania, botswana, mozambique. however, i wish assure low rate inflation within reach give government commitment fiscal discipline macroeconomic stability. it well establish high inflation (that is, ten percent) cost economic activities. this happen through: 1. increase investment costs. high persistent inflation adversely affect save mobilization economy saver would opt hedge inflation. ultimately, lead reduction availability loanable fund investments. in addition, high inflation normally associate high interest rate high interest rate inhibit borrow investment purposes, thereby slow economic growth development process; 2. rise price erode public investors’ confidence economy contribute rapid exchange rate depreciation. this lead currency substitution dollarisation, turn, reduce effectiveness monetary policy; 3. rise price also undermine country’s external competitiveness, may lead decline export earnings, thus, worsen balance payment position country; 4. rise price entrench poverty erosion peoples’ incomes, particularly fix incomes. therefore, high inflation major source concern central bank pose threat general economic development. with regard real estate sector, high inflation affect cost property. in case low income group, high inflation make real estate price unaffordable. apart inflation, financial price great concern bank zambia, especially effort stabilise macro-economy. one financial price level interest rates. interest rates, cost funds, inhibit borrow investment real estate high. inflation also affect level interest rates. to effect, low interest rate require key stakeholder play respective role effectively consistently. the government, reduce domestic borrowing, contribute low yield rate government securities, often use anchor commercial bank set interest rates. commercial bank are, part, also expect respond favourably improve macroeconomic condition consistent low interest rates, borrower need improve credit culture. a bank zambia, great contribution make low interest rate reduction inflation single digit levels. in regard, bank continue monitor financial condition take appropriate action contribute low lend interest rates. exchange rate yet another financial price stabilise effectively contribute promotion growth real estate industry, particularly substantial amount build materials, as, steel imported. an unpredictable behaviour exchange rate make investment real estate unattractive. however, follow introduction broad-based interbank foreign exchange system (ifes) july 2003, exchange rate kwacha major foreign currencies, particularly u dollar, relatively stable. the kwacha appreciate 2.6% u dollar 2004, depreciate 7.2% 2003. other factor contribute relative stability kwacha include strong performance external sector, prudent fiscal management, broad weakness u dollar international market. from behaviour exchange rate 2 bi review 46/2005 kwacha major currencies, clear that, support effective supervision, foreign exchange market participant able police instil discipline market. lady gentleman allow me, juncture, turn function bank zambia – ensure financial system stability. a may aware, financial system stability critical maintenance macroeconomic stability. a matter fact, monetary policy would effective pursue inflation objective financial system stable, monetary policy action transmit financial institutions. in regard, stable financial system play catalytic role financial institution provide financial product contribute development real estate business. therefore, enhance capacity financial institution meet challenge financing, among others, real estate sector, bank undertake lot reforms. for instance, bank’s legislative supervisory power strengthen conform liberalise financial sector. however, development active secondary financial market enhance efficiency financial system remain key challenge us. to address challenges, government approve financial sector development plan (fsdp) 2004. in come fsdp, government recognised, among weaknesses, public financial institution establish facilitate provision various financial service majority people country insolvent, therefore ineffective, close down. e.g., mortgage (znbs); agriculture lend (lima bank, co-operative bank exim bank past) and; bank service rural populace (nscb). in addition, long-term project finance remain difficult access many years. in vein, fsdp aim enhance financial intermediation efficiency financial sector, anticipate problem relate real estate finance would resolve fsdp fully functional. lady gentleman in conclusion, i wish reiterate importance real estate sector economic social development country. with contribution, stakeholder zambia could easily achieve national socio-economic goal medium term. every economic unit need service boom real estate construction sector contribute economic growth development. in regard, i trust various institution represent continue facilitate promote investment real estate sector zambia. on part bank zambia, continue facilitate real sector economic activity continue improve macroeconomic condition country critical mobilisation expansion business. in turn, expect sector economy benefit contribute accelerate economic growth development. i thank you. bi review 46/2005 3 jean-claude trichet: what effect emu euro area member country (closing remarks) close remark mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, ecb workshop “what effect emu euro area member countries”, frankfurt, 17 june 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure make close remark end stimulate conference. let first thank organiser conference excellent handle workshop extraordinary successful give lot food think us. today yesterday debate intensively economic effect create single currency – euro – increasingly integrate european single market. i doubt agree achievement term integration convergence impressive. the introduction euro help consolidate tremendous gain make process european economic integration since establishment european coal steel community (ecsc) 1951. these gain deep (covering increase number markets) wide (covering increase number countries). i also strongly believe euro continue key catalyst integration. one prominent example effect introduction euro accelerate financial integration. notably, elimination exchange rate risk among euro area country foster significantly depth breadth financial market boost financial innovation. there also evidence much close integration stock market euro area. another important example effect trade integration: evidence suggest euro stimulate trade across euro area, also rest world. the export share country outside euro area rise almost 20% gdp 2003 around 17% 1997 (a similar development record imports). it also remarkable that, possibly consequence trade financial integration, well increase degree convergence macroeconomic policies, dispersion real gdp growth rate euro area remain close historical average sign increase divergence growth rate emerge far. today, i try comprehensively review every important achievements. i would rather like highlight one them: truly impressive process inflation convergence euro area. in context, i shall address issue inflation differential within area, particular size recent evolution. i shall focus two particular issues. first, argue monetary union may contribute large specialisation production euro area. in case, need relative price adjustment inflation differential deal sectoral development may increase. i briefly discus current evidence sectoral specialisation. second, i elaborate function inflation differential emphasize importance monitor relative unit labour cost. inflation convergence euro area let remind run-up formation emu, dispersion national inflation rate lastingly reduced. in 1992 difference high low inflation rate term hipc across euro area country 13.5 percentage points. the dispersion steadily decline throughout 90s, trigger preparation emu, broadly stabilise begin stage three emu around 3.3 percentage points. since then, exception modest increase period 2000-02, level inflation dispersion across euro area change little, average standard deviation inflation differential around 1. current inflation differential within euro area unusually large. rather, magnitude similar differential see unite state among 14 u metropolitan statistical areas, namely 3.2 percentage points, average standard deviation 0.9. it emphasise monetary union inflation differential across region country natural way adjust relative price face asymmetric demand supply developments. i would like make 4 remark respect. bi review 46/2005 1 first, change relative price within single currency area large frequent anticipated. the idea euro area area single currency prevent adjustment relative price clearly refuted. for instance, capacity german economy catch rapidly average euro area term cost competitiveness loss competitiveness associate german reunification impressive. from viewpoint euro area flexible adaptable anticipate many observers. second, previous process symmetric. in case existence inflation differential natural consequence economy outperform average term cost competitiveness order progressively adjust towards normal level line average. this problem observed, instance, case netherlands possibly still relevant ireland. third, inflation differential necessary mean achieve relative price adjustment within euro area, like case germany, also natural feature euro area view gradual convergence catching-up process regard gdp per-capita. fourth, one case persistent inflation differential advisable term national economic policies: economy already relatively low level cost competitiveness continue face deterioration due high inflation. in case additional attention must give increase flexibility adaptability institution market structure national economy concern order appropriate adjustment mechanism function. sectoral specialisation euro area an interest issue touch upon last two day whether european integration process result high sectoral specialisation across countries. a mention above, potentially important high degree specialisation might imply great vulnerability asymmetric shock great need relative price adjustments. a relevance argument, two line reason economic literature. the first, support krugman (1991, 1993) new economic geography models, suggest that, trade barrier reduced, inter-industry trade increase opportunity exploit economy scale specialisation production arise whenever country comparative advantage. consequently, countries’ production structure would become le diversify thus increasingly vulnerable asymmetric shock business cycle would become le synchronised. the second, opposite, line reasoning, develop frankel rise (1998), suggest european integration would instead lead great intra-industry trade integration similar economic structures. in case, business cycle would become strongly synchronise convergence factor endowment technology, well reduce exchange rate variability, otherwise would tend weaken intra-industry trade. the evidence whether emu favour prevent specialisation euro area clear yet. accord overview publish european commission, far modest change pattern industrial concentration geographical specialisation within euro area. while production specialisation gradually increase since 1970s, export specialisation appear decreased, could partly explain increase importance intra-industry trade. similarly, study sectoral specialisation carry european system central bank 2004 find production structure euro area country relatively similar. indeed, appear homogeneous unite state relatively stable time. in contrast, host study highlight agglomeration cluster effects. they suggest agglomeration production factor (by generate environment create positive externalities, presence competitor informal link complementary businesses, supply qualify labour investment capital, proximity research capacity) increasingly important could indeed increase specialisation reduce cross-border trade within industries. at time, recent research (for example, kalemli-ozcan et al., 2003, giannone reichlin, 2005) document risk share tend increase currency union, bolster case high specialisation production. the peculiarity channel result asymmetry gdp fluctuation would translate income volatility ownership diversified. this 2 bi review 46/2005 essentially help smooth consumption across country and, therefore, limit welfare cost gdp fluctuations. overall, time span since start emu short strong empirical conclusion view effect emu specialisation consequently still difficult obtain. determinant inflation differential let turn determinant inflation dispersion euro area. a first insight possible cause inflation differential euro area gain perform inflation account exercise, break euro area inflation differentials, measure term gdp deflator, underlie determinants, namely internal factor – unit labour costs, profit margin net indirect tax – external factor – import prices. this kind analysis suggest period 1999-2003 internal factor important contributor inflation differential relative euro area average case 9 member countries, import cost play major role case 3 countries: belgium, france luxembourg. a regard internal source inflation differentials, important component explain dynamic gdp inflation dispersion unit labour costs. look unit labour cost development detail, compensation-per-employee component generally important explain inflation differentials. at time, productivity growth show relatively low level dispersion across euro area. this point relatively significant difference across country component labour compensation reflect productivity growth. in regard, part difference price development may stem difference wage developments, include inertial component wage-setting rules, cause automatic indexation clause wage prices, exist euro area countries. to extent historical inflation differential within euro area seem largely reflect difference cost development across euro area countries, i would like stress relative evolution cost competitiveness, measure instance unit labour cost, key equilibrate mechanism single currency area. conclude remark lady gentlemen, let make three remark conclusion. first, doubt mind full benefit european common market could realise without single currency. i propose simple think experiment: what would be, today, u market would different currency california texas, massachusetts wyoming? would call “achieved single market”? in perspective, single currency offer u economic benefit associate “achieved single market”. in respect, regard interest rate exchange -rate risk particular economy, “winners” “losers”. it “win-win” game …. all economies, without exception, benefit low market interest rate reflect credibility currency: true considerable additional advantage give country previously high interest rates. at time, economies, without exception, benefit elimination exchange risk within single currency area, considerable improvement, include economy already low interest rates, economy benefit much good function single market itself, also significant improvement monetary situation. it equally true germany, spain, italy. it true 12 country form euro area. the single currency area is, view, solid coherent economy partner strong advantages. second, i associate strategic concept “competitive disinflation” period previously high inflation economy, namely french economy, look effective reinforce competitiveness low production cost low inflation rather monetary devaluation. now area monetary stability fully ensured. this mean preoccupation competitiveness disappear. in new environment “competitive stability” careful examination national competitiveness indicators, like relative evolution unit labour costs, reemains important. the ecb set bi review 46/2005 3 benchmark price stability medium long term perspective - accord definition - large part economic policy remain national. in respect i said, set single currency, new monetary regime economic policy maker would substitute competitiveness indicator previous indicator like exchange rate market interest rates. third, let say extent rely research analyse structural transformation ongoing single currency area virtue fully achieve single market single currency. my intuition phenomenon extremely complex. that explain trend difficult substantiate, conjecture easily prove rejected: two effect underline krugman one hand frankel rise hand, probably operate simultaneously euro area, together universal phenomenon agglomeration clusterisation. all experience tell rapidly change world, progress science technology, globalisation process profound structural change europe simultaneous, humble front fact figure ready take board, soon produced, good research deliver i thank attention. 4 bi review 46/2005 philipp m hildebrand: develop country international capital market summary speech mr philipp m hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, economiesuisse, zurich, 14 june 2005. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * after plummet back asian crisis, capital flow develop country rise considerably last three years. in 2005, likely reach approximate level stand shortly asian crisis. capital flow channel mostly emerge markets, notably china. china’s monetary order currently undergo profound changes, country gradually liberalise capital movements. the concept “impossible trinity”, develop nobel prize winner robert mundell, assert inevitably lead either loss monetary autonomy flexibilisation exchange rate regime. both trend clearly observed: pressure fix exchange rate one hand, rapid expansion monetary credit aggregate other. in long term, china’s monetary order probably move towards float exchange rates. this transition hopefully successful. a china’s monetary policy gradual change far prove worth, likely serve example develop countries. niklaus blattner: development swiss bank sector introductory remark mr niklaus blattner, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 16 june 2005. * * * with financial stability report, swiss national bank (snb) inform public state financial system present assessment system stability. moreover, bank provide indicator may use in-depth analysis. the snb track development bank sector macroprudential, i.e. system-wide perspective. in doing, complement task swiss federal bank commission (sfbc), responsible microprudential oversight, i.e. individual institutions. the part report focus bank sector mainly highlight strain imbalance could pose threat system stability short long term. in addition, snb report activity connection oversight payment security settlement systems. this year also provide information “business continuity planning” (bcp) project, i.e. preventive measure overcome disruptions, thus strengthen operational resistance swiss financial centre. bank sector the bank sector currently stable. the stress index develop snb – indicator combine comprehensive information potential stress symptom bank industry – show strain swiss bank industry extraordinarily low compare historical average. this mainly attributable three factors. firstly, swiss bank industry find predominantly positive environment: economic activity stock market exhibit favourable development, interest rate remain low, credit stand borrower tend improve. consequently, profit bank sector remain high, case increase previous period. while satisfactory result achieve already 2003 mainly due cost-cutting measures, figure period review ascribe high operative earnings. secondly, banks’ reinforce capital resource improve sector’s resilience. the majority bank take advantage favourable environment strengthen capital base. excess capital end 2004 significantly exceed historical average. one exception, however, big banks, – despite good profit – hardly increase capital base all. the risk-weighted capital ratio relevant regulation. the big bank quite well place international standard regard. however, unweighted capital ratio use benchmark (in switzerland, subject minimum requirements), capital level big bank modest view internationally. the reason discrepancy comparatively low proportion off-balance-sheet business swiss big bank one hand, low average weight trade loan book hand. thirdly, indication – perspective – risk enter bank industry risen: market interest rate risk increase slightly aggregate level, credit risk even seem fallen. consequently, bank sector good shape moment. a far prospect near future concerned, believe macroeconomic environment financial market condition pose major threat stability swiss bank system. the outlook 2005 indicate economic growth region slow moderate pace. in addition, available indicator suggest currently little risk contagion effect cause crisis swiss bank sector. nevertheless, still potential source risk. they pertain credit risk particular. firstly, unexpectedly sharp economic downturn could serious impact quality loan portfolio stock market. secondly, witness swift economic recovery, however, sharp rise still low interest rate could also result deterioration loan portfolio. this grow interest burden would suddenly put considerable pressure household company mortgage pay off. bank would also directly affect steep interest rate hike, interest rate asset tend fix long period liabilities. in view interest rate risk take extremely low provision swiss bank sector, negative consequence unexpectedly sharp interest rate increase could relatively far-reaching. the swiss bank sector nevertheless sufficient capital bear up, even circumstances. hedge fund might pose indirect threat stability failure affect systemically important banks. in opinion, unlikely scenario, however. hedge fund risk management swiss big bank adequate. the sfbc supervise big banks’ hedge fund activities. their exposure hedge fund must back capital case market credit risks. it is, however, undisputable that, give rapid development hedge fund industry, activity must monitor closely. system oversight in december, report situation regard oversight systemically important payment security settlement systems. in meantime, “systemically important” classification interbank payment system swiss interbank clear (sic), security settlement system secom, central counterparty si x-clear multi-currency payment system continuous link settlement (cls) become definitive, preparation oversight measure stipulate national bank ordinance go ahead scheduled. in particular, detail guideline draw order examine whether regulatory minimum requirement comply with. with guidelines, different system monitor consistently, time keep administrative effort operator acceptable level. business continuity plan (bcp) different experience recent past – 9/11 terrorist attack unite state minor local technical difficulty – suggest measure strengthen operational resistance swiss financial sector must taken. during past year half, snb head sectoral work group cooperation sfbc secretariat. the group consist representative infrastructure providers, financial institution authority conduct in-depth analysis business continuity plan major player financial markets. the business continuity plan (bcp) project focus precautionary measure prevent likelihood disruptions. in addition, measure take help cope efficiently possible disruptions, occurred. in analysis, work group focus two business process consider especially critical system stability must maintain without fail even exceptional circumstances. firstly, supply liquidity financial system central bank money mean repos and, secondly, large-value payment transaction commercial bank swiss interbank clear (sic). the analysis begin follow scenario: severe disruption cause failure important operational centre incapacitate staff. requirement define regard maximum tolerable downtime resumption normal operations. a distinction make critical non-critical business processes, activity participants. business process deem critical function absolutely vital system-wide provision liquidity. • the central infrastructure (snb, sis, telekurs), crucial critical business processes, must able resume critical business activity within two hour without lose confirm transactions. • critical system participant must able resume define critical business activity within four hours. • the system participant must able resume operation within 24 hours. the result analysis show adequate preparation make central infrastructure major system participants. nevertheless, area room improvement identified. for instance, exist precautionary measure tailor cater failure physical component (such build hardware), particularly event interfere staff availability. the final report work group complete second half 2005. it limit issue specific recommendations, also show implemented. financial stability report 2005 (950 kb) jean-pierre roth: the population age - cannot wait longer! summary

productivity gain competitive dynamism globalise demographically diversify world. this measure need put place quickly. at heart demographic challenge lie need enhance productivity economy well productive capacity. it important secure favourable growth condition age population could impact negatively upon capacity growth – strain already now. increase productivity economy pace growth essential wish maintain system social security. at macroeconomic level, finance old age pension work accord simple principle. this involve impose levy income work population transfer fund pensioners, either redistribution present (pay-as-you-go system) via capital fund system benefit future generation senior citizens. thus, demographic age mean work population oblige shoulder ever great levies. if, time, global creation wealth progress slowly, responsibility finance old age pension go impose increase social burden. thus, necessary improve economic efficiency, also need careful impede effort inappropriate measures. we must allow invisible hand competition bring efficient allocation resource possible domestic foreign arenas. consequently, need resource disposal. at time, need make sure access good quality resources. this mean take longer-term approach system education. the condition within economy operate also play important role. growth investment activity allow u create new job also, all, accelerate productivity advance – factor encourage growth help achieve good financial basis old age pension scheme. there three reason swiss national bank concern demographic development growth. first, central bank cannot create wealth beyond income derive investments, therefore cannot finance old age pensions. second, still people believe that, event economic slump, central bank bring sustain improvement economic performance. it illusion believe that, long term, job create monetary stimulation. over long period monetary policy neutral. the third final reason relate fact possible response demographic challenge future might affect equilibrium real interest rate economy – variable always enter assessment give situation. donald l kohn: manage risk change economic financial landscape remark mr donald l kohn, member board governor u federal reserve system, banker’s association finance trade institute international banker conference, new york, 15 june 2005. * * * i please lead promise interest conference. a i think conference title - "charting course future" - strike that, since one never really know future bring, chart specific path preconceive destination limit value. to sure, make best forecast base action them. but perhaps important thing - manager financial institutions, regulators, monetary policymakers - develop system action reaction accommodate unexpected - is, become good manager risk. the evolution financial market institution greatly affect process risk management. the mean manage risk broaden dramatically, result system could well challenge development come years. i would like take minute morning ruminate change financial system implication risk management, possibility development macroeconomic landscape might test systems, step private participants, public policymakers, take raise odds preserve healthy financial system economy unexpected inevitably occurs.1 the change financial landscape change financial market past decade rapid profound. new compute telecommunication technologies, along removal legal regulatory barrier entry, result great competition among wide variety institutions, broad geographic areas, across expand array instruments. the result increase efficiency financial market channel fund saver spender improvement ability saver spender adjust risk profiles. among key technological innovation enable development database critical price manage risk financial instruments. the ability value risky asset lay foundation understand risk embed asset manage risk portfolio basis. the evolution financial market mean people institution great number alternative supply acquire funds. in addition, lender borrower much wide range instrument choose risk profile financial position adjust profile response change situation overall financial economic environment. innovation competition substantially increase role market relative bank traditional provider financial intermediation services. this help reduce cost transfer save anywhere around globe investment anywhere around globe. it also reduce reliance particular class borrower lender particular type financial intermediaries. but also challenge banker identify value add intermediation process, new instrument technique see result attempt exploit comparative advantage. these change create potential more-robust financial markets, practice shift without difficulties. some significant disturbance past decade challenge market participants’ regulators’ understand risk reveal weakness risk-management tool practices. for example, 1997 1998, capital flow number asian country disrupted, severe effect economies. in 1998, global financial system rock russian debt default trouble long-term capital management 1 the view i express necessarily member board. pat white, board’s staff, contribute remarks. bi review 46/2005 1 imitators. those event follow bad excess stock market bubble, include overvaluation many stocks, also lapse corporate governance mark era. still, industrialize economy macroeconomic fallout sharp decline equity prices, spike risk premium business distress, revelation corporate wrongdoing year ago limited; unite states, experience mild recession. the effect limit part financial system prove reasonably resilient developments. since fall 1998, see kind widespread uncertainty health major player financial market past tend intensify spread economic effect adverse events. in view, two basic reason account relatively favorable outcome. first, risk probably fact good diversify good allocate prepare absorb whose financial distress le likely feed-through effect economy. second, monetary policy unite state respond aggressively incipient decline activity inflation result emerge problems. my message morning, however, time complacency. financial-market innovations, yet rigorously stress tested, along macroeconomic environment that, likely stable constructive, contain significant uncertainty, suggest vigilance adaptation market participant regulator necessary improve odds sustain era damp economic cycle support orderly evolution financial markets. the macroeconomic environment change financial intermediation market may help contain transmission shock financial sector real economy, evolution financial market turn probably facilitate favorable economic conditions. business cycle damp since early 1980s, inflation low steady unite state many industrial economy time. a i noted, pattern persist past year despite several major shocks, burst tech stock bubble terrorist attacks. stable economic environment encourage innovation; indeed foster stable economic environment important way central bank contribute public welfare. i anticipate break pattern generally favorable economic performance come years. most economic forecast moderate growth low inflation unite state foreseeable future. to sure, see range view much underlie strength economy has, intensity inflation pressures, path interest rate associate continue growth low inflation. but part, range narrow relative actual fluctuation u.s. economy experience 1950s, 1960s, 1970s. the fundamentals, growth inflation expectation underlie financial conditions, appear support continue good economic outcomes. moreover, flexibility resilience market finance good services, together monetary policy focus maintain price stability high employment, help damp economic fallout unexpected developments. however, although likely outcome overall economy good, number characteristic current situation suggest greater-than-usual risk around central tendency, and, particular, raise question pattern asset price movement might accompany even favorable overall economic performance. that caution flow existence unusual imbalance u.s. economy today. we buy far produce, extra purchase come import export, finance net borrow abroad. the result current account deficit rise record level, excess 6 percent gross domestic product. the counterpart current account deficit low save generate home; past year, household save current income fell unusually low level 1 percent. several factor contribute willingness household spend income, important one rapid continue rise house prices, boost household net worth. that rise turn probably reflect several influences, one low long-term interest rates. these imbalance unusual asset price configuration persist time. the current account deficit grow steadily since mid-1990s; household save rate 2 bi review 46/2005 downward trajectory even longer; low level long-term interest rate rapid pace house price increase subject much commentary past years. these phenomenon could well continue time longer, sustainable indefinitely. at point, global investor require high expect rate return portfolio become increasingly concentrate dollar assets; house price increase encounter resistance rise relative income rents; house price level out, household recognize must increase save income adequate resource retirement; federal reserve already raise short-term interest rate demand recover shock recent years. i expect adjustment more-sustainable pattern spend production save occur orderly manner. the response asset market change attitude appetite induce gradual adjustment spending. but think risk-management challenge come years, need keep mind economy unexplored territory many respects. historic pattern movement interest rates, exchange rates, house price may good guide future relationships. who would anticipate dollar would strengthen 2001 federal reserve ease aggressively long-term interest rate would fall gradually reduce monetary accommodation past year? even orderly adjustment may involve new combination market developments. and risk rapid adjustment unusual configuration asset price movement high normal. implication risk management financial institution public policymakers demonstrate ability respond flexibly change circumstance past several years. but imply ability adapt condition may confront future? financial institution one define characteristic financial institution market late significant expansion tool available manage risk. these tool test refine time. importantly, however, rest past experience understand events. thus, firm look ahead, must cognizant challenge activity event outside experience pose risk management. new product new business lines, example, ongoing challenge. historical data may limit relevant assess risk newly create products. such data limitation affect even standard risk-management tool value-at-risk analysis. recognize need supplement standard risk-management tools, manager also routinely estimate exposure so-called tail events. tail events, is, asset price movement much extreme usual experience, often appear drive unique idiosyncratic circumstances, implication open question challenge risk managers. should view temporary deviation still-valid view usual distribution possible outcomes, harbinger permanent shift suggest need re-assessment risk-management model practices? tail events, nature, also likely accompany heighten uncertainties. during periods, reaction market participant may become relevant assessment one’s risk. consider management market liquidity risk asset price move unusual ways. a firm long assume able reduce risk quickly adjust positions. trade may possible mostly small volumes, large trade almost surely great price effect normally observed. other firm also may try liquidate positions, create demand diminish market liquidity. risk management must take account potential long hold period more-severe asset price movement likely observe condition possibility concentration position markets. the challenge pose tail event limit market liquidity risk. they broad effect measurement management market counterparty credit risk, too. manager market risk typically mark position market compute value position different assumption future price changes. during tail event, wide bid-offer spread expected, reduce accuracy valuation exist positions. more importantly, however, dynamic price tail event individual asset asset relation likely different bi review 46/2005 3 observe normal market conditions. this phenomenon raise question typical assessment likelihood future change values. manager counterparty credit risk face still challenge consider tail events. counterparties may downgrade ordinary times, firm familiar management risk. but contemplate more-unusual movement asset prices, firm must also consider degree correlation default probability exposure default well possibility multiple, correlate downgrades. the financial landscape future require institution continue refine risk-management technique good manage challenge pose tail events. a i note earlier, uncharted territory respect many aspect macroeconomic environment. prudent risk manager recognize potential tail event prepare possibility. such preparation involve stress testing, is, simulate portfolio’s behavior extreme yet plausible event determine loss acceptable conditions. it sometimes hard know type event use testing, choice event will, course, function underlie portfolio. that said, current imbalances, along unusual asset price movement recent year investor behavior expectation reflect, offer clue extreme plausible event management considering. prudent risk management stop stress testing, however. to meaningful, result stress test part management’s ongoing plan future contingencies. policymakers public policymakers partner private sector process strengthen risk management, extension, strengthen financial system. a critical role policymaker, course, ensure plumbing, infrastructure, market sound. trade instrument afford opportunity assume (or hedge) grow variety exposure use grow variety investors. in environment, critically important mechanism settle trade introduce unwarranted risk system. the public sector active develop risk-management standard security settlement systems. this joint effort central bank security regulators, include representative country develop financial market addition group ten countries. a cross-border invest grown, argument common minimum standard become compelling. but standard without implementation worthless. critical component security settlement system many jurisdictions, include unite states, govern private-sector users. realization benefit full implementation standard require partnership private sector. the supervisory process, too, shift toward great focus risk management. a key goal basel ii good align regulatory capital requirement risk. in process, firm give great incentive invest more-sophisticated risk-management systems. the federal reserve supervisor financial institution embrace risk-focused approach way deploy resources. perhaps important contribution federal reserve arise conduct monetary policy. our responsibility work maintain stable price level economic environment. your problem would compound many time surge inflation economic instability. in risk-management approach monetary policy, attempt reduce odds nation experience damage macroeconomic tail events. but capability limited; ultimately, work overnight interest rate concentrate price level generally, may always compatible stability price particular assets. and, like you, cannot reliably anticipate occur. all reason private party regulator pay particular attention possible source risk stress come years. 4 bi review 46/2005 v leeladhar: value-based professional - need hour valedictory address mr v leeladhar, deputy governor reserve bank india, western india regional council institute charter accountant india, mumbai, 10 june 2005. * * * it give great pleasure midst today. the institute company secretary india (icsi) critical player indian endeavour develop professional protect interest stake holders, ensure corporate governance contribute public good - topic intrinsically link theme today, viz. value base professional broad theme corporate governance. these difficult issue give today’s audience, deal broad generic issue rather particulars. in innocent day youth, perhaps, term value base professional would tautology. it take grant professional possess values. the word profession evoke field require extensive study mastery specialize knowledge, law, medicine, engineering, accounting, etc. this contrast sharply humble term occupation, refer merely nature person’s employment. to conduct oneself professional - exhibit “professional behavior” - indicate person’s action remain accordance specific rules, write unwritten, pertain standard profession. indeed, early sociological definition professionalism, particular, involve checklist perceive claim characteristics, apart esoteric knowledge special skills, invariably include ethical behaviour. it also entail recognition social obligation apply one’s skill wisdom general benefit term ‘public good’. one practice profession. it context word mal-practice evolved. it take failure provide professional service skill ethic usually exhibit responsible careful member profession, result injury, loss, damage party contract services. it profession medics, accountants, lawyers, mal-practice associate one could charge same. while george bernard shaw characterize profession “conspiracies laity”, professionals, nonetheless, generally deem group people share common knowledge skill build upon formalize framework learning, also common articulate set value ethics. it thus competence ethic form bedrock professional. one exhort value professional - professional without value professional all. today, world changed. we long live simple times. the cry value ethic business today - value base professional - stem essentially crisis confidence. whether medicine finance, confidence linchpin professional - confidence competence perform confidence integrity. till recently, competence seek enforce jealously guard barrier entry. self regulation fraternity lay code ethic code conduct. these code standard evolve year influenced, small degree, crisis affect profession time time. the late round crisis confidence corporate sphere catalyse unexpected corporate failure 1980s, 1990s indeed high profile collapse new millennium. this perhaps add new dimension discourse relate confidence, relate confidence integrity system whole subserve need market system, stake holder indeed society provide reliable financial data information ‘full fair’ picture company’s account change therein. post mortem report account administrative lapse fail company give liquidator / regulator / inspector give u insight account well regulatory lapse provide stark contrast ‘true fair’ picture organisation various point time life report be. often time perceive practice balance date adjustments, defer expenses, advance revenue recognition judicious indeed creative use complex business group structures, conform letter sometimes intend obfuscate subvert spirit compliance. the general perception account statement fail inform drift financial affair company towards impend failure. this catalyse debate issue like account standard bi review 45/2005 1 well issue auditor independence one hand issue integrity personal deviance, other. the causal root recent corporate “misdemeanors” debatable. at one level, attribute swashbuckling ethos corporate culture initially spawn make fashionable investment banker 1980s - era oft allude ‘decade greed’. this set motion period dramatic financial success receive acclaim, flamboyant star operator view folk hero cautionary word regulator view distaste. at another level, attributable change business environment relentless competition firm operate. this competition bring pressure corporate management consistently sustain enhance financial performance demonstrably enhance shareholder value. the pressure management, recent past, also spill auditor conduct business. these pressure also bring focus concept earn management - quality earn method earn management may lead even constitute fraud. the accounting, regulatory ethical failure subsume system, cultural ethos individual deviance squarely resituated professional value ethic broad governance issue onto centre stage boardroom concerns. the general dismay was, fact, insolvency per se unexpected collapse financial statements, regulatory warn presage come. the un-serviceability account give true fair picture lay store, inaction regulator gauge pulse forthcoming event ethical failure organisational culture individual perpetuate act commission omission paint picture system failure often get blur medium focus personality deviant behaviour. this turn bring back focus quest code standard well issue value ethic business. while quest code standards, generic term is, ways, never ending, endeavour account finance, nonetheless, gear improve reliability financial statements. this make credible increase shareholders’ confidence. confidence financial statement reduce cost capital make market efficient. thus, market economy, quality accounts, audit integrity professional create enable environment economic efficiency corporate growth. historically, importance publish account bring focus uk’s company act 1844. this, time, give rise quest standards, code quality account market base economy shore investor confidence set strong bind account audit standards. it thus financial audit preform auditor independent entity whose financial statement audited. the purpose reduce incentive conflict interest would compromise professional judgement. the early attempt modern time build bind standard date back early 1930s run period security exchange commission (sec) establish u 1934. it interest recall issue arise 1930s redolent debate today. one whether audit perform private firm government auditor another whether rule audit profession would set auditor outsiders. the first issue government auditor vs. private firm resolve 1933 favour private firms. the second issue whether audit standard rule set labour trenches, viz., auditor outsider essentially user account service contentious settle late 1930s - 1939 specific. the issue resolve narrowly, without considerable lobbying, 3-2 vote favour auditor set account audit standards, i.e., regulate themselves, thus formalise regime self regulation. this debate come full circle today, consensus veer favour “outsiders” prominent, dominant, say set account standard quest account quality. the recent event - high profile misstate earn fraud - small measure help catalyse development. the underlie purpose endeavour quality restore confidence stakeholders, regulator society large quality attest function perform accountant integrity professional. it context background, perhaps, almost half member peer review board institute charter accountant india set 2002, draw industry, banking, academics, etc. in international arena, dominance outsider even pronounce - sarbanes-oxley act 2002 u envisage 5 member account board two member certify public accountants. in way reflect movement resituate 2 bi review 45/2005 need consumer account service compulsion convenience provider services. at fundamental level, mark substantial change bring recent time governance audit profession. in fact, move 1980s towards ethical behaviour get gradually subsume expand notion corporate governance, renew discussion emanate cadbury report 1992. over time, voluntary nature self regulation corporate governance metamorphose overlay additional layer rule compliance sarbanes-oxley act. essentially, premise two pillar : (a) mechanism corporation direct controlled; (b) mechanism direct control corporation supervised. in matter relate corporate governance, secretarial practice play critical role. in india secretarial practice evolve period time differ business environment different usages. the need harmonise consolidate diverse secretarial practice use india, give rise quest standard code area too. towards end, institute company secretary india (icsi) constitute secretarial standard board (ssb) objective formulate secretarial standard base applicable laws, business environment best secretarial practices. the establishment board represent significant step towards harmonization, integration standardisation diverse secretarial practice prevalent corporate sector. these standard lay principles’ company expect adopt adhere discharge corporate responsibility. it hearten note collaborative endeavour consultation across sector. it thus ssb comprise eminent member profession represent regulatory authority department company affairs, security exchange board india institute’s sister professional body institute charter accountant india institute cost work accountant india. we trust guidance note develop ssb clarification give issue arise standard contribute good corporate governance. we regulator reserve bank, too, seek catalyse condition good corporate governance. we pain emphasise compliance regulatory requirement minimum requirement good corporate governance require internal, peer market pressure reach high minimum standard prescribe regulatory agencies. a critical element endeavor transparency aspect emphasize expand coverage information timeliness information analytical content. importantly, especially post-reforms phase, central bank reiterate several time deregulation operational freedom must go hand hand operational transparency. this also bring u moot question: what take value base professional? this difficult question. there are, perhaps, quality individual need posse make ethical decisions. first, recognise ethical issue reason ethical consequence decisions. second, ability look alternate point view decide right appropriate particular set circumstances. third, ability deal ambiguity uncertainty make choice best information available. the pace technical change, scientific innovation, cultural interchange global world today, increasingly confront u situation conflict unanticipated ethical challenge force make decision prepare make cannot avoid. often times, exist moral knowledge ethical guideline prove inadequate simply provide answer modern moral problems. worse, pace change similar situation cannot replicate stable recurrent condition therefore difficult look construct ethical guideline fast change present. what individual professionals, group organization need situation acquire skill method give ethical competence confidence handle ethical issue may arise everyday professional life. essentially need know apply personal organizational principle concrete moral problems. moreover, disconnect individual organizational value lead internal conflict dilemmas. worse, disconnect state prevail value organization. we have, point other, face conflict loyalty integrity. we confront issue dissent deal dissent. emerge commercial structure outsource bring issue enjoin agent profess value principal represent. besides, corporate reality check indicate bi review 45/2005 3 increasingly live issue range black white area false mislead claims, fraud manipulation, etc. grey issue concealment information, conflict interest, coercion, vulnerabilities, principal-agent problem fiduciary duties. ethical dilemma individual arise issue corporate misconduct whether particular practice unfair, questionable, mislead intend deceive. it arise one’s personal beliefs, moral value commitment right action. they short challenge one’s integrity. it arise questionable behaviour others pressure indulge questionable behaviour ones’ self get job done. it foster demand time organisational pressure form explicit instruction thing may consider sleazy. it need necessarily arise organization superior corrupt could grow intense pressure get job do or, matter, organizational culture leadership foster environment unethical behaviour take place. what need psychological approach ethical competence one anticipate moral problems, recognize address squarely confidence. in resolve ethical dilemma professional may confront with, communication play important role explain first one’s self others convincingly basis decision take best circumstances. at organizational level, need leadership qualities, communication skill sensitivity inculcate culture raise level ethical awareness carry organization group along credibility confidence. and confidence quest value base professional about. it thus code standard alone culture value base professional may moulded. nor process compliance. while important, view need cautiously work fine balance process outcomes. in today’s politically correct world form, therefore increasingly cry substance - indeed, one school thought, account profession itself, feel obsession compliance beget creativity subverts. this bring word dialectics, associate bohemia, revolution intellectual, squarely lexicon staid accountant regulator. value base professional compliance alone, live spirit compliance. these difficult issue indeed, question answers. today i sign call innocent time leave chiasmus (where mean reverse mirror image): i trust value base professional value profession profess value value profess value. i leave pause ponder. 4 bi review 45/2005 stanley fischer: the relationship economic growth science technology remark professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, rehovot conference science technology, rehovot, 9 june 2005. * * * esteem minister finance, mayor rehovot, president weizmann institute, president israel academy science humanities, director general ministry science technology, honor guests, lady gentlemen: it great pleasure today, especially since important event, first rehovot conference science technology, hold eminent illustrious institution, weizmann institute. when organizer conference ask topic i would lecture today, i decide speak topic “is economics science?” late on, i realize academy science humanity already make decision matter choose friend, professor menahem yaari, president. i concur academy, course: economics indeed science! therefore, i speak today theme appear conference program rather several result economic research relationship economic growth science technology. in matter, natural begin work perform nobel prize laureate, professor robert solow, almost fifty year ago. it possible write production function show level production result level use factor input - especially labor capital - level technology. solow asks, “what great use labor capital contribute growth unite state 1909-1949 period, much technological progress contribute growth time?” his famous answer 80 percent growth period trace technological change economy years. solow’s answer robust enough withstand many test since then. in solow’s work, level technology exogenous factor, mean determine outside economy. in 1960s, economist begin investigate origin technological level, 1970s, immense macroeconomic problem begin crop almost every corner world, economist turn attention problem growth. since 1980s, economic research make focus intensive attempt include factor affect increase productivity, within framework economic models, know “the new theory economic growth.” the result new theory economic growth spell length excellent book friend, professor elhanan helpman, publish 2004 title the mystery economic growth. allow present several main find capsule form: 1. international comparison show main result solow’s work correct. there evidence difference total productivity among country - difference originate different level technology - explain 60 percent difference among country per-worker income growth rates. 2. although growth up down course economic cycle, average growth rate global economy accelerate time. by inference, rate increase technological level global economy also accelerate time. 3. education play important role explain difference growth rate per-worker income country country time. 4. one important result: society earn much high return investment research development investor earns. allow insert parenthetical remark. there substantial difference marginal improvement exist technology development new technology serve many purpose - call multipurpose technologies. these general-bis review 45/2005 1 purpose technology - mechanization, electrification, computerization - technology derive many uses. the contribution technology productivity large long-lasting. however, take many year economy assimilate multipurpose technologies. furthermore, begin process rate productivity growth give economy may even decline new technology crowd antiquate technologies. fifteen year ago, lead robert solow postulate computer revolution take place every part economy except productivity data. this situation, however, begin change middle 1990s. 5. economist emphasize importance openness economy growth rate. there economy world, modern era, manage grow rapidly lengthy period without increase export import steeply. and technology side, country become interdependent due cross knowledge among them. it find country’s trade partner invest research development, country’s total productivity increase. it encourage see greatly less-developed country benefit r&d investment industrialize countries. these results, however, negative side: investment technological innovation may widen gap rich country poor ones. how outcome prevented? only make focus effort rise to, stay at, forefront global technology. and accomplished? by invest education provide support general apply science-including research development. this, however, complicate thing. almost everywhere world, direct government intervention r&d regard failure. there two exception - finland israel. the office chief scientist country success - even though necessary continue investigate factor responsible success draw inference possible change future. let sum part remarks: 1. increase productivity crucial sustainable economic growth. 2. be forefront knowledge technological innovation crucial economic growth. 3. country wish stay forefront must make sure pool technological knowledge expand steadily. 4. evidence around world speak clearly importance israel enhance human capital education technological infrastructure, stay forefront knowledge technological innovation. these lead increase productivity per-capita growth. to bring about, important establish correct set incentive correct institutional structure. it important develop set incentive promote education, emphasis technological education, entire population. concurrently, important create various form incentive process promote innovation invention. 5. if i may, i would also like address relationship growth inequality inequality poverty. the first result regard relationship growth inequality call kuznets curve. the data kuznets’ possession lead believe inequality rise begin growth process afterwards start fall. however, data available back scanty. it clear simple relationship growth inequality. the reason simple: a. inequality may influence mean economic policy, include education system. b. the relationship also depend origin growth, example, kind technological progress growth based. a difference reduce inequality reduce poverty, realize poverty may decline even inequality rises. this happening, example, china. there may short-term substitution relationship reduce poverty reduce inequality. if relationship exists, society decide wish short term. i conclude quote remark late friend, professor yoram ben-porath, write 1986 book title the israeli economy: mature through crisis: “the potential there. israel reservoir 2 bi review 45/2005 human capital scientific infrastructure use increase productivity expand exports. it national determination, use achieve political independence self-defense, could also harness achieve economic independence. thus, economic maturity may still prove start point new phase sustain growth”. in fact, already right path. if stay it, able attain potential fully take position alongside develop country world. bi review 45/2005 3 jaime caruana: overview spanish economy 2004 address mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, govern council bank spain occasion presentation annual report 2004, madrid, 10 june 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, the performance world economy 2004 exceptional: growth exceed 5%, high rate last quarter century; inflation remain control, exception slight rise emerge countries; climate international financial market relatively relaxed, allow generous finance condition countries. no headway made, however, correct world economy’s main disequilibria, tend worsen. add imbalance shock high oil prices, look permanent previous episodes. there thus persistent risk vulnerability which, corrected, might endanger continuity growth. underpin buoyancy world economy was, all, contribution u and, great extent, chinese demand, along emerge asian economies. there also mark rise activity emerge regions, latin america central eastern european countries. conversely, economic performance euro area japan disappointing, rate expansion run initial forecasts. that would appear confirm scant flexibility economy limit responsiveness change condition world markets. recent growth pattern also lead widen divergence growth rate three main develop areas, high rate expansion u economy increase europe japan decline rise le expected. this bore unfavourably global disequilibria, manifest widen u current-account deficit, counterpoint rise surplus japan, china asian economies, well oil-exporting countries, slight surplus euro area increase moderately. the prolong deterioration u external balance - link expansionary fiscal policy compound effect scant private-sector save recent year - engender expectation depreciation dollar international foreign exchange markets, materialise partially asymmetrically. consequently, dollar depreciate significantly euro late 2004, hold stable asian currency u external imbalance build up. the effective depreciation dollar thus 5% 2004. the dollar’s fall period 2002-04 prompt turnaround progressive widen u external deficit, either because, well known, depreciation tend correct current-account deficit lag, aforementioned asymmetry behaviour dollar main currency fact scarcely depreciate currency country run counterpart surpluses. in turn, situation large current-account surplus strong capital inflows, asian country de jure de facto fix exchange rate dollar continue build sizable international reserves. the need asian central bank place reserve also partly explain another salient feature economic development 2004: maintenance long-term interest rate abnormally low levels. this also largely attributable persistence low inflation expectations, set highly credible counter-inflationary monetary policies, condition ample liquidity international financial market operated. for much year, european bond yield markedly synchronous u counterparts, despite different position fundamental two economies. from november, however, european rate declined, move progressively away u rate yield spread area widen considerably. this recent development consistent uncertainty economic recovery euro area bright outlook u economy. but perhaps salient international economic development 2004 persistent rise oil prices. at root this, all, force demand unite state china, bi review 45/2005 1 situation mark production refine capacity bottlenecks, arise limit investment past. compare recent period oil price rises, peak 1990 2000 link geopolitical tensions, increase price occasion feed much great extent long-term future contracts, suggest market expect oil price hold high levels. despite this, indicator available, dear energy scarcely affect inflation expectations, mean so-called second-round effect - link reaction wage - avoided. on past experience, latter affect damaging. so far, effect high oil price surprisingly mild. but economic policy remain vigilant face potential pass-through inflation expectations, risk vulnerability world economy which, respects, diminish tend increase. of note, here, necessary re-establishment normal macroeconomic stance (the main countries’ policy add abnormally expansionary momentum world economy recent years), potential impact financial markets. a regard monetary policies, country ahead business cycle already begin adjust interest rate level consistent neutral stance, foreseeably behind cycle progressively pursue trend economy gather steam. turn fiscal policies, tell deteriorate area moderate growth rates, japan certain euro area countries, seek use fiscal policy counter-cyclical purposes, particularly dynamic economies, unite states, buoyant demand allow ambitious fiscal consolidation goals. the exception pattern deteriorate budget position certain emerge economies, public debt relatively high. this case latin-american countries, harness favourable economic situation improve primary surpluses. the importance further fiscal consolidation medium term develop economy become even clear long-term problem link population age take account, emerge economies, high debt levels, need persevere budgetary discipline. restore normal monetary fiscal policy stance require care, ensure world economy dislodge low-inflation path recovery. it particularly important limit potential shock international financial markets, operate favourable condition mark high liquidity, low risk premium interest-rate term structure propitious long-term borrowing. in respect, monetary measure safeguard price stability must accompany appropriate communication policy consistency application fiscal rule commitments, authority avoid sharp change condition financial markets, might induce exaggerate reactions. in particular, although long-term interest rate doubt resume level keep past experience current cyclical phase, process orderly without excessive propagation towards credit risk premium corporate-debt emerge sovereign-debt markets, foreign-exchange markets. another source vulnerability international economy lies, discussed, global disequilibria. broad international consensus correction imbalance require increase public private save unite states, structural reform invigorate euro area economy japan, great flexibility asian exchange rates, especially china. these policy would gradually correct present current-account mismatch would accompany exchange-rate movement tend bring position close long-term equilibrium levels. the correction current-account imbalance would also ideally re-establish natural direction capital flow develop emerge countries. compare anomalous situation present, flow latter country former ones, owe combine impact absorption exert u economy exchange-rate policy asia, smooth work world economy channel surplus save mature economy return capital higher, incipient phase development. it recall many achievement world economy recent years, move high, inflation-free growth path infuse emerge area great dynamism allow achieve standard live close rich countries, direct 2 bi review 45/2005 indirect consequence grow worldwide integration. globalisation thus give country fluid access foreign market offer incentive concentrate industry comparative advantage lies, provide consumer wide range product favourable prices. but forget rigidity certain countries’ exchange-rate policy ultimately trigger protectionist threat others see adversely affected. it thus vital succumb protectionist temptation persevere liberalisation international trade trend allow world economy achieve recent favourable result may become entrenched. the euro area the prolong sluggishness euro area economy continues, output growth 2% fourth year running. in first half 2004 dynamic trajectory discernible, line great robustness world economy, presage onset firm expansionary phase. activity since weaken notably, however, first half current year see improvement. nonetheless, condition remain place allow rate expansion gdp increase gradually come quarters, spur continuation relatively expansionary financial condition momentum international situation. dear oil appreciation euro hold back growth euro area time, factor intensify 2004. however, would wrong attribute protract period low growth see euro area factors. the euro area fact benefit recent year relatively sharp expansion export markets, allow largely offset negative effect euro’s appreciation. moreover, rise euro, along progress reduce oil dependency, soften adverse consequence high oil prices. at root european economy’s persistent weakness are, instead, factor hamper sustain buoyancy domestic spend heighten sensitivity external developments. the lacklustre consumption investment recent year tell connection, denote presence structural shortcoming dampen household confidence dent corporate profit expectations. accordingly, question uncertainty viability public pension system currently place constraint prevent high productivity growth long-term repercussion also exert contractionary effect present economic situation. these overall characteristic area apply member economies. growth rate vary considerably, largely due different degree vigour show internal demand. amid divergences, spain one country consistently post substantially higher-than-average rate expansion. the eurosystem monetary policy retain accommodative stance, intervention rate set june 2003 unchanged 2%. although forceful oil shock hamper reduction inflation, medium-term inflation expectation hold rate compatible eurosystem’s definition price stability, partly result sustain wage moderation. the favourable trend labour cost natural corollary prevail sluggishness activity employment creation, also reflect credibility anti-inflationary goal monetary policy. the european central bank able sustain monetary condition propitious strengthen activity although, indicate earlier, far prove insufficient achieve satisfactory degree dynamism. it thus appear euro area yet harness fully benefit arise economic integration introduction single currency. the emergence difficulty further european economic integration recently discerned. case point problem affect fiscal discipline framework, delay meet target lisbon agenda obstacle still blocking, certain industries, development single european market. at march 2005 european council, authority attempt correct lack ambition behind structural reform scant consistency budgetary policy disciplinary rule set adjust policy co-ordination mechanisms. however, clear resolve part authority fulfil commitment would dispel scepticism proposal evoke. in fiscal policy realm, european council approve reform stability growth pact. among changes, provision make pay great attention particular situation country evaluate budgetary position make application corrective measure bi review 45/2005 3 envisage treaty flexible. a result changes, economic rationality certain component pact perhaps enhanced, though complexity margin available discretion application also undoubtedly increased. there favourable aspect new rules, raise doubt pact’s capacity deliver budgetary discipline proper function monetary union requires. regardless fact full assessment agreement reach make relate legal text known, imperative, dispel uncertainty reform process aroused, european authority apply revise rule unequivocally strictly. the european council also revise so-called lisbon agenda, hop reinvigorate european economy first decade new millennium. assessment result achieve half-way stage make disappoint reading. the introduction reform insufficient european co-ordination mechanism prove weak encourage adoption appropriate measure national level. the council seek re-launch strategy, focus growth employment, alter co-ordination arrangement council, member state commission, ease way adoption monitor reform national level. this new direction appropriate, although specific measure give determine political impulse process would desirable. such determination needed, particular, overcome obstacle hind completion single market. indeed, manifest european council’s request commission revise draft directive liberalise provision service union. the challenge face european economy considerable set institutional context disrupt “no” vote recently hold french dutch referendum ratification constitutional treaty. the difficulty entrench growth sufficient consistent european model general public’s expectation may influence disappoint result return referendums. but something closely relate difficulty national level push necessary reform explain convincingly. the significance implication result underestimated. but need check european integration. rather, act spur integration mean european national policy respond demand public. in event, european integration linear process past i fully confident european union capable overcome difficulty always obstacle stand way. on plus side current circumstance fact currency share large number country federally organise central bank focal point stability exemplify europeans’ ability embark coordinate ambitious undertake contribute effectively collective well-being. the spanish economy spain, i say earlier, one euro area economy continue post high growth rates, compare relative slackness area whole. the new base-year 2000 national account estimate spain, release week ago, indicate gdp grow 2004 significantly high rate previous estimate (3.1% 2.7%), albeit unbalance composition. moreover, growth rate remain mildly accelerate path, continue 2005 q1, output stand 3.3% compare period 2004. a indicate annual report, yet possible analyse depth new national account series, although first comparison previous estimate indicate datasets offer fundamentally similar diagnosis economy’s performance. in particular, high growth new figure - available far 2000 - show confirm continuity long expansionary phase train since mid-nineties. the expansion result notable momentum domestic demand combine high employment-generating capacity extension supply side economy, two mutually reinforce phenomenon year provide sound base growth. spanish euro area membership lay root significant expansionary impulse experience household corporate expenditure. the effect anchor inflation expectation adjustment interest-rate level recently reinforce loosen monetary financial condition euro area. progress towards fiscal consolidation maintenance 4 bi review 45/2005 balance public finance contribute decisively shape environment stability, ease finance private expenditure growth. on supply side, robust population employment figure make favourable condition expansionary demand impulse translate high growth activity great pressure productive capacity lead disequilibria. that said, i remark later, prevent structural shortcoming economy manifest upward pressure price cost wide current-account deficit. job creation fuel expand labour force, increase inflow immigrant rise labour-market participation woman contributing. regard immigration, population projection draw 2001 census continuously update municipal population census show impact could hardly envisage year back. in event, strong employment generation accompany modest productivity gains, trend continue 2004 employment increase 2.7%, compare 2.5% 2003, apparent labour productivity growth 0.4%. domestic demand quicken 2004 almost 1 pp, grow 4.6%. the growth rate intensify year unfolded, rise rate 5.8% start 2005. this acceleration drive high increase private consumption renew buoyancy construction couple pick-up investment equipment. households’ expenditure underpin recovery disposable income, benefit high employment growth comparatively favourable contribution general government, net effect benefit taxes. but increase household wealth recent year - largely link rise real-estate asset value - favourable finance condition underpin household consumption residential investment decisions. the behaviour productive investment has, recent years, reflect opportunity uncertainty expansionary phase, many relate external environment. however, business investment progressively take lead robustness demand 2004 start current year clearly expansionary path. lax financial conditions, healthy position achieve corporation investment potential favourable expectation economic development behind rise. set increase domestic demand, external demand exert increasingly contractionary influence. although world trade pick 2004, good export grow le external markets, import climb high rates, increase penetration spanish market. tourism feel effect competition nearby destination offer package similar spain competitive prices. the negative contribution external demand gdp growth thus continue expand course 2004, without sign turnaround 2005. on contrary, accord national account data q1, contractionary effect net external demand step significantly, backdrop strong domestic demand pressure drive high consumption vigorous construction spend combine clear take-off investment capital goods. among factor influence negative behaviour net external demand, cause repercussion i shall return later, persistence inflation differentials. indeed, inflation differential euro area widen 2004, reflect relatively sharp impact dear oil spanish prices. moreover, although growth rate labour cost eased, remain relatively high. a result, 12-month increase consumer price rise 3.2% december 3.5% april. it expect moderate come months, however. indeed, initial estimate hicp may (3.1%) suggest already done. at onset 2005 spanish economy highly buoyant. this robustness continue base momentum domestic expenditure high job creation. while impact factor underpin household spend may moderate come quarters, factor operate recent past continue boost domestic demand and, particular, productive investment. likewise, insofar european market recover effect euro appreciation 2004 ease absorbed, contractionary influence external demand might checked. under scenario, outlook economy short run point prolongation expansionary phase, sustain gdp growth rate similar observe 2004. these forecast subject, however, risk. this pose significant challenge economic policy, especially come promote sustainability economic dynamism long bi review 45/2005 5 term, constraint stem euro area membership. there certain external risk whose potential influence spain significant, economic policy action little counter. this case danger arise weakness euro area, high oil price appreciation euro. what economic policy line policymakers counter domestic risks, undoubtedly relevant one policy design. accordingly, i shall focus analyse nature latter possible repercussions. the domestic risk factor stem largely prolongation long, domestic demand-led expansionary phase, group two major areas. first, loss competitiveness build early describe set inflation differential low productivity gains, might ultimately check generation value add job creation. and second, increase household debt accompany expansion consumption residential investment, might constrain households’ spend capacity, particularly development house market prompt uncertainty value sector’s wealth, strongly concentrate real-estate assets. although area risk inter-related, i shall deal separately. in respect competitiveness, sign risk signal banco de españa past already begin materialise. the significant restraint growth exert external demand past year considerable widen spanish economy’s external deficit point direction. admittedly, result partly reflect influence certain external factors, dear oil appreciation euro, dampen positive impact international recovery. moreover, deficit also partly influence cyclical divergence spain euro area. but factor suffice explain either scale deficit speed widened, therefore conceal existence genuine deterioration relate loss competitiveness build recent years, i shall seek illustrate. but let first address significance scope external deficit country concern belong monetary union, qualify interpretation whereby deficit would cease cause concern. it true new circumstance danger burgeon external deficit generate financial foreign-exchange pressure trigger sharp adjustment economy, since fundamental variable interest rate exchange rate determine area-wide level. but mean economy immune competitiveness problems. on contrary, large external deficit emerge monetary union result economy’s difficulty competing, costly dilemma may arise: nominal cost either adjust head-on, loss competitiveness check generation value add job creation. a first sign competitiveness problem find grow difficulty spanish product face maintain market shares. spanish export share foreign markets, hold stable since start monetary union, tend decline 2004, even european market. and fall-off tourist market similar development. although specific factor might explain aspect behaviour, strength grow import penetration domestic market tend confirm diagnosis diminish competitiveness spanish product domestic foreign market alike. the concurrence incipient slide export share ongoing increase import penetration primarily reflect high relative price spanish product result persistent inflation differential recent appreciation euro. testify negative trend traditional price competitiveness indicators, even calculate export deflator capture sector expose foreign trade narrow margin face grow competitive pressure. behind ongoing deterioration price competitiveness lie relative increase unit labour costs, reflect continue high wage increase spain despite moderation compare previous periods, low labour productivity gains. the existence wage-setting index mechanism set high floor nominal wage growth country hind rapid absorption external price shocks. and also tend hamper full convergence arrangement require area macroeconomic stability. the problem pose wage inertia exacerbate lacklustre behaviour productivity. a note previous occasions, partly reflect intensive growth employment generation, 6 bi review 45/2005 beneficial entrench expansionary cycle economy make efficient use labour supply available. but weak total factor productivity growth - relative position vis-à-vis eu continue worsen - denote presence worry factor appear check incorporation innovation technical progress productive processes. the lack innovation productive system tend stifle economy’s overall efficiency long-term growth capacity. the indicator available stock technological capital suggest considerable lag remain place. undoubtedly, specific feature spanish economy’s pattern productive specialisation - bias manufacture towards production intermediate- low-technology goods, service towards tourism activity - may partly explain phenomenon. but also shortcoming restrict business sector’s capacity incorporate advance knowledge adapt productive processes, human resource management corporate strategy environment heighten competition. of particular importance persistent mismatch skill train level labour companies’ requirements, and, all, rigidity work factor product markets, discourage adoption innovative strategies. i draw attention limitation spanish economy particular juncture foreign direct investment slow considerably (fdi one main channel diffusion technological advances), weight high-technology import remain limited, despite surge import penetration. the prolongation current trend might mean industry expose foreign competition adjust staff level order maintain business margins. hence importance create environment conducive technological innovation high productivity, i shall refer later. the second area risk arise extend expansionary phase economy related, early indicated, ongoing buoyancy household spend consumption residential investment. this variable favour notable generosity finance conditions, give rise certain pressure financial position spanish households. a known, household debt last year hold upward course follow since mid-nineties, clearly exceed 100% sector’s gross disposable income. this new peak mark departure average level euro area begin draw close country unite states. although low interest rate long average maturity liability keep financial burden within moderate limits, end-2004 cushion save available interest capital payment fall practically zero spanish household whole. however, effect high indebtedness low save household wealth offset notable surge real-estate wealth, strongly link rise house prices. a result, overall financial position spanish household remain sound. the strength sector’s balance sheet whole likewise reflect microeconomic information draw spanish survey household finance recently compile banco de españa. although survey identify household segment vulnerable situation apparent overall indicators, size segment small. while notable change household balance sheet lead weaken wealth position, increase (by various mechanisms) sector’s exposure relatively broad range possible shocks, thereby raise sensitivity consumption residential investment them. these shock notably include may affect employment, variable which, mention above, largely determine behaviour household spending. obviously, behaviour interest rate also important. however, great uncertainty lie possible implication development real-estate market. this market midst expansionary phase still show clear sign faltering, despite extraordinary duration intensity. 2004 end significant growth supply which, however, insufficient push price growth rate top 17% nominal terms. the statistical change underlie official information 2005 make hard interpret recent data, although still seem show sign significant slowdown. such high growth rate difficult explain entirely basis recent change income interest rates, response demographic change way spain. consequently, overvaluation bi review 45/2005 7 detectable market year continue expand 2004, although size gap difficult gauge accurately. subject natural caution require view lack precision, analysis banco de españa indicate current level overvaluation incompatible gradual correction overvaluation, see past spain abroad. however, central bank consider likely scenario also consequence which, though unlikely, might significantly affect behaviour economy. importantly connection, spanish economy sufficient depth stability enable weather impact household spend appreciable house price correction, unlikely event occur. the soundness spanish credit institutions, underpin high solvency level comfortable bad debt coverage ratio (a matter i return late general framework situation financial system), minimise possibility downward adjustment house prices, occur, would significantly impair banks’ ability continue efficiently finance spend decision firm households. moreover, unlike countries, spanish household start significantly borrow increase house wealth directly finance current consumption plans. in event, loss competitiveness, household debt level house price evidently entail risk expansion interrupted. the economic policy national sovereignty thus important mission prevent risk materialise provide solid foundation growth. in particular, since monetary financial condition likely continue relatively generous need spanish economy foreseeable future, continue responsibility fiscal policy help establish overall macroeconomic stance contribute mitigate spend pressure. however, available instrument limit effect aggregate demand, mean major role must play microeconomic structural reform policy influence behaviour supply create basis efficient market institution increase productivity. in 2004 fiscal policy achieve expect results, since budget general government account almost balance (or modest surplus effect assume renfe’s debt strip out) public debt/gdp ratio show fresh decrease. despite this, certain drift primary current expenditure, offset yet another year highly buoyant government revenue. from general standpoint, momentum improvement structural balance must allow slacken, since would indicate fall-off fiscal drive recent years. in circumstance described, highly recommendable make fiscal effort go beyond program fiscal plan force, least two reasons. first, ambitious fiscal policy would strengthen role stabilise contain domestic demand short term, counterbalance monetary financial conditions. second, firm improvement structural balance would leave public finance good place face increase expenditure derive population ageing, even scenario high immigration flows. fiscal stability fiscal discipline basic asset spanish economic policy which, however, always easy manage, show vagary european fiscal framework. it thus important review fiscal stability law autonomous (regional) government finance system lead weaken fiscal discipline. in situation necessary make headway simultaneously job creation productivity gains, role supply-side policy gear improve work economy expand potential growth crucial. one main message annual report present today precisely become increasingly difficult spanish economy keep raise level well-being make progress fronts. maintain high level job creation is, continue be, powerful mean expand economy’s growth potential, impossible sustain economic momentum long term economy improve competitive position increasingly dynamic international setting. and this, essential significantly improve poor performance productivity. under approach, labour market reform head list transformation needed. a flexible efficient labour market necessary overcome distortion contribute deterioration competitiveness provide appropriate framework firm find sufficient stimulus job creation, introduction new technologies, efficient use factor production enhancement productivity. 8 bi review 45/2005 in setting, persistent ratio temporary permanent employees, seem encounter floor level 30%, attendant negative consequence productivity human capital accumulation, make advisable review effectiveness incentive force hire permanent worker recent years. this would involve redefine measure design reduce non-wage cost link type employment introduce incentive rationalise use temporary employment contracts. it also necessary set train reform collective bargain make wage-setting mechanism flexible, compensation bring line specific condition productive sector firm characteristic workers. this reform would also eliminate, least reduce emphasis on, wage-indexation mechanisms. the stepping-up investment training, physical capital technological capital line objective lisbon agenda fundamental boost productivity. a mentioned, spain notable weakness area innovation incorporation diffusion productive system. these weakness make necessary design specific policy address objective adapt institutional regulatory framework smooth function market drive innovation development new activity focus productive structure sector demand value add greater. a result launch new plan achieve dynamic economy foster productivity, certain measure adopt promote competitiveness (of sectoral nature), unquestionably play part improve productivity. the banco de españa particularly welcome measure address financial system. however, important plan clearly steer reform policy priority right direction maintain momentum reform. the commitment announce must implement ambitiously complement action aim foster improvement human technological capital work market institutions. this appropriate set detail exhaustive review range measure reform require spanish economy. i refer necessary ones, list would incomplete i mention step mitigate potential effect household indebtedness house price rise sustainability growth. the measure aim raise supply house accessibility sufficiently effective include reorganisation land market, remain one main unresolved issue face spanish economy. also, neutral tax treatment house ownership measure foster rental could improve work market. there also implication behaviour financial intermediary i look i review main recent development spanish financial system. the financial system the international financial system benefit 2004 favourable trend train since 2003 still apparent early month 2005. very low long-term interest rates, stable interest rate spread emerge country corporate sector, performance main stock market indices, low level volatility ample liquidity make relatively easy scenario contrast difficulty experience begin decade. despite favourable environment, financial situation complicate certain circumstance cannot ignored. first, finance activity become increasingly complex term demand management. low interest rate thus increase appetite risk spur development new financial products, credit derivatives, new intermediaries, hedge funds. these new possibility mean institution become much sophisticate risk manager singular feature financial product intermediaries, particularly complexity opacity. if factor natural doubt sustainability scenario (not much whether continue benign be), become evident satisfactory behaviour market financial intermediary allow lead complacency, use strengthen soundness institution precaution possible change favourable central scenarios. spanish deposit institution unaffected developments. in fact, favourable factor list added, case spain, highly favourable bi review 45/2005 9 macroeconomic scenario growth differential core european country output employment. this, along good start position institution term efficiency competitiveness, enable soundness international leadership financial system strengthened. our institution thus able meet demand increasingly complex bank product services, time improve profitability. naturally, however, comment international scenario need market institution maintain operational soundness apply likewise spanish institutions. thus 2004 spanish credit institution achieve high level profitability, whether measure growth previous year roe, 14% high average report international competitors. the high business volumes, offset negative effect low interest rate net interest income, tight control operate expenses, enable efficiency ratio improved, two basic factor behind favourable performance. moreover, business activity step precisely instrument provide institution collateralised assets, specifically mortgage loans, characterise low default rates. finally, favourable earn performance also result diversification income sources, significant growth associate provision collection, payment non-banking product services. solvency remain level comfortably minimum regulatory requirements, although strong growth business, therefore capital requirements, mean bank solvency ratio decrease slightly 2004 respect 2003. in case spain, solvency strengthen rigorous bad debt provision policy. that said, optimistic favourable central scenario, great need pay careful attention potential fragilities. in apply caveat spanish institutions, shall focus three line defence use institution protect possible difficulties: risk management, enable ex ante minimisation difficulties, profitability solvency, make easy absorb risk materialise. a regard risks, low level default unquestionably reflect favourable financial macroeconomic trends, also improvement procedure identifying, measure control risks. the sharp increase activity, however, pose certain question think given. first, although fast grow instrument secure loans, concentration real-estate market, together grow household indebtedness, take account managers, since factor (sectoral concentration grow indebtedness) entail alternative scenario great risk, analyse within framework institution’s medium- long-term financial strategy, take account financial equilibrium conditions. second, need management system use incorporate regular performance stress test adverse scenarios, consider variation real estate prices, change interest rate possible modification macroeconomic data. this analysis use regularly review institution’s strategy determine advisability establish internal control measure ameliorate residual risk incurred. particular attention require market segments, finance real-estate development activities, show high risk past. in addition, collateral security must, stipulate attendant regulations, assess market value calculate manner prudent sustainable time, i.e. possible experience potential loss adverse situation last twenty year may consistent characteristic current situation. this take account institution calculate capital consume real-estate loan advance basel ii approaches. but need prudent assessment limit credit institutions: appraisal company play key role spain’s financial system hence essential operate clear prudential guideline lay specific regulations. the sustainability results, recurrence, diversity income source ongoing search efficiency need strengthen line defence represent high profitability spain’s institutions. in respect, must overlook behaviour liability side bank balance sheets. the finance high volume asset make possible access efficient financial market spain join euro area. this enable supplement traditional deposit-based financing, despite strong momentum insufficient finance lend activities. although gear part parcel lend business, grow access 10 bi review 45/2005 international financial

project direct impact credit institutions: ifrs (international financial report standards) new capital accord, basel ii. the european union decide january 2005 consolidate account group security quote regulate market eu prepare use international account standard (ias). it aim assist grow integration european single market ensure investor access financial information high possible level homogeneity. in addition, international financial system strengthened, since plurinational nature ia facilitate convergence standard us. the banco de españa, accordance competence account regulation spanish credit institutions, decide undertake project extend use ia consolidate financial statement individual, regulatory prudential ones, thereby avoid cost uncertainty diverse account criteria. this initiative give rise new account circular 4/2004. through circular, banco de españa acknowledge share benefit derive effort achieve great account harmonisation, pursuing, supervisory capacity, legitimate interest quality account standard effective implementation. also, since process approval adoption new international standard mark complexity undergo certain timetable difficulties, banco de españa’s new circular also intend endow process, far possible, great degree certainty. the complexity new account standard arise process refer to, also basically modification contain them, since involve notable change numerous matter important credit institution management impose new responsibility manager election account policies. although early make detail assessment introduction new account standards, force months, initial evaluation banco de españa positive, major effort work financial institution connection acknowledged. a regard basel ii, june 2004 saw publication final text “a revise framework international convergence capital measurement capital standards”. the notable new development allow institution use internal risk measurement methodology meet certain minimum requirement accept supervisor. the possibility use advance methodology depend development risk management systems, effective integration system management, adaptation technological environment availability consistent integrate historical information databases. bi review 45/2005 11 although accord enter force 2007, work commence long complicate task development, implementation, internal validation institution review banco de españa methodologies, speed inevitably differ depend preparedness institutions. furthermore, european parliament debate directive legally implement basel ii appropriately adapt specific feature eu institution markets. it difficult state, nutshell, new accord signify. perhaps noteworthy three core idea three pillar rest: recognition regulation sound practice risk management, along incentive encourage them; strengthen supervisor’s judgement, add factor safety; importance market discipline, i.e. active scrutiny market, shareholder creditors, imply continual strengthen transparency. it latter aspect, relate pillar iii, least well-known, although great potential medium term disseminate best practice risk management. of course, completion basel ii begin implementation process, credit institutions, also supervisors. in respect, i believe institution supervisory model magnificent position lead implementation process insofar quality concerned. and process yield good manage institution effective supervision. these two key regulatory issue raise points. first, development ia basel ii make necessary strengthen international co-operation supervision regulation. the international expansion spanish bank presence large number jurisdiction differ feature raise need establish close bilateral relation authority countries, good comply respective responsibilities. in addition, new european legislation financial conglomerate also address depth need great co-operation. specifically, eu opt solution base co-operation supervisor appropriate (and essential) approach. indeed, prevail course action present, rout through, example, ecb bank supervisory committee recently create committee european bank supervisors, “level 3

co-operation supervisors. grow supervisory co-operation become unavoidable headway make necessary process integration single financial market. in respect, cannot ignore pace integration far

authority must play supervise single market different level integration various area business and, furthermore, advocate increasingly important role authority home country pan-european institutions. flexibility need adapt level co-operation pace set development integration various segment single market. finally, regard change currently way, major source change intense regulatory process bank sector lately subjected. the adaptation new account standard issue iasb, spain set new account circular, preparation implement new capital accord two landmark project undoubtedly call major effort european institutions. this effort absorb extensive resource deserve full support. in respect, i consider that, process intense regulatory change, focus achieve proper implementation allow 12 bi

govern board swiss national bank, swiss chinese chamber commerce (swisscham), beijing, 10 june 2005. * * * i please guest today swiss-chinese chamber commerce speak word you. i sure necessary convince importance globalisation trade. you live proof export sector’s dynamism willingness adapt change circumstances. by presence china, contribute country’s influence abroad, also expansion economy. a know, economic globalisation often get bad press switzerland. some fellow citizen condemn it, hop barrier delocalisation might strengthen situation labour market. but let’s lead astray scaremongers! those succumb fear fall victim illusion. a policy inactivity synonymous consolidation, decline. it important realise swiss investment abroad, particularly low-wage countries, secure high add value job home. a small country, therefore choice trade rest world want prosper. this mean continuously face challenge international competition. nevertheless, many observers, switzerland remain tiny spot european map, country 7.5 million inhabitant completely surround european union whose population already grow several hundred million. our geographical position obviously put question join european union squarely centre often heat debates. for economy, however, real challenge become european, open global markets. today, switzerland merely quaint little country tourists; home watchmaker banker train run time. this cliché thing past. switzerland today global production platform 4 million job within border 1.8 million people work swiss company abroad. this ratio unique industrialise country. it result long tradition switzerland’s presence abroad. we familiar big name industry which, early begin last century, courageously invest abroad goal conquer new markets. switzerland’s identity world often good perceive activity international committee red cross big companies, rather diplomacy. the internationalisation swiss economy slow recent year - contrary, amplified. let’s look figures: 20 year ago, current account surplus, i.e. foreign investment, account 5% swiss gdp. today, amount 13%. it also say time one franc three make abroad. today, one franc two! the 1990s mark real turn point economy’s trend toward globalisation. our commercial relation china exemplary regard. after level approximately 900 million franc year late 1990s, export china grow rapid pace recent years, reach 2.9 billion franc 2004. with regard chinese export switzerland, trend spectacular, much steady. sale product manufacture china swiss market rise continuously 20 year now, textiles, electronic equipment - naturally - product component reintegrate domestic production. owe soar export china, trade balance country thus flatten steadily; toward end 1990s, clearly negative, 2004 even slight surplus. despite rapid expansion trade china, overall significance remain modest, amount 2% total swiss trade. from chinese perspective, relative importance trade relation switzerland even smaller. switzerland account le 1% chinese import exports. a similar picture observe respect swiss foreign direct investment here. despite thirty-fold increase 1993 2003, still amount le 0.6% total swiss investment abroad. all show enormous potential expansion bilateral economic relation two countries. bi review 45/2005 1 many politician europe seem forget china, like emerge economy asia south america, become one dynamic pole global economy recent years. by contrast, europe trail behind term growth. this precisely globalisation make sense economy open international market ours. for historical geographical reasons, country expose considerable commercial risk europe: 60% export destine european countries; account 25%, germany rank first among export markets. these european market long dynamic today, future. it essential step diversification process ensure expansion export sector. it therefore best interest strengthen economic relation asia, particular china. business relation industrialise country china currently take centre stage political discussions. in particular, harsh criticism level china exchange rate policy peg currency u dollar despite fact make considerable progress term efficiency. a representative country float exchange rate thirty year now, i underscore importance exchange rate regime reflect reality market. during past three decades, swiss franc essential factor development swiss economy. however, never reason exporter sit back relax. on contrary, franc put pressure become efficient specialise product area real competitive edge. consumer also profit strong swiss franc price import good fall significantly. a currency accurately price enable economy benefit improvement term trade trigger productivity increases. if country’s currency undervalued, product sell market give-away prices, productive resource inefficiently allocated. the function currency system, therefore, play pivotal role development country’s prosperity, monetary reform, china currently expect tackle, delicate undertaking. unless new monetary rule mechanism immediately convince market appropriateness new regime, risk speculative pressure emerge. switzerland experience regard well. we ultimately opt flexible exchange rates, i.e. system swiss franc’s value continuously line market forces. in view, float rate panacea, volatile case market disruption. at times, swiss franc push level long compatible economic reality country’s fundamentals. these episode last limit time, however. another advantage flexible swiss franc change international monetary system little bear currency largely determine switzerland’s economic realities. consequently, launch euro - major event monetary scene recent year - lead disappearance destabilisation franc fear some. though euro - intent purpose - accept mean payment switzerland, euro circulation french franc german mark prior monetary integration. furthermore, calm characterise foreign exchange market europe since disappearance national currency mitigate speculative pressure franc. our currency therefore le volatile before. last least, contrary pessimistic assumption swiss national bank would shadow policy european central bank, able set interest rate accord need swiss economy. on whole, monetary regime pass test impose change european monetary system fly colours. even though switzerland modest player international scene carry weight one would imagine. the country’s edge lie small size, leave option open international trade. moreover, liberal philosophy sound financial stand give necessary tool conduct policy openness strong presence abroad. have choose option free trade free movement capital, switzerland is, many respects, good prepare others take advantage great open border bring globalisation. to sure, easy ride, international competition always necessitate painful adjustments, switzerland exception respect. when take stock last years, however, bottom line look favourable. we would certainly even good position now, build strong presence emerge economies. a see, contrary 2 bi review 45/2005 people believe, globalisation cause weak growth swiss economy; indeed opposite true. foreign trade engine drive economy. it expand recent year step global economy. by contrast, domestic market stagnate register limit gain productivity. and that, lady gentlemen, problem lies. bi review 45/2005 3 donald l

individual way reduce regulatory burden bank organizations. the board consider incorporate comment relevant regulation move forward regulation review efforts. while bank agency achieve burden reduction administrative action, congress play critical role regulatory relief process. many proposal reduce regulatory burden require congressional action implement. moreover, congress ultimate responsibility establish overall regulatory framework bank organizations, action congress ensure regulatory relief consistent framework establish maintain safety soundness bank organization promote important public policy goals. interest reserves, reserve requirement interest demand deposit i please note board’s important regulatory relief suggestion - include authorize federal reserve pay interest balance hold depository institution reserve banks, enhance board’s flexibility set reserve requirements, permit depository institution pay interest demand deposit - recently pass house part h.r. 1224, business check freedom act 2005. let briefly explain board support passage amendments, either stand-alone bill part broad regulatory relief bill. i also discus little late board support aspect h.r. 1224 would, first time, authorize industrial loan company operate outside supervisory framework establish insure bank offer interest-bearing transaction account business customers. for purpose implement monetary policy, board oblige law establish reserve requirement certain deposit hold depository institutions. because federal reserve pay interest balance hold reserve bank meet reserve requirements, depository incentive reduce reserve balance minimum. to so, engage variety reserve avoidance activities, include sweep arrangement move fund deposit bi review 44/2005 1 subject reserve requirement deposit money market investment not. these sweep program similar activity absorb real resource therefore diminish efficiency bank system. h.r. 1224 would allow federal reserve pay depository institution interest require reserve balances, would remove substantial portion incentive depository engage reserve avoidance measures. the result improvement efficiency eventually pass bank borrower depositors. besides require reserve balances, depository institution also voluntarily hold two type balance reserve bank account - contractual clear balance excess reserve balances. h.r. 1224 would authorize federal reserve pay explicit interest balance well. this authority would enhance federal reserve’s toolkit efficiently conduct monetary policy. in order federal open market committee (fomc) conduct monetary policy effectively, important sufficient predictable demand balance reserve bank exist system know volume reserve supply (or remove) open market operation achieve fomc’s target federal fund rate. authorize federal reserve pay explicit interest contractual clear balance excess reserve balances, addition require reserve balances, could potentially provide demand voluntary balance would stable enough monetary policy implement effectively exist procedure without need require reserve balances. in circumstances, board could consider use authority grant h.r. 1224 reduce - even eliminate - reserve requirements, thereby reduce regulatory burden depository institutions, without adversely affect federal reserve’s ability conduct monetary policy. have authority pay interest excess reserve also could help mitigate potential volatility overnight interest rates. if federal reserve authorize pay interest excess reserves, so, rate pay would act minimum overnight interest rates, bank would generally lend bank low rate could earn keep excess fund reserve bank. although board see need pay interest excess reserve near future, movement direction would need study, ability would potentially useful addition monetary toolkit federal reserve. the board also strongly support provision h.r. 1224 would repeal statutory restriction currently prohibit depository institution pay interest demand deposits. repeal prohibition interest demand deposit would improve overall efficiency financial sector and, particular, assist small bank attract retain business deposits. to compete liquid asset businesses, bank compel set complicate procedure pay implicit interest compensate balance account spend resource - charge fee - sweep excess demand deposit business money market investment nightly basis. small banks, however, often resource develop sweep program need compete deposit business customers. moreover, standpoint overall economy, expense incur institution size implement program waste resource would unnecessary institution permit pay interest demand deposit directly. the cost incur bank operate program pass on, directly indirectly, large small business customers. authorize bank pay interest demand deposit would eliminate need customer pay costly sweep compensate balance arrangement earn return demand deposits. h.r. 1224 contain provision intend address potential federal budgetary impact proposal require reserve bank transfer capital surplus treasury cover budgetary cost pay interest require reserve 2009. a board consistently point out, transfer would provide true offset budgetary costs. although transfer would allow treasury issue few securities, federal reserve would need low hold treasury security amount make require transfers. thus, level treasury debt hold public sector would unchanged, treasury’s interest payments, net receipt federal reserve, would unaffected. 2 bi review 44/2005 de novo interstate branch the board propose amendment would remove outdated barrier de novo interstate branch banks. since enactment riegle-neal interstate bank branch efficiency act 1994 (riegle-neal act), fifty state permit bank expand interstate basis acquisition exist bank state. interstate bank good banks, good consumer economy. while number bank fall recent years, number branch rise sharply 71,000 2004 compare approximately 50,000 1990. more 2,000 branch open bank 2004 alone. the creation new branch help maintain competitiveness dynamism american bank industry improve access bank service otherwise under-served markets. it result good bank service household small businesses, low interest rate loans, high interest rate deposits. interstate branch also increase convenience customer live, work, operate across state borders. however, riegle-neal act permit bank open branch new state without acquire another bank host state enact legislation expressly permit entry de novo branch (an opt-in requirement). to date, twenty-one state district columbia enact form opt-in legislation, twenty-nine state continue require interstate entry acquisition exist bank. this limitation de novo branch obstacle interstate entry bank also create special problem small bank seek operate across state lines. moreover, create unlevel play field bank federal save associations, long allow establish de novo branch interstate basis. the board’s propose amendment would remove last obstacle full interstate branch bank level play field bank thrifts. the amendment also would remove parallel provision allow state impose minimum requirement age bank acquire out-of-state bank organization. these change would allow banks, include particular small bank near state borders, good serve customer establish new interstate branch acquire newly charter bank across state lines. it also would increase competition provide bank le costly method offer service new locations. the establishment operation new interstate branch would continue subject regulatory provision condition establish congress de novo interstate branches, include financial, managerial, community reinvestment requirement set forth riegle-neal act. small bank examination flexibility another amendment board support would expand number small institution qualify extend examination cycle. federal law currently mandate appropriate federal bank agency conduct on-site examination insure depository institution least every twelve months. the statute, however, permit institution $250 million le asset meet certain capital, managerial, criterion examine eighteen-month cycle. a primary federal supervisor state-chartered banks, board federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) may alternate responsibility conduct examination appropriate state supervisory authority board fdic determine state examination carry purpose statute. the $250 million asset cutoff eighteen-month examination cycle raise since 1994. the board’s propose amendment would raise asset cap $250 million $500 million, thus potentially allow approximately additional 1,100 insure depository institution qualify eighteen-month examination cycle. the propose amendment would provide meaningful relief small institution without jeopardize safety soundness insure depository institutions. under propose amendment, institution le $500 million asset would qualify eighteen-month examination cycle institution well capitalized, well managed, meet criterion establish congress federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 1991. the amendment also would continue require insure depository institution undergo full-scope, on-site examination least every twelve eighteen months. importantly, agency would continue ability examine institution frequently time agency determine bi review 44/2005 3 examination necessary appropriate. despite advance off-site monitoring, board continue believe regular on-site examination play critical role help bank supervisor detect correct asset, risk-management internal control problem institution problem result claim deposit insurance funds. permit board grant exception attribution rule the board propose another amendment believe help bank organization maintain attractive benefit program employees. the bank hold company act (bhc act) generally prohibit bank hold company owning, aggregate, 5 percent vote share company without board’s approval. the bhc act also provide share hold trust benefit bank hold company’s shareholder employee deem control bank hold company itself. this attribution rule intend prevent bank hold company use trust establish benefit management, shareholders, employee evade bhc act’s restriction acquisition share bank nonbanking companies. while attribution rule prove useful tool prevent evasion bhc act, always provide appropriate result. for example, may appropriate apply attribution rule share question acquire 401(k) plan widely hold by, operate benefit of, employee bank hold company. in situations, bank hold company may ability influence purchase sale decision employee otherwise control share hold plan trust employees. the suggest amendment would allow board address situation authorize board grant exception attribution rule appropriate. reduce cross-marketing restriction another amendment propose board would modify cross-marketing restriction impose gramm-leach-bliley act (glb act) merchant bank insurance company investment financial hold companies. the glb act generally prohibit depository institution control financial hold company engage cross-marketing activity nonfinancial company own financial hold company glb act’s merchant bank insurance company investment authorities. however, glb act currently permit depository institution subsidiary financial hold company, board approval, engage limit cross-marketing activity statement stuffer internet website nonfinancial company hold act’s insurance company investment authority (but act’s merchant bank authority). the board’s propose amendment would allow depository institution control financial hold company engage cross-marketing activity company hold merchant bank authority extent, subject restrictions, company hold insurance company investment authority. we believe parity treatment appropriate, see reason treat merchant bank insurance investment financial hold company differently purpose cross-marketing restriction glb act. a second aspect amendment would liberalize cross-marketing restriction apply merchant bank insurance company investments. this aspect amendment would permit depository institution subsidiary financial hold company engage cross-marketing activity nonfinancial company hold either merchant bank insurance company investment authority nonfinancial company control financial hold company. when financial hold company control portfolio company, cross-marketing activity unlikely materially undermine separation nonfinancial portfolio company financial hold company’s depository institution subsidiaries. industrial loan company a i note earlier, board strongly support allow depository institution pay interest demand deposit allow bank branch de novo across state lines. the board, however, oppose proposal would allow industrial loan company (ilcs) offer business now accounts, 4 bi review 44/2005 h.r. 1224 does, open de novo branch nationwide corporate owner ilc take advantage special exemption current law allow owner operate outside prudential framework congress establish corporate owner type insure banks. ilcs state-chartered fdic-insured bank first establish early twentieth century make small loan industrial workers. a insure banks, ilcs supervise fdic well charter state. however, special exemption current law, type company, include commercial retail firm, may acquire ilc handful state - principally utah, california, nevada - avoid activity restriction supervisory requirement impose bank hold company federal bhc act. when special exemption ilcs initially grant 1987, ilcs mostly small, local institution offer demand deposit type check accounts. in light facts, congress condition exemption requirement ilcs charter 1987 remain small (below $100 million assets) refrain offer demand deposit withdrawable check similar means. this special exemption aggressively exploit since 1987. some grandfathered state allow ilcs exercise many power commercial bank begin charter new ilcs. today, several ilcs own large, internationally active financial commercial firms. in addition, number ilcs grow large, one hold $50 billion deposit additional eight hold $1 billion deposits. affirmatively grant ilcs ability offer business now account open de novo branch across state line would permit ilcs become functional equivalent full-service insure bank operate across unite states. this result would inconsistent historical function ilcs term special exemption current law. because parent company exempt ilcs subject bhc act, authorize ilcs operate essentially full-service bank would create unlevel competitive play field among bank organization undermine framework congress establish corporate owner full-service banks. it would allow firm subject consolidate supervisory framework bhc act - include consolidate capital, examination, report requirement - control functional equivalent full-service bank. it also would allow foreign bank acquire control equivalent full-service insure bank without meet requirement bhc act foreign bank subject comprehensive supervision consolidate basis home country. in addition, would allow financial firm acquire equivalent full-service bank without comply capital, managerial, community reinvestment act (cra) requirement establish congress glb act. congress establish consolidate supervision fundamental component bank supervision unite state consolidate supervision provide important protection insure bank part large organization federal safety net support banks. financial trouble one part organization spread rapidly parts. to protect insure bank part large organization, supervisor need authority tool understand risk exist within parent organization affiliate and, necessary, address significant capital, managerial, deficiency pose danger bank. this particularly true today, hold company increasingly manage operation - risk arise operation - centralize manner cut across legal entities. risk cross legal entity manage consolidate basis simply cannot monitor properly supervision direct one, even several, legal entity within overall organization. for reasons, congress since 1956 require parent company full-service insure bank subject consolidate supervision bhc act. in addition, follow collapse bank commerce credit international (bcci), congress require foreign bank seek acquire control u.s. bank bhc act subject comprehensive supervision consolidate basis foreign bank’s home country. authorize exempt ilcs operate essentially full-service bank also would undermine framework congress establish - recently reaffirm glb act - limit affiliation bank commercial entities. this type company, include commercial firm, may exempt ilc without regard activity restriction bhc act design maintain separation bank commerce. while h.r. 1224 attempt address concern relate mix bank commerce place certain limit type bi review 44/2005 5 ilcs could offer business now accounts, limit h.r. 1224 adequately address issue. for example, h.r. 1224 would allow ilc receive fdic insurance october 1, 2003, application deposit insurance pending date, offer now account business customer long institution experience change control. thus, bill would allow commercial retail firm acquire ilc october 1, 2003, transform institution functional equivalent full-service insure bank. the bill also would allow ilc establish acquire october 1, 2003, offer business now account long ilc’s appropriate state supervisor determine company control ilc derive least 85 percent annual gross revenue activity “financial nature incidental financial activity.” importantly, bill define term reference glb act otherwise establish standard state authority use determine activity “financial nature incidental financial activity.” instead, bill leaf important determination - potential undermine nation’s longstanding policy maintain separation bank commerce - discretion ilc’s state supervisor. moreover, unlike grandfather provision glb act ilc provision bill purportedly base (see 12 u.s.c. § 1843(n)), h.r. 1224 would require company acquire ilc october 1, 2003, divest non-financial, commercial activity within specify period time. the limit contain h.r. 1224 also address risk issue present ilcs. for example, bill fail address supervisory issue associate allow domestic firm foreign bank subject consolidate supervision control functional equivalent full-service insure bank. let clear. the board oppose grant ilcs ability offer business now account open de novo branch corporate owner ilcs engage expand activity cover supervisory regulatory framework apply owner full-service insure banks. state simply, ilcs want benefit expand power become functionally indistinguishable insure banks, corporate parent subject rule apply owner full-service insure banks. the board belief important principle govern structure nation’s bank system - consolidate supervision, separation bank commerce, maintenance level play field competitor financial service marketplace - abandon without careful consideration congress. in board’s view, legislation concern payment interest demand deposit de novo branch unlikely provide appropriate vehicle thorough consideration consequence alter key principles. conclusion i appreciate opportunity discus board’s legislative suggestion priority concern regulatory relief. the board would please work subcommittee, full committee, staff move forward develop consider regulatory relief legislation. appendix:

association, mumbai, 22 june 2005. * * * fellow participant colleagues, it give great pleasure midst, commence workshop bank security. i particularly happy address group involve person harbinger change - say - use technology banking. bank business involve management risks. while much say financial risks, risk arise large scale implementation technology recent origin, bank take large scale use technology normal day-to-day business. security bank thus assume significant proportions, comprise physical aspect addition relate information, information system information technology, impact reputational risk financial organisation. in world geographical barrier lose significance death distance already reality, essential security give prime importance transnational scenario large sum

financial service industry. the vision desire objective large extent depend desire aspiration economy, expect role financial sector economy, stage development economy financial sector degree international integration rest world. the master plan also serve key reference document guide country chart orderly development islamic financial system. the broad strategy action plans, necessary milestone need pursue medium long term develop islamic financial system identified. within define parameters, country distinct option determine best course action achieve envisage country vision. experience member country compile serve references. it need recognize however, plan provide strategic direction, implementation need manage flexibility. the approach implementation action plan outline bi review 49/2005 1 master plan need do iterative manner, take account potential change may occur domestic external environment. the master plan also identify build block various part financial sector need put place provide foundation progress built. the financial master plan thus provide sequence priority identify key financial infrastructure need put place advance forward. in areas, implementation simultaneous, others direct route take enable rapid pace development. in design formulate master plan, consideration need give diversity member country idb. the member country various

this could range development islamic bank system efficiently intermediate fund economy, place sophisticate islamic bank financial system internationally integrate itself, engine growth. 2 bi review 49/2005 pre-requisites islamic bank system the development vibrant dynamic islamic bank system meaningful role nation's future economic social development require well-defined strategy focus two main areas, build institutional capacity development support financial infrastructure. allow highlight key area strategies. the first task identify nature islamic bank system appropriate country - whether ultimately adopt dual bank system islamic bank conventional bank offer islamic bank product operate parallel conventional bank system, alternatively adopt single bank system fully accord shariah injunction bank islamic. second, measure need place ensure islamic bank well-capitalised resilient. for islamic bank already existence, clear criterion need specify minimum capital size would enable significant player market, able gain economy scale, diversify earn base strong market presence. such minimum size either achieve organic growth merger partner bank would bring desire outcome short period time. incentive provide induce bank consolidate guideline minimum capital size impose ensure bank either merge undergo recapitalisation exercise. in case country embark introduction islamic banks, could achieve issue new islamic bank licences. third, country dual bank system, conventional bank allow offer islamic bank products, must adequate firewall ensure absolute separation bank operation avoid co-mingling islamic conventional funds. this ensure integrity islamic bank operation sanctity islamic funds. the firewall would need include separate capital funds, cheque clear systems, clear account central bank, settlement account report systems. fourth, regardless choice system, important stakeholder institution play role effectively efficiently generate improvement entity. of importance, strong leadership management team firm commitment toward performance capacity enhancements. in addition, investment requisite talent skill essential spearhead development islamic financial products. fifth, need put place comprehensive legal infrastructure. enactment islamic bank law important part process. for conventional bank offer islamic bank products, amendment exist bank legislation may necessary allow bank undertake trade-related activity multi-faceted functions. the investment policy government may need review provide issue islamic investment instrument facilitate liquidity operation bank institutions. in addition, legal fraternity competent shariah civil law also important. finally, dual bank system, tax legislation accord neutrality treatment islamic conventional bank products. sixth, development comprehensive shariah framework fundamental part process. each institution offer islamic product need establish shariah advisory committee ensure islamic transactions, product operation shariah-compliant. shariah decision need make transparent promote great understand acceptance decisions. seventh, importance robust effective regulatory supervisory framework cannot over-emphasised. while financial regulation supervision islamic bank institution would similar, area capital adequacy, liquidity framework take account unique risk

athens, 24 june 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like thank prof. richard porte kind introduction. it indeed honour pleasure address distinguish audience academic practitioner specialize field european economic policy broad issue link euro. this meet important event. it take place time tension impact single monetary policy euro area several commentator raise doubt sustainability monetary union. europe's single-currency undertake perhaps bold attempt ever large diverse group sovereign state attempt reap efficiency gain use common currency. the euro create new monetary reality 307 million european would think possible generation ago. like bold undertakings, however, euro share up downs. when euro launch 1999, skeptic doubtful whether would possible make euro stable currency. yet, euro, probably visible tangible symbol integration process, seventh year firmly credibly establish stable currency. today, i want address widely-debated issue - namely, whether single monetary policy fit party supposedly heterogeneous currency area. this issue debate extensively since start emu. the debate recently intensified, reflect concern increase divergence growth rate past quarter uncertainty derive french dutch rejection constitutional treaty. before i discus issue, allow offer follow qualification. my perspective someone greece, small, open economy history high inflation enormous fiscal deficit 1980s first half 1990s. other countries' perspective might well highlight feature i discuss. emu: an optimum currency area perspective emu bring unique challenge monetary policy. critical observer take view single monetary policy doom failure. this skepticism support argument traditional theory optimum currency areas, recommend monetary unification among economy flexible markets, free mobility labour, centralise fiscal policy, limit incidence asymmetric shocks. clearly, condition - - hold euro area. after all, euro zone characterise significant rigidity labour product markets, absence significant centralise fiscal transfer mechanism, national economy unique institutional economic feature - set circumstance result high incidence impact asymmetric shocks. in circumstances, argument goes, shock likely lead widen price differential common nominal interest rate monetary union result different real interest rate among countries. for member country relatively-strong domestic demand higher-than-average inflation rate, low real interest rate fuel domestic demand national inflation. conversely, country relatively-weak domestic demand lower-than-average inflation rate, high real interest rate put downward pressure domestic demand inflation. a one-size monetary policy, words, match need members. the foregoing, traditional view optimum currency area neglect several important factors. it seek identify characteristic country satisfy prior join monetary union - is, ex ante. we know, however, participation monetary union may induce change economic structure performance ex post least two channels. these channel operate enhance credibility trade financial integration. how credibility channel work? a major benefit participate emu, especially country greece, italy, portugal, spain recent history relatively-high inflation rates, credibility gain derive eliminate inflation bias discretionary monetary bi review 49/2005 1 policy. with low stable inflation inflation expectations, nominal interest-rate differential country country history relatively-low inflation rates, germany, almost eliminated. with low nominal interest rate traditionally high-inflation countries, cost service public-sector debt reduced, facilitate fiscal adjustment, free resource uses. moreover, low stable inflation, economic horizon lengthen, encourage transformation financial sector. the lengthen horizon reduction interest rate stimulate private investment risk taking, foster fast growth. for greece, enter euro zone mean loss independent monetary policy - fruit amply demonstrate 1980s early 1990s - also credibility gain associate stable, low-inflation monetary regime. in 15 year 1994 - year greece's effort qualify euro-area entry begin earnest - inflation average almost 20 per cent real growth average le 1 per cent. in contrast, past 6 year real growth average 4 per cent inflation slightly 3 per cent. another way infer credibility gain look interest-rate spreads. in 1997, year 10-year government bond first issue greek financial market, yield differential bond comparable german bond 412 basis points. today, stand 24 basis points. i suggest, therefore, give nationally-tailored monetary policy not, fact, cost, benefit. now let turn trade channel. recent empirical work show common currency promote trade growth effect produce separate currency tie together fix exchange rates. for euro area, evidence suggest adoption euro already increase trade among emu member 4 16 per cent compare trade among european country adopt euro. increase trade integration lead more-highly-correlated business cycle common demand shock great intra-industry trade, reduce need country-specific monetary policies. there additional reason monetary union reduce incidence country-specific shocks. one principal cause asymmetric shock - effect divergent monetary policy - long exists. furthermore, expect deepen financial-market integration also entail convergence transmission mechanism monetary impulses. finally, common currency help increase price transparency and, therefore, competition goods, service factor markets, lead alignment economic cycles. inflation differential the fact remains, however, inflation differential among member euro zone. how significant differential concern be? recent evidence provide ecb show that, period 1990-99, 12 country comprise euro area experience downward trend degree inflation dispersion - measure standard deviation dispersion - 6 percentage point early 1990s low le one percentage point second half 1999. since time, inflation dispersion change little - is, remain le percentage point. to provide basis comparison, since 1999 inflation dispersion across euro area fluctuate close level observe across 14 metropolitan statistical area unite states. remarkably, process nominal convergence euro area accompany great dispersion real gdp growth rates, remain close historical average around 2 percentage point follow adoption euro. there one notable difference, however, inflation differential euro area unite states. although inflation differential euro area widened, exhibit relatively-high degree persistence, high experience across 14 metropolitan statistical area unite states. seven 12 euro-area economy record annual inflation rate remain either persistently persistently euro-area average since 1999. one country greece, inflation persistently exceed euro-area average one-and-a-half percentage point since greece become member euro area 2001. several factor contribute persistence inflation differential across euro-area economies. one factor relatively-low income countries, greece, call balassa-samuelson effect, accord long-term differential regional inflation attributable 2 bi review 49/2005 difference rate productivity increase various regions' tradable non-tradable good sectors. although difficult quantify effect precision, provide partial explanation persistent inflation differential exist euro area. in case, effect transitory one. it part i call adjustment mechanism - case, adjustment high standard living. other factor contribute inflation differential within euro area, include misalign fiscal policies, wage dynamic link productivity development structural inefficiency rigidity product factor markets, benign. redress problems, know, within domain monetary policy. national economic policy relevant instrument enhance ability individual country respond economic shock national divergences. i believe emu help stimulate reform euro area. major reform undo rigidity accumulate decades, prepare social institution loom demographic change make euro area increasingly competitive internationally. it crucial continue strengthen competition labour product markets, example, liberalisation deregulation, improve efficiency price signals. national fiscal policy also provide important instruments. they react shock way counteract emergence differentials. however, sound public finance essential element price stability necessary automatic stabilizer work fully without risk excessively high deficits. in respect important government strive achieve balance budget surplus period favourable economic activity. what difference would change make? i previously refer relatively-low dispersion real growth rate euro area, is, fact, order magnitude near exist among region unite states. the dispersion among u regions, however, center around high average growth rate. since 1999, u economy, flexible euro zone, grow average rate 3.1 per cent, compare 1.9 per cent average euro area. it important national labour market policy enhance flexibility national regional levels. structural policy also aim improve efficiency wage price set mechanism reduce persistence inflation divergence. in connection, i note countries, greece, wage behaviour fully adapt new regime. conclusion let conclude follow thoughts. recent event give rise populist rhetoric wisdom single currency within europe. a commentator pose question: why monetary union europe? my perspective different. i share sentiment colleague govern council dismiss "absurd" speculation euro area's future throw doubt. a single-size monetary policy work extremely well, deliver price stability change price convey effective information demand supply conditions. the credibility ecb's monetary policy deliver interest rate historically low level member country euro-area. yet, price stability low interest rate enough raise growth improve live standards. they provide fabric upon dynamic europe woven. recent events, view, confirm currency union require great competition independent monetary areas. market reform strict fiscal rule luxury member monetary union, necessities. in response asking, "why single currency? let cite wise word pen late irish playwright, george bernard shaw. "some people," wrote, "look thing ask, 'why?' i look thing might be, ask 'why not?'" this, lady gentlemen, way i look future europe. why not, indeed? lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 49/2005 3 christian noyer: the contribution payment infrastructure european financial integration establishment sepa (single euro payment area) speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france, 20th anniversary european bank association (eba), paris, 23 june 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, i please join today celebrate 20th anniversary european bank association (eba), paris palais brongniart. first all, i would like give credit eba strong commitment favour european financial integration. this commitment lead eba set large value payment system euro 1 retail payment system step 1 step 2. central bank eurosystem, like central bank, keen interest secure financial system fall monetary competence unified, competitive stable. this essential european economy, consider high degree financial integration enable efficient transmission monetary policy, good allocation financial resources, minimisation cost capital, well fast safe execution payment across call sepa, say single euro payment area. different factor support development fully integrate financial system european level. today, i emphasise key driver process - payment infrastructures. in particular, i focus already do area remain done. i start underline importance, european financial integration, development efficient safe payment infrastructures. then, i ass progress make field since launch euro. i mention immediately assessment mixed. on one hand, i consider situation favourable large-value payment systems. on hand, i can’t yet make positive assessment concern retail payment systems. a consequence, i end presentation elaborate development need strengthen integration retail payments. 1. payment infrastructure necessary driver financial integration payment infrastructure cover procedure system use financial intermediary exchange payment order issue economic agents. accordingly, play fundamental role smooth function economy whole. indeed, provide allow financial transfer take place economic agent efficient safe way, payment infrastructure key support one core function money, namely money mean exchange. in eu, infrastructure process payment euro consist number arrangements, different nature. for example, exchange payment order euro financial intermediary handle within multilateral system within framework correspondent bank bilateral arrangements. although great number arrangement ensure money transfer financial intermediaries, practice, financial transfer tend concentrate them. thus, large volume value payment order currently carry multilateral payment systems. on basis several survey conduct eurosystem since 1999, consider market share system nearly 80 %, term volume value. however, minimise role correspondent banking, hold remain 20 % market. correspondent bank arrangement also show high degree concentration: report bank eurosystem’s survey, ten large bank account 80 % overall value correspondent bank transactions. moreover, correspondent activity bank substantial similar size interbank fund transfer systems. the issue infrastructure diversity payment euro across eu raise prior to, due to, introduction euro. at time, realise diversity drawback bi review 49/2005 1 extent come together discrepancy service level national cross border payments, expense latter. with respect objective financial integration, clear situation could consider optimum. the issue take account launch euro. the re-engineering payment processing, aim notably close identify efficiency safety gap cross-border national payment infrastructures, appear pillar ensure high degree monetary financial integration europe. the eurosystem closely involve lift obstacle european financial integration particular respect relate payment infrastructures, support market initiatives, include notably eba. the rationale involvement line statutory role eurosystem. indeed, pursuant treaty, responsibility ensure smooth function payment system one basic statutory task eurosystem. therefore, eurosystem participate far process integration three roles. firstly, service provider clear settlement large value payments, operation target system. secondly, catalyst market participants’ effort creation sepa retail payments. thirdly, overseer function system process payment euro. 2. the present situation display significant discrepancy integration payment infrastructure let ass achievement integration process payment infrastructures. the degree integration depend segment payment infrastructure market. while large value payment segment already reach high level streamline consolidation progress launch target 2 system, retail payment segment still fragmented. in area large value payment infrastructures, degree integration increase quickly. we bear mind euro 1 target clearly set face challenge emu. it great importance large value payments, particular link money market, rely system handle efficiently safely cross border transactions. moreover, target prerequisite effective conduct single monetary policy, ensure settlement monetary policy operations. the timeframe particularly tight build target system. therefore, design target 1 base principle minimum harmonisation decentralise architecture, interlink national rtgs (real-time gross settlement systems). target 2, due go live 2007, improve degree integration wholesale payment infrastructures. it provide fully harmonise settlement service across europe real-time central bank money, support single price structure domestic cross-border payment single process platform. this single platform use central bank escb provide service bank community. target 2 enhance cost-efficiency meet state-of-the-art business continuity procedures. a result, le ten year since launch euro, number large value payment system euro operate eu dramatically reduced: number drop 21 ( i.e 16 component target1 plus 5 privately-owned systems) 2 (target2 euro 1). to sum up, shortly foot unite state term integration large-value payment infrastructures. on retail side, situation quite different. indeed, today eu, 15 multilateral clear settlement system euro, almost number 10 year ago, clear sign time number go fall significantly short medium run. the market therefore characterize multiplicity national multilateral retail payment systems, coexist various payment arrangement bilateral schemes, international card scheme bank “clubs”. it fair say significant step towards integration nevertheless make since introduction euro banknote coins. in 2002, european bank community launch sepa project, final objective 2010 “all payment treat domestic far speed, security, convenience cost concerned”. 2 bi review 49/2005 however, meet ambitious objective imply significant evolution current retail infrastructure towards pan european infrastructure, call peach, aim reinforce global efficiency payment europe. the main achievement regard infrastructure launch step2, since first infrastructure compliant peach requirements, define epc. but still significant way go since step2 handle low volumes, 170.000 payment may 2005, still offer level service national achs. in context, must see positive prospect national retail payment system prepare implementation sepa, spread use standardisation, allow interoperability infrastructures. in france example, several bank initiate stet project view sepa. however, one note idea consolidate retail system platform time really forefront market initiatives, even though consolidation source cost save efficiency. why gap level integration large-value payment system retail payment systems? i see two main explanations. first, large value payment system benefit incentive adoption single monetary policy euro area, make creation target mandatory. second, integration retail payment infrastructure complex issue. large value payment infrastructure handle one type payment instrument, fund credit transfer, whereas diversity retail payment instrument make integration national retail infrastructure difficult. in addition, transition cost significant coordination problem solve important. 3. the integration retail payment infrastructure become priority agenda eurosystem it particularly important european bank community focus retail payment issue take particular challenge create fully integrate retail payment infrastructure. the stake obvious - success sepa. tool build sepa infrastructure know us, i would like mention briefly: deal enforce standardisation interoperability system one side, ensure equal access financial intermediary without consider national location side. the epc express commitment deliver two pan-european payment scheme - one credit transfer one direct debits- develop framework card available client 2008. furthermore, epc expect “a critical mass transaction naturally migrate payment instrument 2010 sepa irreversible operation market force network effects”. from point view, successful, new strategy epc require two main condition fulfilled. the first condition make sure pan-european instrument attractive consumers. a regard first condition, i would like draw attention one point: order really attractive, pan-european payment instrument need “best breed” say service level provide converge towards best service level europe. the second condition infrastructure ready support critical mass effect expect term adoption customer pan-european payment instruments. the 2010 deadline infrastructure “sepa compliant”, recommend eurosystem, therefore important. this “sepa compliance” infrastructure imply particular interoperability retail infrastructure ensured. define enforce requirement interoperability certainly part self-regulation space claim epc. in line supportive stance market efforts, eurosystem, jean-claude trichet already explain morning, stand ready assist bank industry definition implementation requirements. to conclude, i would like stress essential effort put together bank industry since 2002 bear fruit sepa become shortly tangible reality citizens, company economic agents. change function payment infrastructure key enabler result obtained. the sector wholesale payment enter crucial stage consolidation due launch target 2 central banks. a breakthrough also necessary retail side: field infrastructure breakthrough notably mean bi review 49/2005 3 interoperability increase competition, market select best infrastructure sepa. thank attention. 4 bi review 49/2005 mark w olson: regulatory relief testimony mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 21 june 2005. * * * chairman shelby, senator sarbanes, member committee, thank opportunity testify issue relate regulatory relief. the board aware current grow regulatory burden impose nation’s bank organizations. often burden fall particularly hard small institutions, few resource large brethren. the board strongly support effort congress review periodically federal bank law determine whether streamline without compromise safety soundness bank organizations, consumer protections, important objective congress establish financial system. in 2003, chairman shelby’s request, board provide committee number legislative proposal believe consistent goal. since then, board continue work federal bank agency staff regulatory relief matter board recently agree support several additional regulatory relief proposals. a summary proposal support board include appendix testimony. in remarks, i highlight board’s three high priority proposals. these three proposal would allow federal reserve pay interest balance hold depository institution reserve banks, provide board great flexibility set reserve requirements, permit depository institution pay interest demand deposits. these amendment would improve efficiency financial sector, assist small bank small businesses, enhance federal reserve’s toolkit efficiently conduct monetary policy. i also mention additional proposal board support would provide meaningful regulatory relief bank organizations. the board look forward work congress, fellow bank agency interest party develop analyze potential regulatory relief proposal legislative process move forward. for part, board strive review regulation least every five year identify provision date otherwise unnecessary. the board also active participant ongoing regulatory review process conduct federal bank agency pursuant economic growth regulatory paperwork reduction act (egrpra). egrpra require federal bank agencies, least every ten years, review seek public comment burden associate full range agencies’ regulation affect insure depository institutions. the board bank agency midst first ten-year review cycle, i please report track complete process 2006 deadline. the agency already solicit comment four broad category regulation - include govern applications, activities, money laundering, consumer protection lend transaction - conduct outreach meet throughout country encourage public participation egrpra process. in response efforts, agency receive comment 1,000 entity individual way reduce regulatory burden bank organizations. the board consider incorporate comment relevant regulation move forward regulation review efforts. while bank agency achieve burden reduction administrative action, congress play critical role regulatory relief process. many proposal reduce regulatory burden require congressional action implement. moreover, congress ultimate responsibility establish overall regulatory framework bank organizations, action congress ensure regulatory relief consistent framework establish maintain safety soundness bank organization promote important public policy goals. interest reserve reserve requirement flexibility for purpose implement monetary policy, board oblige law establish reserve requirement certain deposit hold depository institutions. by law, board currently must set bi review 47/2005 1 ratio require reserve transaction deposit certain threshold 8 14 percent. because federal reserve pay interest balance hold reserve bank meet reserve requirements, depository incentive reduce reserve balance minimum. to so, engage variety reserve avoidance activities, include sweep arrangement move fund deposit subject reserve requirement deposit money market investment not. these sweep program similar activity absorb real resource therefore diminish efficiency bank system. the board’s propose amendment would authorize federal reserve pay depository institution interest require reserve balances. pay interest require reserve balance would remove substantial portion incentive depository engage reserve avoidance measures, result improvement efficiency eventually pass bank borrower depositors. besides require reserve balances, depository institution also voluntarily hold two type balance reserve bank account - contractual clear balance excess reserve balances. a depository institution hold contractual clear balance need high level balance require reserve balance order pay check make wire transfer account federal reserve without incur overnight overdrafts. currently, clear balance earn explicit interest, earn implicit interest form credit may use pay federal reserve services, check clearing. excess reserve balance fund hold depository institution account reserve bank excess require reserve contractual clear balances. excess reserve balance currently earn explicit implicit interest. the board’s propose amendment would authorize federal reserve pay explicit interest contractual clear balance excess reserve balances, well require reserve balances. this authority would enhance federal reserve’s ability efficiently conduct monetary policy, would complement another board’s propose amendments, would give board great flexibility set reserve requirement depository institutions. in order federal open market committee (fomc) conduct monetary policy effectively, important sufficient predictable demand balance reserve bank exist system know volume reserve supply (or remove) open market operation achieve fomc’s target federal fund rate. authorize federal reserve pay explicit interest contractual clear balance excess reserve balances, addition require reserve balances, could potentially provide demand voluntary balance would stable enough monetary policy implement effectively exist procedure without need require reserve balances. in circumstances, board, authorized, could consider reduce - even eliminate - reserve requirements, thereby reduce regulatory burden depository institutions, without adversely affect federal reserve’s ability conduct monetary policy. have authority pay interest excess reserve also could help mitigate potential volatility overnight interest rates. if federal reserve authorize pay interest excess reserves, so, rate pay would act minimum overnight interest rates, bank would generally lend bank low rate could earn keep excess fund reserve bank. although board see need pay interest excess reserve near future, movement direction would need study, ability would potentially useful addition monetary toolkit federal reserve. the payment interest require reserve balances, reduction reserve requirements, would low revenue receive treasury federal reserve. the extent potential revenue loss, however, fall last decade bank increasingly implement reserve-avoidance techniques. pay interest contractual clear balance would primarily involve switch explicit interest implicit interest currently pay form credits, therefore would essentially net cost treasury. interest demand deposit the board also strongly support repeal statutory restriction currently prohibit depository institution pay interest demand deposits. the board’s propose amendment would allow depository institution legal authority offer demand deposit pay interest deposits. a i explain little later, however, board oppose amendment would 2 bi review 47/2005 separately authorize industrial loan company operate outside supervisory regulatory framework establish insure bank offer, first time, interest bear transaction account business customers. repeal prohibition interest demand deposit would improve overall efficiency financial sector and, particular, assist small bank attract retain business deposits. to compete liquid asset businesses, bank compel set complicate procedure pay implicit interest compensate balance account spend resource - charge fee - sweep excess demand deposit business money market investment nightly basis. small banks, however, often resource develop sweep program need compete deposit business customers. moreover, standpoint overall economy, expense incur institution size implement program waste resource would unnecessary institution permit pay interest demand deposit directly. the cost incur bank operate program pass on, directly indirectly, large small business customers. authorize bank pay interest demand deposit would eliminate need customer pay costly sweep compensate balance arrangement earn return demand deposits. the payment interest demand deposit would direct effect federal revenues, interest payment would deductible bank taxable firm receive them. some proposals, h.r. 1224 - business check freedom act 2005 - recently pass house, would delay effectiveness authorization interest demand deposit two years. the board belief short implementation delay one year, even less, would best interest public efficiency financial sector. a separate provision h.r. 1224 would, effect, allow implicit interest pay demand deposit without delay new type sweep arrangement, provision would promote efficiency. it would allow bank offer reservable money market deposit account (mmda) twenty-four transfer month could make account depositor. bank would able sweep balance demand deposit mmdas night, pay interest them, sweep back demand deposit next day. this type account would likely permit bank pay interest demand deposit selectively direct interest payments. the twenty-four-transfer mmda, would useful transition period direct interest payment allowed, could implement low cost bank already sweep programs. however, bank would face competitive disadvantage pressure incur cost set new program transition one-year interim period. moreover, business would benefit mmda. hence, board advocate twenty-four-transfer account. small bank examination flexibility the board also support amendment would expand number small institution qualify extend examination cycle. federal law currently mandate appropriate federal bank agency conduct on-site examination insure depository institution least every twelve months. the statute, however, permit institution $250 million le asset meet certain capital, managerial, criterion examine eighteen-month cycle. a primary federal supervisor state-chartered banks, board federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) may alternate responsibility conduct examination appropriate state supervisory authority board fdic determine state examination carry purpose statute. the $250 million asset cutoff eighteen-month examination cycle raise since 1994. the board’s propose amendment would raise asset cap $250 million $500 million, thus potentially allow approximately additional 1,100 insure depository institution qualify eighteen-month examination cycle. the propose amendment would provide meaningful relief small institution without jeopardize safety soundness insure depository institutions. under propose amendment, institution le $500 million asset would qualify eighteen-month examination cycle institution well capitalized, well managed, meet criterion establish congress federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 1991. the amendment bi review 47/2005 3 also would continue require insure depository institution undergo full-scope, on-site examination least every twelve eighteen months. importantly, agency would continue ability examine institution frequently time agency determine examination necessary appropriate. despite advance off-site monitoring, board continue believe regular on-site examination play critical role help bank supervisor detect correct asset, risk-management, internal control problem institution problem result claim deposit insurance funds. the mandatory twelve- eighteen-month on-site examination cycle impose important discipline federal bank agencies, ensure insure depository institution go unexamined extend periods, contribute significantly safety soundness insure depository institutions. for reasons, board oppose alternative amendment would allow agency indefinitely lengthen exam cycle institution order allocate conserve agency’s examination resources. permit board grant exception attribution rule the board propose another amendment believe help bank organization maintain attractive benefit program employees. the bank hold company act (bhc act) generally prohibit bank hold company owning, aggregate, 5 percent vote share company without board’s approval. the bhc act also provide share hold trust benefit bank hold company’s shareholder employee deem control bank hold company itself. this attribution rule intend prevent bank hold company use trust establish benefit management, shareholders, employee evade bhc act’s restriction acquisition share bank nonbanking companies. while attribution rule prove useful tool prevent evasion bhc act, always provide appropriate result. for example, may appropriate apply attribution rule share question acquire 401(k) plan widely hold by, operate benefit of, employee bank hold company. in situations, bank hold company may ability influence purchase sale decision employee otherwise control share hold plan trust employees. the suggest amendment would allow board address situation authorize board grant exception attribution rule appropriate. reduce cross-marketing restriction another amendment propose board would modify cross-marketing restriction impose gramm-leach-bliley act (glb act) merchant bank insurance company investment financial hold companies. the glb act generally prohibit depository institution control financial hold company engage cross-marketing activity nonfinancial company own financial hold company glb act’s merchant bank insurance company investment authorities. however, glb act currently permit depository institution subsidiary financial hold company, board approval, engage limit cross-marketing activity statement stuffer internet website nonfinancial company hold act’s insurance company investment authority (but act’s merchant bank authority). the board’s propose amendment would allow depository institution control financial hold company engage cross-marketing activity company hold merchant bank authority extent, subject restrictions, company hold insurance company investment authority. we believe parity treatment appropriate, see reason treat merchant bank insurance investment financial hold company differently purpose cross-marketing restriction glb act. a second aspect amendment would liberalize cross-marketing restriction apply merchant bank insurance company investments. this aspect amendment would permit depository institution subsidiary financial hold company engage cross-marketing activity nonfinancial company hold either merchant bank insurance company investment authority nonfinancial company control financial hold company. 4 bi review 47/2005 when financial hold company control portfolio company, cross-marketing activity unlikely materially undermine separation nonfinancial portfolio company financial hold company’s depository institution subsidiaries. industrial loan company a i note earlier, board strongly support allow depository institution pay interest demand deposits. the board, however, oppose proposal would allow industrial loan company (ilcs) offer interest-bearing, negotiable order withdrawal (now) account business customer corporate owner ilc take advantage special exemption current law allow owner operate outside prudential framework congress establish corporate owner type insure banks. ilcs state-chartered fdic-insured bank first establish early twentieth century make small loan industrial workers. a insure banks, ilcs supervise fdic well charter state. however, special exemption current law, type company, include commercial retail firm, may acquire ilc handful state - principally utah, california, nevada - avoid activity restriction supervisory requirement impose bank hold company federal bhc act. when special exemption ilcs initially grant 1987, ilcs mostly small, local institution offer demand deposit type check accounts. in light facts, congress condition exemption requirement ilcs charter 1987 remain small (below $100 million assets) refrain offer demand deposit withdrawable check similar means. this special exemption aggressively exploit since 1987. some grandfathered state allow ilcs exercise many power commercial bank begin charter new ilcs. today, several ilcs own large, internationally active financial commercial firms. in addition, number ilcs grow large, one hold $50 billion deposit additional six hold $1 billion deposits. affirmatively grant ilcs ability offer business now account would permit ilcs become functional equivalent full-service insure banks. this result would inconsistent historical function ilcs term special exemption current law. because parent company exempt ilcs subject bhc act, authorize ilcs operate essentially full-service bank would create unlevel competitive play field among bank organization undermine framework congress establish corporate owner full-service banks. it would allow firm subject consolidate supervisory framework bhc act - include consolidate capital, examination, report requirement - control functional equivalent full-service bank. it also would allow foreign bank acquire control equivalent full-service insure bank without meet requirement bhc act foreign bank subject comprehensive supervision consolidate basis home country. in addition, would allow financial firm acquire equivalent full-service bank without comply capital, managerial, community reinvestment act (cra) requirement establish congress glb act. congress establish consolidate supervision fundamental component bank supervision unite state consolidate supervision provide important protection insure bank part large organization federal safety net support banks. financial trouble one part organization spread rapidly parts. to protect insure bank part large organization, supervisor need authority tool understand risk exist within parent organization affiliate and, necessary, address significant capital, managerial, deficiency pose danger bank. this particularly true today, hold company increasingly manage operation - risk arise operation - centralize manner cut across legal entities. risk cross legal entity manage consolidate basis simply cannot monitor properly supervision direct one, even several, legal entity within overall organization. for reasons, congress since 1956 require parent company full-service insure bank subject consolidate supervision bhc act. in addition, follow collapse bank commerce credit international (bcci), congress require bi review 47/2005 5 foreign bank seek acquire control u.s. bank bhc act subject comprehensive supervision consolidate basis foreign bank’s home country. authorize exempt ilcs operate essentially full-service bank also would undermine framework congress establish - recently reaffirm glb act - limit affiliation bank commercial entities. this type company, include commercial firm, may exempt ilc without regard activity restriction bhc act design maintain separation bank commerce. h.r. 1224 attempt address bank commerce concern raise allow ilcs offer business now account place certain limit type ilcs may engage new activities. however, governor kohn recently testify house behalf board, limit contain h.r. 1224 adequately address concerns. moreover, h.r. 1224 fail address supervisory issue associate allow domestic firm foreign bank subject consolidate supervision control functional equivalent full-service insure bank. let clear. the board oppose grant ilcs ability offer business now account corporate owner ilcs engage expand activity cover supervisory regulatory framework apply owner full-service insure banks. state simply, ilcs want benefit expand power become functionally indistinguishable insure banks, corporate parent subject rule apply owner full-service insure banks. for reason discuss above, board oppose amendment would allow exempt ilcs open de novo branch throughout unite states. affirmatively grant exempt ilcs authority offer business now account also necessary ensure provide parity among insure banks. the board’s propose amendment would allow depository institution authority offer demand deposit ability pay interest deposits. thus, board’s propose amendment would treat depository institution equally. separately grant exempt ilcs ability offer functional equivalent corporate demand deposit, hand, would grant new expand power institution already benefit special exemption current law. far promote competitive equity, proposal would promote competitive inequality financial marketplace. the board belief important principle govern structure nation’s bank system - consolidate supervision, separation bank commerce, maintenance level play field competitor financial service marketplace - abandon without careful consideration congress. in board’s view, legislation concern payment interest demand deposit unlikely provide appropriate vehicle thorough consideration consequence alter key principles. conclusion i appreciate opportunity discus board’s legislative suggestion priority concern regulatory relief. the board would please work committee staff seek develop advance meaningful regulatory relief legislation consistent nation’s public policy objectives. appendix: regulatory relief

would expand number small institution may qualify eighteen-month (rather twelve-month) examination cycle. under current law, insure depository institution must $250 million le total asset qualify eighteen-month examination cycle. see 12 u.s.c. § 1820(d). the amendment would raise asset cap $500 million, thereby potentially allow approximately additional 1,100 institution qualify extend examination cycle. 6. permit board grant exception attribution rule concern share hold trust benefit bank hold company shareholder employee the amendment would allow board, appropriate circumstances, waive attribution rule section 2(g)(2) bank hold company act (bhc act). this attribution rule currently provide that, purpose bhc act, company deem circumstance control share hold trust (such employee

(when fdic review agency). 12. streamline bank merger act procedural requirement transaction involve entity already common control the amendment eliminate need review agency bank merger involve affiliate entity request report competitive factor associate transaction bank agency attorney general. the amendment also would eliminate post-approval wait period bank merger act transaction involve affiliate entities. the merger depository institution already common control typically impact competition. 13. a. restore board’s authority determine new activity “closely relate banking” permissible bank hold company amendment would restore board’s ability determine nonbanking activity “closely relate banking” section 4(c)(8) bhc act and, thus, permissible bank hold companies, include elect

liebscher: overview financial service austria speech dr klaus liebscher, governor austrian national bank, global financial service industry 2005 summit, vienna, 17 june 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure i accept invitation participate global financial service industry 2005 summit vienna, i would like extend warm welcome behalf oesterreichische nationalbank (oenb). in next twenty minute i address issue regard development financial service industry austria. first, i would like highlight change austrian economy financial sector take place since austria join european union (eu) ten year ago. second, i go outline development adaptation make austria’s financial sector highly competitive, sound stable. third, i focus recent performance austrian financial sector major challenge face near future. 1. change austrian economy financial sector since eu accession austria celebrate number important anniversary year. we commemorate end world war ii 60 year ago sign austrian state treaty 50 year ago, also austria’s accession european union ten year ago. eu accession important milestone promote positive development austrian economy - among thing - beneficial effect economic growth, price stability, labor market country’s attractiveness foreign investors. these effect - pair high adaptability innovative character industrial especially also financial sector - strengthen austria’s competitiveness international arena. let give figure attest favorable economic development austria follow accession eu: • good export increase considerably 25% gdp 1995 38% 2004. • the trade deficit widen 1995, trend clearly reverse follow eu accession. • the volume foreign direct investment eu-15 austria almost quadruple 10 billion euro 38 billion euro last ten years, volume austrian investment within eu-15 go nearly five time 4 billion euro 19 billion euro. austria’s accession eu considerable impact financial service industry capital market. in respect, eu’s common market serve important catalyst increase refocus consolidation effort austrian bank sector make order become competitive. specifically, consolidation effort result decline total number austrian credit institution 1,053 end-1994 882 end-2004 total asset unconsolidated basis increase 369 billion euro 653 billion euro period. the unconsolidated return asset (roa) improve 0.33% end-1995 0.46% end-2004. the number credit institution go significantly particular decentralize sector austrian bank industry (that save banks, raiffeisen volksbank credit cooperatives) less extent also bank sector (that joint stock banks, state mortgage banks, build loan associations, special purpose banks). example consolidation dynamic level large bank group acquisition large austrian bank - bank austria creditanstalt - german hypovereinsbank well acquisition p.s.k., austrian postal save bank, bawag, 2000. austria nevertheless retain high bank branch office density, number inhabitant per bank office (head office branches) amount 1,537 2003. this compare 2,113 inhabitant per bank office bi review 47/2005 1 germany 2,043 switzerland. this mean still room consolidation austrian bank sector. another significant development last decade formation cluster small bank within sector become increasingly tie central institution (e.g. erste bank, rzb) cross-guarantee schemes. this development produce relatively large bank groups. to put perspective, worldwide rank bank groups1, ba-ca occupy rank 99 2003, erste bank occupy rank 106 rzb rank 189. the bank head sector pyramid provide centralize service achieve economy scale area payment settlement, liquidity management funding. furthermore, traditional multisector structure austrian bank sector - derive historical difference line business ownership - change significantly recent years, vast majority bank effectively operate universal banks. the refocus effort aim raise financial sector competitiveness run-up austria’s eu accession resulted, among things, expansion large austrian bank (rzb, ba-ca, erste bank) central eastern europe (cee), region share historical tie austria. at begin transition period cee, financial sector economy show inefficiencies, instability low degree financial intermediation. for reason, austrian banks’ strategic move region benefit respective banks, also help stabilize financial sector economy improve penetration bank services. the successful cross-border diversification strategy several austrian bank contribute substantially positive profit development, since margin cee still relatively high. austrian bank today account market share approximately 20% cee (except russia), erste bank, ba-ca rzb among major player region. in neighbor country austrian credit institution reach market share range 32% czech republic 44% slovakia 2004. 42% net profit austria’s five large bank stem operation central eastern european countries. not least owe accession many cee country eu may 2004 subsequent boost economic growth well harmonization legal framework, positive impact profitability expect continue, although probably le pronounce basis margin adapt eu level therefore expect decline. the positive experience operation cee transfer upcoming markets, especially southeastern european countries, austrian bank increasingly take lead region well. a i show take austrian bank sector example, european integration success story. in respect, economic monetary union (emu) - especially adoption common currency 12 eu member state - certainly mark historic successful milestone integration process. emu base efficient interplay three main factor embody stability architecture: first, monetary policy primary goal maintain price stability medium term; second, sustainable public finances; third, structural policy support growth global competitiveness. price stability high importance safeguard consumers’ purchase power promote secure stable plan condition enterprises. price stability, however, maintain solid financial policy pursued. moreover, structural reform necessary overcome friction labor product market well service sector; also important come improve resilience economy shock make flexible. these three mutually supportive factor responsible success emu prerequisite economic stability, sustainable growth employment. therefore, recent public discussion dissolution emu totally absurd. regard price stability, moderate wage increase austria last ten year low inflation, remain 2% annually 1999, contribute positive development economy support austria’s competitiveness euro area well internationally. 1 source: the american banker. 2 bi review 47/2005 however, since begin 2005 inflation austria high 2%, mainly attributable grow pressure energy prices, service sector increase rents. 2. stability soundness austrian financial sector the fact austria’s financial institution prove highly adaptable change macroeconomic environment strengthen stability soundness austrian financial sector. this confirm international monetary fund financial sector assessment program (fsap)2 2004 reconfirm yearly consultation finalize may 2005. the key conclusion imf assessment follows: • austria’s financial sector generally stable resilient external shocks. • the stability bank sector confirm detail stress test conduct imf cooperation oesterreichische nationalbank. • the austrian insurance sector perform relatively well compare many european countries. • austria enjoy high standard prudential supervision base strong institution comprehensive legal framework. financial supervision integrate financial market authority (fma) 2002, cooperation fma oesterreichische nationalbank, continue strongly involve bank supervision, work smoothly. • this framework result high level compliance internationally accept standard area banking, insurance, security prevention money laundering. this highly favorable imf assessment reflects, among things, strategic foresight

performance 2004 first month 2005 turn third issue, i would like give brief glance development austrian economy financial sector 2004 first month 2005. austria encounter current challenge reform requirement forward-looking economic policy. the pension reform contribute sustainable retirement system financially secure long term. the corporate income tax reform add make austria attractive business location support real income households. austria’s current account surplus amount 0.3% gdp 2004 expect improve course year. mainly back strong exports, austria’s gdp grow 2% 2004, thus clearly high two previous year line euro area average. the oenb recently forecast real gdp grow 2.0% 2005 2.2% next two years. support mainly exports, second stage tax reform also constitute important impetus domestic demand. austria’s economy, however, cannot fully withstand current economic slowdown euro area. austria’s deficit accord maastricht amount 1.2% gdp 2004, considerably le euro area average. the 2005 tax reform expect raise deficit 1.8% 2005. however, austria’s recent stability program set target reach balance budget well debt ratio 60% gdp 2008. the stability bank sector strengthen 2004 first quarter 2005. in march 2005, total asset bank sector amount 678 billion euro unconsolidated basis (+3.9% qoq). in words, total bank sector asset grow 3.9% compare fourth quarter

capital buff case stress scenarios. (year-end 2004 data: consolidate roa 0.6%, consolidate capital ratio 12.2%). the insurance industry experience positive development 2004 well. a total 52 insurance undertake (except small mutual associations) operate austriain 2004. their total asset come 68 billion euro 2004, constitute increase 7% year year. their total premium volume rise 7% around 14 billion euro 2004, mainly attributable increase demand retirement-related products. insurance penetration express ratio total insurance premium gdp stand 7.2% austria 20044. pension fund (pensionskassen) manage asset amount approximately 10 billion euro 2004, mean 11% increase year year. pension fund thus strengthen position important institutional player austria’s financial sector. the austrian market pension fund highly concentrated, three major player account market share approximately 70%. the performance pension fund exceed 7% average 2004, thus continue positive trend previous year. the mutual fund sector enjoy strong year-on-year growth 13% 2004, attribute positive economic environment, launch new retirement-related save product well good performance vienna stock exchange, wiener börse ag. total asset mutual fund sector amount 125 billion euro 2004. 2,021 fund domestic mutual fund management company 3,378 fund foreign mutual fund management company license austria. the vienna stock exchange perform strongly 2004 continue 2005, atx outperform major international indices. stock market capitalization amount 74 billion euro april 2005, reach approximately 30% gdp. while market capitalization still consider rather low compare advance economies, atx show strong growth 4 u.k.: 14.8%, switzerland: 13.4%. 4 bi review 47/2005 approximately 33% year year end-april 2005, 140% compare end-2000 april 2005. have demonstrate positive performance austrian financial sector well stability soundness, i would like outline major challenge financial institution face near future. these challenge result continue integration process eu financial service sector, also development new product technique shape financial industry. continue financial integration euro area -

(to extent exporter china revalue well, course, impact overall asian export would somewhat greater.) the broad tariff chinese good recently proposed, implemented, would significantly low u.s. import

central bank, ecb workshop “what effect emu euro area member countries?”, frankfurt, 16 june 2005. * * * introduction when ecb start organise workshop year ago, think address question workshop’s title would provide necessary stocktaking useful analysis effect emu euro area member countries, 6½ year introduction single currency. recent development debate show impact emu euro area country topical issue indeed. officials, economist commentator seek analyse pertinent issue try answer question conference. and come conclusion colleague govern council call “absurd”, “nonsensical” imply “economic suicide” – rightly so. this debate sometimes risk fairly long polemic rather short arguments. with workshop, i would like welcome all, bring discussion solid facts, sound argument good understand manifold issue involved. the debate issue often couch term two key concepts, “convergence” “heterogeneity” (which do, however, need clear definitions), relationship two. on one hand, integration labour, product capital market expect reduce economic heterogeneity within euro area. on hand, degree heterogeneity expect remain and, indeed, consider natural feature monetary union. these proposition raise several important questions, example: • what kind convergence process emu set motion? • to extent emu-induced convergence moderate economic heterogeneity within euro area? • what cause consequence sometimes sizeable case persistent inflation output growth divergence across different euro area countries, macroeconomic environment shape ecb’s monetary policy, aim preserve price stability euro area whole? these questions, address workshop, relate diverse interrelate issues, trade integration, business cycle synchronisation, financial integration, structural reform product labour markets, well inflation persistence inflation differentials. i believe quality paper present impressive group discussants, chairperson panellist contribute fruitful debates. look title various session workshop, i would like share think three specific topics. the first relate consequence market integration trade. the second, “closer home” central banker, concern inflation output divergence across euro area country implication policy. the third pertain role euro foster reform product, labour financial markets. the implication integration goods, service financial market trade the first topic – effect market integration trade – particularly interesting, raise number issue sometimes seem lead puzzle results. first, conclusion expect trade effect deep integration are, part, ambiguous – think, example, effect specialisation. increase competition achieve deregulation completion single market, well cross-border price transparency due single currency, may foster high sectoral industry-specific specialisation. great sectoral specialisation, well increase financial integration, lead increase trade flow within euro area. at bi review 46/2005 1 time, however, increase integration lead similar economic structure business cycles, could weaken trade flow within euro area. but even expect effect integration ambiguous, appear instead rather straightforward, evidence available thus far seem fully conform expectations. take, example, significant progress make 1990s regard product market reforms, positive effect integration degree competition good service market euro area. one could expect ease regulation foster competition would lead high labour productivity growth industry concerned, happened, example, telecommunication sector. yet, past decade euro area whole experience decline trend labour productivity growth. a number effect integration trade also look at: instance, whether labour regulation taxation hamper technological innovation could lead decline export within euro area, well result low export euro area rest world. a regard latter effect, appear product composition euro area export might involve risk future export performance euro area, under-specialisation fast-growing high-tech sector adequately addressed. richard baldwin’s paper offer useful comprehensive treatment issue relate euro’s trade effects. and find – find – certainly provide fertile grind fruitful discussion first session. inflation growth divergence euro area policy implication the existence divergence growth rate inflation euro area, associate challenge pose economic policy general, single monetary policy particular, issue debate extensively intensively since creation euro. they centre public debate recent months, partly result performance euro area economy past quarters, partly result uncertainty concern derive ratification process constitutional treaty. in context, doubt even raise sustainability single currency. there four key question address regard matter: • be growth inflation divergence real problem monetary union? • and, so, serious problem euro area? • be divergence likely get bad likely self-correcting? • what do reduce divergence time foster high growth euro area whole? it worth recall growth inflation divergence member country natural, inevitable phenomenon large monetary union, evidence experience long-established one, unite states. and, general, may reflect structural conjunctural factor affect differently monetary union’s country regions. difference economic structure and/or market adjustment mechanism across member country imply common global shock common policy different effect economies. moreover, growth inflation differential may also reflect impact asymmetric shocks, fiscal policy diverge productivity wage developments. whether divergence create problem performance function monetary union depend causes, size persistence. what fact relative macroeconomic performance euro area member countries? and diagnosis causal factor underlie process explain them? i would like point two interest fact contrary popular perceptions. the first first six year since creation euro, growth inflation differential observe member country great record 25 year establishment emu. on contrary, accord measures, dispersion growth rate recently reach historically low level. the second fact growth inflation differential euro area since introduction euro broadly order magnitude correspond differential observe across region metropolitan area unite states. these fact would seem suggest that, least basis size, heterogeneity 2 bi review 46/2005 observe macroeconomic performance euro area member country exceptional thus need cause alarm. nevertheless, certain development suggest caution point need deep comprehensive analysis. one development relate significant persistent divergence measure competitiveness member countries. the diverge competitiveness consequence various factor policy well market adjustment mechanisms, case reflect rigidity labour market low degree integration competition certain product markets, particularly services. the persistence development suggest adjustment mechanism function slowly self-equilibrating force sufficiently strong. the extent cumulative effect difference competitiveness euro area country raise concern impact growth. in addition, factor – exogenous, competitive pressure result globalisation, internal, influence consumer sentiment – affect economic activity tend compound adverse effect erosion competitiveness country partly offset benefit increase competitiveness attain countries. a good understand factor process determine economic fluctuations, inflation persistence competitiveness development across euro area country contribute diagnosis present situation assessment future trends. two paper workshop provide insight useful result end. the extent synchronisation economic activity europe examine paper domenico giannone lucrezia reichlin, evaluate long-run tendency cyclical fluctuations. different growth trend may due different pattern specialisation, desirable within monetary union provide country share risk capital market integration. this study recent research show european financial integration result increase opportunity share risk. the paper ignazio angeloni, luc aucremanne matteo ciccarelli concentrate determinant inflation dynamic different euro area countries, notably evidence price-setting behaviour firm factor explain inflation persistence. a thorough analysis aggregate inflation dynamic inertia characterise core inflation direct relevance formulation monetary policy also contribute diagnosis cause growth fluctuation high unemployment europe. one general conclusion emerge paper prepare workshop divergence observe euro area fundamentally consequence structural conjunctural factor – even current divergence may also influence certain extent conjunctural events. the policy implication general diagnosis economic reform need address structural impediment growth cause growth inflation divergences. of course, structural reform always easy implement, may politically costly, positive effect may immediately visible – make difficult communicate convince public large benefits. nevertheless, implementation appropriate economic reform address effectively permanently root cause euro area’s economic problems. consequently, focus public debate speed reform process beneficial effect thus strengthen consumer business confidence. the role euro foster reform product, labour financial market ha euro help push reform agenda? at time launch single currency, observer see euro “reform whip” that, together completion single market, would push direction increase competition, high productivity growth great market flexibility, essential smooth function monetary union. after all, single currency area, adjustment domestic imbalance cannot correct exchange rate policy longer, rather take place via price costs. the paper romain duval jørgen elmeskov, discuss tomorrow, provide empirical evidence determinant pace reform process. our ecb research, present paper lorenzo cappiello, philipp hartmann, peter hördahl, arjan kadareja simone manganelli, dwell impact euro integration european financial markets, notably equity bond markets. this stock-take exercise associate analysis also assist identify where, precisely, structural change urgently need make necessary reform success. bi review 46/2005 3 conclude remark the introduction euro conduct single monetary policy establish environment price stability euro area. the ecb’s monetary policy acquire credibility succeed anchor long-term inflation expectation price stability, thereby exert moderate influence price wage-setting behaviour. both short-term interest rate long-term bond yield historically low level nominal real terms. but, know, price stability favourable finance condition establish necessary sufficient condition sustainable growth. there still way go term implementation necessary structural reform result fast durable growth euro area, high productivity growth, increase labour utilisation, improve competitiveness global economy. which bring final reflection, open broad perspective. the issue discuss workshop also see background globalisation. the force dynamic globalisation influence economic development euro area (for instance pressure firms’ cost structures) also impact integration process trigger euro. of course, easy disentangle effect globalisation european integration process stem creation single currency. however, process call mechanism facilitate economy’s efficient adjustment cope challenge constantly change environment firms, consumer policy-makers. all reinforce urgency pursue structural reform agenda euro area determine systematic manner. with wider-ranging reflection, i conclude. once again, welcome ecb workshop. i rationally predict productive enrich one. 4 bi review 46/2005 jean-claude trichet: ensure price stability confidence - five idea english translation contribution mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, publish le monde, edition date 16 june 2005. * * * europe experience significant demand episode profoundly original historic undertaking, namely voluntary union people nations, begin 55 year ago launch schuman plan. more half century economic democratic construction, high lows, latent period period acceleration. this first time new idea project put aside time rejected. the rejection france european defence community august 1954 initially regard signal end european construction. however, europe set new objectives, objective prove historically successful. do jean monnet write memoir “those never want anything guarantee thing happen plan condemn immobility”? the historical evolution europe progress pace, assess long term. i confidence ability europe overcome present difficulty i share sentiment confidence resolve express joint statement issue josep borrell fontelles, jean-claude juncker josé manuel barroso, president european parliament, european council european commission respectively. the european central bank is, domain, totally executive body. together national central bank euro area, i.e. member eurosystem, task ensure price stability 307 million fellow euro area citizens. i feel important today highlight five ideas. first, issue responsibility. an independent monetary institution ultimately responsible public opinion. it imply bank regularly answer question put european parliament. indeed, average six time per year, i invite appear european parliament, often american counterpart appear u congress. and ecb vice-president i are, within g7, unique among central bank representative hold press conference immediately every monetary policy decision govern council, 11 time per year, tirelessly explain eurosystem’s analysis situation reason govern council take decision has. the second idea importance faithful mandate – price stability – eye citizen euro area. i think germans, coin term “teuro” express concern “expensive euro”, italians, consider price rise remain excessive. i think consumers, 307 million euro area, particularly least fortunate, european opinion poll send u clear message, ask u vigilant. that reason say everyone: “if hesitant decision consumer fear future erosion purchase power, hesitate longer, count u guarantee purchase power money.” the third idea faithfulness mandate also allow u offer favourable financial environment possible growth job creation. a saver investor europe throughout world convince credibility, incorporate expectation future inflation line definition price stability, i.e. “below close 2%”. this remarkable result due entirely high level confidence eurosystem. this result explain particular euro today record low rate ever observe growth rate outstanding loan private sector (at 7.4%) twice nominal gdp. a i write, ten-year rate best rat settle 3.1%. who would dare envisage creation euro? this say businesses: “investment decision, decision base number criteria. one criterion level interest rates. be moment invest?” the fourth idea that, contrary wrongly-held widespread belief, euro area characteristic unite state term interregional difference relate growth inflation. in unite states, europe, considerable difference state state region region, growth inflation differential magnitude two economies. on side atlantic central bank look relevant area’s economy whole, state member country together. i would also like mention european economy, belong euro area "win-win" situation: term achieve concept internal market enjoy low interest rate risk premia comparison best-performing currency eliminated, particular benefit country high market interest rates; also risk associate exchange rate eliminate within one vast integrate economy, good countries, include whose market rate already low. turn fifth idea, question whether contribute growth job creation fulfil requirement mandate, say: “you le demand definition price stability. 2% low. make 3%. you could reduce intervention rates!” but advice would backfire: opt 3% would lose confidence household also push rate up, down, rate incorporate increase 1% expectation future inflation. and would totally counterproductive… others make admissible remark say: “your definition price stability line good anchor inflation expectations. this good growth. but much? perhaps could achieve result low intervention rates!” yet information currently available suggests: cautious would fellow citizen share view (and would find price rise reasonable) also would impact observe price rise (which would significantly low definition price stability) inflation expectations, would significantly le 2%. this case present. regard inflation expectation particular, public private survey market indicator converge 1.9% 2%. we cannot arithmetically close 2%! these objective survey show necessary ensure stability credibility, less…no more. and govern council consider interest rate appropriate. we bias – i say i prepare market rate cut. nor i prepare rise interest rates. we remain vigilant, realistic pragmatic. *** a good monetary policy necessary sufficient alone – cannot achieve everything. european citizen know eurosystem can, thank faithful mandate. a sound budgetary policy comply stability growth pact also essential. structural reform also decisive role play strengthen competitiveness, raise potential growth rate stimulate job creation. behind key word today's europe: confidence. confidence part household firms, must nurture strengthened. we fortunate european central bank inspire level confidence among european rest world market rate exceptionally favourable levels. let u maintain precious confidence entrust europe. philipp hildebrand: snb overview financial market activity introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 16 june 2005. * * * 1. development financial market financial market activity dominate recent month three key developments. firstly, u dollar start strengthen. secondly, long-term capital market yield decline despite already low levels. thirdly, change credit risk premium different debtor category mix precede months. despite persistently high current account deficit us, dollar appreciate since begin year roughly 12% euro swiss franc, approximately 7% yen. the dollar benefit particular willingness foreign investor back u financial investments. in 2004, net purchase u security dominate strong demand certain asian central banks. while purchase remain significant far year, private investor outside us, too, buy u securities. this surge demand due part fact market continue rate growth prospect u good europe japan. the grow yield spread favour dollar investment well political uncertainty regard future development european union also contribute relative attractiveness greenback. at present, indication unusually pronounce imbalance real exchange rate currency large economic blocs. look development, become apparent close long-term average (cf. graph 1). this suggest u current account deficit primarily product exchange rate distortions. it mainly due comparatively high growth momentum low save rate us. yield capital market continue fall. while decline weak us, yield continental europe hit historical lows. in switzerland, instance, yield ten-year swiss confederation bond reach all-time low le 2%. the extraordinarily low capital market yield reflect market’s low inflation expectations. during recent months, certain concern economic growth trigger decline yields. both strong demand long-term debt security industrialise country (driven demographic factors) high save rate emerge market – particularly china – probably also contribute generally low level interest rates. while 2004 characterise steady uniform decline credit risk premium different debtor categories, past six month saw le even trend credit risk premium individual bonds. in corporate bond area, market’s attention focus two major u automakers. their downgrade junk bond status send small shockwave relevant market segments; segment far remain largely unaffected, however. the credit risk premium corporate debtor rise slightly remain historically low level (cf. graph 2). meanwhile, emerge market develop line economic fundamental respective countries. 2. investment policy a large proportion snb’s asset comprise currency reserves. an internationally accept mean payment crisis situations, serve safety net swiss economy swiss franc. in order fulfil function, reserve need invest foreign currency – primarily reserve currency dollar euro – gold. the bank’s leeway investment extend considerably entry force new national bank act may 2004. this allow snb invest part currency reserve foreign equity corporate bonds. in mid-february 2005, snb – already invest corporate bond since june 2004 – turn attention expansion equity portfolios. at present, little chf 3 billion invest internationally diversify equity portfolios. a equity index-managed external asset bi review 46/2005 1 managers, snb take active decision regard weight individual sector securities. in principle, national bank invest swiss equity corporate bonds, thus avoiding, outset, potential conflict interest could jeopardise snb’s independence. a shareholder swiss companies, bank would risk confront structural issues. it could also lead conflict monetary policy investment policy goal interest rate hike snb erode domestic companies’ profits. furthermore, move could adverse effect price snb liquidate security swiss business short notice. and finally, conceivable national bank could gain access privilege financial market information activity area system stability. this would make invest swiss financial sector even problematic. the influence equity portfolio corporate bond national bank’s risk profile moderate. the overall risk attach asset – measure value-at-risk – change greatly since introduction investment options. gold exchange rate still big factor contribute overall risk. equity account le 5% total risk, corporate bond contribute negligible proportion. the current investment structure performance snb’s asset publish online quarterly basis update appendix investment policy guideline swiss national bank. 3. risk measurement management the return snb’s asset – particularly currency reserve – fluctuate dramatically year year. the absolute loss considerable. while true earn fluctuation reduce scaling-back dollar gold hold recent year along improve diversification currency investment categories, possible continue reduce risk ad infinitum. hence, hedge currency reserves’ dollar gold risk high degree, instance, impracticable, reserve would long serve intend purpose. professional risk measurement management thus crucial snb. the risk attach national bank’s asset primarily assess use value-at-risk (var) method. this widely use risk indicator quantify level loss probably exceed within specific period time. the snb calculate var base 95% probability time horizon one year. value-at-risk analysis undertake individual portfolio total assets. the current var total asset approximately chf 100 billion amount roughly chf 4.5 billion. a value-at-risk analysis give indication much could potentially lose beyond specify level 95%. furthermore, base current risk correlation structure necessarily accurate reflection future risks. this particularly case moment – time market volatility low historical standards. the snb therefore back var calculation stress scenario analyses. these simulate extreme market fluctuation examine impact fluctuation assets. scenario especially severe impact snb’s asset include fall gold price depreciation dollar euro. such scenario show serious loss could potentially sustained. the volatility snb’s earn therefore remain high despite new investment universe. experience shown, however, major loss tend even medium term, i.e. period three five years. 2 bi review 46/2005 bi review 46/2005 3 jean-pierre roth: economic activity switzerland introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 16 june 2005. * * * lady gentleman a announce press release, swiss national bank leave target range three-month libor rate unchanged 0.25-1.25%. it intend keep rate middle target range around 0.75% time being. the fourth quarter 2004 first quarter 2005 saw stagnation economic activity switzerland, high price oil well depreciation dollar final quarter 2004 act brakes. these factor also hold back economic activity europe, expected, thus weaken swiss economy. despite sluggish development first quarter 2005, snb still expect economy recover course year, increase momentum second half. this notwithstanding, pace expansion 2005 likely slow further. the snb thus project growth rate around 1%, compare 1.5% last assessment. it expectation regard inflation 2005 remain unchanged march assessment, average annual inflation year likely amount 1%. on assumption three-month libor remain unchanged 0.75%, annual inflation forecast stand 0.5% 2006 reach 1.4% 2007. inflation prospect medium term look positive march assessment. a correction expansionary monetary policy pursue snb long time necessary economic outlook improves. should swiss franc appreciate rapidly, swiss national bank respond appropriately. what important factor lead decision leave three-month libor rate unchanged? before answer question, i would like briefly outline situation facing. i begin present economic environment, go describe monetary situation. a far economic activity concerned, revise evaluation downwards since last monetary policy assessment. in final quarter 2004, swiss economy slip slightly, accompany rise price oil decline dollar period october december. both factor also unfavourable impact european economy. contrary expectation express last monetary policy assessment, economic activity switzerland remain restrain first quarter. despite slight increase domestic demand, gdp stagnate compare previous quarter. this disappoint result mainly attributable export developments. company face slack demand consequently limit volume investment. this affect employment, result uncertain labour market situation dampen impact private consumer spend rise below-average rate. the real estate sector, contrast, benefit continuation favourable finance conditions. oil price rise begin year, continue act brake world economy, situation remain particularly gloomy europe. give developments, unlikely 1.5% growth 2005 forecast last monetary policy assessment attained. however, sign improvement swiss economy become evident first quarter year, export pick april may. we expect trend confirm month come, forecast real gdp growth 1% year 2005 whole. this delay recovery economy dampen effect price development year 2006. now i would like outline assessment monetary developments, remain le unchanged respect assessment present march. the three-month libor rate remain low level long time now: one percent almost three years, since july 2002. real rate interest three month maturity negative two years. give unusually low level interest rates, willingness invest liquid asset remain high and, accord estimates, money overhang persists. however, moderate growth m3 monetary aggregate indicate situation change since last monetary policy assessment. thus, monetary analysis show continue pursue expansionary monetary policy time being, without incur additional risks. since first quarter 2003, year-on-year growth rate mortgage loan exceed 5%. mortgage loan household slow slightly end 2004, since rate growth accelerate level high record recent years. mortgage loan companies, decline past five years, also rise since begin year. price continue increase real estate market, development which, view, low mortgage rate contributed. well aware monetary policy still expansionary, keep close eye development real estate sector. in view above-mentioned developments, decide leave target range three-month libor rate unchanged 0.25-1.25%. what important factor lead decision? there three them. first all, need downgrade expectation respect development economy. however, sign cyclical downturn economy continue recover, even recovery somewhat delay muted. second, lacklustre economic activity accompany improvement medium-term outlook inflation. this mean increase libor target range appear le urgent. third, level uncertainty risen. the economic outlook europe difficult ass march. although price oil decline april may, rise significantly june, high price oil market could persist time come. in addition, decline level long-term interest rate consistent recovery economy. i briefly outline new forecast inflation. the graph depict current previous forecasts. the dash red curve represent new forecast, cover period second quarter 2005 first quarter 2008. the dash-dotted green curve show forecast present last monetary policy assessment. both forecast base assumption three-month libor rate

before, snb respond appropriately swiss franc appreciate rapidly, keep option open eventuality, do past. observe inflation june 2005 inflation forecast march 2005 libor 0.75% june 2005 libor 0.75% inflation forecast june 2005 (53 kb) david dodge: adjust change remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, winnipeg chamber commerce, winnipeg, manitoba, 15 june 2005. * * * good afternoon. i'm glad back winnipeg. the last time i deliver speech january 2002. a lot change since - city canadian economy. at time, economy recover worldwide economic slowdown impact september 2001 terrorist attack unite states. today, face more-intense international competition, also face new opportunities, expand economy become important market products. like rest canada, winnipeg manitoba feel impact international changes. change central theme remark today. first, i talk change take place bank canada 70-year history. then, i'll talk change currently take place global economy, well see economy - across canada right manitoba - adjust changes. change bank canada this year mark 70th anniversary bank canada. the bank open door 11 march 1935, time canadian economy reel effect prairie drought worldwide depression. in early days, much bank's work focus try cushion economy effect high unemployment fall prices, replace bank note different issuer bank canada notes. almost every aspect bank's work change since time. but today i'll focus change take place conduct monetary policy. by late 1950s, bank's monetary policy federal government's fiscal policy try find balance control inflationary pressure economy encourage high level employment. the economic boom 1960s bitter inflationary experience 1970s eventually lead increase focus price stability goal monetary policy. we develop good appreciation keep inflation low, stable, predictable best contribution central bank make economic welfare nation. during decades, learn key lessons. the first float exchange rate tremendous asset help economy adjust changes, particularly economy open ours. a float currency give country flexibility need adjust economic force originate inside outside borders. the second lesson learn that, monetary policy successful control inflation, float exchange rate enough. an "anchor" monetary policy also needed. canada first float dollar 1950, return fix exchange rate eight year 1960s. after decision float dollar 1970, bank spend 1970s 1980s search appropriate monetary policy anchor. by this, i mean clear target monetary policy, way help policy-makers keep policy track, way tie "anchor" expectation future inflation. the outcome search eventual adoption inflation target anchor canadian monetary policy. in february 1991, bank federal government announce agreement series inflation-reduction targets. this agreement extend three times, since 1995, call bank keep inflation 2 per cent, midpoint 1 3 per cent target range. this inflation-targeting system, support float exchange rate, do keep inflation low - deliver strong sustain growth output employment canada. let quickly stress inflation-targeting framework operate symmetric way - care much inflation fall target inflation rise target. if demand good service push canadian economy limit capacity, inflation poise rise target, bank raise interest rate cool economy. and economy operate production capacity, inflation poise fall target, bank low interest rate stimulate growth. this symmetric approach help canadian economy adjust change circumstances, maintain strong, sustain growth output employment. the bank's commitment idea transparency another way monetary policy evolved. there time central banker keep action think shroud secrecy, convince policy would effective implement element surprise. time changed, best practice monetary policy evolved. we find monetary policy effective people understand why. that's communicate regularly parliamentarians, markets, public. we regular monetary policy report update reports. we press release fix announcement date interest rate decisions, eight time year. and public speak engagement audience across country. our method communication also continue change. today, use tool technology reach canadian explain work. for example, audio portion speech broadcast live internet. and complete redevelopment bank's website. since creation 1995, website central effort conduct bank's business open transparent manner. the site visit 180,000 time week. in 2003, name "central bank website year" central bank publication unite kingdom. we want make site even better, monday launch new version. it feature attractive graphic redesign, improve navigation, lot new content. i encourage visit new site, welcome comments. change global economy so that's quick look way bank change 70 years. i'll spend remainder time today discuss major change afoot global economy canadian economy adjust developments. i've return canada meet central banker china japan. i also attend meet switzerland, unite states, morocco past month. and two weeks, i head unite kingdom. in countries, almost every nation, people affect powerful force - grow competition emerging-market economies, china india, large grow financial imbalance unite state asia. the growth emerging-market economy drive demand commodities, push world price oil many commodity produce canada. meanwhile, competitive world environment productivity improvement country low price number consumer goods, communication services, computer equipment. all force cause significant exchange rate movements, include sharp appreciation canadian dollar u.s. dollar past couple years. high price many commodity produce canada mean term trade - is, ratio price canadian receive export price pay import - improve 14 per cent since late 2001. this contribute importantly high real income strong domestic demand. how canadian economy adjust various economic forces? in bank's last monetary policy report, publish april, note see increase business investment spend oil gas extraction, mine activity, wood-product manufacturing. these sector benefit high world price products. we also see rise investment sector expose international trade, electric power generation, finance insurance, information cultural industries. in latter cases, firm react strong growth domestic demand. we've also strong investment housing. but sector highly expose international trade, price either fall rise slowly. here, i refer goods-producing sectors, auto parts, furniture, clothe manufacturing, well service sector tourism. firm industry feel pressure high canadian dollar, also face increase competition region world. the good news many canadian firm make necessary adjustments. investment spend direct towards increase specialization, high productivity, low costs. since much productivity-enhancing machinery equipment price u.s. dollars, strong canadian dollar make easy firm invest equipment boost productivity. stiff competition also encourage firm seek new markets, increase specialization, offer value-added, customize services. other adjustment also take place. a grow number firm look cut cost import inputs. we've certainly see type adjustment take place among manufacturer telecommunication equipment. other firm phase production good service low profit margin concentrate yield high returns. current economic development canada manitoba through monetary policy, bank help adjustment support domestic demand. in april monetary policy report, project domestic demand would grow almost 4 per cent 2005. accord recently release data, grow slightly expect first quarter year. so continue see evidence strong domestic demand offset small contribution net export make economic growth. on 14 july, publish monetary policy report update, contain late view canadian economy. the bank process gather analyze full set information global canadian economy fee next interest rate decision, update. on last policy-announcement date may, decide maintain target overnight interest rate 2 1/2 per cent. at time, indicate global canadian economic development unfold broadly line expectation outlook canadian economy end 2006 unchanged one present april monetary policy report. the analysis contain report still relevant. so statement that, line outlook growth inflation, reduction monetary stimulus - is, increase key policy rate - require time. now, let say word economic prospect manitoba. the provincial economy grow estimate 2.3 per cent last year, 1.5 per cent 2003. like rest canada, manitoba rely heavily domestic spend engine growth 2005. private sector forecaster expect output growth 2.7 per cent year, largely result strong consumption investment. export also continue grow, albeit slow pace 2004. this projection assume agricultural production increase 2005. it early predict impact recent flood ruin many field province. diversification manitoba's economy helpful. this province's economy one diversify canada - good mix goods-producing service industries, resource manufacturing, traditional new technology. and grow diversity innovation within industries, pharmaceuticals, furniture manufacturing, transportation-equipment sector. the broaden manitoba's economic base provide stability economy keep province's unemployment rate well national average. manitoba also help continue fiscal prudence. conclusion change rarely make without difficulty, even know change better. this certainly true adjustment response global economic reality today. in cases, industry force rethink way business. some firm close, job lost. this type adjustment never easy. but economic change create new opportunities. and city like winnipeg, across canada, individuals, businesses, industries, public sector institution make adjustment help improve competitiveness seize new opportunities. these effort also make canadian economy strong resilient. that best way prepare economy whatever change future may bring. v leeladhar: bank technology - road ahead keynote address mr v leeladhar, deputy governor reserve bank india, it@bfsi-200 conclave, bangalore, 9 june 2005. * * * lady gentlemen, i deem privilege present conclave conduct indian banks’ association, appropriate topic appropriate time appropriate audience would catalyst change bank india poise great leap near future. i sure banker india feel positive impact technological revolution way bank transformed. bank need ready take challenge unleash various external force competition, globalisation, shrink margins, internal force relate human resources, need change procedure etc. to mind, substantial portion challenge easily address technology; i shall, therefore, dwell role technology bank near future. bank india need compliment inculcation technology large way day-to-day operations. credit must give indian bank bring new wave techno-banking country. in short span le two decades, customer bank felt positive impact technological solution implement banks. the customer bank today virtual menu option far delivery channel concern benefit technology, visible benefit happen area payment retail transactions. a variety cards, automate teller machines, electronic base fund transfers, internet banking, mobile bank late technology base payment solutions, gain large acceptance amongst indian bank public. with technological solution rapidly evolving, new product service may soon become order day. while address critical topic technology today become basic necessity rather luxury bank sector, i must examine various component comprise build block bank would function morrow. i would, therefore, enlist major aspect which, mind, appear corner stone road pave highway would ensure free, safe secure conduct bank business. the first major aspect need address consolidation. bank india evolve mix various independent functions. thus credit function separate activity, deposit take another different function, host payment facility - distinct activity, service on. it time look consolidation inter-related functions. technology already provide answer form total branch automation, give way core bank systems, facility single-window service branches. while traditional approach towards consolidation may ensure customer today retain bank, growth new clientele will, however, relate progressive measure take banks. an outward look consolidation hold key. consolidation type financial service customer bank may require need offer banks. while step take bank form universal bank offer relate financial service insurance, tax advice, security market operations, depository function like, future may witness alliance service provider may today’s context appear relationship traditional bank concepts. for example, mobile phone user, customer particular telecommunication service provider, may switch preference another bank phone company link service particular bank user bank with. thus strategic alliance vary service provider may become necessity. the next major challenge arise force competition. traditional concept relate competition player line business indeed exist pale oblivion form competition hitherto unexplored unanticipated areas. easy finance scheme retailer consumer durable article obviate need short term loam customer banks, thus result dwindle retail loan portfolio. bank overcome challenge provide refinance retailer would requirement fund improve business turnover portfolio. the essence competition may exploit opportunity. plan unanticipated look opportunity hold key successful bi review 45/2005 1 bank future. in connection, i draw attention report rbi group rural credit microfinance suggest bank first mover would stand gain substantially term expand retail portfolio. technology implementation come attendant requirement too. a major aspect need reckon relate • need standardisation - across hardware, operate systems, system software, application software facilitate inter-connectivity system across branch • need high level security - environment require high level confidentiality, security important requirement • once achieved, next logical approach would towards communication network - use network would facilitate centralise database distribute processing. exploitation computer network bank would result save cost increase efficiency • need technology plan periodically monitor also upgrade consequent upon change technology • need business process re-engineering large scale usage computer - objective merely mechanise activity result holistic benefit computerisation customer staff branch • need address issue human relation computerise environment especially point human resource development • share technology experience expertise reap benefit technology implementation across wide community all change have, however, host attendant challenges. prominent among paradigm shift concept security. with delivery channel relate fund base service - movement fund electronically different account customer - take place use technology, requirement relate security also need undergo metamorphosis rapid pace. various concept digital signatures, certification, storage information secure tamper-proof manner assume significance part practice procedure day-to-day function bank tomorrow. i must juncture, add would add requirement well establish practice today may also continue also co-exist along new requirements. security requirement provide two pronged perspective - first internal requirement bank second relate legal precinct law land. it matter satisfaction note infinet (indian financial network) safe, secure efficient communication network exclusive use bank sector, provide inter-bank communication - imply bank function group time compete one another too. the key advantage infinet security framework form public key infrastructure - pki, conformity provision information technology act, 2000. an effective security policy would offer share vision control workplace implement objective protect data, information eventually, economic value organisation. this supplement education train area reinforce action concern top management culture security created. these control supplement surveillance, monitor audit detect unusual usage pattern deficiencies. bank put place policy ensure implement effectively, audit it relate function ensure lapse deviation approve information security policy. another major challenge relate bridge divide cause distances. today, bank break geographical barrier demand customer relate ‘anywhere anytime banking’. currently, it base offer internet mobile bank provide customer mean meet requirement able perform bank transaction anywhere. the death distance also necessitate bank india merely look inward. development elsewhere world also strong impact effort indian bank factor always vibrant world technology base banking. add 2 bi review 45/2005 fact market shrink digitally gap would reduce morrow. it would necessary prepare function small knit shrink world. information availability across large section people bring challenge able process large mass information. this opportunity bank sector sector include it industry well. bank will, therefore, brace co-operation co-existence geographical boundary may move away oblivion share resource (such atms) already commence propagation. we hear digital divide challenge overcome bank industry well. while average indian customer may technology savvy even good western counterpart, cultural aspect relationship may necessitate personal touch offer banks. further, technology base offer bank bias towards major town city need reach mid size city well large rural population assume significance. these pocket hold promise substantial growth prospect today network capability available much high reliability level affordable costs, bank may pay attention segment country well. to achieve these, bank also re-orient internal process procedures. just mechanisation process manufacture company require change step involve production cycle, suitable change job process within bank also made. no technology implementation complete without attendant change basic way process function organisation implementation shave made, technology implementation successful, accompany suitable change process flow across sector economy, base business process re-engineering. it essential bank embark upon business process re-engineering large scale preferable even large scale implementation technology commenced. the management external relationship another requirement would take care banker future. convergence service industry organisation emerge provide holistic service offer discern customer, bank would prime target customer provide service level match expectations. this would necessitate bank operate environment facilitate ease inter-operability. just inter-operable it system straight through process (stp) become order day, inter-operable business domain also prevail bank overcome challenge stride. this also observe manage external function business process outsourcing, management it service provider good vendor management - hitherto unknown domain banks’ personnel. the challenge star bank today need result feel inadequacy. the i t framework india strong grind industry show significant growth rate previous years, financial sector benefit immensely offer it. banks, part, prove mettle i must add year since liberalisation, bank india prove withstand force change blend change gracefully manner even provide challenge hitherto exist leader line business. bank commence grow laterally exponential rate. we best talent personnel best institute develop resource best brain manage changes. our society hold pride place largely knowledge based, ever since time veda early day world. a india develop formidable force, information technology hold key process transformation. our key strength lie knowledge process banker perform function quite well customer well growth organisations. this underlie strength ensure key success. a bank poise challenge excite time ahead, i sure conclave also provide substantial input day progress various opportunity bank harbour implementation within respective confines. i sure conclave provide kindle fire transformation bank india light enthusiasm indian bank transcend barrier gain great coverage, would make mark world leader provide unparalleled, efficient service affordable rate result high level customer satisfaction overall vibrant economy. lastly, i conclude i would like draw attention two vision document , one relate payment system draft bi review 45/2005 3 propose financial sector technology rbi recently put website. these document set vision next three years. we welcome reaction. need le say preparedness synchronous vision central bank. i wish conclave success. thank you. 4 bi review 45/2005 niklaus blattner: three nations, two

governor sverige riksbank, conference inflation targeting: implementation, communication effectiveness, stockholm, 10 june 2005. * * * i would like begin welcome stockholm conference inflation targeting. the idea hold conference hatch couple year ago, lars svensson i talk think area evolve recent year theory practice. where stand today research term well practice? and learn basis experiences? the fact conference plan take place year provide add incentive, ten year since sweden’s inflation target regime fully implement accordance original decision 1993. we decide spread word respective networks: lars academic side i practical side. we delight you, colleague friends, accept invitation, believe look forward reward discussion inflation target stand today develop further. i think exaggeration say monetary policy today is, whole, conduct good prudently ever before. in many countries, key success inflation targeting. although main reason introduce inflation target many case - least sweden’s - frustration previous regime economic performance, subsequently prove work well stand interest option also already well-functioning economies. this demonstrate particular current debate regard possible introduction inflation target unite states, economic performance recent decade remarkably good monetary policy successful. but first, i go problem currently feel significant u riksbank i also think central discussion unite state elsewhere - balance concern output stability inflation stability - allow say word fundamental view regard inflation target policies. unsurprisingly, i see considerable advantage explicit, symmetric inflation target. it also impression view enjoy considerable support academic literature, assertion, however, assembly good place question one. the clear framework encompass inflation target, publish forecast specify target horizon generally work well guide policy. there communication problem there, obvious situation would much good different regime. another benefit clear framework, i think receive little attention academic circles, opinion important favourable outcome, help bolster internal work economic discussion. other consideration purely relate inflation likely put rigorous intellectual test would otherwise case, i think useful. however, fact inflation target work well mean, course, problem solve issue worth discussing; so, would reason arrange conference. by way introduction, i intend describe swedish experience problem area inflation target i see one significant, perhaps even significant - deal trade-off stabilise inflation stabilise real economy. i focus regard two area central conference - policy implement communicated. the inflation-real economy trade-off flexible inflation target policy it presumably safe say inflation-targeting country today conduct lars svensson would call flexible rather strict inflation target policy, even though degree flexibility bi review 45/2005 1 probably vary somewhat country country. in words, not, use mervyn king’s well-known expression, “inflation nutters”, i.e. focus stabilise inflation also take account real economic development possibly factor too. however, present degree flexibility inflation-targeting policy probably always regard obvious today. at least far sweden concerned, i think i right say gradual process bring u today. that probably also true many inflation-targeting countries. immediately announcement inflation target 1993, riksbank tend formulate policy intention anything flexible. this may credibility problem 1970s 1980s consider damage deem warrant “tough talk”. whether wise strategy begin way one-sided focus inflation perhaps open question. one could argue would good choose balance line outset. it might possible counteract criticism level riksbank supposedly “focusing exclusively inflation completely disregard employment”. from mid-1990s onwards, though, riksbank try various way clarify focus solely stabilise inflation. i believe correct say implementation policy also begin become flexible around time. one example fact utilise scope rate cut - accord strict interpretation - deregulation supply factor create last year 1990s. the clear example attempt convey inflation target policy flexible rather strict clarification monetary policy executive board publish 1999. in that, explain may appropriate situation - e.g. event large shock deviation target - refrain bring inflation back target quickly order mitigate adverse consequence output employment.1 we express term reason occasionally depart simple policy rule - repo rate normally raise inflation one two year ahead forecast 2 per cent, vice versa inflation forecast undershoot target. explicit framework basis the strategy sweden choose deal “flexibility problem” could, simplify terms, describe we, find necessary, various way modify adapt framework - mainly represent explicit symmetric target, regular publication detail decision-support data include forecasts, simple policy rule repo rate normally adjust background forecasts. this probably key reason flexibility part chiefly say reflect “exceptions” policy rule, rather explicitly describe term continual procedure balance concern output inflation stability. i think way handle flexibility issue way unique sweden instead fairly typical. one experience find quite difficult time time get kind message across, least flexibility reflect unchanged raise policy rate, oppose cut. in circumstance seem rather hard debunk idea monetary policy conduct accord mechanical rule say policy rate, regardless force act economy time, always set ensure inflation forecast give time horizon meet target. on occasion find appropriate depart policy rule regard, action seldom take public domain sign conduct flexible inflation target policy. instead, interpretation time change way conduct monetary policy decided, le obscure reason, maintain certain line irrespective forecast tell us. 1 for overview inflation-targeting central bank say stabilise output, see kuttner, k.n. (2004), “a snapshot inflation target adolescence” kent, c. s. guttman, the future inflation targeting, conference volume, reserve bank australia. 2 bi review 45/2005 to extent, problem experience probably reflect fact people always prefer low interest rate high ones. but could also case, course, way deal communicate flexibility problem simply clear enough, despite best efforts. one could perhaps see sign successful “anchoring” simple rule introduce early stage attempt clearly explain decision create confidence new regime. discrepancy word deed of course, sweden country communication flexible inflation target cause problems. for instance, international level general criticism claim central bank inflation-targeting country bias monetary policy communication towards stabilise inflation.2 the criticism hence level inflation target conduct practice; recognise central bank inflation-targeting country take account real economy. it however claim discrepancy word deed raise question regard status stabilisation real economy really relation stabilise inflation. i perhaps underline criticism, i understand it, say great clarity country specific target inflation. in opinion, assertion communication inflation-targeting central bank generally tend focus lot stabilisation inflation real economy essentially correct. inflation forecast undeniably lead role report publish central banks, usually basis forecast bank explain policy decisions. so central bank pursue flexible inflation target policy choose concentrate inflation communication often rather vague regard look upon trade-off stabilise inflation stabilise real economy? one important explanation, i already touch upon, probably many economy adopt inflation target policy previously beset high, sharply fluctuate inflation. the task, accordingly, create broad understand credibility new policy focus price stability. it therefore natural communicate policy term factor relatively easy measure comprehend, accord concrete, relatively simple principle could serve guide monetary policy could contribute stabilise inflation expectations. moreover, point view explain policy good overall objective price stability adopt elect body many country also use implementation policy allow play prominent part debate. that communication still tend focus strongly inflation, despite considerable confidence low-inflation policy today, could reflect perception easy make substantial change policy rhetoric. personally, however, i think problem run deep that. it quite simply difficult clearly communicate kind varying, subtle deliberation involved. of inflation-targeting central banks, norge bank perhaps one come furthest term ambition clarify way policy take real economy account, regularly publish estimate output gap parallel inflation forecast well discussion policy take account it. it seem interest path take, time evident - basis ten years’ experience - far consideration face would capture model. conclude remark by way conclusion, number issue need evolve thinking. i believe contribution conference indeed succeed capture important relevant ones. 2 see, example, fischer, s. (1996), “why be central bank pursue long-run price stability”, achieve price stability, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, wyoming. a recent reference bring problem fore faust, j. d.w. henderson (2004), “is inflation target best-practice monetary policy?”, federal reserve bank st. louis review 86(4), 117-143. bi review 45/2005 3 one central point view concerns, i indicated, balance inflation stability output stability - term appropriate way accommodate practical policy best way communicate it. although hardly doubt “we flexible inflation targeters now”, progress regard concretise flexibility action communication? another interest question whether inflation target good suit regime come anchor long-term inflation expectations. i always think myself, course issue require empirical investigation. one might also ask whether inflation targeting, even succeed anchor long-term inflation expectations, become good today facilitate formation expectation near medium term? this relate issue address several contributions, namely best communicate expectation plan regard future conduct policy. recently, number central bank begin depart assumption unchanged policy rate forecasts, choose instead work path future interest rate developments. what kind interest rate path use case - “exogenous” path base imply forward rate “endogenous” path reflect central bank’s expectation plans, advantage disadvantage options? and could, example, excessive degree openness detail regard central bank’s expectation risk increase market volatility instead facilitate economic agents’ planning? these handful issue address contribution conference i hope provide basis reward discussion. once - welcome! 4 bi review 45/2005 william ryback: launch two-factor

bi review 44/2005 1 ardian fullani: a brief look albanian bank system speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, black sea business day, yerevan, armenia, 6 june 2005. * * * distinguish lady gentlemen, dear participants, it’s great pleasure opportunity participate regional meet black sea countries. i always appreciate initiative special opportunity country involve in. in long career, i realize success business consist generally ability gain public confidence. nevertheless, overall economic, political social environment country play also important role. during career, i witness many event directly indirectly damage bank system. the monetary collapse bank system end communist era, flourish degenerate fraudulent investment schemes, well many social, political economic problem associate albanian transition, make bank system “suffer” long time. however reputation albanian bank system place recently. it’s enough i refer late problematic episode occur albania, early spring 2002, due lack public information political speculation introduction deposit guarantee scheme, confidence household traumatized, lead considerable deposit run bank system. have look statistical indicators, result bank system time sound grow continuously. but, insufficient since memory year 1997 (the collapse fraudulent schemes) still present household sensitivity high. inspite recent significant achievement i would like stress still high potential fragility economy entire region well. a consequence, i think much prudent much diligent speak financial stability country. this episode suggests, inter alia, necessity associate reform concrete preparatory step and, certainly, combine back-up plan case failure. for purpose market need intensively prepare elaborate since early stage implementation reforms. it imperative decisionmakers know advance market behavior sentiments. last spring, joint assessment albanian financial sector conduct international monetary fund world bank

authority, acihk the financial market association basel ii seminar, hong kong, 27 september 2005. * * * only year ago might seem bite strange invite regulator speak subject risk management. after all, regulator suppose relationship risk preacher sin: it. historically, regulation risk management opposites. regulation suppose stop bank take risks. risk management, contrast, concern take risk manage it. regulation criticised, rightly view, take insufficient account modern risk management technique credit risk operational risk modelling, stress-testing, portfolio management. thankfully begin move away day regulator perceive regard take sort risk "a bad thing." regulator care, all, bank system sound stable. one important factor sound bank system bank profitable; regulator recognise without risk chance bank make money. what matter risk bank take, good identifying, monitor control them. hopefully also move away day regulator set regulation real relation bank look risk, manage risk. basel ii major step direction. it aim link way regulator look risk bank look risk; encourage use modern risk management techniques; encourage innovation; encourage bank ensure risk management capability commensurate risk business. a result basel ii bring regulation 21st century. previously, regulators' main focus credit risk market risk. basel ii take sophisticate approach credit risk, allow bank make use internal rat base system - "irb systems" become know - calculate capital requirement credit risk. it also introduces, addition market risk capital charge, explicit capital charge operational risk. together, three risk - credit, market, operational risk - so-called "pillar 1" risks. but basel ii go much look risk. a i sure know, risk management professionals, three risk scrap surface. banks' risk management function need look much wide range risk - interest rate risk bank book, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, business cycle risk, reputation risk, strategic risk. the risk management role help identify, evaluate, monitor, manage control mitigate risk become crucial role modern-day banking. indeed, probably exaggerate importance say quality bank's risk management become one key determinant success bank. basel ii recognise importance risk - quality risk management - mean know "pillar 2". under pillar 2, assessment firstly risk bank run and, secondly, ability manage risks. this lead bank require hold capital cover risks, make improvement risk management. pillar 2 therefore encourage bank improve risk management, give capital incentive so. 1/5 i say late on, probably time point i say little hong kong implement basel ii. hong kong implementation we take strategic decision early basel ii process hong kong implement basel ii accordance timetable recommend basel committee bank supervision members. this mean adoption approach new framework start 2007, advance approach start 2008. thus hong kong adopt basel ii time major international financial centres, london, frankfurt tokyo. from regional perspective, implementation timetable hong kong broadly similar adopt australia singapore. for several year hkma develop supervisory approach along basel ii lines, lead significant change supervision conducted. central issue "process versus rules". process versus rule the original basel capital accord develop risk management still much infancy. it reflect might call "rules-based" approach regulation sense set prescriptive standard bank require follow. it rely largely application simple, mechanical formula assess much capital bank hold. the essence old capital accord represent attempt monitor prudential soundness bank use standardise risk measurement framework, apply institution employ data base snap-shot balance sheet certain specify report dates. the approach standardise since regulator specify precise form calculation capital adequacy perform - example, specific risk category asset assigned. there are, course, still plenty rules-based aspect new capital framework: difficult otherwise understand many hundred page basel ii document need for. however, point i want stress advance approaches, especially irb, introduce new element bank supervision. for want good term, i'll call process-regulation. whereas old accord focus rules, irb approach focus instead process risk managed. rather prescribe detail rule assess capital adequacy, supervisor future need ass adequacy internal process use firm manage risks. this reflected, example, approach propose take validation irb systems: prescribe specific numerical standard expect internal risk measurement system achieve. rather, discus individual irb bank system perform relation bank's internal objective appetite risk. irb require u engage dialogue ai understand go develop approve irb models. a result, future bank supervision likely take form active discussion counterpart risk management credit control functions. it le matter u set hard fast rules, matter u hold dialogue risk managers. of course, dialogue cannot open-ended: point draw conclusion make assessment. but irb bank expect u show different level engagement, great intensity interest in, risk management system previously shown. 2/5 pillar 2 a i mention earlier, much focus basel ii irb, thus pillar 1. now, credit risk remains, course, one fundamental risk banking. however, hkma determine early stage basel ii process would desirable broaden focus bring equation various "pillar 2 risks." the case is, view, self-evident, risk concentration risk, interest rate risk bank book, liquidity fund risk every bite devastate financial health bank credit risk be. in run-up final agreement basel ii, therefore, issue series guidance note give encouragement ai upgrade ability manage risk appropriately. we know come year ai risk management specialist likely preoccupy pillar 1 thus want make sure "pillar 2 risks" adequately address priority, afterthought. in theory, pillar 2 require bank formal process allocate internal capital wide range risk explicitly part pillar 1. this formal process sometimes refer capital allocation assessment process "caap". however, acknowledge bank currently process place, large sophisticate institution able devote resource necessary build type formal capital allocation systems. consequently, regulator, plan require bank develop internal capital allocation models, least initially. the need model must commensurate institution's scale sophistication. in place require ai develop models, hkma develop internal supervisory review process, "srp". a may know, hkma long time set capital ratio bank-by-bank basis. this aim try ensure capital ratio reflect risk profile individual ai, take account full range risk potentially exposed. we intend use srp bring great rigour process set ai-specific minimum capital ratios. in effect, srp credit score system. it take large number variables, carefully choose reflect different aspect risk, combine produce single overall "score" ai. the score turn map onto particular range capital ratios. among factor process consider pillar 1 pillar 2 risk i already mentioned. in addition, srp take account variety factor reputation risk, strategic risk, quality corporate governance. the input process derive primarily exist supervisory arrangements, off-site on-site examinations. we believe srp capable replace current, relatively subjective, approach set ai-specific minimum capital ratio something rigorous objective. like good credit score systems, still scope expert judgement and, experience, substitute supervisory smell-test. on whole, however, intend base ai's capital ratio output process. once derive score, thus correspond capital ratio, individual ai, discus result srp ai. again, review irb systems, concept supervisory dialogue important. it aim understand ai approach range risk exist outside pillar 1, understand mechanism place identifying, monitor control risks. if ai able demonstrate u good way allocate capital risk srp model, open discus correspond adjustment capital ratio. thus one aim approach give bank incentive come good mousetrap. there capital benefit good internal capital allocation process. 3/5 implementation challenge i'd like say word next implementation challenge associate basel ii. although preparation implementation new capital framework well advance large number jurisdictions, include hong kong, process without critics. it recently claim much regulation great source risk global financial system, implication suppose draw regulator somehow engage self-defeating exercise. at root criticism compliance burden arise basel ii implementation take combination recent developments, adoption international account standards. the first point i make time various initiative completely control: account profession, example, tend plough furrow independently bank regulators. this case many lead international financial centres, hong kong. effort underway variety context try secure good coordination various initiatives, admit ideal world would quite cluster together. that said, i would first acknowledge basel ii require heavy investment risk management system it infrastructure, well radical change risk management culture banks. however, healthy development. i suspect bank would case need make so-called "basel ii-related" investment want stay top game. by agree accept banks' internal risk management system basis calculation regulatory capital requirements, basel committee provide powerful incentive bank upgrade risk management systems. but otherwise would need able compete best. there are, however, quite specific challenge asian bank use advance approach basel ii. one important availability data. historically, many asian bank collect data need develop type model need irb purposes. some start so, several year sufficiently rich data begin inform credit risk management processes. a second, related, factor even data collected, many country default experience distort 1997-98 financial crisis: question bank extent experience factor risk management systems. a third issue extent off-the-shelf model develop primarily u market capture behavioural characteristic asian borrowers. none problem principle insurmountable. however, suggest degree caution order bank make leap irb. that advise bank consider use irb approach "look leap." the important consideration bank make sure irb system robust well-founded, integrate overall system identifying, manage control risk, make credit decisions, product pricing. we will allow bank much time need achieve objectives. the implementation date irb approach take deadline. bank feel need long work system full support. get right matter specific date calendar. look ahead, regulator industry continue face many challenge come month years. put basel ii place demand everyone involved, continue so. however, i confident process complete able look back satisfaction achieved. there doubt mind basel ii produce step-change risk management practice 4/5 around world, result global bank system become efficient robust. through pain transition, need keep eye firmly prize. 5/5 amando m tetangco, jr: stimulate growth microfinance philippine speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas, national capital region (ncr) stakeholders’ forum microfinance, manila, 19 september 2005. * * * introduction good morning. i happy honor part stakeholders’ forum aim look role microfinance job generation entrepreneurial growth, specifically national capital region (ncr). the ncr continue high unemployment rate nationwide, result poverty inequality. it indeed opportune time conduct forum address press problems. microfinance: benefit beyond one household in face problems, one possible intervention provision microfinance services. although microfinance panacea, proven, around world, powerful intervention tackle various facet poverty. a already know, practice provision microfinance grow philippines. this increase drive numerous empirical evidence many success story demonstrate microfinance effective tool economic development. microfinance provide necessary push microenterprises help grow. this bear significance philippine micro, small medium enterprise make 99.6% total industry employ 70% workforce. it become even significant learn around 4.1 million family belong low income stratum engage microenterprise activities. without access financial services, microenterprises force rely expensive source credit informal money lender limit capacity grow businesses. it clear therefore invigorate microenterprises, microfinance direct contribution impact economic development poverty alleviation. microfinance empower many filipino live poverty increase economic activity income, build assets, prepare emergency good invest education, health, house thereby improve overall quality lives. in addition, benefit go beyond client’s household. these microbusinesses generate much need employment increase economic activity local economies. growth microfinance industry give benefit microfinance potential far reach gains, question ask u today develop stimulate growth microfinance country. growth microfinance industry may characterize increase breadth depth outreach exist microfinance institutions, heighten competition among microfinance service providers, diversification product service offerings, presence private commercial fund microfinance activities. there standard blueprint show u achieve characteristic ensure growth microfinance industry. to large extent, growth be, be, 1/4 market driven. but enable factor necessary condition must present achieve growth. necessary condition growth first foremost, must enable policy regulatory environment support promote development sustainable viable microfinance institution best serve microfinance clients. the philippine among country world national strategy microfinance. the national strategy envision viable sustainable private microfinancial market main objective provide low income household microenterprises access financial services. anchor national strategy, policy framework create several law issuance pass promote great involvement private sector, non-participation government line agency credit program adoption market orient financial credit policies. these social reform poverty alleviation act, agriculture fishery modernization act, executive order 138 rationalize government direct credit programs, general bank law 2000 baranggay micro business enterprise act. the general bank law particular pave way flourish microfinance within bank sector. the bangko sentral mandate recognize microfinance legitimate bank activity have, since then, take pro-active stance develop “microfinance-friendly” policy environment, increase capacity bsp bank sector well engage promotion advocacy efforts. i happy note initiative play catalytic role bank engage microfinance. before year 2000, 55 bank claim microfinance operations. today, 187 bank engage microfinance cover region country. that well 200% increase le five years. with increase bank provide microfinance, see unbanked yet bankable receive much need access financial services. the bsp commit continue support development primary objective create policy environment allow bank wide scope microfinance operations, protect depositor financial system. in cases, may entail flexible provisions, case may entail rigorous standards. what essential policy regulation seriously consider need bank microfinance operation order increase outreach sustainability. aside laws, issuance national strategy, philippine also boast clear regulatory framework microfinance institutions. this framework focus key area transparency, portfolio quality, efficiency outreach. the regulatory framework establish support diverse set microfinance institutions, whether bank, ngo cooperative, recognize strength type institution deliver quality microfinance services. this enable policy regulatory environment lead burgeon interest microfinance ever-growing number microfinance institutions. this bring u second necessary condition ascertain growth microfinance sustainable viable one. this second factor need microfinance institution adopt subscribe performance standard operations. the bangko sentral member national credit council work hard finalize set performance standard use microfinance institution across banking, non-governmental cooperative sector facilitate assessment 2/4 evaluation performance. the standard go acronym p.e.s.o., stand portfolio quality, efficiency, sustainability outreach. a microfinance industry develops, standard become relevant. a recent study consultative group assist poor (cgap), consortium 29 donors, show world capital market challenge recent year investor increasingly search alternative way boost return spread risks. they identify microfinance fit neatly trend. with clear standards, possibly industry benchmark rat system future, interest investor good equip evaluate microfinance institution potential partner growth. this beneficial microfinance industry. oikocredit international, social investor increasingly engage microfinance, express channel commercial capital microfinance institution key establish condition sustainability scaling-up microfinance institutions. commercial capital push microfinance institution rigorous financial discipline management. the challenge practitioners, regulator policy maker uphold adhere standard ensure transparent sustainable commercial microfinance industry country. at end day, commercially viable institution able expand reach wide geographical area provide extensive range financial service clients. with institution play, ultimate benefit go microenterprises responsive product services, innovative methodology competitive prices. the third necessary condition presence comprehensive credit information system. with player engage microfinance, problem credit pollution multiple borrow also increasing. the share disseminate credit relate information able address problem. credit bureau useful reduce risk lend encourage responsible attitude towards credit borrower ultimately low delinquency strengthen credit financial system. in addition, presence credit bureau foster lend previously neglect sector micro, small medium enterprise due le reliance collateral base credit decisions. despite many benefit credit bureau, many participate avail service due fear lose client competition, confidentiality issue effectiveness current credit bureau services. at present, propose bill house congress aim fully institutionalize credit information system country. conclusion the continuous growth microfinance industry present u promise opportunities. it important seize opportunity still remain large unmet demand microfinance service country. a long remain nearly 40% population live poverty, urgent need microfinance provide opportunity increase economic activity, foster spirit entrepreneurship, facilitate employment improve quality life community. a microfinance practitioner say, one microfinance loan change future entire family. several loan change community. thousand loan transform entire economy. let u remain focus unrelenting commitment see become reality. 3/4 on part, bangko sentral continue active advocate microfinance country. thank good day you. 4/4 i j macfarlane: what global imbalances? speech mr i j macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, economic society australia dinner, melbourne, 28 september 2005. * * * 1. introduction i give number speech economic society years, pleasure tonight. the last time i give close address conference economist 1997 hobart. the subject i want speak tonight one loom particularly large international macro-economic discussion period since then. i refer subject global imbalance international payments. most discussion, least quite recently, focus large u current account deficit question sustainability risk pose world economy. tonight i would like approach subject global payment imbalance broad perspective. in so, focus attention shift towards asia, recognition give weakness europe, unite state cast accommodate role, rather initiate one. when look global economy past half dozen years, number development difficult satisfactorily understand explain. i suggest follow five development central one need explanation. 1. why u current account deficit start widen sharply 1997, reach high percentage gdp, yet relatively easily financed? 2. why asia run large current account surplus build high level international reserves? 3. why world's central bank push short-term interest rate low level century, apparently easy monetary policy lead appreciable pick-up inflation? 4. why bond yield low, stay low even short-term interest rate raised? 5. against background wide payment imbalances, margin risk corporate emerge market debt exceptionally low? a number explanation put forward account developments. the common explanation start widen u current account deficit, attribute mainly excessive spend borrow insufficient save u household u government.1 while explanation consistent widen u current account deficit, number shortcoming inconsistent development observe global economy. for explanation plausibility, must consistent five simultaneous development list above. in view, promise explanation present one start surplus country focus national save much high national investment countries.2 1 see mann (1999 2002), obsfeld rogoff (2000 2004) peterson (2004). 2 ben bernanke, governor u federal reserve board, give best explanation along lines. he originally call “glut savings” argument, could appropriately call “dearth investment” argument really increase world savings, redistribution. alternatively, could call “glut save surplus countries” argument. see bernanke (2005a, 2005b). 1/10 although not, itself, complete explanation everything happened, plausible consistent five development list above. 2. the excess save surplus country the best start point explanation recognise wide disparity save rate different countries. broadly speaking, asian country tend high save rates, anglo-saxon one low save rates, country somewhere (row 1 table 1). for balance payment purposes, would matter investment rate country match save rate, case (row 2 table 1). in country high save rates, investment rates, high, high save rate, country run current account surplus. the opposite apply low save countries. to understand development current accounts, understand development save investment ratio different country regions. in short, asian country save wish invest countries, invest lend abroad. this basic balance payment identities. other country invest save finance investment use save foreigners. the actual channel take many forms, crucial story. to complicate story slightly, asian country run surplus moment. a result high oil price, middle east russia also so, latin american country different reasons. while acknowledge surpluses, i intend leave rest account grind good deal small asia, that, past experience, likely temporary. for want follow up, i recommend recent paper website.3 return asia, ask country invest themselves, find several explanation i outline later. whatever explanation, probably accept medium term, surplus asian save asian domestic investment fact life; hence, asia run large current account surplus therefore excess supply save invest abroad. give go happen, country must run deficit – another important balance payment identity must hold. if country prepare run deficit, world economy would enter downward spiral ex ante save great ex ante investment. clearly, country run deficit consumers, business 3 for full account developments, see orsmond (2005) imf (2005). 2/10 government will spend whose financial system efficient intermediate flow world savings. for ease exposition, focus three main region world – asia, euro area anglosphere (mainly unite states, also unite kingdom, canada, australia new zealand). asia run large current account surplus, might expect balance deficit two regions. in fact, entire deficit show anglosphere, euro area approximate balance. while balance sound like good thing, euro area achieve largely weak domestic demand high unemployment recent years. so appear balance european payments, fact important imbalance global economy. a explain before, asian surplus invest rest world, tend flow region offer high return capital. while foreign investment flow ways, net term flow asia mainly unite state underpin level u dollar, despite u current account deficit, provide easy access finance u borrower business, household government sectors. 3. how explanation fit five questions? (i) the ease finance u current account deficit there widespread fear express past half dozen year unite state would difficulty finance deficit, u dollar would fall sharply, real interest rate unite state would rise borrower compete funds. in fact, u current account deficit relatively easily finance despite continue fifteen year reach 6 per cent gdp. the u dollar real effective term today slightly level fifteen year ago recent run deficit start (graph 1). although fall net term since early 2002 peak, unwind rise since mid 1990s. this one would expect country difficulty attract fund finance deficit. similarly, real interest rate borrow occur lot low decade ago, subject i address later. overall, u experience consistent plentiful supply internationally-mobile save rather one struggle find fund finance spending. 3/10 (ii) the continuation asian surplus this start point explanation, something explain developments. even so, interest know asian country seem content situation. although common factor among countries, also interest differences. japan easy deal large surplus long time, would expect high-income country rapidly-ageing population. but situation china east asia interest move significant surplus past half dozen years. 4/10 in case east asia , i think clear occur reaction pain suffer asian crisis 1997/98. both asian private government sector cut back sharply show fall investment ratio 7 8 per cent gdp low level, stay (see graph 3). the government region reach conclusion “had make economy resilient international capital flows. the simple way cut expenditure (particularly investment expenditure), keep save high, run current account surplus build international reserves”.4 4 macfarlane (2005). 5/10 in china 's case, story complicated.5 it suffer asian crisis, still absorb lesson country did. that one reason china choose run current account surplus build international reserves. but over-riding reason awareness government that, result economic liberalisation, create 20 million job per year absorb exodus worker countryside. in words, run economy exceptionally fast pace, reluctant adopt policy might run counter aim short run, even would contribute maintain longer-run sustainability. 5 see dooley, folkerts-landau garber (2003 2005) interest account asian approach balance payment adjustment. 6/10 i think historian regard economic liberalisation china major economic event past 30 years, effect show country economic variable first sight seem remote it. to date, size chinese surplus small japan east asia , china 's influence way greater. all asian country acutely aware level competitiveness vis-à-vis china, international trade investment, additional reason resist appreciation currencies. the rapid increase chinese manufacture output exports, base exceptionally low labour costs, affect competitor asia much customer unite states. (iii) low central bank interest rate the high supply asian save explanation sharp fall central-bank-determined interest rate 2001 2002. that fall response central bank develop country collapse global equity market boom associate recession occur countries. but interest question interest rate go low; unite state , japan euro area fell 1930s levels. and stay low, even accept unite state go way restore neutral level? the answer inflation remain low. if inflation pick way early cyclical recoveries, central-bank-determined interest rate would rise now. so real issue inflationary pressure stay low? an ex ante excess supply world save mean would unlikely situation generalise excess demand world's good market occur, hence inflationary pressure emerge. another way think remember surplus save give country mean country produce good service absorb domestic spending. in china's case, massive increase capacity produce manufacture goods, domestic spend keep pace expansion supply. the result rapidly grow supply low-cost manufacture good supply china rest world. the true small scale asian country run surpluses. the increase productive capacity china part asia see part mechanism trade current account surplus exert downward pressure global inflation. 7/10 (iv) why bond yield remain historically low level the fact bond yield remain low despite rise oil price feed raise short-term interest rate really nub issue. if excessive u spend inadequate save main story affect world economy, bond rate would rise falling. clearly, development bond market far consistent world plentiful save one excessive spend borrowing. the low level nominal interest rate may partly explain force already cite hold inflation. but real interest rate also fall extremely low levels.6 (graph 5). thus, inflation inflationary expectation work – real demand supply borrow fund must changed. in economic terms, fall price suggest supply curve save move outwards relative demand curve. (v) why risk margin narrow again, entirely consistent world excess supply fund look attractive yields. with yield high quality government paper drive low levels, investor attract security offer something higher. thus, margin grade corporate debt emerge market debt drive down. this occur despite recent history u corporate scandal default argentina, would normally heighten perception risk securities. of course, search yield affect debt; also explain rise price asset type house equity investor take advantage low borrow cost seek alternative investments. 6 only period unanticipated sharp rise inflation lower. 8/10 4. two counterfactuals some observer may think explanation global developments, u profligacy excessive reliance debt let lightly. what, may ask, would happen increase u spend reduce save accommodate asian save lending? the answer increase u spend low u save would occurred, would occur greatly reduce scale. if excess world save available, global economy would opposite position, namely excess demand good capital markets. u demand fund would push bond rates, inflationary pressure would mean u monetary policy would tighter, u government would difficulty fund budget deficit. business household unite state would face tough monetary fiscal policy spend would restrained. despite high u interest rates, u dollar would probably weak foreign demand u asset would lower. the u current account deficit would small due weak domestic demand low u dollar. it clear whether world economy would weak stronger. on one hand, extra asian spend would push world demand. on hand, high inflation, high world interest rate reduce u spend would hold down. but imbalance international payment would smaller. i want give impression large u current account deficit imbalance, go rise forever. clearly, case. my view start analysis u current account, look remediation key unwind imbalances. for example, commonly hear prescription unite state reduce call world save reduce fiscal deficit. however, analysis correct, reduction u fiscal deficit would unlikely major impact international imbalances.7 in absence policy change asia, asian country would likely continue run surpluses, fiscal contraction unite state would add contractionary influence global economy already characterise surplus save unusually low interest rates. another view recently put excessively loose monetary policy rather saving/investment imbalance heart problem. this view generally bolster reference excessive liquidity, although concept leave undefined. i find argument convincing. there doubt world interest rate exceptionally low, mean monetary policy exceptionally loose? to maintain view, would believe, example, monetary policy japan europe , weak demand growth negligible inflation number years, tightened, i.e. european japanese interest rate raised. this would make sense. the low level interest rate develop country first cause global imbalances, result them. 5. conclusion in make asia focus account, i hope i give impression i blame asia imbalances. this case, partly i never pessimist sustainability imbalances, partly i sympathise much recent asian experience, particularly asian crisis. my account take form purely fact one seem consistent five question i pose beginning. it one explain downward pressure cpi inflation interest rates, consequence upward pressure asset prices. a central banker, i cannot complain event make central task maintain low inflation easier. similarly, 7 bernanke (2005a) report federal reserve study estimate balance federal budget would reduce current account deficit medium term le 1 per cent gdp. the imf estimate permanent 1 percentage point gdp improvement u budgetary position would low current account deficit ½ one per cent gdp. 9/10 australian, i see impressive economic development asia benefit complementary economy many ways. i provide assessment risk involve current situation would involve another talk least long tonight's. but, reassurance, i think see early sign return normality, even small process likely long one. the fed's policy gradually move u interest rate towards neutrality obvious sign. the one china 's abandonment fix parity u dollar. although upward movement far extremely modest, clearly set direction future. to me, extremely significant move suggest countenance policy change short run might slightly restrain demand, long run increase chance sustainable growth. 10/10 toshihiko fukui: reflection happen global economy today summary speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, 2005 iif annual meeting, washington dc, 25 september 2005. * * * introduction it pleasure appear morning share think happen global economy today. before i go further, let express deep condolence great suffer cause hurricane katrina week ago. my remark divide three parts. in first, i comment current structural change global economy long-term perspective. against backdrop changes, i would like say word change role international monetary fund (imf)--a medium-term issue u room. finally, i comment briefly conjunctural issue--the state japanese economy monetary policy bank japan. i hope answer questions, time i head dull airport catch plane tokyo. structural change global economy the global economy undergo significant structural change last decade. of changes, view, three important. the first entry emerge market economy market-based economic system. the second progress observe information, communications, telecommunication (ict) technology. the third age population, especially mature industrialize economies. let take development turn. since 1990s, emerge market economies--china, india, country central eastern europe--have progressively integrate market-based economic system. take advantage relatively low wage foreign direct investment (fdi) technology transfer mature industrialize economies, country increase supply good service global economy. in process, country broaden export well. they export light industry products, textiles, also heavy high-tech industry products. export also include services, operate call centers. the advance ict technology, widespread use internet, significantly reduce cost process transmit information. this has, turn, enable firm expand operation globally. production good service spread many economies. at time, ict technology also enable firm enhance efficiency so-called middle-management functions, result flatten corporate organizations. the confluence development integration emerge market market-based economic system reduce cost business worldwide, enhance competition global marketplace. meanwhile, importance third structural change i mentioned--the rapid age population especially industrialize economies--is begin sink in. we realize shift demographic may profound effect various aspect global economic system. for example, may change savings-investment balance; may change flow money financial intermediaries; may influence asset allocation among investors. 1/6 today, i choose focus issues, various development global economy--sometimes puzzle developments--flow changes. one subdue rate consumer inflation, defy extremely elevate price level commodity raw material crude oil. another relative stability long-term interest rates. at end august, crude oil price reach us$70 barrel. though price come peaks, starkly illustrate rapidly rise price commodity raw materials. factor political unrest producer country bad weather certainly influence developments. look crude oil, production capacity petroleum product constrained, enough money invest exploration, extraction, refine wake collapse price second oil crisis. nevertheless, significant factor seem tightness supply demand condition cause strong demand. in particular, combination relatively high growth relatively inefficient energy use emerge market country seem contribute high expect growth crude oil demand. a i note moment ago, emerge market country integrate market-based economic system. be new member system, however, economy still evolving. there remain rigidities, price controls. consequently, able use resource efficiently mature industrial economies. give environment, seem live high price commodity raw materials, least time being. while input price thus rising, pass-through output price rather limited. in fact, since 1990s, observe significantly low rate consumer price index (cpi) inflation around globe. productivity growth corporate sector provide cushion. however, important factor behind development integration emerge market country market-based economic system. with increase integration, good bring onto market. in turn, competition enhance globally, producers' price power weakened, consumer benefit downward pressure prices. low inflation accompany small fluctuation economy. not see low inflation rates, also see low inflation volatility. the volatility growth also declining. the increase importance services, demand le volatile goods, one contribute factor. a individual firm take advantage ict manage output, economic activity macro level may see le fluctuation. at time, great flexibility product labor market may help firm adapt smoothly change business conditions. obviously, factor structural change also low inflation volatility inflation growth. central bank also contribute enhance stability. independent central banks, pursue price stability monetary policy, successfully tame inflation. this enhance credibility monetary policy, and, turn, stabilize inflation expectations. in financial markets, low stable rate inflation lead low long-term interest rate around world. since i wish repeat chairman greenspan, i merely say structural change i touch today definitely influence interest rate developments. the three broad trends--globalization, ict, aging--will sustain time. consider still million billion underemployed worker emerge market countries, integration process probably continue many years. since human ingenuity unlimited, find new innovative us ict year ahead. institutional change mitigate effect rapid age begun. 2/6 a result interaction trends, sure see economic development would never imagine before. we crystal ball accurately identify change ahead u consequences. this mean well-being maintain efficiently effectively adapt change environment. we must monitor event closely unfold, ready respond flexibly. i optimistic central bank adapt change economic conditions, do many years. the change role imf structural change confine real economy. the force globalization influence international monetary system well. yesterday, meet imf council, discuss result strategic review imf, initiate manage director, rodrigo de rato. rodrigo's project extremely helpful, draw comprehensive list issue address. the consensus stand already describe gordon brown yesterday, i repeat here. the strategic review necessary useful define need do today. it is, however, first step. sixty year ago, fund create maintain network exchange rate anchor u.s. dollar back gold. there also mechanism facilitate adjustments. member country oblige enter annual consultations. in process, fund identify economic policy would undermine network fix exchange rates. the fund suggest remedies, lend money necessary buy time policy adjustment take effect. if exchange rate really fell line economic fundamentals, possible tweak rates. fast-forward today, long fix exchange rates, particularly systemically important countries. a result, policy advice fund lose force urgency had. at time, witness increasingly strong mobile private capital flows. these flow are, course, generally beneficial. though hard measure precisely, private capital play significant role robust investment-led growth many countries. private flow get bigger, get nimble. in seventy eighties, bank main financier emerge market economies. on hand, much today's private capital flow form bond issues. compare banks, bondholder tend react quickly. banker cannot call loan due. on hand, bondholder sense problem brewing, sell bond immediately. if everyone head exit once, bond price collapse exacerbate problem issue country. there also coordination problems. you cram dozen banker one room cut deal, cannot bondholders. no wonder emerge market develop country tap international financial market sometimes feel insecure helpless. the welcome rug could pull quickly feet, many find late 1990s. they turn fund help, private flow could even overwhelm fund. fund quotas, essentially equivalent paid-in capital, total us$330 billion. this fraction global financial flows. in recent effort reform international monetary system, try deal changes. a i say minute ago, strategic review important milestone. nevertheless, recommendation soon overtake development international financial landscape. the three trend i mention first part talk--globalization, ict, aging--will continue. this mean capital movement 3/6 economy accelerate, broaden expand. the fund must continue evolve, remain relevant tomorrow's international monetary system. though cannot predict exact consequence structural changes, general idea expect seem clear enough. if private flow become increasingly important, emphasize private solution well public interventions. there two significant development context. one collective action clause (cacs) bond covenants, advocate g-10 country september 2002. now almost new international bond issue govern cacs. in near future, bond without cacs retired, cacs would govern resolution sovereign debt crises. a typical cac allow term bond issue change consent 75% bondholders. this mean country cannot pay debt full, need come restructure plan satisfy 75% lenders. the clear transparent rule also reduce chance holdout rogue investor disrupt orderly workout process. in turn, market appropriately price risk cost defaults. another notable development "principles stable capital flow fair debt restructure emerge markets," release year ago. i know manage director, charles dallara colleague iif work hard see publication. the principle offer framework enhance flow information borrower lenders. they also provide guidance productive engagement them. these improvement enable lender ass price risk precisely, enhance stability flow develop emerge market countries, facilitate resolution problem occur. these developments, especially principles, would strengthen market discipline. borrow country would encourage improve institution adopt sound economic policies. a result, see few international financial crises. in unfortunate hopefully rare event problem arise, borrow country private lender negotiate orderly settlements, framework cacs. the public sector, include fund, would call rare cases, speed magnitude problem might overwhelm effort formulate private solutions. what mean fund? in term give policy advice, fund's role would relative. if private lender become important, borrow country would incline listen market wants. the fund face formidable competition, i think build excellent reputation. i especially look forward effort currently underway enhance fund's work relate financial issues. meanwhile, i note moment ago, fund lend necessary rapidly unfold crisis considerable magnitude. we should, therefore, consider current rule release fund resource could appropriately cope situation. in jargon fund, question improve rule exceptional access. to say board responsible approve lend sidestep question. can board form consensus quickly enough? be board representative enough member subscribe comfortably decisions? who go hold accountable something go wrong? answer question tax imagination full extent, must dodge them. disaster happen. recent development japanese economy before close remarks, let briefly speak japanese economy monetary policy bank japan. 4/6 if put aside quarter-to-quarter fluctuation rate growth, japanese economy recovery track three half years, since begin 2002. nevertheless, summer 2004, period sluggish growth export industrial production. this pause growth bring global adjustment ict sector. the bank japan state along slow growth temporary, japanese economy would eventually regain momentum. there were, however, concern japan slip back recession. fortunately, recent development seem indicate pause growth finally over: adjustment ict sector almost complete; domestic demand components, private capital investments, household consumption particular, generally show firm growth; exports, flat months, seem regain traction. i believe trend sustain time. the japanese economy remain moderate endure growth path, support domestic external demand. there two particularly encourage factors. the first japanese firm last see end structural adjustment necessitate burst bubble economy. for decade, japanese economy yoke "three excesses"--excess capacity, excess employment, excess debt. japanese firm work hard get rid excesses. they adopt new strategy enhance efficiency competitiveness. a result, become profitable. in fact, measure profits-to-sales ratio, japanese firm profitable end 1980s, peak bubble economy. against background, growth capital investment relatively strong, large manufacture firm also manufacture small medium-sized enterprise (smes) non-manufacturing firms. the second encourage factor household increasingly benefit recovery corporate sector. employment growing, jobless rate drop seven-year low 4.4%. look past headline numbers, see even encourage signs. until recently, japanese firm hire part-time temporary worker order keep labor cost check. today, firm step effort hire permanent workers, background improve profitability thus business confidence. consequently, employee income, depress rise proportion part-time temporary workers, rise moderately. the promise employment income environment firmly support personal consumption, good services. these trend employment, income consumption expect continue time being. come back broad trend, japanese economy grow 2.7% 2004 expect grow 2.0% 2005 accord fund's world economic outlook (weo). this spectacular unite states, grow 4.2% 2004 whose weo growth forecast 3.5% 2005. nevertheless, respectable growth path compare mature industrialize economies. i believe moderate growth trend sustain time. what mean monetary policy? the bank japan maintain policy framework quantitative easing. a know, framework, bank supply liquidity far excess require reserves, create environment short-term interest rate stay close zero. another element present policy framework firm commitment maintain environment year-on-year inflation, measure core cpi, stably zero above. 5/6 currently, japanese core cpi still decline slightly, bank japan steadfastly adhere commitment i explained. by so, support japanese economy's return stable sustainable path growth. thank attention. it pleasure speak you. 6/6 alan greenspan: economic flexibility remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, national association business economics annual meeting, chicago, (via satellite), 27 september 2005. * * * today i like reflect way economic policy affect affect increase flexibility u.s. economy. for country's first century half, government peripherally engage currently term management aggregate demand. any endeavor alter path private economic activity active intervention would deem inappropriate and, important, unnecessary. in one notable coincidence history, declaration independence sign year adam smith publish wealth nations. smith's prescription let market prevail minimal governmental interference become guide philosophy american leadership much history. with masterful insight work free-market institution emerging, smith postulate "invisible hand" competitive behavior drive economy's resource toward full efficient use. economic growth prosperity, argued, would emerge government stand aside allow market work. indeed, within decades, free-market capitalism become prevail stance governments' economic policy, even often implement imperfectly. this framework withstand conceptual onslaught robert owen's utopians, karl marx's communist later, fabian socialists. the free-market paradigm come more-vigorous attack collapse world's major economy 1930s. a global depression deepened, seem failure competitive market restore full employment perplex economist john maynard keynes offer explanation influence policy practitioner generation come. he argue that, contrary tenet smith followers, market system always converge full employment. they often appear settle equilibrium significant segment workforce unable find jobs. in place smith's laissez-faire approach arise view government action require restore full employment rectify see deficiency market-driven outcomes. a tidal wave regulation soon sweep much american business community. labor relations, security markets, banking, agricultural pricing, many segment u.s. economy become subject oversight government. the apparent success economy world war ii, operate full employment contrast early frighten development depression years, lead considerable reluctance fully dismantle wartime regulation hostility come end. however, crack facade government economic management appear early post-world war ii years, crack continue widen time passed. at macro level, system wage price control impose 1970s deal problem inflation prove unworkable ineffective. and micro level, heavy regulation many industry increasingly see impede efficiency competitiveness. by early 1980s, long-prevalent notion centrally plan economy soviet union catch west begin discredited, though fully discard collapse berlin wall 1989 expose economic ruin behind iron curtain. 1/5 start 1970s, u.s. presidents, support bipartisan majority congress, respond grow recognition distortion create regulation, deregulate large segment transportation, communications, energy, financial service industries. the state purpose deregulation enhance competition, come see significant spur productivity growth elevate standard living. assist dismantle economic restraint persistent, albeit slow, low barrier cross-border trade finance. a consequence, unite states, widely see once-great economic power lose way, gradually move back forefront joseph schumpeter, renowned harvard professor, call "creative destruction"--the continual scrap old technology make way innovative. in paradigm, standard live rise depreciation cash flow industry employ older, increasingly obsolescent technology marshaled, along new savings, finance production capital asset almost always embody cutting-edge technologies. workers, necessity, migrate capital. through process, wealth created, incremental step incremental step, high level productivity associate innovative technology displace less-efficient productive capacity. the model presuppose continuous churn flexible competitive economy new displace old. a 1980s progressed, success strategy confirm early view loosen regulatory restraint business would improve flexibility economy. no specific program encompass coordinate initiative enhance flexibility, grow recognition market economy could best withstand recover shock provide maximum flexibility. beyond deregulation, innovative technologies, especially information technologies, contribute critically enhance flexibility. a quarter-century ago, example, company often require week discover emergence inventory imbalances, allow production continue exacerbate excess. excessive stockbuilding, turn, necessitate deep decline output would necessary knowledge status inventory fully current. the advent innovative information technology significantly shorten report lag, enable flexible real-time response emerge imbalances. deregulation new information technology joined, unite state elsewhere, advance flexibility financial sector. financial stability may turn important contributor evident significant gain economic stability past two decades. historically, bank forefront financial intermediation, part ability leverage offer efficient source funding. but period severe financial stress, leverage often bring bank institution and, cases, precipitate financial crisis lead recession worse. but recent regulatory reform, couple innovative technologies, stimulate development financial products, asset-backed securities, collateral loan obligations, credit default swaps, facilitate dispersion risk. conceptual advance price option complex financial products, along improvement computer telecommunication technologies, significantly low cost of, expand opportunity for, hedge risk readily deflect early decades. the new instrument risk dispersal enable large sophisticate banks, credit-granting role, divest much credit risk pass institution far le leverage. insurance companies, especially reinsurance, pension funds, hedge fund continue willing, price, supply credit protection. 2/5 these increasingly complex financial instrument contribute development far flexible, efficient, hence resilient financial system one exist quarter-century ago. after burst stock market bubble 2000, unlike previous period follow large financial shocks, major financial institution defaulted, economy hold far good many anticipated. if attain degree flexibility mitigate significant shocks--a proposition yet fully tested--the performance economy improve job macroeconomic policymakers make much simpler. government today, although still far activist nineteenth early twentieth centuries, rediscover benefit competition resilience economic shock fosters. we also begin recognize international version smith's invisible hand globalization economic forces. whether intention happenstance, many, most, government recent decade rely force marketplace reduce intervention market outcomes. we appear revisit adam smith's notion flexible economy, great ability self-correct inevitable, often unanticipated disturbances. that great tendency toward self-correction make cyclical stability economy le dependent action macroeconomic policymakers, whose response often come late misguided. it important remember adjustment market imbalance well way imbalance become widely identify problem. individual prices, exchange rates, interest rates, adjust incrementally real time restore balance. in contrast, administrative policy action await clear evidence imbalance necessity late. be able rely market heavy lift adjustment exceptionally valuable policy asset. the impressive performance u.s. economy past couple decades, despite shock past would surely produce mark economic contraction, offer clear evidence benefit increase market flexibility. we weather decline october 19, 1987, fifth market value u.s. equity little evidence subsequent macroeconomic stress--an episode hint change adjustment dynamics. the credit crunch early 1990s burst stock market bubble 2000 absorb shallow recession post-world war ii period. and economic fallout tragic event september 11, 2001, moderate market forces, severe economic weakness evident weeks. most recently, flexibility market-driven economy allow us, thus far, weather reasonably well steep rise spot future price oil natural gas experience past two years. the consequence far stable economy. * * * in perhaps must great irony economic policymaking, success stabilization carry risks. monetary policy--in fact, economic policy--to extent successful prolong period, reduce economic variability and, hence, perceive credit risk interest rate term premiums. a decline perceive risk often self-reinforcing encourage presumption prolong stability thus willingness reach ever-more-extended time period. but, people inherently risk averse, risk premium cannot decline indefinitely. whatever reason narrow credit spreads, differ episode episode, history caution extend period low concern credit risk invariably follow reversal, attendant fall price risky assets. such development apparently reflect market dynamic also all-too-evident alternate infectious bout human euphoria distress instability engender. 3/5 therefore, difficult suppress grow market exuberance economic environment perceive stable, highly flexible system need place rebalance economy psychology asset price could change rapidly. indeed, i point past, policy enhance economic flexibility need integral part economic policy monetary fiscal initiatives. rely policymakers perceive speculative asset bubble develop implement timely policy address successfully misalignment asset price simply realistic. a federal open market committee (fomc) transcript mid-1990s duly note, feed uncomfortable stock market appear early 1996 disconnect moorings. yet significant monetary tighten 1994 prevent must begin bubble 1990s. and equity price continue rise tighten policy mid-1999 may 2000. indeed, equity market's ability withstand period tighten arguably reinforce bull market's momentum. the fomc know tool available choke stock market boom, tool would effective undermine market participants' confidence future stability. market participants, however, read resilience economy stock price face monetary tighten indication undiscounted market strength. by late 1990s, appear u aggressive action would require counteract euphoria develop wake extraordinary gain productivity growth spawn technological change. in short, would need risk precipitate significant recession, unknown consequences. the alternative wait eventual exhaustion force boom. we conclude latter course far safer. whether judgment continue hold time yet determined. * * * flexibility readily achieve foster environment maximum competition. a key element create environment flexible labor markets. many work people equate labor market flexibility job insecurity. despite perception, flexible labor policy appear promote job creation. an increase capacity management discharge worker without excessive cost, example, apparently increase companies' willingness hire without fear unremediable mistakes. the net effect, surprise most, appear decline structural unemployment rate unite states. protectionism guises, domestic international, contribute welfare american workers. at best, short-term fix cost low standard live nation whole. we need increase education train displace creative destruction, stifle competition. move forward, i trust learn durable lesson benefit foster preserve flexible economy. that flexibility product economic dynamism worker firm unleashed, part, effort policymakers remove rigidity promote competition. although business cycle disappeared, flexibility make economy resilient shock stable overall past couple decades. to sure, stability create new challenge policymakers. but fundamentally, environment great economic stability key impressive growth standard live economic welfare evident unite states. 4/5 5/5 datuk zamani abdul ghani: role development financial institution financial system speech datuk zamani abdul ghani, deputy governor central bank malaysia, international ceo forum development finance institution 2005, kuala lumpur, 12 september 2005. * * * i would like first express sincere appreciation association development finance institution malaysia invite say word morning "the role development financial institution (or dfis) financial system". it indeed honour address distinguish gather ceo senior official dfis many part world. before go subject hand, allow congratulate organiser jointly put international forum. this forum provide platform ceo senior official exchange view idea sme development important, role dfis endeavour. i would also like specifically welcome foreign participant malaysia wish pleasant enjoyable stay kuala lumpur. my remark morning consist three parts. the first provide overall perspective universal establishment dfis many part world; second look prospect challenge dfis carry roles; final part provide insight role dfis malaysian perspective. there present approximately 550 dfis worldwide. these special financial institution establish mostly own government aim promote support national economic development agenda. indeed, v years, history shown, reinforce view, dfis important role play country's socio-economic development. for instance, europe, advent development bank trace back mid-nineteenth century, establish meet increase demand medium long-term capital new emerge enterprise industrial revolution. the year follow world war ii saw establishment dfis many develop country provide, particular, medium long-term finance identify critical support economic development agenda countries. in laissez-faire economy, efficient financial intermediation system mobilise allocate scarce resource towards activity would optimise rate return. on basis, commercially-driven profit-maximising bank institution would often tend take short-term view consider solely private benefit project, expense potential long-term social benefit could derive finance particular project. this has, therefore, create gap market place whereby certain segment economy underserved bank system. these include development project involve high potential risk long gestation period, yet significant long-term benefit overall economic development country. similarly, also sector group business which, due business characteristic lack track record, limit credit history inadequate collateral, adequate access finance bank system. these clearly instance market failure, establishment dfis indeed attempt rectify shortcoming. in regard, achieve national policy economic social development, dfis establish strategic conduit bridge gap supply financial services, channel resource fund financial system area sector deem strategic long-term economic development purposes. in essence, dfis complement bank institution meet finance requirement 1/5 economy, particularly support economic social development nation. the establishment dfis part national development plan itself. a policy-based financial institutions, dfis role mandate link closely country's national development objectives. this evidence establishment dfis specific purpose promote development identify sectors, range industrial agriculture sector area export promotion, infrastructure development well small medium enterprise (smes). it notable role dfis evolve course country's economic development transformation. this important ensure dfis remain relevant support change finance need economy. in instances, dfis widen diversify scope activities, cater financial need new growth areas, information communication technology (ict), biotechnology. many expand financial product include provide short-term work capital loans, equity participation investment banking. while operate widen scope activities, observe majority dfis continue maintain provision medium long-term finance project finance core activities. at time, dfis still fundamentally remain complementary, especially support strategic sector smes agriculture. a reflect term, "development financial institution", dfis expect provide development finance nation building, also undertake high degree developmental role nurture develop target sectors. with regard this, dfis demonstrate outstanding performance developmental role. for instance, kfw mittelstandbank, prominent dfi foster sme development germany, provide credit facility establish smes also new start-ups. another example organisation smes regional innovation japan focus provide advisory consultancy services, train nurture develop smes. let's look prospect challenge dfis, i.e., second part presentation. with grow change global economy, i doubt dfis remain important relevant meet increase developmental need respective countries. this development, indeed, present opportunity challenge dfis way forward. while expand economies, develop develop countries, would create great business activity dfis, also mean remain innovative product service explore new way business, able respond effectively different finance developmental requirements. dfis must continuously evolve review area comparative advantage order remain relevant, effective strategic. to drive performance, one important aspect clearly identify key performance indicator dfis, order measure efficiency effectiveness perform mandate roles. recognise dfis' developmental role, performance measurement dfi go beyond standard financial measurement encompass quantitative qualitative non-financial indicator evaluate economic social contribution dfis, consistent objective establishment. for dfis involve sme development, key performance indicator include number new start-ups financed, extent borrower receive advisory service number smes "graduated" dfis. an important aspect highlight need dfis financially sound sustainable operations. this critical dfis could fulfill role without continuously draw resource government public sector. it indeed hearten note many dfis successful balance challenge fulfill developmental roles, ensure operation financially sustainable. for instance, 2/5 development bank japan, focus provision supplement long-term fund qualify infrastructure projects, show favourable financial performance return equity 6.5% 2004. similarly, business development bank canada, lead sme development bank country, also record encourage performance average return equity 7.1% past five years. the experience dfis prove despite specific mandate finance development activities, business operation dfis financially sustainable. these success story essentially share several key factors, include high focus mandates; dynamic leadership proper accountability within dfis; continuous development human resource capability; intensive use information technology improve efficiency; last, least, adoption sound prudent financial principle well best practice operations. at time, give relatively limit access funds, recognise financial support government important enable dfis play role sustainable basis. this, however, mean dfis solely rely government funding. in order remain relevant effective meet grow financial need expand economy, dfis need increasingly draw fund alternative sources, capital market. source fund directly market would also help instil certain form discipline operation dfis. allow opportunity share overview role development dfis malaysia. there currently 14 dfis malaysia. like find countries, dfis establish fund government develop promote identify strategic sectors, line overall industrialisation economic development objective malaysia. the first dfi malaysian industrial development finance berhad (midf), establish 1960, provide medium long-term finance promote development private industrial enterprises. subsequently, several major dfis established, include bank pertanian malaysia (or agriculture bank malaysia) promote agricultural development, bank pembangunan malaysia berhad (or development bank malaysia) promote bumiputera indigenous community development commerce industry, bank industri malaysia berhad (or industrial bank malaysia) support development industrial manufacture sectors, well export-import bank malaysia (exim bank) malaysia export credit insurance berhad (mecib) promote international trade support export diversification expansion, especially non-traditional markets. over years, dfis malaysia evolve tandem country's economic transformation, especially support development strategic new growth area high technology, infrastructure, sme development micro finance. bank pembangunan entrust government support infrastructure development expedite economic recovery follow financial crisis 1997. likewise, line strategy promote capital-intensive high technology industries, bank industri entrust task support advance industrial development, engineer activity computer software development. in malaysian financial system, bank institution form large component financial system, constitute 51% 78%, respectively, total asset loan financial system. in contrast , total asset loan dfis group, respectively account 5% financial system. nevertheless, dfis instrumental provide complementary financial service need support development target sector activities. one particular notable development support provide dfis smes. like many economies, malaysia, smes form backbone economy high potential foster forward backward linkage activity along value chain. while smes constitute 90% total establishment manufacture sector, 3/5 moment provide 30% employment sector contribute 6% malaysia's gdp. clearly, room unlock potential smes malaysia. while bank system remain main provider fund support activity smes, tendency system focus establish smes. it also argue bank institution also lack appropriate skill experience develop nurture smes. this presence dfis critical, provide complementary services, financial non-financial, particularly support viable small smes unable obtain finance bank institutions. in malaysia, present two major dfis specialise support development smes. these bank pembangunan dan infrastruktur malaysia berhad credit guarantee corporation (cgc). each dfis assign specify mandate role assist smes malaysia. bank pembangunan entrust mandate promote entrepreneurial development provide financial service smes, also assume nurture developmental role provision advisory consultancy service target group. meanwhile, cgc mandate assist smes lack track record collateral access financing, provide credit guarantee enhance smes' accessibility credit facilities. to supplement guarantee schemes, cgc, business advisory service entity programme, identify engage panel consultant assist smes, particularly draw business plan financial documents. bank negara malaysia recognise important complementary role dfis financial system developmental role support national socio-economic agenda. a such, bank negara malaysia financial sector masterplan (fsmp) draw roadmap development dfis, objective develop group dfis able perform mandate effective efficient manner minimal cost government. in order achieve objective, three broad development thrust outline dfis, namely, strengthen regulatory supervisory framework dfis, capacity capability build well institutional efficiency enhancement dfis. a total eight recommendation formulate premise development thrusts. one significant milestone strategy strengthen dfis enactment development financial institution act 2002 (dfia). the act provide comprehensive regulatory supervisory framework dfis, primary objective ensure dfis perform mandate role activity carry prudently,

robust dfis capable perform mandate role effectively. seven dfis currently place purview act. recognise unique characteristic dfi, regulation policy largely tailored-made suit different role function dfi view facilitate strengthen operations. in general, dfis require ensure operation activity line mandate roles, underpin good corporate governance best practices. they require operate transparency, especially regard information disclosure corporate performance, order enhance credibility harness great confidence public serve well government. strategy formulate also focus enhance clarity role

dfis, order enhance effectiveness support development smes. in addition, bank negara malaysia develop distribute set micro finance manual dfis engage provision micro finance, use reference acquire

complementary developmental role address nation's development strategies. nevertheless, envisage dfis expect evolve direct financier function strategic conduit facilitate finance bank system, especially provision credit enhancement. in addition, dfis would also increasingly become specialise institution render advisory business support services, order increase effectiveness meet finance developmental needs. at time, need dfis remain financially sustainable perform mandate role cannot over-emphasised. this would require continuous capacity capability enhancement dfis, especially strengthen human capital skill institutional efficiency, together adoption good corporate governance best practice dfis. in addition, ensure available resource channel adequately appropriately support target sectors, dfis would need strategically reduce channel fund sector business mature and, own, would able obtain financial resource bank institution capital market. in conclusion, i must say theme today's forum "revving smes engine growth" timely appropriate give importance potential economic contribution smes, particularly develop countries. therefore, important sme sector continue receive

challenge road euro speech mr lucas papademos, vice president european central bank, conference hold latvijas banka, riga, 19 september 2005. * * * i. introduction it great pleasure speak conference organise latvijas banka, country play important role major trade centre european history. initially, role partly reflect geographic location one old trade route europe – so-called “route viking greeks”, use trade, among things, latvian amber – route date back time ancient greek roman empire. and later, city gather today, riga, become one significant member hanseatic league, control trade bustle baltic sea 14th 15th centuries. today, latvia modern dynamic economy, occupy important position european trade, achieve remarkable transition towards successful market economy gain independence 1991. trade finance always go hand hand. therefore, surprise latvian economy undergo impressive transformation, latvian financial system. latvia make substantial progress development financial structure create institutional legal framework necessary support market-oriented financial system.1 today, financial market develop rapidly new direction provide valuable service household corporate sector, underpin function modern high-growth economy. a i address distinguish audience expert knowledge latvian economy, i consider appropriate take broad comprehensive view, look development financial sector latvia, new eu member state whole. after overview certain salient feature characterise financial structure countries, i concentrate two issue recently receive considerable attention policy-makers media: strong credit growth rapidly rise house prices. this bring focal point remarks: challenge arise development appropriate policy responses. ii. feature financial structure new member state many witness first hand remarkable transformation economy financial system new member state central eastern europe past decade. the convergence financial structure economy western europe also significant. the modernisation country’s financial structure – is, whole set financial markets, instrument institution – crucial importance actual potential economic growth, receive lot 1 see european central bank, “financial sector eu accession countries”, july 2002. 1/7 attention academic policy-makers.2 financial structure differ country country, reflect influence various factor different traditions; structure also change time process economic development financial integration evolve. look financial structure new eu member state today, five key characteristic apparent. first, overall degree financial depth central eastern european country still low euro area. this apply particular financial intermediation bank household sector. for example, bank finance represent much small share gdp euro area.3 it may argue low degree financial intermediation persists, could impede efficient channel save investment, financial reform would therefore needed. second, capital market country remain relatively underdeveloped. a result, issuance quote equity debt security non-financial corporation order finance investment operation important euro area. this may come surprise, give stock market new eu member state experience strong and, indeed, accelerate growth past years. the average annual return equity country outperform significantly stock market euro area. on one hand, substantial increase equity price new member state may reflect rise fundamental value shares. on hand, development may also reflect supply constraints: limit issuance new equity firm relatively small number company listed. for example, share five big list company total market capitalisation turnover high new eu member states. thus, since liquidity market relatively low, price movement small number company might influence relatively large extent overall price level stock market. overall, finance bank remain dominant form intermediation key feature financial structure majority new member states. that said, equity finance grow steadily past years, even though amount corporate fund raise capital market remain rather limited. furthermore, financial account data, collect compile ecb close collaboration new member states, indicate that, term amount outstanding, share equity important source finance non-financial corporations, mainly owe large contribution non-quoted equity. this form equity financing, example family capital invest small companies, also contribute large share equity finance euro area non-financial corporations.4 for six new member state data unquoted equity available, share total equity finance 80% more. third, new eu member state observe significant degree foreign involvement financial sector term ownership, finance investment. this particularly visible bank sector, predominantly foreign ownership practically countries. but also extend beyond that. for example, substantial share 2 see, example, b. amable j.-b. chatelain, “can financial infrastructure foster economic development?”, journal development economics, 64(2), april 2001, pp. 481-498; j. bonin p. wachtel, “financial sector development transition economies: lesson first decade”, financial markets, institution & instruments, 12(1), february 2003, pp. 1-66; l. ndikumana, “financial development, financial structure, domestic investment”, journal international money finance, 24(2), june 2005, pp. 651-673. 3 with exception cyprus malta, respect somewhat comparable euro area. 4 ecb monthly bulletin, “characteristics corporate finance euro area”, february 2001, pp. 37-50. 2/7 government enterprise finance come abroad many major firm list stock exchange outside countries. fourth, new eu member state experience significant consolidation number financial institutions, particularly banks. this process contribute soundness stability countries’ bank sectors. consolidation also affect stock markets. for example, three baltic stock market recently merge scandinavian omx market use common trade platform. finally, clear several new member states, improvement legal framework market infrastructure may need order establish transparent efficient financial markets. this also apply great transparency counterparties financial transactions, would undoubtedly promote integration countries’ financial market euro area. from overview, evident that, despite significant progress make previous years, convergence process financial structure new eu member state euro area yet complete. i come back issue – see road ahead new member state – later. at stage, allow address two issue topical latvian economy several new member states: strong credit growth rapidly rise house prices. iii. credit growth let start, question credit markets, point three characteristic facts. first, dynamic credit growth private sector observe number new eu member states, well average rate euro area. the growth credit private sector especially strong baltic country hungary, reach annual rate 30% 50% recent years. in countries, czech republic slovakia, rate credit growth private sector moderate, pick recently, poland slow considerably, follow peak reach around turn decade. second, credit-to-gdp ratio central eastern european country still remain well euro area level. third, credit expansion has, countries, finance domestic external sources. in early stage credit expansion, rise domestic savings, partly reflect increase confidence bank system overall financial deepen economies, particularly important source banks’ financing. subsequently, interest rate decline propensity consume increased, bank progressively rely external sources. look sectoral breakdown credit growth, fairly clear main driver credit dynamic loan household – largely form mortgage lending. intense competition market segment encourage bank substantially expand lend households. by contrast, bank credit growth corporate sector lag behind. this partly explain fact important share investment non-financial corporate sector finance retain earn foreign capital, include credit bank country foreign direct investment. another strike – potentially worry – feature credit growth new member state high share foreign currency-denominated loans. these loan mostly euro-denominated, although loan currency also gain importance recently. they typically grant non-financial corporations, though also household baltic country poland. borrow foreign currency drive low borrow cost stimulate financial liberalisation country prior eu entry. the majority foreign currency loan hold large multinational firms, generate great part revenue foreign currency, therefore also consider hedge instrument. in general, borrow foreign 3/7 currency widespread country fix exchange rate regime exchange rate targets, particularly baltic countries. nevertheless, external net liability position bank sector central eastern european country continue limited, exception estonia latvia, external net liability position reach level correspond 23% 17% gdp respectively end 2004. iv. house price a well aware latvian experience, rapid credit growth go hand hand strong increase house prices, especially certain segment house market, apartment major cities. that said, picture quite diverse across countries, difficult discern general patterns. some countries, include baltic countries, experience double-digit increase house prices, whereas others, example czech republic, house price development moderate. in general, however, house price many new member state rise strongly recent year average euro area, albeit admittedly much low base. moreover, house construction pick throughout region, reflect buoyant house demand. of course, property price also increase fast pace past year several euro area countries, well country around world, notably unite state unite kingdom. so phenomenon characteristic new eu member states. when discuss trend house prices, important keep mind number specific feature house market new member states. i think particular generally high – still rise – degree owner-occupancy fact institutional arrangement associate develop house markets, legal framework, easy transfer property, different type available insurance, good valuation method alternative form mortgage finance, still rather embryonic stage countries. this may explain volume transaction relative total house stock still relatively limit many new member states. that said, positive development several country considerable effort make improve institutional arrangement financial service offer. how explain observe house price developments? very favourable finance condition perception among household house price likely continue rise future contribute significantly strong house demand. the supply side house market, recently suggest indicator build permit grant number house completions, partly gradually respond strong price signals. if supply new house continue increase, alleviate pressure market contribute moderation house price increases. v. policy challenge from tour d’horizon salient feature financial structure and, particular, credit house markets, i see number pertinent policy question arising: how ass risk financial stability may associate development market characteristics? what main challenge policy-makers, is, governments, central bank supervisory authorities? what issue watch concern evolution financial structure year come? let provide answer questions. i shall start potential implication rapid credit growth strong increase house price financial stability new eu member states. strong credit expansion cause concern, least bank crisis often precede episode excessive credit growth. this statement support theoretical argument extensive empirical research. that said, i stress bank crisis 4/7 inevitable consequence episode excessive credit expansion. however, number theoretical explanation put forward elucidate credit boom associate high probability bank distress, notably procyclicality bank lend behaviour. risk may underestimate expansionary phase credit cycle, thereby result low credit standard average “quality” borrowers. this may lead high credit loss next economic downturn occurs. risk may also underestimate consequence so-called “financial accelerator” mechanism, whereby over-optimism future return may boost asset valuation thus firms’ net worth, fee back high investment credit demand increase asset prices. so much theory: concern specific circumstance new member states? first, danger rapid credit expansion may strain banks’ ability monitor ass risk properly. this especially relevant new member states, banks’ credit risk assessment burden measurement difficulty forecast potential future credit losses, owe lack sufficiently long credit histories. this problem may even pronounce case market segment previously underserviced, household small medium-sized enterprises. second, relative importance foreign currency lend domestic private sector country may increase vulnerability household unhedged non-financial corporation adverse exchange rate movements. third, since mortgage loan contract several new member state typically float interest rates, rise interest rate would negative impact households’ debt-servicing ability countries. furthermore, since mortgage lend major growth area new member states, evolution house price – mention – is, course, relevant factor require careful monitoring. the upward trend real estate price expect continue medium long term, partly result gradual convergence price level “old” eu member states. however, would comfort think “natural” development would result excessive unsustainable house price increases. in respect, would useful monitor extent strong mortgage lend house price increase may lead mortgage equity withdrawals, turn may stimulate consumption even thus fuel gdp credit growth. when assess balance risk financial stability, number mitigate factor also take account. to begin with, credit risk contained, ratio debt-servicing burden firm household relative income still considerably low euro area. moreover, favourable growth outlook improve prospect household disposable income associate catching-up process, current low interest rate environment, likely make easy private sector borrower service debts. in addition, improve profitability bank new member state help maintain solid capital base, also improve shock-absorbing capacity. finally, ratio non-performing loan total loan has, countries, decrease remain low level past years. let stress, however, banks’ asset-quality indicator typically backward-looking. since risk may build boom phase, deterioration credit quality may become visible significant time lag general economic condition worsen. a new member state enjoy relatively high rate economic growth recent years, resilience loan portfolio negative output shock remain untested now. notwithstanding overall positive near-term outlook financial stability new member states, potential risk imply rapid credit growth call continue vigilance national authorities. reflect concerns, central bank supervisory authority take several measure response rapid credit growth. the commonly apply measure classify category “moral suasion”. these include enhance central bank communication concern risk relate fast credit expansion, 5/7 financial stability report means, recommendation make prudential supervisor aim increase banks’ risk awareness. in countries, tighten monetary policy, example latvia, fiscal measure aim reduce incentive borrowing, introduce estonia, also use moderate credit growth. nonetheless, measure yet prove sufficient moderate pace credit growth baltic countries, remain high middle 2005. financial regulation prudential supervision therefore ensure sound asset quality maintained. furthermore, fiscal policy also contribute macroeconomic stability thus help moderate volatility financial markets. finally, let address one issue somewhat “closer home”. since robust bank credit growth may continue period lead accession new member state euro area even year follow adoption euro, pertinent consider whether could bear euro area whole future. give strong ownership link euro area bank bank new member states, could argue might risk transmission channel within eu. however, bear mind bank sector new member state represent relatively small fraction total asset euro area bank groups, potential contagion risk seem rather limited. vi. the outlook financial structure risk financial stability what outlook financial structure potential risk financial stability come years? broadly speaking, expect catching-up economy new member state financial real term likely two main implication financial structures. first, expect lead deepen financial intermediation development capital market level comparable euro area. second, likely promote increase role non-bank financial intermediaries, pension fund life insurance companies, whose presence limit compare euro area countries. a result, financial sector balance sheet expect expand substantially new member state next decade. similarly, bond stock market likely develop significantly, along life insurance company pension funds. against background, key policy challenge new member state safeguard soundness bank system robust stable development financial markets. in fact, several potential stress could arise financial system expand, especially environment capital mobility financial market integration. experience number emerge market economy show financial market exuberance drive risk premia external debt domestic financial instrument level low warrant fundamentals. under circumstances, strong capital inflows, rapid credit growth buoyant asset price may lead episode sizeable real exchange rate appreciation – potentially serious repercussion real economy expectation point fulfilled. it important guard potential risks. after – paraphrase slightly larry summer say – “the new finance like highway. it get go good faster, accident may worse.” vii. conclude remark let conclude. our review financial structure new member state show substantial progress towards convergence euro area achieved, also still need improve financial infrastructure strengthen legal framework. i highlight two major issue currently attract attention number member states: robust credit growth rapidly rise house prices. while development could pose, certain circumstances, significant risk 6/7 financial stability, see risk rather modest juncture, bear mind situation vary considerably country country. nevertheless, important authority market participant vigilant take measure help reduce likelihood risk materialise increase resilience financial system. to end, implementation sound macroeconomic policy key – particularly implementation prudent fiscal policy contribute moderate unsustainable aggregate demand increase contain large current account deficits. fiscal measure also aim eliminate tax distortion fuel property price dynamics. moreover, strengthen supervisory mechanism practice enhancement risk management method employ bank help limit potential risk improve shock-absorbing capacity financial system. what clear, however, supervisory authority cannot take financial stability granted. the british statesman political theorist edmund burke remark never plan future past. this observation forgotten, particularly field financial stability prudential supervision, especially give fact modern financial history new member state still rather short. thank much attention. 7/7 jean-claude trichet: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, european parliament, brussels, 14 september 2005. * * * madame la présidente, madame et monsieur le membres de la commission économique et monétaire, j’ai l’honneur de paraître devant votre commission aujourd’hui dans le cadre de notre dialogue régulier. à cette occasion, je voudrais rendre hommage à wim duisenberg, qui est décédé à la fin du mois de juillet. le premier président de la banque centrale européenne apporté une contribution considérable à la construction européenne. il joué un rôle décisif dans la mise en place de institution monétaires en europe, dans le lancement réussi de la nouvelle monnaie, dans l’affirmation de la crédibilité de notre monnaie unique – l’euro – et dans l’instauration de la confiance placée en elle. nous le regrettons profondément. je commencerai mon intervention aujourd’hui par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire actuelle. ich möchte außerdem zu aktuellen themen d fiskalpolitik und zu den fortschritten im bereich d strukturreformen stellung nehmen. abschließend möchte ich die position d ezb zu den folgeaktivitäten hinsichtlich de eu-aktionsplans für finanzdienstleistungen erläutern. economic monetary issue at time last appearance european parliament july underlie trend real economic growth euro area remain modest. look ahead, expect positive fundamental factor – notably strong global demand robust earn euro area – would contribute certain pick broaden economic activity. the late data indicator change assessment. accord eurostat’s flash estimate, real gdp grow quarter-on-quarter rate 0.3% second quarter year, compare 0.4% first quarter 2005, confirm underlie growth dynamic remain subdue first half 2005. at time, recent survey indicator have, balance, support view economic growth could improve second half year. look ahead, condition continue place positive fundamental factor influence outlook economic activity pick beyond short term. on external side, ongoing growth global demand improvement euro area price competitiveness support euro area exports. on domestic side, investment benefit exceptionally low level nominal real market interest rate prevail across entire maturity spectrum, well robust growth corporate earn ongoing improvement corporate efficiency. consumption growth gradually rise, broadly line expect development disposable income. this picture consistent recent ecb staff projections, envisage euro area real gdp grow rate 1.0% 1.6% 2005 1.3% 2.3% 2006. compare june projections, range project real gdp growth adjust slightly downwards. for 2005, mainly reflect slight downward revision past data, 2006 reflect project effect disposable income increase oil prices. this outlook economic activity subject number downward risks, relate mainly high oil prices, low consumer confidence concern global imbalances. in particular, potential dampen impact oil price outlook growth monitor closely. oil price continue rise, increase considerably since begin year, development future price suggest market participant expect current tightness oil market persist. obviously, situation complicate tragic effect hurricane katrina. all think people city new orleans affect neighbour area touch wave global solidarity help cope 1/3 immediate needs. at time, remain difficult ass full extent damage period time necessary repair. normally, despite significant wealth destruction result storms, economic impact national level limit short term increasingly offset positive impact rebuild activity. at moment, consider global impact likely remain limit temporary, course continue monitor closely available evidence. turn price developments, recent increase oil price push headline inflation rate level excess 2% last months. accord eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation 2.1% august, compare 2.2% july, inflation rate expect fluctuate around current level next months, increase towards year-end. at time, analyse underlie domestic inflationary trends, continue significant evidence upside pressure build euro area. in particular, wage increase remain contain recent quarter trend prevail time being, give current labour market situation. this picture broadly line new ecb staff projections. ecb staff project average annual hicp inflation lie 2.1% 2.3% 2005 1.4% 2.4% 2006. these projection constitute significant upward revision eurosystem staff inflation projection publish june, mainly reflect fact oil price increase suggest early forward rates. upside risk new baseline inflation scenario remain, relate potential rise oil prices, administer price indirect taxes. more fundamentally, main risk inflation outlook stem potential second-round effect wage price-setting behaviour trigger ongoing oil price rises. in respect, essential social partner continue meet responsibilities. against background, continue monitor inflation expectation closely. particular vigilance require order ensure longer-term inflation expectation remain well-anchored euro area. turn monetary analysis, money credit continue grow robustly euro area last months, mainly drive prevail low level interest rates. in particular, growth mortgage borrow remain strong. in context, price dynamic house market need monitor closely. the liquidity situation euro area remain ample plausible measures, indicate risk price stability medium long horizons. in conclusion, oil price development lead upward revision inflation projection year ahead. at time, medium-term domestic inflationary pressure still remain contained, balance risk baseline inflation scenario tilt upside. cross-check economic analysis monetary analysis confirm need particular vigilance order keep medium-term inflation expectation firmly anchor level consistent price stability. by achieve this, monetary policy make significant contribution towards economic growth job creation euro area. turn fiscal policies, late available information suggest pace fiscal consolidation many euro area country remain unsatisfactory. it particular concern target correct excessive deficit risk cases. moreover, country recently breach 3% deficit limit grant relatively long period correct situation constitute generous application reform stability growth pact. against background, important recall best contribution fiscal policy make stability, growth cohesion euro area effectively tackle exist fiscal imbalance part determine well-designed economic reform programme. in context, rigorous implementation new rule needed. this would reinforce credibility stability growth pact, boost expectation sound fiscal policy thereby help increase confidence economic growth prospects. a regard structural reforms, european commission recently present “community lisbon programme”, contain list measure eu level relaunch lisbon strategy. the ecb fully back initiative, particular measure open eu market simplify regulatory framework within business operates. progress community member state level crucial address economic challenge face eu. 2/3 financial service policy i would like say word european commission’s green paper financial service policy period 2005-2010. a already express contribution commission’s public consultation, eurosystem support key policy orientation green paper, highlight need focus consolidation consistent implementation legislative framework financial services. to end, potential lamfalussy framework exploit extent possible. a regard area financial regulation, eurosystem concur emphasis place commission objective rationalise exist framework. the proposal “better regulation” base open, transparent evidence-based policy-making fully supported. the eurosystem also support suggestion commission launch feasibility study development one body consistent law. we regard “financial service rulebook” tool rationalise exist set eu rule financial institution and, particular, reduce complexity legal uncertainty eliminate possible inconsistencies. still context financial regulation, completion current fsap legislative work also important. in connection, i would like mention particular capital requirement directive, which, i informed, work proceed smoothly. also, i would like make specific reference issue security clear settlement, eurosystem attribute great importance. an efficient security clear settlement infrastructure fundamental importance integration smooth function financial markets. to end, eurosystem support commission’s intention put forward proposal directive security clear settlement. on question new regulatory initiatives, share view asset management retail financial service area regulatory intervention could considered. in area financial supervision, eurosystem fully support commission’s view current institutional set-up exploit maximum extent potential structural change considered. in particular, eurosystem agree main policy objective area financial supervision two-fold: first, enhance competitiveness eu financial market institution facilitate development cross-border finance term institution term product service – so-called financial integration angle; second, ensure effectiveness standard oversight supervision integrate financial system – so-called financial stability angle. in respect, attach particular importance consistent implementation financial service legislation pursuit supervisory convergence, well effective cooperation home host authorities. we view important home-host coordination develop robust consistent basis financial group involve way ensure effective supervision reduce compliance costs. the level 3 committee play important role respect. furthermore, see need current regime supervision liquidity risk review background financial market developments, include introduction euro. a regard financial stability, represent area particular interest eurosystem, opinion refinement financial stability arrangement remain key priority eu. there three broad area eurosystem see room enhance present arrangements, namely financial stability assessment, management financial stress deposit insurance. in respect, let recall provision emergency liquidity assistance central bank function agreement within eurosystem facility operate euro ara. thus, specific issue relate provision emergency liquidity assistance need address context post fsap work. finally, let stress govern council ecb strongly attach full completion single market bank service level play field make absolutely difference nationalities. i ready answer questions. 3/3 rakesh mohan: communication central bank - perspective address dr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, saarcfinance governors’ symposium, mumbai, 9 september, 2005. the annex reference speeech available rbi’s website www.rbi.org.in. * * * i. introduction communication part professional hazard central banker face routine. the response well measure mostly ‘measured’. financial market watch pauses, punctuation mark text statement distinct possibility get transmit movement point yield curve. face grave consequence measure million rupee dollars, communication central bank become really serious matter. be true central bank only? perhaps not: all, communication general complex process. while attempt communicate among time, nonetheless, expression intention oral write mode often get transmit correctly reader listener. word different connotation - paragraph lengthy documents. the reader listener often ascribe motif expression use wedge create say perceived. what person perceive often dependent expect hear, want hear. it interest refer william poole note context central bank communication, “accurate communication require settle mean words. for give word, consult dictionary usually discover english word several meanings, quite different. there dictionary look several mean paragraph. the mean policy statement — preferably one — must establish central bank, consistent practice time extend discussion language means” (poole, 2003). furthermore, expression intention one-off affair; contrary element incrementality communication reputation play role. illustratively, child often start react direction reminder: normal reaction direction see whether i serious begin with. my credibility constantly stake. communication central bank far difficult process. it long ago central bank shroud mystery. book like “secrets temple” (greider, 1989), expression like “monetary mystique” (goodfreind, 1985) bear testimony this. it fact widely believe communication central bank need couch term “constructive ambiguity”, term coin chairman gerry corrigan new york fed. one remind alan greenspan said, “the undeniable, though regrettable, fact effective policymaking do outside immediate glare press" (greenspan, 2002). it felt early policy effectiveness depend degree surprise market take central bank policy announcements. in fact, quite remarkable note prior 1994 target federal fund rate even announce u federal reserve: market leave infer rate timing, sequence magnitude open market operation (woodford, 2005). now, however, u.s. federal reserve announce current target feed fund rate also provide clear indication likely trajectory future interest rates. such revolution central bank communication practice last ten fifteen years. 1/9 since late 1980s early 1990s widely perceive iron wall central banks’ communication become much thinner, along fall iron curtain. from current vantage point clearly discern three reason change: • first, clamour attainment central bank independence impose great degree responsibility central bank – major one attainment transparency communication. • second, adoption inflation target number central bank since 1990s make effective communication integral part policy making. monetary policy committee form minute start published. • third, innovation information communication technology make speed form communication central bank quite revolutionary. from print medium television new entrant transmission web-sites central bank wire agency like reuters bloomberg. this change think occur enhance perception "central bank affect economy much influence expectation direct, mechanical effect central bank trade market overnight cash" (woodford, 2005), specific announcement intervention rate. woodford go far say "central bank management expectations". when central bank change intervention / policy rate, effectiveness influence key variable inflation rate depend crucially effect financial market price exchange rate, equity price long term interest rates. thus, apart specific action relate overnight policy rate, central bank use mean disposal achieve policy aims. now direct credit controls, quantitative direct instrument available, financial market deepen even countries, effective communicative central bank policy objectives, instrument action gain prominence. in fact, presently perhaps abundance information get transmit central bank public. this go extent economist (july 22, 2004) recently raise question: “do communicative central bank make financial market lazy?” conclude that, “it’s always good talk.” the issue hand country relate understand depth sophistication financial market public large. should communication strategy similar counterpart develop countries? should mode monetary policy making, e.g. inflation targeting, similar current vogue elsewhere? how confident power model forecasting? these question deal fashion communication strategy accordingly. it context i attempt review rationale, form practice communication central bank try evaluate indian experience address. the rest address orgranised follows. section ii look general issue relate communication central banks. section iii present indian practice personal reflection regard. section iv give conclude observations. ii. necessity communication central banker the issue communication central bank intimately interlink mandate central bank. the complex mandate central bank, difficult well important communication. illustratively, mandate central bank either inflation target exchange rate target (as currency board arrangement) objective central bank amply clear public. hence communication necessary express commitment central bank reflect 2/9 continuous action maintain credibility achieve objectives. on contrary, mandate complex is, example, u federal reserve reserve bank india, objective may clear. moreover, even objective known, multiple objective could lack clarity among relative weight change relative weight objectives. in cases, central bank need communicate objective continuous basis. thus, benefit central bank communication depend crucially adopt policy approach (bernanke, 2004). specifically central bank follow simple feedback policy, private sector easily infer future policies. in case, necessity extensive communication central bank except central bank decide deviate substantially rule. central banker modern time hardly follow simple feedback rule – central banks, include inflation targetors, take account wealth information decide future course monetary policy follow term ‘forecast-based approach’. in case, public able infer likely course policy easily need guidance central bank’s perception outlooks, risk assessments, objectives. clear transparent communication play important role case. the need communication central bank also come another distinct source. since early 1990s, increase emphasis central bank independence. in democratic polity, good deal trust place central bank. various country world attain vary degree independence central banks. in context, question accountability transparency often raised. communication heart accountability. there is, thus, need understand motif procedures. when political authority give clear mandate central bank bestow independence communication policy central bank reasonably clear. a crucial issue communication policy communicate. interestingly, central bank independent, communicate control authority. in case independent central bank communication go various actors, viz., (a) public, (b) legislature executive, (c) market participants. the mode method communication participant would distinctly different three entities. in globalise world, possible formulate monetary policy independent international developments. monetary policy formulation has, thus, become complex interdependent (mohan, 2002). furthermore, globalise world increase communication regulatory club like bi imf, sophistication staff perhaps different among countries. the question, however, is: sophisticate audience understand delicate nuance announcement central banks. in fact, effectiveness monetary policy crucially depend well public market participant understand central bank signals. a relate question is: central bank need communicate different agent differently? what good public may good market participants. after all, “the market thrive volatility, public dislike quite intensely” (blinder et al., 2000). monetary policy effective market anticipate correctly. thus, general consensus literature transparency, good is. more open public disclosure central bank policy may enhance efficiency markets, follow two channels: • first, great information central bank make policy decision help reduce financial speculation. • second, clear decision rule help reduce volatility markets, and, thus, enhance predictability future movement financial assets. furthermore, rational expectation literature teach u effect give policy action define within treatment policy expectations. it argue assumption public understand future course policy precondition coherent analysis current policy. monetary policy exception general rule. 3/9 besides, literature also show monetary authority cannot utilize short-run trade-off “fooling” public systemically, thereby establish necessity transparency communication central banks. the forex market, special nature, could exception general rule ‘more merrier’ case transparency. communication area exchange rate policy special due number reason (blinder et al., 2000). first, apart central banks, government number case joint responsibility exchange rate policy. second, case exchange rate arrangement (such as, pure peg pure floats), need central bank communication absent. third, instance central bank decide intervene foreign exchange market pursuit monetary goals, secrecy may defensible grind effectiveness. i shall turn issue indian context somewhat great detail. another general issue despite multiplicity objective one instrument central banks, viz., variant short term interest rate. central bank world try change short term interest rate assumption influence medium long term interest rate - medium long term rate affect expectation asset price (blinder, 1998). to large extent, happen explanation forecasts. the effectiveness crucially depend degree sophistication financial market participant interlocutors. the extent transparency central bank communication dictate norm openness body-politic well. illustratively, bank england (boe)’s information dissemination govern freedom information act 2000 u.k. this act place obligation public authority adopt maintain publication scheme. furthermore, effect january 2005, act provide general right access type record information hold public authority set exemption right. similarly, u.s, per freedom information act one request information fed. do central bank talk obscure language? be communication exercise obfuscation? many central bank traditionally portray ‘tight-lipped, secretive, cryptic’. it often allege central bank executive use complicate word convey little meaning. blind others allege that, “chairman alan greenspan credit raise fedspeak high art … even characterize way communicate mumble great incoherence” (blinder et al, 2000). in one particular incident, chairman greenspan report tell u senator, claim understand chairman said, “in case, i must misspoken”. notwithstanding allegations, great move foster transparency central communication recent years. a case point publication minute monetary policy committee bank england. accord bank england act, 1998, boe suppose "publish minute mpc meet end period 6 week begin day meeting." until october 1998 minute publish five week meeting. the monetary policy committee announce 1998 would publish minute monthly meet wednesday second week meet take place. apart minutes, publish vote pattern individual member well. besides, central bank increasingly learn communicate ‘perception uncertainty’, different ‘ambiguity’. in term communication various way tell public ‘we know certain’, clearly preferable couch statement ambiguous language. illustratively, boe publish growth inflation forecast differ margin error – popularly call “fan chart”. the fan chart increase light shade (at outward direction) mode clearly communicate extent uncertainty degree ignorance forecaster. 4/9 another important hallmark modern communication emerge role web-sites wire agencies. while speed communication still slightly slow light, wire agency put communication central bank almost real time basis. this great ramification transmission news formation expectation financial markets. have delineate general principle let turn indian specific central bank communication. iii. communication rbi i already point complex mandate central bank necessity communication. the indian case would perhaps approximate complex objective. after all, apart pursue monetary policy, financial stability one override concern rbi. within objective monetary policy, control inflation provide adequate credit productive sector economy foster growth equally important. this apart, reserve bank act bank regulator, debt manager, government debt market regulator currency issuer. face multiple task complex mandate, utmost necessity clear communication part reserve bank india. what need communicate? in central bank, necessity three kind communication, viz., (a) policy measures, (b) reason behind policy measure (c) analysis economy. rbi engage three kind communication. in fact, international standard reserve bank india (rbi) fairly extensive transparent communication system. the bi-annual policy statement traditionally communicate reserve bank’s stand monetary policy immediate future six month one year. a july year, begin system quarterly review addition bi-annual statements. the present practice attach review macro economic development annual policy mid term review, quarterly review give expansive view central bank see economy. in bi-annual policy meet lead bankers, governor announce policy explain rationale behind measure length. these policy meet one-way traffic. each banker present meet interact governor express reaction policy announcement. after policy announcement over, governor address press conference afternoon. the deputy governor in–charge monetary policy department normally give live interview major television channel day. governor also give interview print electronic medium next day monetary policy announcement. the thing still live telecast governor’s monetary policy announcements. apart policy statement communication rbi policy take place speech governor deputy governors. these speech devote issue concern economy well articulation rbi’s policies. interestingly, globally find speech governor central bank important determinant movement term structure interest rate change repo rate (fracasso, genberg wyplosz, 2003). the typical mode rbi’s policy communicate regulate entity departmental circulars. depend domain operation concern department issue circular place website without delay. a typical complaint circular often write language easily comprehensible, one need translate normal understandable language. but complaint formal statement couch semi-legal language. i believe, however, much good job write circular plain english shorn tedious jargon. 5/9 the major mode dissemination rbi policy well view economy reports. over year report turn analytical, transparent forward look outlook. the two statutory report bank, annual report report trend progress bank india evoke immense interest among public, market participant well academia. the theme base report currency finance platform articulate research find issue topical interest. rbi occasional paper also emerge professional journal referee research output rbi staff. over year committee report emerge another plank communication rbi. the plethora committee form rbi try communicate financial sector participant markets. interestingly, many committee conceptualize process either annual mid-year review monetary policy, time next policy recommendation available consideration implementation. while general public quite cynical formation committee, long authority serious transparent acceptance rejection recommendation committees, remain major vehicle collective policy thinking. an important feature rbi communication policy almost real-time dissemination information web-site. the result liquidity adjustment facility (laf) day post web-site 12.30 p.m day, 2.30 p.m reference rate number also place web-site. by next day morning press release money market operation out. every saturday 12 noon weekly statistical supplement place web-site, give fairly detail recent data-base rbi financial sector. by first every month, rbi bulletin month out. all regulatory administrative circular different department place web-site within half hour finalization. i think high speed dissemination possible due professional skill internal staff rbi. another significant step towards transparency monetary policy implementation formation various technical advisory committee (tacs) rbi representative market participants, regulator (like sebi irda) experts. over years, three technical advisory committee emerge – one money, forex g-sec markets, regulation, recent one monetary policy. these forum act platform rbi come know need market player rbi able communicate stand issue may strictly feasible formal mode circulars. many agenda note prepare meet form background bi-annual monetary policy announcements. these apart, resource management discussion annual policy act another mode two-way communication management commercial bank rbi management. meet state finance secretary another platform communication. i try give quick run-down various mean mode communication strategy policy rbi. needle say, tune global trend rbi become transparent, articulate fast communicate policy view economy. nevertheless, question remain. what else could done? could rbi do better? what impediment hazard communication central bank? how fast market react central bank’s announcements? let turn issues. how fast central bank communication influence market? an interest illustration impact central bank communication perhaps episode stock market may 17, 2004. on day, wake change government, stock market india witness record fall price, trigger index-based circuit breaker twice day. the index-based circuit breaker trigger first time 10:16 be sensex touch low 4516. when trade resume one hour 11:15 am, 6/9 sensex open 4448 touch day's low 4227 11:19 be – trigger circuit breaker around two hours. in normal circumstances, reserve bank take view stock market. however, confront possibility spill-over money, g-sec forex market rbi intervene day two separate press release issue bank indicating, (a) constitution internal task force executive director, financial market committee monitor development financial markets, (b) assure availability rupee forex liquidity (annex). thus, communicate rbi keep touch major settlement bank stock exchange ensure payment obligation exchange meet give assurance sell dollar agent bank order augment supply intervene directly meet demand supply imbalances. these press release place web-site around 2.00 p.m, release wire agency half hour early flash ticker 1.30 p.m. trade resume time 1:16 pm; subsequent flash press release, market witness quick recovery, close 4505. whereas i claim entire recovery sensex day solely due communication rbi, important understand role power communication occasion central bank communication immediate impact market - market strictly jurisdiction. central bank communication flip side too. the modern day paparazzi-syndrome haunt central banker well. i sure many central banker must point time must bitterly surprise find next day’s newspaper statement ascribe – whereas truth could entirely opposite. let illustrate personal experience – one among i experience stay rbi. on august 14, 2004 i annual citibank-fitch debt market conference. on entry i chase journalist one question i ask future rate inflation. to best recollection i say present rise inflation predominantly drive supply-shocks monitor development carefully. to utter surprise, pink paper next day (i.e., august 15, 2004) report story photograph president india mine side side, follow catch lines: • “president apj abdul kalam say saturday sustain high eight per cent growth contain inflation, 7.61 per cent, major challenge country.” • “meanwhile, reserve bank (rbi) deputy governor rakesh mohan saturday reiterate authority expect inflation fall early level five per cent.” the story imply deputy governor rbi differ president india stance inflation eve independence day! however, i absolutely catch-22 situation unable issue letter protest would give signal rbi expect inflation go up. such travail central bank communication! similar experience often find interpretation various report policy statements. i tell recent years, bank canada institute medium “lock-up” arrangement medium read key report bank canada write story prior official publication time. there regular medium brief lock-up period, official deal technical question clarify issue (purely unattributed basis) media. in canada practice result clear improvement quality reporting. i aware rbi well, report release medium day early release date without technical briefing. perhaps think introduce medium lock-up arrangement inclusive technical 7/9 brief rbi. this could reduce work issue rejoinder perceive misgive central bank policies. in common parlance, often central communication see insider-outsider context. it assume central bank communication refer central bank choose tell general public, market participants, experts, media. what happen communication internally? or, borrow management literature, “sell brand inside” (mitchell, 2001)? while information doled employee form memos, news letter, many occasion employee organization unable realize uniqueness brand. central bank exception general trend corporate world. the policy research wing rbi would need pay particular attention dissemination effective communication rbi policy internal staff play pro-active role. i put forward follow idea context: • it would useful context arrange internal seminar / talk regional office train college rbi monetary policy announcement publication important report – whether regular (e.g., annual report report currency & finance) committee reports. • another idea could release faq (frequently ask questions) policy matter website. there could educational resource well do feed (such as, “in plain english: make sense federal reserve”, material personal financial education). • still another idea could introduce work paper series clear disclaimer ‘these find individual researcher rbi’. the unfortunate thing domestic press often choose disregard disclaimer, start ascribe research find rbi. • finally, many internal note various department immense analytical value; subject caveat confidentiality (which i sure would exception rather rules), many note could make available internally. departmental site rbi intranet could effectively utilize this. while management normally make policy statement outside world, increasingly liberalize economy, staff often act ambassador institution – sense internal communication could act conduit external communication well. a look communication policy central bank advance country bring two important features. many central bank monetary policy committee form other, many inflation report financial stability report. the question far need them? while inflation report hallmark many inflation target economies, mean universal – also true financial stability report. nevertheless, critical question context publication central bank’s forecasts. almost central bank internal forecast inflation growth rate economy. the inflation target country tend attach heavy emphasis publication forecasts. these forecast base economic models, buttress policy maker’s expectation future. thus, if, think favour introduce inflation report india, need sort prerequisite detail macro model well commitment band inflation – point time (which way announce bi-annual policy statements), bur path year(s) come. a far financial stability report concerned, hearten note report trend progress bank india, 2003-04 introduce chapter

national bank road towards escb, organise cooperation bulgarian national bank gtz office, tirana, 5 september 2005. * * * dear participants, first all, i would like say good morning you. today’s meet bulgarian friend take place context several activity recently organise clear focus future challenge relate integration process. i please fall season year start activity first all, i avail opportunity extend gratitude representative bulgarian national bank, gtz friend, professor bolle. since first day appointment position, i publicly declare bank albania’s institutional preparation road towards escb remain main challenge. meanwhile, meet i representative regional central banks, well high official brussels ecb, i underline idea future eu prosperous unproblematic country periphery look towards brussels, also start look other. we – central bank region – represent example direction. a pioneer institution progress, central bank region cooperate order expand road political, social economic integration. i believe chance rapid secure process european integration could accelerate – among others – healthy safe financial bank system, able advance economic development country. nevertheless, order materialise objective approximation model eu member states, hold opinion central bank transition country difficult “homeworks” classical responsibility carry central bank. speak concrete terms, mainly challenge relate development markets, unification different norm standard enhance credibility country, thus aim creation atmosphere inspire confidence foreign investors. even though pass consolidation stage, bank system still remain fragile, such, require great commitment care. regardless statistical developments, scale financial intermediation relatively low, whereas time time shadow shock economic equilibra show different countries. future change simple all, u together, exchange experience necessity change, build safe environment, i hope make future challenge somewhat easier. grant independence central bank represent one relevant step financial system reform country region, important precondition maintain inflation control become escb member. however, endeavour consolidation institutional real independence coordinate carefully take consideration specific feature economy transition, mere implementation may seem successful model escb countries. in framework, i consider today’s meet important, since bulgarian economy bulgarian national bank go substantial reform context eu accession. i believe challenge face face future le experience bulgarian authorities, include bulgarian national bank. a consequence, i think bilateral cooperation bank carry high potential, name institution, i avail opportunity offer maximal guarantee regard fruitful development relations. 1/2 pass multilateral framework, i return idea focus institutionalisation inter-regional cooperation central banks. if look meet organise regional bank authorities, initiative regional cooperation welcomed, i also believe time come carry concrete measure towards cooperation. judge personal experience, governor banker, i hold opinion would appropriate establish club regional central banks. the regular meet club would certainly enable exchange experience strengthen cooperation. 2/2 y v reddy: monetary co-operation asia speech dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, imf-mas high-level seminar asian integration, singapore, 3 september 2005. * * * mr. chairman distinguish participants, it privilege associate deliberation asian integration. singapore vividly signify diversity potential prosperity asian region. we deeply appreciate hospitality excellent arrangement make imf ma high level seminar. the discussion paper circulate ma high quality useful document. this session devote subject special interest central banks, namely “enhancing regional surveillance monetary co-operation asia”. i intend focus one topic flag discussion session organizers, namely “is scope co-operation co-ordination exchange rate policy long term?” in brief presentation, i propose explore follow areas: first, change dynamic exchange rate regime asia; second, importance asian economy global prosperity stability; third, asian dynamic financial integration, fourth, scope co-operation co-ordination exchange rate policies; finally, think specific indian situation. change dynamic exchange rate regime asia in period prior 1997 crisis, many asian economy follow exchange rate regime fix adjustable pegs. during east asian crisis, realize peg quite vulnerable speculative attacks. several east asian economy adopt different type exchange rate regime post-crisis period. while country continue peg regimes, others move kind manage floats. thus, appear economy asia, weight experience seem tilt favour intermediate regimes, post-crisis, choice exchange rate regime generally reveal grow preference relatively flexible exchange rate before. in regard, give current state relatively benign international financial market conditions, possible speculate comfort level forex reserve self insurance reached, institution financial market asian economy acquire resilience, shift preference might grow strong wider. the recent move chinese malaysian authority would substantiate notion. an intermediate manage float regime may sound technically perfect system but, prima facie, prove pragmatic explain popularity. the built-in flexibility allow domestic currency responsive market forces, meet concern authority ‘basic stability’ orderly movement forex markets. in contrast pure float, mechanism prevent excessive exchange rate volatility adverse impact external trade investment. in words, rather distract quest ‘perfect system’, perhaps wise focus improve work give float regime. the real issue regard relate much float envisage nature, magnitude well instrument management. these would depend several factors, especially change contour flexibility volatility economy. the recent record impressive growth asia drive trade cross-border investment flows. the rapid stride achieve china provide powerful stimulus regional expansion. but nature trade flow much impressive scale shape economic relationship prospects. while much trade involve production goods, still ultimately destine north american european markets, also reflect increase division labour, product specialization integration within region. together this, fundamental shift economic relation also take place. many intra-asia trade flows, correspond international division labour asian countries, flow export component spare finish good end consumers. a crucial question country region level income would 1/4 enable domestic demand become main drive force growth. a domestic demand, notably household sector demand, become driver growth, movement flexible exchange rate policy would feasible. similarly, corporates well financial intermediaries, especially bank equip manage movement exchange rate, great flexibility would feasible, forex market also would tend become le volatile. it also necessary regard recognize ‘insurance’ form foreign exchange reserve need potentially volatile capital flow sufficient take care fluctuation capital flow ‘liquidity risk’. it generally felt reserve would act circuit breaker situation unidirectional expectation become self-fulfilling. the swap arrangement among central bank one chiang mai initiative (cmi) add level ‘insurance’ hence comfort factor central bank deal excess volatility capital flows. recently considerable expansion global liquidity dilute vigil policy maker regard volatility capital flows. very often, difficult assess, ex ante, whether capital flow temporary permanent. it prudent policy maker assume reversible till prove enduring. impact real economy significant reverse movement relatively short period could destabilize attendant serious welfare implications. we asia acutely aware aspects. recent sharp upward movement oil price era heighten uncertainty yet another reason policy maker asia vigilant. the hike oil price tend adverse consequence growth price several economy also significant impact external sector, encompass current capital accounts. on current account, trade deficit tend widen. on capital account, surplus generate oil export country may add global liquidity lead large capital inflow emerge market net importer oil. hence, careful assessment medium term sustainability would imperative. over medium long term, exchange rate regime relate policy likely influence (a) confidence strength asian economies; (b) perceive resilience economic well financial systems; (c) grow economic financial integration amongst asian economies; (d) emerge significance asian economy global economy; (e) state international financial architecture market condition (f) policy-induced measure co-operation co-ordination amongst asian economies. importance asian economy policy the fact asian economy recover swiftly crisis 1997 important consideration view future external developments. the growth rate develop asia, plummet 4.2 per cent 1998, recover quickly 6.2 per cent 1999, rise 6.6 percent year 2000. in recent period, recovery output asian economy robust develop asia grow nearly 8 per cent 2003 2004. it widely recognize contribution asia global growth generally impressive recent years, may continue so, several year future. the current account balance payment surplus many asian economies. the private capital flow emerge asia recover outflow u $ 52 billion 1998 inflow u $151 billion 2004. at time, reserve build region significant. in backdrop resilience asian economy ability bounce back deep financial crisis, resurgence confidence future. strategy form mutual swap agreement chiang mai initiative, guard speculative attacks, could enlarged, could also supplement great co-operation co-ordination exchange rate regime policies. indeed, longer-term perspective, must note asia appropriately poise term abundance factor production – labour capital – particularly labour, demography clearly favour asia sustain long- term growth. the emergence surplus factor production asia combine financial strength would impact prices, wage exchange rates. asian economy could explore strategy evolve system whereby could prevent and, necessary, manage financial crisis extent possible, also play active role coordinate policy major develop economies. these arrangement could consistent continue active role imf international monetary cooperation. 2/4 it useful recall acute sense interdependence arouse financial “contagion” 1997 convince asian economy importance economic cooperation, one reflect common interest priority well strengthen voice global arena. among others, lead two parallel movement – one south asia form saarc initiative east asia reflect asean+3 initiative. the idea integrate financial system provide viable ‘safety net’ time crisis germinated. a result, idea “asean + 3” initiative1 gain prominence. this, turn, reflect two correlate developments. first, 2000, asean+3 country mutually agree form network bilateral swap agreement provide mutual protection financial emergencies, popularly know chiang mai initiative. more recently, resurgence debate formation asian monetary fund adoption asian currency unit. concomitantly, reflect parallel development asean+3 initiative, wide discussion debate formation south asian economic union south asian development bank2. second, asian bond fund initiative3 launch 2003 reflect effort develop regional bond market cater medium long term finance need asian economies. asian dynamic financial integration it useful recognize that, several important factor relevant consider great financial integration asia. first, wide diversity level economic development across region. second, divergent level financial sector development across region. third, limit scope exist intra-region resource-pooling mechanism lack institutional frameworks. fourth, presence asynchronous business cycle amongst country region. such divergence aptly reflect asymmetric transmission demand monetary shock region. there significant development point emergence enable factor strengthen economic integration asia. first, emerge asia fare quite well term factor mobility wage price flexibility. second, trade intensity ratio emerge asia, particularly asean region, quite high likely accelerate. further, foreign direct investment flow within region significant. third, tariff bring rapidly. fourth, free trade agreement expand deepen make prospect tariff-free virtual trade integration asia sooner later. fifth, strong commitment political leadership asia focus economic issues. there regular frequent close interaction among central bank governor asia strengthen process cooperation. scope co-operation co-ordination the chiang mai initiative good start point build various exist initiatives. although present dispensation cmi complementary similar imf initiatives, important symbolic value much signal market regional commitment support member country’s currency speculative pressures. it also recognize establish swap arrangement obviate need address structural financial sector weaknesses. it may also add cmi might contribute exchange rate stability 1 the asean + 3 form gather government asean members, china, korea japan asian member asem, first leaders’ meet december 1997. 2 the saarc council minister meet hold islamabad january 2-3, 2004, desire saarcfinance prepare concept paper propose south asian economic union south asian development bank. 3 the asian bond fund basically arrangement pool portion foreign exchange reserve east asia pacific country fund portfolio invest liquid u dollar denominate bond major asian economies. 3/4 region, also contribute close regional economic financial integration co-operation. it useful discus way carry process forward. there several forum already establish regional monetary cooperation. the asian clear union (acu), establish 1974 initiative economic social commission asia pacific (escap) eight member central banks. the main objective acu provide facility settle current international transaction among member multilateral net settlement basis. the acu mechanism also provide currency swap type mechanism amongst member trade transactions. acu aim promote monetary co-operation amongst member also result close relation across bank system member countries. during last year trade settle acu mechanism grow rate high total international trade member countries. yet another forum exchange view experiences, include visit train programmes, saarcfinance. area cover recent month include communication policy practice central bank real time gross settlement systems. the recent policy shift china peg flexible exchange rate regime significant development international finance. this step watershed financial sector reform process underway china. go available indications, china long-term plan development deep liquid market financial assets, would encompass foreign exchange, bonds, equities, also commodities. some think india’s approach it may useful recall experience exchange rate management india. in september 1975, government india propose system determine exchange rate base basket five currencies, weighting, base essentially though entirely, trade weights. the permissible range exchange rate 2.25 per cent either side. the currency choose u dollar, pound sterling, deutsche mark, japanese yen sdr. the weight revise 1979, 1983 1984, though currency composition broadly remain one change 1984 french franc replace sdr. the band, however, extend 2.25 5.0 per cent 1979 5 10 per cent 1986. soon devaluation rupee july 1991, move march 1992 regime partial convertibility (essentially dual exchange rate). in march 1993 regime change uniform exchange rate rupee market-determined – system remain place date. in august 1994, india move current account convertibility. from latter part 1997, india move cautious well calibrate move towards capital account convertibility. these development test exchange rate regime prove conducive growth maintain stability. india actively participate various initiative saarcfinance acu arrangements. exchange view co-ordination policy formal informal mechanism main characteristic co-operation. india’s trade link asia grow unprecedented scale. the state policy regard tariff bring par east asia soon feasible. policy free trade agreement country asia, include sapta point bind force great integration india asia. launch negotiation free trade agreement asean india historic significance carry forward asian integration. a part policy communication aid researcher analyst reserve bank india construct five-country 36-country index nominal effective exchange rate (neer) real effective exchange rate (reer). we decide review reer accordingly expect new six-country index replace present five-country one. the new index likely include u.s.a., eurozone, u.k., japan, china hong kong. the new index would case two new currencies, asian, namely, renminbi hong kong dollar. the 36-country index already include key asian countries, review likely result enhancement weights. this reflect increase recognition indian economy’s rapidly grow integration asia. 4/4

submit document action intend ensure 8 per cent requirement would continue satisfy acquisition. in addition, bank formalize especially stringent guideline bpi follow order ensure bank’s capital base could sustain mandatory tender offer. bpi respond request provide update document capital strengthen need sustain acquisition control banca antonveneta. 6/14 lastly, 20 june bank italy initiate inspection general nature bpi, inter alia aim checking, connection acquisitions, bank’s capital ratios, credit disbursement management procedure statistical reports. the first check concern amount bpi’s funds. the latter initiative come start 9 june inspection antonveneta check whether function bank’s ordinary operation impair temporary uncertainty stem precautionary suspension shareholders’ resolution 30 april renew banca antonveneta’s govern bodies, order court padua 21 may. the inspection end 24 june without significant findings. 2.6 the examination bpi’s propose tender offers. the examination, conduct accord criterion method refer above, focus principally three aspect material grant authorization acquire control antonveneta: a) bpi group’s capital adequacy; b) bpi’s “quality” shareholder, take account above-mentioned consob resolution consequent step take bank italy; c) check carry bank italy regard conduct connection temporary shortfall bpi’s capital ratio. on last two point bank italy continue avail advice authoritative jurist collaborate start antonveneta case. recourse make outside expert view complexity factor evaluated, novelty case extremely specialize nature matter, include practical application. professor agostino gambino, massimo luciani, fabio merusi paolo ferro-luzzi collaborated; professor gambino luciani part bank italy’s defence team trial lazio administrative court. the examination begin estimate overall capital ratio 30 june basis documentation statement produce time bpi. the ratio find equal 9.2 per cent restrictive assumption shareholding already hold would consolidate use equity method; consolidated, take account intervene suspension vote right attach absence bpi representative antonveneta’s board directors, bpi’s capital ratio would high 11 per cent. consider capital strengthen measure envisage bpi, particularly capital increase €1.5 billion way, find bank’s capital base could sustain transaction event tender offer succeeding. however, examination also reveal uncertainty regard situation would emerge year-end application international account standards, due put option issue bpi third party share group company commitment purchase antonveneta share own party shareholders’ agreement. a regard conduct deem material purpose verify compliance requirement quality shareholder sound prudent management, initial phase examination find questionable conduct business deal shareholder antonveneta, relation fact bring light consob resolution 10 may check carry bank italy. for full evaluation facts, analysis aspect usefully supplement observation already make legal advisors; result consultation contribute significant element appreciation case standpoint grant authorization. the convergent opinion legal advisors, authoritative expert matter, consider overcome various doubt arise first phase 7/14 examination provide correct interpretation letter spirit italian community legislation. on 11 july 2005 bank italy authorize bpi acquire control antonveneta, give ample account grind decision authorization measure. the integration two bank envisage business plan present positive aspect supervisory point view, consider significant synergy would arise, partly consequence new group’s strong territorial roots. on basis advisors’ opinion, authorization measure recall necessary autonomy bank italy’s evaluation matter able impair sound prudent management respect above-mentioned consob resolution. it observe law provide mandatory tender offer ex post remedy favour minority shareholders; accordingly, comparison different interest lead conclusion consequence denial authorization serious course possible applicant bank find manifestly unsuitable, extent render threat target bank’s stability obvious. in addition, separate evaluation make conduct bank’s corporate officer “reliability” bank. accord approach adopted, conduct punishable administrative sanctions. the imposition administrative sanction affect reliability bank, effective applicant authorization ability ensure sound prudent management question. a regard conduct question, sanction procedure already initiate bank italy. similar consideration hold temporary shortfall capital ratio, since, note earlier, make good full bank italy already initiate administrative sanction procedure violation rule capital requirements. with regard bpi’s prospective capital adequacy, account take formal commitment meet need strengthen fund feasibility step envisaged. at event bank italy expressly require bpi to: – launch cash/cash exchange tender offer condition successful outcome capital increase way verified; – reformulate shareholders’ agreement bpi shareholder antonveneta, avert negative impact capital adequacy entry force international account standard supervisory purposes; – modify agreement conclude société genérale, deutsche bank dresdner bank transfer 30 per cent antonveneta share acquire cash tender offer subsequent resale market reduce market risk bear bpi; – take every step might necessary future ensure compliance prudential rules. the examination begin 22 april prior notification transmit bpi last 80 days. from date first formal application submit (5 may), last 67 days, include period time limit suspended. meanwhile, bank italy consob continue exchange information documentation context ordinary cooperation. the bank italy describe detail fact-finding activity begin check inspection way, notify consob decision make concern bpi’s acquisition control antonveneta. 8/14 2. action administrative law rule lazio administrative court between april june abn amro decide apply legal remedies, requesting, among things, annulment revocation authorization issue bank italy bpl (now bpi) whereby latter progressively authorize raise hold banca antonveneta 29.9 per cent. these application examine lazio administrative court, 28 april dismiss applicant’s request suspension authorization issue rule merit case, date 13-19 july file 9 august. the administrative court recognize full legitimacy act bank italy. the judge preliminarily exclude bpl grant favour treatment issue authorization le time take abn amro, since two application involve different situation (bpl’s direct towards acquisition minority albeit qualify holdings, abn ambro’s towards acquisition control), merit distinct evaluations. in regard, i recall examination grant authorization acquire control antonveneta last 52 day abn ambro 80 day bpi. in state grind ruling, administrative court underscore go-ahead transaction “formulated way reconcile preeminent need bank supervision characteristic dynamism market transactions”, affirm authorization bpi increase interest antonveneta 29.9 per cent come end “an examination appear complete appropriate” bank italy evaluate sustainability transaction “standpoint sound prudent management”. furthermore, court confirm correctness conduct bank italy, grind “the bank italy require verify much current amount applicant’s fund relation entire plan acquisition, adequacy practical feasibility propose plan capital strengthening, thereby make forecast, high degree technical

franz-christoph zeitler, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, salzburg seminar, salzburg, 26 august 2005. * * * 1 a glance fiscal policy reality euro area almost half country euro area either exceed 3% deficit ceiling specify treaty stability growth pact last year danger exceed threshold 2005. six ten economy join eu last year deficit 3% more.1 moreover, number countries, one-off fiscal measure disguise true extent structural budget problems. at present, procedural step article 104 ec treaty (excessive deficit procedure) instigate six 12 euro-area countries. and six ten new ember state involve ongoing procedure art. 104. the development debt ratio tell similar story. in seven euro-area country debt ratio overshoot 60% reference value 2004. in three countries, germany, france portugal, actually sharp increase debt ratio since 2000. in germany, example, government deficit exceed maastricht limit every year since 2002 even 2005 deficit bring back 3%-theshold. the consolidate gross debt ratio germany increase 5 percentage point since 2000. with approximately 65% 2004 well 60%-limit. the high debt effectively restrict room fiscal policy. for 1€ outstanding debt 2004 nearly

stability growth pact. the term “pact” reflect political consensus underlay creation. in legal sense, fact “pact”, mean agreement international public law, rather two council regulations3, words, secondary european law. this reinforce european council resolution 17. june 1997.4 the “mother rules” still primary law article 104 ec treaty protocol no 11 excessive deficit procedure. the change

share opinion hold neutral observers: namely, overall fiscal rule significantly weakened. by contrast, challenge face stability-oriented fiscal policy term public acceptance grow considerably. the le stringent rules, convince sound fiscal policy need daily life. this change make pact le transparent. they increase discretion national institution brussels open door backslide form generally lax budget policies. even “old” pact weaken restrict sanction mechanism arise primary law. this often portray case “sinners sit judgement fellow sinners”. the individual stage procedure initiate commission. the ultimate decision-making power lies, however, ecofin council.7 the reform change this. it would good stick criterion procedure old pact, reverse “burden action” – provide first draft constitutional treaty. the ecofin council would make decision base commission “proposal” rather commission recommendation currently case. this change, first sight appear minor, would significant,

claimed11 – mutually dependent. this suggest word “economy (greek: oikonomia)”, literally mean “rules manage household”. therefore, i shall describe brief main reason behind conclusion stability growth pact prior start european monetary union. these also main reason objective rule-based fiscal policy euro area. 2 reason objective rule-based fiscal policy when originally plan dual concept political monetary union relinquish run-up emu, become clear european monetary union would live asymmetry management two key macroeconomic areas, monetary fiscal policy. a supranational monetary policy coexist fiscal policies, essentially12 remain national responsibility. this mean absolute impediment successful function monetary union may even certain operational advantages, example, concern competition tax systems, social security system education systems. however, also entail economic risks. thus historical analysis show monetary union 19th century fail largely result mismatch fiscal policies.13consequently, article 104 maastricht treaty, well stability pact adopt ecofin council dublin december 1996 largely urge german minister finance, dr waigel, attempt combine advantage fiscal policy which, operational terms, remain national responsibility necessity set common rules. there four main reason this. first: avoid conflict fiscal monetary policy. at time high government debt high interest rate – cannot rule especially give current historically low interest rate – great risk attempt make accommodate nominal debt burden pressure central bank pursue lax monetary policy, ie force forgo postpone interest rate increase need ensure monetary stability. a credible monetary policy institutional independence ecb national central bank lay article 108 ec treaty undoubtedly provide strong counterweight pressure. however, stability pact aim combat exist conflict fiscal monetary policy rather – base wisdom past political experience – design prevent conflict arise first place. second: avoid conflict within monetary union. before start monetary union, market force able exercise disciplinary effect fiscal policy stance perceive unsound correspond exchange rate interest rate responses. although market reaction often come relatively late overshoot mark, fiscal policy maker always reckon sanction kind market. in monetary union, public sector borrower can, time, hide economic disadvantage result unsound fiscal policy blanket monetary union lessen impact market response policy distribute across monetary union. economist call fiscal externality, others talk freeriding moral hazard: country sound fiscal policy impose painful cutback citizen force carry le discipline member states. in nutshell: in broad liquid financial market, high deficit specific country may le impact interest rate : stone cause great wave throw garden pond throw lake. 11 for example, see han eichel (2003) “der pakt ist kein strafgesetzbuch”; frankfuter allgemeine zeitung, 15 november 2003, 12. 12 the eu budget secondary importance context. 13 for example, see: therresia theurl (1999), erfolgs- und misserfolgsfaktoren von währungsunionen: historische erfahrungen, zeitschrift für bayerische sparkassengeschichte, 13, 129-156 . those u regard long-term internal cohesion monetary union avoidance centrifugal force matter primary importance must therefore vehemently urge member state observe fiscal policy rules.14third: interrelationship sound fiscal policy growth. it often maintain government deficit – regardless initial debt level concern – always conducive growth. however, glance fact show low government debt positive correlation growth resultant boost confidence, low tax burden, great involvement efficiency private sector.15within european monetary union, demonstrate recent year example country spain, finland, ireland also belgium, cut high debt level (of 140% launch monetary union) approximately 96% (in 2004) recent year record considerably high growth rate germany, example. canada provide interest example outside euro area. for past seven year achieve budgetary surplus growth rate never fall significantly 2%. leave aside debate so-called non-keynesian effect fiscal policy aim reduce deficit – which, way, also prove effective germany year follow 1982 despite gloomy prediction make time country “would save death” – widely accept high debt level impair stabilise role fiscal policy even respect short-term growth stimuli. this expansionary fiscal policy le impact environment high deficit debt level economy structurally sound public finances. the marginal utility short-term fiscal policy stimulus decrease debt increase owe economic agents’ expectation late correction debt level hence future burden associate debt. fourth: need tackle grow implicit government debt, words, demographic burden result age population western europe. a study bundesbank german council economic expert clearly shown16, addition explicit government debt public debate focused, impact implicit promise future state benefit social security system overlooked. for many member states, germany particular, constitute real problem term sustainability public debt.17 the bundesbank estimate raise long-term consolidation requirement 3½% gdp. thus, rule-based fiscal policy also necessary fairness future generations. in language public choice economists, stability pact constitute insurance policy temptation politician purchase vote today high borrow cost future generations. 3 criterion viable fiscal framework basis former stability pact 1997 in order place fiscal economic objective stability pact i mention early viable operational footing, fiscal framework must fulfil follow criteria.18 simplicity, transparency consistency – particularly important framework appear 14 for debate along line argument see harald uhlig (2002), one money, many fiscal policy europe: consequences? tilburg university. center economic research discussion paper 2002-31.15 the fact sound public finance positive effect economy’s long-term growth well document empirical growth analyses. for example, see d romero de avila r strauch (2003), public finance long-term growth europe – evidence panel data analysis, ecb work paper 246; s fölster m henrekson (1999), growth public sector: critique critics, european journal political economy, 15, 337-358; s fölster m henrekson (2001), growth effect government expenditure taxation rich countries, european economic review, 45, 1501-1520. 16 see deutsche bundesbank (2004), demographic burden growth wealth, monthly report, december. 17 for base year 2002, german council economic expert estimate present value implicit debt range 270% gdp compare explicitly record debt level roughly 60%. 18 see kopits symanski (1998), fiscal policy rules, imf occasional paper 162. credible general public term efficiency apply member states. fix incentive sanction system event rule breached. rule without fix incentive sanction system take seriously. this apply equally private life action government states. ensure fulfilment medium long-term objective balance budget provide short-term scope “automatic stabilisers” (“flexibility criterion”). a know, automatic stabiliser modern term deficit result cyclical tax revenue shortfall additional labour-market relate expenditure. despite undeniable political compromise characterise even early pact – especially concern absence automatic triggering, whether base legal provision mechanisms, system sanction – former rule largely fulfil requirements. the key underlie principle medium term clear: budget balance surplus. this provide scope deficit short term overcome cyclical shocks. a clear legal optical “anchor” provide 3% deficit ceiling accompany fairly precise definition exception natural disaster severe economic downturn (2% decline gdp annual basis decline least 0.75% council’s discretion pursuant council resolution 17 june 1997). in particular 3% ceiling often describe “arbitrary” even “stupid” (prodi). of course, nature rule must clearly define result expression political will. this apply duty citizen – example, blood alcohol limit drivers, deadline submit tax return limit work-related tax-deductible expense – much action public-sector bodies. but 3% ceiling never "arbitrary". owe difficulty involve effectively define actual objective cyclically-adjusted balance budget, nominal balance deliberately choose and, time pact negotiation 1996, 3% ceiling define deficit regard generous. furthermore, 3% ceiling closely link 60% ceiling government debt. for example, assume nominal growth19 5%, time 3% deficit would tend lead debt level 60%. give humble growth rate grow accustom recent years, much low deficit ceiling would appropriate. the problem weakness old pact due rigid. on contrary, lay weakness political decision-making process incentive sanction system preventive effect modest. consequently, european commission20 also find – governments’ medium-term stability programme systematically overstate growth hence budgetary developments, words, opportunity overestimate risk underestimated. 4 change make stability growth pact 2005 the change agree 23 march 2005 follow protract political debate, coordination german french government active participation luxembourg president eu council jean-claude juncker. they concern fundamental, “preventive” arm stability pact define council regulation 1466/97 surveillance budgetary positions, well “corrective” arm lay council regulation 1467/97 speed clarify excessive deficit procedure. (1) in “preventive” arm pact, medium-term budgetary objective previously apply member state (balanced budget surplus) modify country-specific considerations. under article 2a new regulation, medium-term budgetary objective set – take account debt level potential growth rate member state concern – within range -1% gdp.21 19 base inflation 2% line ecb’s stability objective, 3% real growth assume overall. 20 european commission (2005), public finance emu 21 target set euro country well erm ii participate countries. moreover, member state allow scope deviate “adjustment path” (article 5 (1) amended), ie path towards achieve country-specific objective, implement structural reforms, particular transition partially fund public pension system. in regulation itself,22 reason give change-over country-specific budgetary target “economic budgetary heterogeneity” member states. this clearly conflict underlie concept european monetary union, key component single monetary policy base idea “one size fit all”.23 the proposition structural reform inevitably place short-term burden budgetary position appear fully support empirical evidence. in fact, certain essential reforms, particular pension system also labour good markets, well tax reform (with impact tax revenue), actually positive effect budget. (2) the change “corrective arm”, ie council regulation 1467/97, go even further. pursuant article 2 (2) et seq., member state permit exceed 3% ceiling – lay protocol no 11 ec treaty thus enshrine primary european law – event severe recession natural disaster, also case negative annual growth rate (potentially, even small one) low gdp growth relative potential. moreover, specify “all relevant factors” take account decide excessive deficit accordance article 104 (3) ec. this long list potential exceptional circumstance grind exemption hind implementation excessive deficit procedure. these include “prevailing economic cycles”, “policies context lisbon agenda“, measure “to foster research development innovation”, “debt sustainability”, “financial contribution foster international solidarity”, contribution “achieving european policy goals, notably unification europe” (in words: include payment relate german reunification) many more. face list, difficult speak consistent, coherent set rules.

effects, investment petroleum sector affect activity level offshore mainland norway. oil give u economic base available many countries. but also present u considerable challenges. our petroleum resource part national wealth. when oil extract sold, natural asset transform financial wealth. norway’s national wealth belong generation, also future generations, government policy take account. when exercise fiscal discipline, norwegian authority seek ensure petroleum wealth distribute equitably across generations. second, size cash flow petroleum activity varies. considerable fluctuation demand norwegian economy, amplify cyclical fluctuations, would result petroleum revenue use accrue. third, use petroleum revenue impact competitiveness norwegian business industry. a high level substantial variation use petroleum revenue would negative impact internationally expose industries. the establishment government petroleum fund guideline use petroleum revenue intend meet challenges.1 the petroleum fund serf buff current petroleum revenue use revenue norwegian economy. in way, economy shield fluctuation price extraction rate petroleum sector. petroleum revenue may gradually phase norwegian economy. the fund also save fund allow petroleum wealth distribute across generations. the objective best achieve invest petroleum fund outside norwegian economy. the act relate government petroleum fund stipulate central government revenue petroleum operation shall transfer petroleum fund fund’s capital may spend central government budget. the act prohibit use fund’s capital way. once year, government authority decide accordance act much fund may reasonably used. all use central government fund thus subject assessment alternative us must weigh one another. the background material act relate petroleum fund clearly indicate fund shall second central government budget and, implication, shall use investment spend receive priority budget. the chart show share central government’s annual net cash flow petroleum activity transfer fund fiscal budget. since 1996, considerable portion petroleum revenue retain fund. in 2000 2001, almost transfer fund fiscal budget past two year share transfer fiscal budget represent one-third cash flow. 1 see act relate government petroleum fund, adopt 22 june 1990 amend act no. 2 16 january 2004. the petroleum fund become large. at end second quarter 2005, market value petroleum fund’s portfolio nearly nok 1 200 billion approximately eur 150 billion, roughly 65 per cent gdp. the ministry finance define clear mandate norge bank’s management petroleum fund. norge bank shall seek achieve excess return relation benchmark portfolio mean active management within certain risk limit. the chart show development average annual net real return real return without contribution active management. return fluctuate considerably since petroleum fund make first investment equity market 1998. since 1998, first whole year petroleum fund invest equities, annual excess return active management close half percentage point. the correspond krone amount nok 18 billion. petroleum revenue generally involve substantial, uneven currency inflow norway. the currency flow might result strong krone large variation exchange rate. the petroleum fund act buff dampen wide fluctuation krone exchange rate petroleum revenue might otherwise generated. an increase petroleum revenue result high capital outflow petroleum fund. operator foreign exchange market may time tendency underestimate fund’s function stabilisation mechanism. the capital outflow fund contribute curb appreciation krone maintain stability. since summer 2004, krone exchange rate appreciate 5 per cent, measure trade-weighted exchange rate index (twi). the chart show krone exchange rate oil spot price 1999. the chart indicate clear relationship nominal exchange rate oil spot price time. an appreciation krone accompany high oil price period low oil price others. the correlation oil price nominal exchange rate therefore vary time. however, since introduction inflation target march 2001, average correlation zero. this remarkable result may indicate petroleum fund shield nominal exchange rate movement oil prices. therefore, cause optimism regard possibility isolate mainland economy variable oil price short medium run. in long run, however, cannot insulate real exchange rate development petroleum sector use petroleum revenues. i return later. an increase oil price may nevertheless generate expectation increase petroleum revenue spend ahead, particularly high oil price assume persist. such expectation may exert appreciation pressure krone. the chart show future oil price 6-7 year ahead increase spot price since january 2004. this sharp rise may help explain appreciation past year. in addition, may expectation development favourable norwegian stock market foreign market oil price rise. this may also contribute strengthen krone. however, estimate future value petroleum fund, expect decline level production norwegian continental shelf also take account. in addition, tendency lately overestimate production look year ahead. investment petroleum sector important source business cycle fluctuation norway. investment rise sharply 1970s 1980s reach peak 1998. mainly result persistently high oil price expectation oil price remain high, investment norwegian petroleum sector may reach record level year. norge bank’s regional network currently report high level activity among supplier petroleum industry. however, investment may decline large development project like ormen lange, kristin snøhvit near completion. it uncertain sharp fall be, today’s high level exploration activity long period high oil price imply petroleum investment remain high year ahead. investment petroleum sector spillover effect mainland economy, initially engineer industry construction sector. look forward, scale petroleum investment spillover effect highly uncertain. the last time petroleum investment show sharp increase, 1997/1998, growth substantially strong assumed. an upturn occur norwegian economy whole time. the unexpected increase petroleum investment contribute economic upturn substantially strong projected. if oil price rise remain current high level long period, petroleum investment may amplify cyclical upturn great extent projected. let return framework economic policy norway. the storting (norwegian parliament) approve fiscal guideline use petroleum revenues. it state that, general, petroleum revenue spend shall limit 4 per cent, expect annual real return petroleum fund time. this fiscal rule shall ensure use revenue norwegian economy level sustain time. the usefulness fiscal guideline give weight long-term consideration address day-to-day economic policy challenges. the fiscal rule stabilise enterprises’ expectation concern competitiveness krone exchange rate, thus prevent abrupt pronounce swing structure economy. if government authority disregard rule, enterprise lose important reference. a policy rule make matter bad economic agent draw long-term plan faulty basis. the fiscal rule budget state government use 4 per cent fund time. this year, around 6 per cent fund used. the deviation partly reflect unexpected shortfall tax revenue non-oil economy recent years. the government budget deficit difference total revenue total expenditure. they account half total gdp norway. even small deviation expenditure revenue projection major impact deficit. exchange rate change also lead fluctuation value petroleum fund. for reason alone, use petroleum revenue may period deviate 4 per cent rule. spend also increase response economic downturn 2003. we therefore safely affirm fiscal rule normative fiscal policy. nevertheless, last year oil money flow norwegian economy earlier. petroleum investment show pronounce increase year. moreover, government petroleum revenue spend increase recent years. the fiscal rule part set economic policy guidelines. the various component economic policy vary effects. this different functions: • monetary policy steer inflation medium long term also contribute smooth swing output employment. • the central government budget – growth public spend – influence krone size internationally expose business sector medium term. government expenditure revenue must balance long term. • wage formation, structure economy incentive determine efficiently use labour resource economic resources. there also interaction. to give example: • in budget resolutions, government authority attach importance effect budget norwegian economy therefore take account interest rate effects. in way, avoid situation growth public spend interest rate push economy different directions. norway’s history oil nation go back end 1960s. at begin oil age norway, relationship use petroleum revenue change industry structure highlighted. however, since then, competitiveness business sector norway deteriorate due high wage growth late year appreciation krone trade partners. cost rise sharply mid-1960s mid-1970s. in subsequent years, cost vary around high level. so far year, competitiveness norway’s manufacture industry 5.5 per cent weak average period 1970-2004. over past 30 years, manufacture scale back waves. a substantial decline occur period 1977 1984 1987 1992. the last wave occur around turn millennium. manufacture employment decrease close 55 000 person 1998 2004. there many study international literature2 point pitfall face country suddenly discover large natural resources. certainly, norwegian manufacture sector undergo substantial change past 30 years. on hand, period also mark substantial productivity gain part shelter sector, example retail trade bank sector. petroleum activity contribute technological development shipbuilding industry offshore sector. the current cost level norwegian business sector adapt expansion petroleum sector steady phasing-in petroleum revenue mainland economy. in long term, exchange rate tend adjust domestic economy current account balance. after period, able cover small share import use current petroleum revenue draw petroleum fund. competitiveness improved. it may bring back around level prevail end 1960s prior norway’s emergence oil nation. rough estimates3 suggest real exchange rate ensure balance external account petroleum wealth long significant role economy line real exchange rate start with. this show chart, real exchange rate long term revert level prevail petroleum extraction began. in conclusion, petroleum fund fiscal rule shield economy fluctuation oil price extraction rates. with inflation target, inflationary pressure steer use interest rate, value krone fluctuates. consequently, decision use petroleum revenue taken, weight must give long-term consideration distribution wealth across generations, also development real exchange rate competitiveness expose sector short medium term. thank attention. 2 see e.g. j. d. sachs a. m. warner (2001)”the curse natural resources” european economic review 45, pp 827 – 838.3 see akram, farooq

regime speech mr zhou xiaochuan governor people’s bank china, inauguration ceremony the people’s bank china shanghai head office, shanghai, 10 august 2005. * * * honorable general secretary chen, honorable mayor han, colleague friend financial industry dear guests, lady gentlemen, first all, i would like take opportunity express gratitude concern support kindly render people’s bank china many years, i would also like thank avail busy schedule attend inauguration ceremony people’s bank china shanghai head office. on today’s significant occasion, i wish focus remark two specific issues. the first issue explore rule develop financial center, second issue aim clarify question concern reform rmb exchange rate regime. for first issue, answer quite straightforward. the people’s bank china shanghai head office establish purpose strengthen function central bank head office relate improve financial market operation financial services. first, international experience chinese practice process reform open well demonstrate great marketization economy could lead increase cross-region economic activities, consequently improve integration scale economy call strengthen function central bank head office term market operation provision financial services. marketization internationalization expose economic development undergo constant changes, lead increase reliance monetary policy conduct transmission money market foreign exchange market. the development financial market also help expand financial service client different region country cultivate limit number financial market serve whole nation even world, segment financial market dot across country serve different regions. for time being, shanghai already become harbor financial market national influence, foreign exchange market, gold market, security market, future market inter-bank bond market etc. however past centralize economic system prevalent early period reform marketization barely developed, financial organization favor institutional structure feature “parallel set-up business department subordinate head office level” mean branch office financial institution different location must establish correspond business department contact point interface relevant department head office. by so, information could collect centralize high authority could turn decompose centrally make plan level level different region locality implementation. with socialist market economy preliminarily establish improve china, outdated organizational structure people’s bank china long fit mandate improve market operation financial services. likewise, large financial institution china also face organizational problem. second, development technology transportation facility produce profound impact economy financial industry. in past, underdevelop telecommunication computer technology well backward transportation tend restrict economic activity trade locality little cross-region business interactions. while now, development scientific technology transportation facilitate cross-region even cross-country commercial activities, increase economic scale financial market financial service foster modernization financial infrastructures. this development bring dramatic change financial business mode create great challenge regionalized structure institution organizations. under circumstances, financial organization prone set view whole country rather different region financial information professional also increasingly flow financial center provide service whole country. this turn could help facilitate development infrastructure financial center cultivation high-end technology financial products. finally, today’s world, country’s competitiveness depend whether dynamic financial center. a financial center cluster effect, i.e., attract foster financial institutions, skilled labor force various services, include intermediate institutions, legal, accounting, rat appraisal services. naturally, activity out-sourced, rest foster base cluster financial institution skilled labor force. in regard, existence financial center yardstick whether country internationally competitive whether efficiency domestic financial service elevate large scales. general secretary hu jintao call continue effort make shanghai four center nation, importantly financial center. in sense, build national financial center base interest city particular region. give responsibility conduct monetary policy, exercise macroeconomic management, foster financial market development maintain financial stability, people’s bank china must give consideration development national financial center carry central bank function base platform financial center. in regard, setup pbc shanghai head office historical significance. regard reform rmb exchange rate regime, i would like elaborate little bite content basket currencies. a know, authorization state council, july 21, 2005 china move manage float exchange rate regime base market supply demand reference basket currencies. the rmb long peg u dollar. instead, rmb exchange rate determine base basket certain major currency assign weight select line real situation china’s external sector development. at time, proper measure could take manage adjust rmb exchange rate base market supply demand consider change basket currencies, maintain rmb exchange rate basically stable adaptive equilibrium level. in sense, quite natural people increasingly concern composition basket currency determined. to enhance public understand china’s exchange rate policy, i would like make follow clarification regard determination basket currencies. a reference float rmb exchange rate, selection basket currency determination weight assign currency must abide fundamental principle give due consideration country stand china’s trade counterpart current account transaction national currencies. a know, four item current account, namely, trade goods, trade services, income (including interest income dividend income) current transfer (such remittance overseas chinese). to put simply, basket compose currency country china prominent exposure term foreign trade, external debt (interest repayment) foreign direct investment (dividend). and weight respectively assign currency also consist proportional importance country china’s external sector. - share trade good service fundamental consideration selection basket currency weight assign currency basket. current account major component china’s balance payments, whereas trade good service predominant item current account. the current situation china show trade good service dominate current account balance. therefore, share trade major consideration determination currency component basket. china’s major trade partner unite states, euro land, japan, korea, etc., naturally, u dollar, euro, japanese yen korean become major currency basket. in addition, china also trade significantly singapore, uk, malaysia, russia, australia, thailand, canada, currency country also important determine china’s rmb exchange rate. generally speaking, annual bilateral trade volume excess us$10 billion negligible weight assignment, whereas exceed us$5 billion also consider significant factor currency weight deliberation. when look currency use trade settlement, although country region prefer u dollar currency trade settlement china, situation change gradually trade settlement local currency increasingly choice trade partners. moreover, encourage development. since basket represent currency country cover significant share china’s external trade, rmb exchange rate basket currency therefore good indicator value rmb change china’s term trade u dollar, consequently serf important reference achieve basic trade balance good services. - currency structure foreign debt consider a china open outside world, size foreign debt incur continue grow significantly. by end last year, china’s foreign debt reach us$228.6 billion origin increasingly diversified. in cases, foreign debt repayment would require purchase specific foreign currency rmb. the result conspicuous demand specific foreign currency market would become factor influence rmb exchange rate. a such, determine currency weight basket, also take consideration currency structure china’s foreign debt. - fdi consider in recent years, rapid growth witness fdi gain importance foreign economic relations. by now, accumulate fdi flow china reach us$560 billion, significant part denominate currency originate economies. the investment return form dividend need exchange relevant foreign currency repatriated. therefore factor fdi consider selection basket currencies. - current transfer item current account also consider though current transfer important proportionally item current account, currency structure transfer still need consider determination weight assign currency basket. in sum, reform rmb exchange rate regime allow rmb exchange rate float reference basket currency line need diversify foreign economic trade relation well development international economic financial system. refer basket currency equal peg basket. peg mean mechanically adjust exchange rate rmb u dollar accord exchange rate movement currency basket attempt keep nominal effective exchange rate unchanged. quite differently, manage float exchange rate regime base market demand supply reference basket currencies. in comparison exchange rate regime peg u dollar solely, good reflect competitiveness rmb major currencies, good absorb impact generate unstable u dollar moderate fluctuation rmb exchange rate multilateral level, safeguard overall stability china’s foreign economic trade environment consequently promote basic equilibrium balance payment well sustained, coordinate healthy growth chinese economy. thank much. jean-claude trichet: jackson hole conference - monetary policy “credible alertness” intervention mr jean-claude trichet, president ecb panel discussion “monetary policy strategies: central bank panel”, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, wyoming, 27 august 2005. * * * dear alan, dear lady gentlemen, i privilege participate alan meet g7 minister governor last 18 years. but one big difference us! he participate meet president federal reserve, whereas responsibility change three time period. i successively undersecretary treasury country, governor banque de france president european central bank. i could therefore look legendary exposition alan g7 three different angles, benefit multiocular perspective also hindsight. and i say 3-d alan’s exposition intimate, restrict format incredibly sharp, profound visionary. i personally share fully, particular, judgement alan blind ricardo real lucidity alan regard early diagnosis productivity jump u economy. not unite states, also europe rest world, alan high reputation. in european quarters, even sometimes make principal witness monetary policy activism, i sure whether would agree role. still, issue fed’s movement interest rate ecb frequently debated. let elaborate debate somewhat further. since 1 january 1999, european central bank (ecb) officially become monetary authority euro area, ecb change policy rate 15 times. the ease cycle start 2001 side atlantic saw cumulative reduction euro area’s policy rate 275 basis points, accomplish 7 moves. that cycle yet reversed. the fact move le frequently federal reserve, particular last 2 years, generate interest discussion central bank activism. the undisputed notion central bank react state economy go long way explain different currency area witness different degree central bank activism. shock great magnitude and/or long duration, economic system exogenous disturbance run course strongly speedily, largely explain different policy responses, measure frequency policy move cumulative change policy rate. so, different contingency economic structure – quite naturally – result different conduct policy. and i could explain length 2001 high rate euro area level 4.75%, 6.5% unite state cumulative reduction ease cycle large unite states, take account objective measure difference amplitude economic swing characterise side atlantic.1 but i would like share today think different sort difference “activism”: one induce state economy, rather one find deep motivation central bank’s strategy. it degree activism result way policymakers try reconcile fundamental tension inherent profession. on one hand, quite general principle prudent monetary governance, pay adopt systematic policy focus respond fundamental force work economy predictable manner, disregard vagary expectation markets’ fads. this policy would enhance markets’ ability anticipate central bank’s behaviour, favour smooth adjustment economy disturbances, prevent instability expectation inject volatility monetary policy, turn economy. if successful, degree activism display policy would mainly relate variability state economy. 1 table 1 annex display evolution several macroeconomic indicator euro area unite state last years. on hand, central bank also need recognise mislead expectation amplify prolong response inflation economic activity inflationary deflationary shock. this would general imply central bank embark aggressive policy action response expectation instability. and, add degree activism display policy rate. i argue that, whilst central bank must always ready take aggressive action needed, well-designed institutional framework, undisputedly assign central bank primary objective price stability, adoption clear monetary policy strategy, quantitatively define price stability pretend fine-tune directly business cycle, make latter type policy activism unnecessary many circumstances. the reason framework reduce uncertainty central bank’s ultimate motives, provide strong anchor inflation expectation make easy market map expect path policy rate evolution macroeconomic conditions. this would reduce likelihood expectation might over-react first place and, expectation instability nevertheless occur, provide central bank additional viable option. i argue condition central bank regain control private expectation without necessarily change interest rates, visibly credibly “alert”, explain stress commitment maintain inflation level consistent price stability objective. the threat act effective credible central bank time actually deliver price stability, define quantitatively. the paradox would policy priori “reinforced alertness” would make central bank appear ex post le “activist” term change policy rate. importantly, side effect, policy would good sustain economic activity minimise macroeconomic volatility. in practice, central bank would normally make use available option – circumstance dictate – counteract situation potential undermine confidence perturb market condition last period. we do past future. a example, chairmanship predecessor, wim duisenberg, whose pass away month ago deprive community central banker man remarkable wisdom lucid judgement, take immediate decision dramatic event 9/11, pour large amount liquidity euro, set swap agreement feed decrease rates. this demonstrate clearly ecb eager act decisively immediately appropriate absolutely enshrine bias wait “slowest ship convoy”. this observation observer market participant make certainly important reinforce credibility govern council ecb embark “reinforced alertness”. in situations, aid task monetary policy strategy. clarity quantitative definition price stability framework adopt ass risk price stability particularly important u ensure smooth start monetary union europe. such clarity afford considerable latitude action early year decade, despite repeat unfavourable shocks, remarkable leverage market conditions. the advantage rule-like behaviour at first thought, “discretionary” response shock might seem exactly one would expect professional central banker. after all, economic contingency unique combination circumstance that, way, unprecedented, probably never repeat precise form. so, new contingency would seem command different, tailor-made response part monetary authorities. there grain truth this. but decade reflection role expectation macroeconomics teach u monetary policy sequence isolate policy actions. when form expectations, agent seek capture general pattern monetary policies, pattern matter shape economic behaviour. therefore, relevant problem solve central bank much size time give interest rate move response particular contingency. it strategy repeatedly adjust policy instrument response state economy, whatever might be. if central bank able convince economic agent market participant analysis assessment outlook, policy measure go take response it, mechanism anticipation act self-equilibrating manner. a soon macroeconomic news released, expectation short-term interest rate adjust equilibrate direction market expect see implement central bank. such credibility asset turn beneficial case major shock risks. it clear world central banks’ inclination market view perfectly align unlikely emerge reality. however, decade academic reflection central banks’ quest stability past vain. our keen preoccupation make understand word deed establish new climate mutual understand academics, investors, market participant public opinion large. we step number gather document strategy carefully explain action broad audiences. on markets’ side, constant drive toward continuous all-round exchange public tangibly reward high marks. the leverage central bank pronouncement action private economic behaviour strengthen extent could remotely imagine decade ago. there shortcut fully reveal central bank’s strategy. this disclosure – perform ongoing process interaction large complex audience – help clarify policy environment anchor expectations. but unless deed support words, word unconvincing. so, good way establish reputation actually follow strategy monetary policy let public infer recognise repeat behaviour. consistent behaviour precondition outsider understand action believe pronouncements. in synthesis, precondition credibility. this capital credibility build time easily squandered. so, general principle, weigh argument decision, never fail appreciate behaviour durable significance. it add asset credibility, detract important ways. a corollary: beware false signal in view, statement reputation consistent behaviour asset carry important corollary it. we guard over-reacting indicator might give distort picture economic reality thus promote policy might regret – hastily reverse – retrospect. to specific, carry strategies, would ideally need accurate, quantitative, contemporaneous read current pertinent economic, monetary financial data. for instance, knowledge level production would consistent stable prices, so-called “natural” rate output, would important tool assess whether stance policy broadly appropriate. however, estimate time-varying natural rate output, implication measure economic slack, notoriously imprecise. even hindsight, different estimation method yield quite disperse figures. allow data revisions, re-appraising synthetic indicator aggregate revise data, make uncertainty surround measure pervasive. now, act strongly indicators, force reverse gear soon thereafter new estimate become available, risk danger erratic policy process. importantly, confound markets, look back record try make sense past behaviour use wisdom available hindsight. if give indication differ markedly could reasonably infer real time, outside observer might extract distort picture intentions. even prudent policy conduct could appear ex post – deplore – evidence incorrect decisions. this could drain central bank’s stock credibility. all new revive memory 1970s. be spectacular policy mistake unfortunate decade due poor economic theory, poor policy bias representation economy? it probably blend factors, last one carry substantial weight. advance theory since 1970s sophisticate econometrics immunise policy process potential pitfalls. and concrete example i mean. the first estimate output gap typically available reference year, revise subsequent years. it important note final estimate available long period time: 1999 estimates, example, still revise non-negligible amount 2004. revision also large: often affect sign, well magnitude estimates. in case hand, example, revise output-gap measure available u today positive almost estimate 1999, 2000 2001, estimate negative real time [as show chart 1.] 2 uncertainty even high output gap projections, measure output gap exist begin year. for example, real-time estimate output gap 2005, publish spring european commission, imf oecd, differ average 25% output-gap projection institution make end 2004. and, add real-time measure output gap 2005 average size revision observe past, conclude may ex post turn anything -3.6% +0.8%. clearly, output-gap measurement issue fact past. central bank also need cope problem present. i take warn central bank rely simple indicator economic slack take policy decisions. to conclude point i would say are, undoubtedly, great difference term monetary policy strategy u ecb and, use alan blind terms, greenspan’s fed. we consider public display arithmetic definition price stability essential success strategy. we equally deem communication market two-pillar monetary policy concept important great help actual implementation policy. it true that, sense, belong two different school think side atlantic. but important point contrary share exactly views. we want comprehensive possible analysis. we want neglect information, in-depth appreciation particular situation. we want rely exclusively single particular model economy, sophisticate may be. i say several time govern council ecb intention “prisoner” single system equations. we highly praise “robustness”. there substitute comprehensive analysis risk price stability pay due attention relevant information. it stand good chance anchor policy – channel – expectation durable fashion. respond risk instability it expectation way dynamic factor policy i turn. why expectation problem within credible policy environment? because economy never rest. agent catch continuous change environment ongoing process learning. when shock moderate, underlie evolution economic structure proceed slow pace, imperfect information learn excessively complicate interaction private sector. but time stormy perturbation accelerate structural change make uncertainty acute. these time perpetual process learn part economic agent implication overall stability economic system – extent, independently monetary policy regime place. if agent posse rational expectations, re-estimate continuously coefficient unknown model economy, use roll window new observations, well happen shock sufficiently serious magnitude unsettle expectations, even credible monetary institutions. the reason simple. it might become impossible private forecaster quickly form reason guess scale shock, duration persistence, likelihood might easily wash away, would become, eyes, embed fundamental relation regulate function economy time come. long-term expectation thus may over-react shock. they may drift endogenously reflect impact unprecedented disturbance exert agents’ re-assessment key structural feature economy. these time which, typically, disconnection private view macroeconomic outlook central bank’s internal forecasts. the expectation likely outcome entertain median agent economy likely depart central 2 chart 1 display estimate output gap construct european commission, imf oecd. to good contrast difference initial estimate revise data, chart 1 show real-time estimate late available revision and, make simplify assumption data revise 3 year initial estimate approximately correct, display revise data period spring 2002. scenario consider plausible, give condition assumptions, purpose central bank’s internal assessment macroeconomic outlook. a agents’ expectation shape market reaction new economic data central bank’s policy actions, embed information central bank cannot neglect grossly underrate analysis. the difficulty lie devise prudent way factor situation policy. and fundamental tension inherent profession come in. on one hand want keep eye fundamental avoid mislead intoxicate could well noise unfounded overreactions. on hand, excess endogenous volatility private expectation could indeed provide advance warn pending risk central bank take account. mislead market expectation prolong dynamic response inflation real activity inflationary deflationary shock sufficiently great potency. this might entail serious risk instability. recent work do federal reserve board athanasios orphanides john williams3 show that, circumstances, rise (or fall) private inflation expectation beyond (or short of) imply perfect knowledge elicit aggressive response could expect normal conditions. the optimality response corroborate study vitor gaspar, frank smets david vestin4[4] ecb. they argue agent perceive inflation persistence high, inflationary – deflationary – shock easily become entrenched, agent suspect force perpetuate economic structure. an aggressive policy adjustment reaction detect sign expectation instability help head risk one might see associate manifestation phenomenon. it might effective way prove central bank perceptive change circumstance – even change view circumstances, present prospective – ready act pre-emptively. however, unexpected possibly unprecedented action central bank take response risk might disorient market. so, process market participant price long-dated security asset general might impaired, investor might misinterpret central bank’s intentions. a consequence, asset price could drive far away fundamental value confidence could undermined. this would suggest action may always advisable. sometimes, optimal behaviour consist appropriately communicate central bank’s assessment fundamental state economy prospect order regain control inflation expectations. in long term, advantage systematically avoid hasty reaction outweigh benefit might apparent short term. by maintain steady posture, central bank embrace policy view role lighthouse or, accurately, lightship, storm. in respect, build reputation calm firm management event pay off. the viability approach – efficiency – enhance central bank operate within clearly define institutional framework. in policy-making regime feature primary, sharply-defined objective – reinforce precise numerical definition central bank’s notion price stability – likely evolution economy vis-à-vis objective give clear indication likely future stance policy. this suppose diminish odds expectation might start diverge first place. and, expectation instability develop nonetheless, able refer communication unambiguously objective – time certain circumstance – provide effective substitute tangible action, provide “credible alertness” central bank undisputed market participants. action vigilance all all, art central bank involve find fine balance action word order react change market expectations. the ease cycle start 2001 instability inflation expectation occur 2003 represent 2

appropriate benefit hindsight, move interest rate low level – explore secular uncharted water – indeed bold ex ante new institution, mid 2003 exactly 5 year old – new currency – time 4½ year old. it do extent either feed bank england! in retrospect, bold equally lucid. there doubt govern council use appropriate judgement grant high weight decrease inflationary pressure stem downside risk economic activity. and also doubt resolute action ecb, base inflationary analysis, permit stabilise inflation inflationary expectations, also help forestall much deep slowdown economy. the behaviour inflation expectation bring episode i mentioned. long-term inflation expectations, remain well anchor level line ecb definition price stability outset monetary union january 1999, start display sign upward instability second half 2003 last decision decrease rates. the ten-year break-even inflation rate (beir) suggest incipient rise longer-term inflation expectation [see chart 2]. survey-based data also reveal probability assign inflation outcome definition price stability long horizon rise [see chart 3a]. movement indicator long-term inflation expectation possibly reflect concern policy stance incompatible inflationary impact surge oil prices, accompany pick-up economic activity protract condition ample liquidity, could see favour spend propensity grant firm increase price power.5[5] the rise inflation expectation consider carefully ecb’s govern council. it utmost importance regain control expectations. for reason would common central bank plus three peculiar ecb. first, i already explained, bold explore new territory low side interest rates, dissipate wrong sentiment market could neglect main objective, namely price stability. second, also eliminate risk part market might tempt regard single currency embed average feature constituent currencies, rather inherit characteristic best perform monetary regime constitute legacy: euro, since inception, been, least credible, stable good store value credible national currency were, fundamental goal monetary union, remarkably marshal great success time transition. and, third, analysis market participant – possibly over-assessing medium long-term inflationary expectation – push medium long-term market rate moment necessarily advisable judgement. 5 beir may also affect technical market factors. when assess development beir, caution needed. beyond short-term movement financial price may distort information content long-term interest rates, upward movement beir may signal increase inflation expectation risk premium associate high inflation uncertainty, although obvious concern central bank our concern rise inflation expectation signal market autumn 2003 press conference. over time, communication become increasingly “alert”, signal vigilance upside risk inflation grow time. we make clear june 2004 policy statement, state upward trend inflation expectation call “particular vigilance”, september expression concern reinforce statement “strong vigilance”, make crystal clear ecb ready take whatever action necessary eliminate drift expectation restore stability. it course difficult isolate effect

inflation outcome high price stability objective declined. we also observe decline unprecedented low level standard deviation individual respondents’ point forecasts, “disagreement”, reveal increase alignment private sector expectation around focal point – coherent notion price stability [see chart 3b]. a stabilisation inflation expectation follow decline coincide display ecb constant alertness key feature central bank’s policy, probably argue market become increasingly aware ecb’s readiness act, therefore ecb’s communication one main factor drive expectations. an argument support view decline break-even inflation coincide sharp rise oil prices. this constitute major break past, rise oil price regularly lead high break-even inflation rates. however, factor also may contribute fall expect inflation, technical market factors, dampen dynamic labour cost increase weakness lead indicator economic activity. of course, communication play decisive role steer expectations, end actual

a expected, dynamic closely associate movement actual inflation short-term indicator inflationary pressure, oil price dynamics. however, imply forward break-even inflation rate (referring period

monthly press conference follow govern council meet discus monetary policy, i regularly make point make promise market future policy move stand ready act soon necessary maintain price stability. conclusion if i draw lesson future observe side atlantic, alan’s tenure, experience europe, i would like suggest three words: risks, robustness credibility. first, stand ready time weather materialisation new risks. the last 18 year particularly impressive standpoint. those risk probably unavoidable necessary counterpart immense chance science technology one hand, success emerge economy globalisation other, bring world economy. be intellectually conceptually ready extremely important. incidentally, reason financial stability continue essence constant inspiration monetary policy. second, fully accept economies, well global economy, experience period rapid structural changes. i would fully subscribe alan’s remark “the economic world … best describe structure whose parameter continuously changing”. it even true europe. because addition impact science technology, addition effect globalisation, addition rapid demographic change characterise industrial world, also take account structural transformation europe boldly marshal itself: single market, single currency, historic enlargement. but lesson valid all. robustness present situation key depend single model would necessarily impoverish considerably wealth information need enlighten decision. third, i would stress ever future concept credibility. it feed has, throughout last 18 years, highly credible remarkable success achieve price stability, even without i would consider precondition anchor inflationary expectations: quantitative definition price stability. in difficult episode crisis credibility feed decisive effectiveness handle situation. in case govern council ecb i explain credibility enable u regain full control inflationary expectation remarkable efficiency last two years. and observer market participant rightly intimate conviction intend absolutely ready act time need inhibit respect either unconditional commitment – always carefully avoid – kind well intentioned public pressure

environment, foreign exchange market assume critical importance stability financial system since banks’ balance sheet influence foreign capital inflow various external transaction directly indirectly credit exposures. the indian forex market widen deepen since 1990s account implementation various measure recommend high level committee balance payment 1993 (chairman: dr. c.rangarajan), expert group

regulations. some recommendations, as, freedom cancel rebook forward contract tenor, delegation power ad grant permission corporates hedge exposure commodity price risk international commodity exchanges/ market extension trade hour inter-bank foreign exchange market already implemented. the reserve bank place report public domain comment feedback receive take consideration arrive final decision regard. great liberalisation require bank act responsibly order provide confidence corporate entity go derivative transaction addition satisfy regulations. in context, customer suitability appropriateness issue assume significance. the “appropriateness standard” ensure bank use principle take credit decision respect complex derivative transaction non-derivative transactions. bank expect evaluate purpose derivative transaction make assessment whether appropriate customer’s need level sophistication. while bank already appropriateness policy place, many bank not. instance international bank encounter compensation claim due slackness part area well known. it is, therefore, important bank introduce customer suitability appropriateness policy. further, great clarity require area derivative account book corporates well bank regard revenue recognition valuation asset liabilities. in general may desirable practice convergence account standard foreign currency inr derivative balance sheet balance sheet items. there also need eliminate incentive drive wedge on-balance sheet off-balance sheet items. clarity essential differentiate hedge trade transactions. in respect

important. in case complex structure products, imperative part bank / corporates transparent disclose nature quantum risk contract system put place monitor risks. while account disclosure issue engage attention, rbi also examine recommendation technical group phase implementation. one recommendation relate cover options. a thing stand, corporates allow purchase option support genuine underlie transaction/receivable. any structure product involve cost reduction allow provide increase underlie risk net receipt premium. cover options, allow corporates write cover call put subject adequate risk management system place. this expect impart great depth liquidity option market provide great flexibility market participants. similarly, propose revisit procedure respect crystallization unpaid

suggestion allow price fix hedge extent average quantity commodity bought/sold previous three years, previous year, whichever higher. this would applicable commodity imported/ export procure domestically. rbi welcome input forex association regard recommendation examination. a proposal ccil extend guarantee settlement us$/inr forward transaction trade date currently examine us. since settlement guarantee extend trade date, expect liquidity depth forward market increase significantly. the risk bank today carry book account large outstanding forward position significantly reduced. let turn g-sec market. iii. g-sec market a debt manager government, development deep liquid market government security critical importance reserve bank would result good price discovery reduce cost government borrowing. such market also provide effective transmission mechanism monetary policy, facilitate introduction price hedge product serve benchmark debt instruments. effort towards development government security market focus three areas: institutional measures, innovation instruments, enable measures. a result gradual reform measure take years, indian g-sec market see transition better, reflect follow developments: • market become increasingly broad based. • consolidation securities, albeit passive manner, result development several benchmark securities, • high degree sophistication achieve auction process narrow gap cut-off price weight average cut-off price result strong correlation bid primary auction secondary market yields, indicate improve price discovery. • increase volume trade secondary market result reasonably smooth yield curve; • yield curve elongate 30 year maturity reduce bunch redemption minimise rollover risk; • process novation, central counterparty, like clear corporation india limit (ccil) provide excellent infrastructure contribute good risk management. • address important issue regard pricing, choice benchmark, liquidity respect float rate bond (frbs), sub-group technical advisory committee money, forex government security market constituted. • rbi enhance efficacy nd incorporate screen base anonymous order match system ambit effect august 1, 2005. give backdrop, let turn recommendation make technical group government security examination. first, since rbi would able participate primary auction market effect 2006-07, internal technical group rbi examine recommend appropriately restructure primary issuance process. the technical group suggest primary dealers(pds) may take great role underwrite may accordingly need underwrite 100 per cent notify amount future auctions. second, large responsibility cast pd may need compensate appropriate incentive one suggestion extend exclusivity auctions, typical feature country pd system. however, another view may disadvantage player government security market participate directly auctions. third, pd also require play role market-makers always offer two-way quotes, thereby impart liquidity. however, represent absence short sale constrain market-making role pds. the issue consideration whether short sales, appropriate safeguard would necessary pd play role market-making. fourth, number challenge emerge monetary debt management: to meet emerge challenges, reserve bank take step fine-tune open market operations. this would need great accuracy forecast market liquidity short- medium-term. operationally, open market purchase sale may undertaken, necessitate review process technical infrastructure consistent market development. other recommendation make group develop efficiency liquidity secondary market government security include (i) active consolidation securities, (ii) introduction ‘when issued’ market phase manner, (iv) security borrow window pds. a per announcement union budget 2005-06, bill amend rbi act,1934 providing, among things, legality otc derivative introduce parliament. similarly, government security bill seek broaden market government security facilitate retail interest also ensure orderly secondary market. some substantive improvement expect management public debt account bill are: (i) strip reconstitution government security facilitate improve secondary market liquidity, one hand enable good risk allocation appropriate investor class, other, (ii) provision hypothecation, pledge creation lien government securities, etc. let turn money market. iv. money market the money market form important part financial system provide avenue equilibrate surplus fund lender requirement borrower short periods. it also provide focal point central bank’s intervention influence liquidity financial system thereby transmit monetary policy impulses. the primary aim reserve bank’s operation money market ensure liquidity short-term interest rate maintain level consistent monetary policy objectives. in recent years, reserve bank’s approach foster balance development different segment money market, introduce new instruments, reduce dependence participant uncollateralised exposures, facilitate price discovery short-end upgrade payment system infrastructure. accordingly, reserve bank’s strategy focus develop pure call/ notice money market, institute full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility(laf), develop infrastructure, promote transparency, various measure pertain instrument non-bank participants. the follow important development pertain money market: • with view transform call/ notice money market pure inter-bank market participation bank primary dealer (pds) only, phase exit non-banks call/notice money market start may 2001. with effect august 6, 2005, non-bank participant completely phase call money market. • several new financial instrument introduced. the traditional refinance support fix term replace full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (laf) introduce june 5, 2000 view modulate short-term liquidity diverse market conditions. • the development payment system infrastructure strengthen introduction negotiate deal system (nds) february 2002, formation clear corporation india ltd. (ccil) 2001, implementation real time gross settlement (rtgs) system march 2004 • measure also take make various money market instrument (such cds, cps, etc.) freely accessible non-bank participants. these measure intend improve depth well efficiency transparency operation money market. • a part development new instruments, major initiative pertain collateralised borrow lend obligation (cblo), operationalised money market instrument ccil january 20, 2003. with view develop market cblo, reserve bank allow certain exemption form crr relaxation. v. interaction forex, government security money market the far-reaching financial sector reform also facilitate india’s movement open economy framework interaction forex, government security money market become quite important. the open economy bring gain term inflow foreign investments, contribute growth employment. however, gain also pose new challenge manage macroeconomy amidst large volatile capital flows. this implication monetary management. we address challenge appropriate monetary-fiscal coordination. suitable change make laf scheme ms introduce address endure portion liquidity overhang. in view grow integration market across borders, imperative domino effect minimise refine upgrade financial infrastructure vital components, account standards, include income recognition provision norms, disclosure standard insolvency laws. this upgradation attain conformity international best practices. in regard, reserve bank strengthen consultative process major policy step transparent manner involve market participant experts. vii. conclude observation the reform successful bring significant improvement various financial market segment improve depth, liquidity efficiency. the money market reasonably develop wide array instruments. the character government security market change captive market broad-based, deep liquid market enable reserve bank pursue monetary policy market-based instruments. various reform measure result sharp growth foreign exchange market. reform also successful create sustain orderly condition market. these factor lead increase inter-linkages across financial institution markets. in recent period, various segment financial market india have, large, exhibit stability. rbi endeavour provide enable environment healthy development financial markets. the enable environment also encompass harmonization reform financial sector real sector. large gap exist demand supply infrastructure service transport, electricity, port etc. it need emphasize sound macroeconomic policy competitive domestic sector improve capacity economy absorb high capital inflows, reduce cost capital, translate external flow high investment level provide cushion unexpected shock liberalize external markets. with progressive financial sector reforms, various segment financial market, include forex, money g-sec markets, make tremendous strides. while come long way control regime yester years, believe follow gradualist approach open up. a calibrate approach towards financial sector liberalization hallmark financial sector reform process pay rich dividend economy insulate vagary international capital flow contagion effect various crisis face emerge market economy 1990s. let conclude thank association give opportunity. i sure deliberation conference quite useful i wish conference success. thank you. this bi review available bi website www.bis.org. susan schmidt bies: basel ii development unite state remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, institute international bankers, washington dc, 26 september 2005. * * * i would like thank institute international banker opportunity offer remark today. i honor panel esteem colleagues. my remark touch late development basel ii capital revisions, include u.s. implementation process progress home-host issues. background a know, seventh year work basel ii, still several year away full implementation. some might bemoan long formative period, must remember international undertake magnitude take substantial time complete. part reason long gestation period purposely transparent proposals, take substantial time listen industry public comments, work diligently make framework good response comments. in addition, international agreement certain "common denominator" find accommodate variety bank financial system involved. from perspective federal reserve, consider work well worth it, give objectives. a know, unite state decide implement advance approach basel ii make mandatory largest, internationally-active banks. we move along parallel path amend current basel i rule vast majority u.s. financial institutions. broadly speaking, develop basel ii strive establish high standard internal risk management complex bank organizations, include capital adequacy, improve supervisors' public's understand banks' risk take risk management. indeed, one main reason start basel ii path good align regulatory capital bank actually practice manage risk level risk exposures. over past two decades, major bank organization become ever large complex; national bank system look quite different nearly two decade ago basel i developed. market change increase sophistication risk-management technique require update initial basel framework, apply large institutions. a fundamental premise basel ii that, major banks, neither supervisory market discipline effective unless banks' system rely upon measure manage risk take capital adequacy. one sometimes hear advance approach basel ii "too complex" anyone understand, mathematical formula various draft framework look like foreign language readers. but remember complexity basel ii reflect today's sophisticate risk-management practice employ advance quantitative methods. most room understand mathematics statistic integral part manage businesses. thus, sensible implement framework large institution line banker doing. and since practice change rapidly, necessary flexibility incorporate new good practice without conduct fundamental restructuring. i believe framework provide useful credible basis improve risk-management practice today allow future improvements. we consider vitally important bank remain highly dynamic industry. supervisor especially attentive change 1/4 practice ensure basel ii inhibit adoption new bank practice financial instruments. basel ii development unite state you likely aware past several month u.s. bank agency conduct additional analysis result fourth quantitative impact study--known qis4. a interagency statement issue april 29 indicated, result qis4 widely disperse show large overall drop regulatory capital requirement qis4 population bank agency expected. the agencies' reaction qis4 results, take additional time understand react information provide banks, show seriously take basel ii implementation. this impetus decide delay notice propose rulemaking (npr) basel ii. analyze data use qis4 vitally important, ultimately success basel ii depend quality data model bank use implement framework. i would like point qis4 recent series assessment framework's potential impact. in conduct qis4, understand bank lack full information eventually expect them--one example lack precision downturn estimate lgd (loss give default). understandably, result le perfect. but commend banker extensive effort thank patience produce result less-than-perfect circumstances. in future, expect good assessment framework's impact u.s. bank fully implemented. and move forward process, expect additional information provide u.s. supervisors--through rulemaking guidance--would allow banker produce regulatory capital result accurate likely line expectations. one important find qis4, obviously, relate overall decline regulatory capital requirements. capital serf important backstop risk-taking need ensure adequate level capital produce basel ii framework. to frank, federal reserve would comfortable qualify bank base result qis4, basel ii apply today. but i note above, qis4 represent final version basel ii unite state realize bank data risk-management system require basel ii yet fully develop implement expect framework. to sure, time basel ii "goes live," banker would significantly information regard expectation robust default loss-severity data. bank also adhere qualification standard set supervisors. but give uncertainty still remain impact basel ii, important continue effectively use safeguard design basel ii process. a i mentioned, qis4 one series study conduct bank test methodology identify implementation issues. the process also require bank successfully complete four quarter run basel ii system parallel capital requirement basel i, qualify next stage. the current framework require bank demonstrate continue reliability process two years, floor minimum regulatory capital exist prevent unintended drop capital. the public comment process transparency implementation process would provide add check balances. i would also like emphasize market participant also expect play important role basel ii implemented. not supervisor expect evaluate information provide institutions. a basel ii roll out, banker would expect disclose institution stage implementation, institution ass manage risk, relevant information third party ascertain effectiveness bank's risk 2/4 management. pillar 3 market discipline, therefore, complement supervisory effort maintain adequate capital. so go here? the u.s. agency learn valuable information follow-up work pertain qis4 result summer. right still evaluate result follow-up work, discuss option respond findings, determine implementation process proceed unite states. obviously, understand industry others interest detail next step unite states, hope provide public communication sometime october. additionally, agency move forward advance notice propose rulemaking revision basel i rules, detail publicly available soon. we expect timeframe adopt revision current rule overlap basel ii proposals, industry review side-by-side. progress home-host issue with large group international banker attendance, i would remiss offer think home-host issue relate basel ii implementation. understandably, internationally active bank keenly interest cooperative arrangement among supervisor evaluate capital adequacy basel ii. several year ago, accord implementation group (aig) form subcommittee basel committee supervisor discus tactical issue associate cross-border supervision. most recently, cooperation representative core principle liaison group (non-group ten supervisors), joint work group establish consider enhance guideline information share among home host supervisors. this work group look clarify role responsibility home host supervisor well supervisory expectation bank regard communication head office foreign offices. the work group also hop address communication home host supervisor enterprise-wide risk model use assess capital adequacy host jurisdictions, well mechanism supervisor work together consistency avoid duplication. obviously, whatever guidance issue would supplement implementation plan qualification process become fully developed. i think also helpful remember number home-host issue pertain basel ii actually variation long-standing challenge face banker supervisor context cross-border banking. that is, many issue discussion necessarily new, make complicate framework. however, understand concern banker surround basel ii actually

governor bank canada, toronto cfa society, toronto, 22 september 2005. * * * i happy opportunity today follow speech i give toronto last december. in speech, i talk need canada improve financial system efficiency. today, i want focus remark regulation can, must, contribute important goal. when i talk efficient financial system, i mean system help allocate scarce economic resource productive uses. by make financial system efficient, help generate sustain economic growth prosperity. the bank canada contribute goal efficient financial system number ways. the bank's monetary policy aim keep inflation low, stable, predictable. by so, enhance canadians' confidence value money, thus reduce need people spend resource either anticipate cop inflation. we also contribute efficiency role overseer major payments, securities, foreign exchange clear settlement systems, provide liquidity time financial stress. by reduce risk safety stability financial system, increase certainty robustness system, thus support efficiency. our semi-annual financial system review promote awareness financial system issues, look development trend system, address issue affect safety, soundness, efficiency. a well, bank work actively market participant regulator develop promote efficient financial system. and conduct research help inform decision policy-makers term promote goal. today, i want talk policy-makers support efficiency get regulatory framework right. i start brief remark regulation general. i'll discus regulatory framework support financial system efficiency, best make sure framework effective one. i'll conclude look current issue financial system regulation various way bank involve them. how regulation promote financial system efficiency let start basic premise. for market economy operate efficiently achieve optimal allocation resources, need solid legal regulatory framework. basic legal concepts, property rights, rule law, honour contracts, must place order market force work generate wealth. once done, policy-makers number overlap motivation regulation. i'll spend much time today talk promotion efficiency. but regulator also act improve safety stability financial system, protect investor savers. let set three principle policy-makers apply decide regulation appropriate. first, regulation appropriate correct market failure or, put economic jargon, deal "externalities." the second principle regulation must effective. even market failure recognized, regulator act reasonable chance actually address failure question. the third principle 1/5 benefit particular regulation must great cost imposes. in try solve one problem, regulator must avoid cause even great problems. with principle mind, let describe three way regulator enhance efficiency financial system. the first promote competition domestic international markets. competition unleash force drive financial institution market become innovative efficient. that mean regulator "just get way." appropriate regulation enhance competition. for example, important goal competition bureau prevent firm unfairly restrict competition. canada become world leader promote competition financial market adopt many recommendation porter commission 1960s. at time policy-makers worldwide favour extensive government control economic activity, particularly within financial system, porter break new grind come strongly favour enhance efficiency promotion competition free markets. competition enhance expand scope give market. one way market institution compete country foreign enterprise compete markets. therefore, regulation need take international consideration development account. i'll say point minutes. for now, point i want stress competition lead great efficiency. a second way good financial system regulation promote efficiency work correct "information asymmetries" sometimes occur, lead market failure suboptimal allocation funds. most often, failure arise significant difference quantity quality relevant information available market participants. regulation design investor able adequately gauge risk potential return investment. to clear, i'm say goal regulation full disclosure information. rather, aim reduce information asymmetry point benefit disclosure still outweigh cost compliance. in way, regulation lead efficient financial system. the third way financial system regulation support efficiency promote overall financial stability, essentially mean limit systemic risk. the idea regulation support efficiency time promote stability may strike counterintuitive. but objective mutually exclusive. if regulation carry right way, enhance stability lead increase efficiency save resource would otherwise dedicate guard systemic risk. let elaborate. i note early bank's monetary policy support efficiency increase certainty future value money. this reduce need canadian spend resource activity intend protect inflation. similarly, enhance safety financial system reduce need canadian unnecessarily spend resource guard risk financial crisis. policy-makers likely successfully promote stability efficiency bring market player picture address particular issue. canada's large value transfer system (lvts) provide good example systemic risk mitigate efficient way. the lvts process canada's large-value time-critical payments. it give participant certainty payment processed, transaction settle day, regardless might late happen participants. this certainty enhance efficiency own. but, addition, design lvts minimize amount collateral institution need pledge system, compare gross settlement system use countries. this reduction collateral free resource put efficient us elsewhere. 2/5 build effective framework that's look three way sound regulatory framework improve efficiency financial system—by promote competition, reduce information asymmetry practical, reduce systemic risk. but goal improve efficiency, also important regulatory framework effective. what make framework effective? i would highlight three factors. first, regulation provide incentive encourage market reinforce reward right behaviour. these incentive sufficient motivate market participant without constant intervention regulator imposition detail rule dictate firm must done, must done. the right incentive help regulator achieve goal without impose process cost outweigh benefit regulation. second, achieve effective regulatory framework, need take international development account. country gain comparative advantage develop superior regulatory framework. for financial market institution internationally competitive, regulatory framework need be—and need see be—as good as, better, countries. but time, canadian rule application tailor domestic need reflect domestic realities. this tension domestic international consideration lead challenge canadian policy-makers. a case point sarbanes-oxley law. canadian policy-makers embrace general principle behind legislation term promote good governance financial practices. but extreme level detail application rules, well focus process instead outcomes, create cost many firm likely exceed benefit system. large canadian corporation want access u.s. capital market choice—they must follow spirit letter sarbanes-oxley. but canadian regulator right take made-in-canada approach accommodate need canadian issuer investors. let clear. the goal mimic u.s. regulations, despite market's size proximity. the principle behind regulation must good as, good than, countries. but must apply principle way develop comparative advantage firm markets. finally, importantly, effective regulatory framework one rule enforce perceive enforced. even coherent efficient regulatory framework effective unless followed. participant must appropriately monitored. and rule broken, offender must prosecuted, adequate penalty must strictly applied. a framework strong monitoring, prosecution, application penalty provide incentive firm follow rules, add framework's credibility. when everyone play rules—and everyone confident others incentive same—then market operate great efficiency. i've say regulation design enhance confidence support trust market institutions. let talk one issue example. canadian-listed firm sometimes low market valuation similar firm list unite states. why? bank canada research point concern governance possible cause. and one main concern appear perception canadian enforcement insider-trading law strong could be. we continue research good understand root perception. the key point improve effectiveness regulatory framework, investor must confidence treat fairly. to repeat: must have, perceive have, proper enforcement canada. 3/5 current issue financial system regulation that's look sound regulatory framework improve efficiency financial system. now let's turn current issues, number bank canada involvement in. the bank active term research commentary development aim improve efficiency. we work alongside private sector improve safety efficiency clearing, payment, settlement systems. for example, we've recently work various group make sure participant continue pursue robust business-continuity plans, especially system-wide perspective. by increase degree certainty critical system operational time disruption, development appropriate business-continuity plan improve overall efficiency financial system. with respect fixed-income markets, bank also play role help develop regulation regard transparency alternative trade systems. we promote innovation electronic trade systems, provide opportunity reduce transaction cost increase transparency appropriate levels. this increase liquidity lead better-functioning markets. and research, commentary, and, cases, direct involvement, contribute design rule code conduct improve function fixed-income foreign exchange markets. of course, one ongoing issue financial system question consolidation among financial institutions. in speech toronto last december, i note canada face difficult policy challenge try keep country enthusiastically adopt competition-based regulatory philosophy espouse porter commission. we need strive policy framework continue provide incentive innovation efficiency encourage competition. at time, need consider allow financial institution scope improve efficiency economy scale. recent research bank canada examine economy scale bank conclude could untapped efficiency gain canadian financial institutions. the benefit efficiency gain could flow across economy, lower-cost business retail lending. but relevant public policy question well, include foreign ownership concern concentration market power among players. strike balance interest simple task. but term competition, keep mind level competition maintain enhance new entrant marketplace threat new entrants. another issue hotly debate relate ideal structure security regulator canada. what i say issue last year remain true today. efficiency dictate canada uniform security law regulation base principle apply everyone. but question apply rule tiered way take account differ need issuers. for example, one tier could apply large, complex firm want access international capital markets. rule firm would similar apply new york london. at end spectrum, another tier could apply small, speculative resource firm historically rely canadian equity market financing. a third tier middle could apply bulk canadian "mid-cap" firms, choose access canadian capital markets, often small le complex u.s. "mid-cap" firms. these different tier firm exist major provincial jurisdictions. and investor every jurisdiction similar needs. so key point that, application rule need take account size complexity firms, need different rule apply base province territory issuer investor. 4/5 conclusion in closing, let say i hope find comment topical. many important decision regulatory framework currently considered, profoundly affect canadian economy. in make decisions, important policy-makers keep mind goal efficiency. they support goal promote competition, correct market imperfection practical, promote financial stability reduce systemic risk. but even important remember goal efficiency must followed. ultimately, policy-makers must strive provide best possible environment achieve optimal allocation economic resources. this policy-makers regulator financial system best serve public contribute sustainable economic growth prosperity canada. 5/5 alan greenspan: mortgage bank remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, american banker association annual convention, palm desert, california (via satellite), 26 september 2005. * * * in week month ahead, federal reserve continue closely follow consequence recent devastate event gulf coast region order ass implication economy. however, well aware broad economic impact part human misery leave wake events. in remark today, i plan, addition, focus one key factor drive u.s. economy recent years: sharp rise house valuation associate build-up mortgage debt. over past decade, market value stock owner-occupied homes1 rise annually approximately 9 percent average, $8 trillion end 1995 $18 trillion end june year. home mortgage debt link structure rise somewhat fast rate. this enormous increase house value mortgage debt spur decline mortgage interest rates, remain historically low. indeed, thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage, currently around 5-3/4 percent, 1/2 percentage point level late spring 2004, federal open market committee (fomc) embark current cycle policy tightening. this decline mortgage rate long-term interest rate context concurrent rise federal fund rate without precedent recent u.s. experience. some decade-long decline ascribe expectation low inflation, reduce risk premium result le inflation volatility, small real term premium seem due moderation business cycle past decades. besides factors, worldwide trend reduction long-term yield presumably reflect excess intend save intend investment. since mid-1990s, worldwide save boost significant increase share world output produce economy persistently above-average saving--predominantly emerge economy asia. this impetus save supplement shift income toward oil-exporting countries, recently build surplus steep increase oil prices. softness intend investment, however, also part story. in unite states, example, capital expenditure restrain time relative substantial level corporate cash flow. that development likely reflect business caution apparent wake stock market decline corporate scandal early decade. in similar fashion, japanese investment exhibit prolong restraint follow burst japan's speculative bubble early 1990s, investment emerge asia, exclude china, fell appreciably asian financial crisis late 1990s. the economic force drive global saving-investment balance become manifest past decade, steepness recent decline long-term yield suggest something may work past year. accord 1 include second home rented, vacant home sale, vacant land. 1/5 estimate prepare staff federal reserve board, significant portion recent decline appear result fall term premiums. such estimate subject considerable uncertainty; nevertheless, suggest perceive increase economic stability recent year encourage risk-takers reach more-distant time horizons. regardless precise mix factor explain decline interest rates, associate run-up house value leave household substantial pool available home equity. accord data recently develop jim kennedy federal reserve board staff, me, discretionary extraction home equity account four-fifths rise home mortgage debt.2 our data split home equity extraction net close costs, hence debt increase exist homes, extraction three sources: (1) associate home turnover--that is, mortgage origination buyer exist home le associate debt cancellation sellers, (2) refinance cash-outs, (3) increase home equity loans. the size equity extraction owe turnover closely parallel presumably finance realize capital gain homes, whereas cash-outs home equity loan generally extract as-yet-unrealized capital gains. what share finance capital gain spend consumer good services, thereby reduce save rate, uncertain.3 survey data suggest approximately fourth third value home equity loan cash-outs finance personal consumption expenditure directly.44 another fourth fund repayment nonmortgage debt used, effect, bridge financing, predominantly personal consumption expenditures.5 home mortgage debt thus final source fund consumer outlay originally finance extension credit card consumer debt. although comparable survey disposition equity extract seller home beyond amount apply payment subsequent home purchase outright cash purchases, plausibly would exhibit similar propensities. if indeed case, imply increase past decade consumption expenditure finance home equity extraction, rather income assets, would account much decline personal save rate since 1995. 2 we define discretionary extraction change mortgage debt (excluding construction loans), plus scheduled, i.e., nondiscretionary, debt amortization minus mortgage debt origination finance newly build homes. see alan greenspan jam kennedy (2005), "estimates home mortgage originations, repayments, debt one-to-four-family residences, " finance economic discussion series 2005-41 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, september). 3 because personal save rate measure relative personal disposable income, purchase finance proceed capital gain increase personal consumption expenditure income, therefore measure save rate decline. the reason exclude capital gain income, hence saving, book save finance capital investment, key requirement structure national accounts. capital gain add gross domestic product (gdp). 4 survey report approximately third mortgage extraction spend "home improvements," part home repair, personal consumption expenditure. 5 the survey result cite report glenn b. canner, karen dynan, wayne passmore, "mortgage refinance 2001 early 2002," federal reserve bulletin, vol. 88 (december 2002), pp. 469-81, peter j. brady, glenn b. canner, dean m. maki, "the effect recent mortgage refinancing," federal reserve bulletin, vol. 86 (july 2000), pp. 441-50, glenn b. canner, thomas a. durkin, charles a. luckett, "recent development home equity lending," federal reserve bulletin, vol. 84 (april 1998), pp. 241-251. it possible trace part equity extraction initially purchase certificate deposit, stocks, bonds, asset late liquidate finance personal consumption expenditures. survey data usually request disposition loan proceed limit period year. we make assumption share loan proceed fix past decade. 2/5 however, significantly different approach separate proportion consumer spend finance income finance wealth, though one similarly robust, conclude decline save rate past decade explain decline interest rate increase overall household wealth. that wealth, however, include nonhousing wealth, importantly stock market wealth. thus, two approaches, would seem capable explain much decline personal save rate. of course, cannot true, were, would explain great drop personal save actually occurred. obviously, issue remain area active research interest. nonetheless, difficult dismiss conclusion significant amount consumption drive capital gain combination stock residences, latter finance predominantly home equity extraction. if so, leave aside effect equity price consumption, mortgage interest rate rise home affordability stretched, home turnover mortgage refinance cash-outs would decline would equity extraction and, presumably, consumption expenditure growth. the personal save rate, accordingly, would rise. carry hypothesis further, import consumer good would surely decline would import intermediate product support them. and one would assume u.s. trade current account deficit would shrink well, else equal. how significant disruptive adjustment turn open question. nonetheless, i point previous commentary, economic effect will, large extent, depend flexibility inherent economy. in highly flexible economy, unite states, shock largely absorb change prices, interest rates, exchange rates, rather wrench decline output employment, likely outcome le flexible economy. * * * to judge size hypothetical decline home turnover cash-outs, need examine closely composition sale home possible future path home prices. although comprehensive data split sale owner-occupants purchaser second homes, especially investors, enough data available draw conclusions, however tentative. a i note earlier, little doubt exceptionally low level home mortgage interest rate major driver recent surge homebuilding home turnover steep climb home prices. indeed, home price rise sharply many country around world. in unite states, sign froth clearly emerge local market home price seem rise unsustainable levels. it still early judge whether froth become evident widen geographic scale, whether recent indication ease speculative pressure signal onset moderate trend. the house market unite state quite heterogeneous, facilitate easy diffusion local excesses. instead, collection local market loosely connect factor mortgage interest rate and, long term, migration construction capacity. a consequence, behavior home price vary widely across nation. speculation home also largely local, especially owner-occupied residences. for homeowner realize accumulate capital gain residence--a precondition speculative market--they must move. another formidable barrier speculative activity home sale involve significant commissions, taxes, points, fees, average 3/5 neighborhood 9 percent sale price. where sale owner-occupants predominate, speculative turnover home difficult. but recent years, pace turnover exist home quickened. apparently, substantial part acceleration turnover reflect purchase second homes--mainly investment vacation purposes. accord data collect home mortgage disclosure act (hmda), mortgage origination second-home purchase rise 7 percent total purchase origination 2000 twice end last year. anecdotal evidence suggest share may currently even higher. because payment second home appear larger, average, home buy owner occupancy, large share second home appear pay wholly cash, second home presumably represent large fraction total purchase loan originations, arguably historically unprecedented levels. transaction second homes, course, restrain degree sale primary residences--an individual sell without move. this suggest speculative activity may great role generate recent price increase customarily past. * * * the apparent froth house market may spill mortgage markets. the dramatic increase prevalence interest-only loans, well introduction other, more-exotic form adjustable-rate mortgages, development bear close scrutiny. to sure, finance vehicle appropriate uses. but extent household may employ instrument purchase home would otherwise unaffordable, use add pressure marketplace. over past years, great deal attention focus grow range loan choice available mortgage borrowers. the menu, know, feature long list novel mortgage products, interest-only mortgage also mortgage forty-year amortization schedule option arms, allow limit amount negative amortization. these product could cause concern expose borrower interest-rate house-price risk standard thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgage see vehicle enable marginally qualified, highly leverage borrower purchase home inflate prices. in event widespread cool house prices, borrowers, institution service them, could expose significant losses. although aggregate loan-to-value ratio (ltv) single-family residences, condominium cooperative flat since early 2003, flatness could mask increase number highly leverage home purchasers. use data individual mortgage loan information, member board staff estimate distribution remain mortgage principal current home value large set u.s. households. the loan factor calculation include first mortgage lien type second liens. the result show that, mid-2005, le 5 percent borrower current ltvs exceed 90 percent. in large part, share small recent growth house price rapidly push effective ltv many homeowners. only recent, highly leveraged, home purchaser high ltvs. highly leverage home purchaser tend use so-called piggyback mortgages; is, second lien originate time purchase. these loan popular, significant part, avoid non-deductible private mortgage insurance payment require larger, single loans. if piggyback loan common state house price appreciation particularly rapid past five years, one might worry homebuyers especially expose reversal house prices. however, data collect 4/5 2004, first year coverage hmda, show use piggyback loan particularly correlate strong appreciation prices. among mortgage track hmda, piggyback loan use particularly high texas, california, utah, oregon, colorado. the presence california list probably surprise, home price four state grow particularly rapidly. of course, hmda data track mortgage make institution open-ended loan home equity line credit (helocs). anecdotal report suggest homebuyers use helocs piggyback mortgages, probably full account mortgage debt. nonetheless, combine newly available data piggyback hmda information, construct reasonably comprehensive measure degree leverage mortgage use purchase homes, state, 2004. these estimate ltvs high state experience relatively little house price appreciation, low state price appreciate most, california massachusetts. the main reason negative relationship likely people buy home california probably also sell home california use least part accumulate home equity capital gain payment new house. apparently, many household forgo consumption low new mortgage balances. in summary, encourage find that, despite rapid growth mortgage debt, small fraction household across country loan-to-value ratio great 90 percent. thus, vast majority homeowner sizable equity cushion absorb potential decline house prices. in addition, ltvs recent homebuyers appear low state experience explosive run-up house price that, conceivably, could risk large price reversal. that said, situation clearly require ongoing scrutiny period ahead, l adverse trend emerge. 5/5 mark w olson: business trend management challenge bank industryremarks mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual economic outlook conference, middle tennessee state university, murfreesboro, tennessee, 16 september 2005. * * * good morning. when i decide week ago focus remark challenge face bank industry, i could imagine challenge gulf coast financial institution customer would face devastate aftermath hurricane katrina. so, i turn plan topic discuss bank bank supervision generally, i'd like spend moment review effort federal reserve, conjunction financial institution regulators, maintain restore vital financial service people gulf coast--including remain region force storm relocate outside region. first, however, i want express heartfelt sympathy individual family suffer greatly past week acknowledge brave effort many individual save lives, help sick displaced, restore public order. at federal reserve's new orleans branch, essential employee stay office keep secure despite rise flood water limit contact outside world. in end, office barely escape flooding, continue help staff member whose life totally disrupted. a yesterday, one branch's 176 employee account for. we much hope individual locate soon. the federal reserve bank atlanta parent bank new orleans branch. i want commend bank's staff hard work try time. the senior leadership atlanta take number important step work banks, thrifts, credit union effort ease, possible, burden institution customers. for example, aftermath hurricane disasters, simple provision cash federal reserve bank bank customer become critical. the federal reserve bank atlanta federal reserve office quickly adjust operation cash service normally supply new orleans office could provide feed office surround disaster area. to ensure bank get cash service needed, office remain open labor day weekend last weekend. they open come weekend. also, follow 9/11 attacks, federal reserve assist depository institution priority restoration telephone service cooperation department homeland security. check clear disrupt throughout area affect katrina, yet check write individual seek shelter necessities--and need access funds. a relief recovery effort began, restoration check clear become increasingly important. we quickly shift check process normally handle new orleans office atlanta. we also work bank industry immediate aftermath katrina many issue affect individual institutions. to help ease check-clearing burden, start week september 5, begin give credit check deposit bank new orleans branch territory check still process normally new orleans. we also return check unable present severely affect institutions. instead hold check work closely institutions' primary supervisor determine could restart operational contact. 1/6 the federal reserve bank atlanta also remind depository institution serf that, usual, discount window available assist meet liquidity needs. we contact many depository institution affect area carefully monitor situation. at time, see evidence significant fund difficulty problem balance-sheet management. in washington, work closely regulatory agency encourage financial institution consider reasonable prudent step ease burden customer deeply affect katrina. at point, bank industry whole show resilience flexibility response challenge situation. while challenge mean passed, bank appear take appropriate action provide customer access much-needed cash bank services. meantime, federal reserve's community affair staff work clearinghouse information available disaster relief consumer protections. the federal reserve bank atlanta also stand ready assist community organization financial institution directly affect hurricane, provide information contact resource address need displace families. so, mindful think attention continually draw back plight katrina's victims, let turn plan topic--banking unite states. the bank industry important subject economic analysis, one probably get le attention should. include bank industry economic analysis valuable major economic financial development become manifest bank balance sheet business performance. one possible reason bank get attention today bank system strong, healthy, vibrant, condition least partially reflect nation's economic well-being. when bank industry experience serious problems--as time time u.s. history--the economy tend suffer well. this connection economic health bank system, know, persuade congress assign federal reserve important role supervise safety soundness bank organizations, well responsibility discount window. my remark today address unique aspect bank system evolution, special role play community bank system, bank supervisory issue relate current economic context. a unique evolve bank system the start point discussion importance u.s. bank system recognize system unique relation bank system countries. the structure regulatory framework u.s. system complex, develop many decades. reflect decentralize nature economy vast geographic expanse country, historically large number banks, small. initially, charter supervision bank large small purview state governments. follow civil war, national bank charter authorize national bank act, set place call dual bank system. over ensue decades, regulatory structure bank shape financial crises, include great depression; creation national deposit insurance system; forces. more recently, technological advances, along increasingly rapid evolution financial product markets, drive many marketplace change result dynamic business environment create opportunity significant challenge bank regulators. the visible change u.s. bank industry past quarter-century dramatic consolidation among banks. there 7,600 commercial bank unite state today--quite reduction approximately 13,000 bank operate 1980. reflect banks' effort operate efficiently improve market 2/6 penetration, merger acquisition main instrument bank use consolidate. in addition, consolidation take place intra-company combination separate subsidiary charter within large bank hold companies. bank failure also play role bank consolidations, failure relatively rare since mid-1990s. along consolidation, current generation banker witness competitive change blur once-clear boundary around market different financial service products. new feature add traditional products, feature often allow direct competition among different type financial service providers. new product capabilities--frequently link development capital markets--emerged challenge banks' traditional role financial intermediation create risk management diversification opportunities. a product line business become le distinct across industries, bank naturally develop great interest own security insurance firms, vice versa. legal regulatory change followed, recognition new market realities. the riegle-neal act eliminate barrier growth across state lines. later, gramm-leach-bliley act repeal major part glass-steagall act, remove obstacle expansion across financial service firms. despite dramatic change market financial service product regulatory framework, bank system continue operate well--indeed, thriving. commercial bank earn $106.6 billion 2004, second year profit exceed $100 billion. the first year 2003. with earnings, commercial bank deliver aggregate return common equity 14.22 percent 1.34 percent return assets. over first half 2005, industry profit already reach nearly $57 billion, rate return little record 2004. demonstrate breadth strong earn across industry, 5.7 percent commercial bank report net loss 2004. robust growth loan deposit contribute banks' strong profits, strong fee income, include mortgage origination service revenues. now let say word two factor support improvement banks' earnings: asset quality operate efficiency. asset quality extremely strong, large part favorable economic conditions. these condition tangible effect profits, allow bank set aside le earn future credit losses. thus, banks' provision loan loss 0.25 percent asset first half 2005, well 0.70 percent 2002. net chargeoffs far 2005 amount le 0.50 percent loans, really remarkably low figure. return present, problem asset end june 2005 also low, 0.56 percent loans, peak 1.23 percent 2002. operate efficiency also improve contribute strong profits. consolidation bank investment new technology partially responsible improve efficiency. i like use productivity measure bank call efficiency ratio, measure proportion total revenue eat overhead costs. this ratio show bank achieve significant reduction cost structure. the aggregate efficiency ratio commercial bank 2004 61.7 percent, mean bank need spend roughly 62 cent generate dollar revenue. that full-year 2004 ratio fully 3.5 percentage point low ten year ago 1994. community bank today although number bank unite state decline dramatically, general proposition still commercial bank develop countries. the large number bank country neither accident vestige time 3/6 telephone internet allow business overcome geographic distances. new reason emerge large number institution demarcation large institutions--with well-integrated regional, national, global operations--and small locally orient institution i call community banks. in new setting, community bank differentiate focus specific need local market provide high level service attention customer markets. community banks, is, bank asset $1 billion less, continue quite successful. these bank generate combine earn $13.4 billion 2004, translate attractive return common equity 11.72 percent return average asset 1.21 percent. thus far 2005, profitability bite ahead pace, return equity first half 2005 roughly 50 basis point high period 2004. in second quarter, return equity reach 12.26 percent versus 11.80 percent year-earlier period, first-quarter 2005 return equity 12.33 percent compare 11.81 quarter 2004. seasonality significant factor community banks. on first review, would logical conclude community banks' earn profitability figure bank le profitable large institution thus competitively disadvantaged. indeed, large banks--those $10 billion assets--generate high rate profitability, return average equity 15 percent range. this difference profitability make economic market sense, number reasons: community bank subject le earn volatility large banks. competitive condition source earn community bank also differ large banks. for example, aggregate, community bank historically pay 10 20 basis point industry whole save money market deposits, demonstrate interest attract retain core deposits. further, underlie business paradigm community bank quite different large institutions. many community bank family owned, many closely held, mean minimal pressure quarterly earn performance. comparison community large bank naturally raise broad question small bank compete successfully large banks. to answer question, one need stratify bank basis profitability. this stratification reveal that, nearly every area bank performance, financial result best-performing community bank match well result big banks--most notably area efficiency. one might expect large bank operate efficiently scale operations. and 2004, community bank whole report overall efficiency ratio 65 percent, much le favorable 58 percent figure large banks. yet surprisingly, top-performing community bank outperform large banks, deliver efficiency ratio 56.6 percent. another key strength top-performing community bank capital. the top one-fifth community banks, term profitability, hold capital 40 50 percent great industry average. the top quintile's leverage ratio 11.10 percent 2004, compare 7.99 percent banks, 38.9 percent high industry average. when compare large-bank ratio 7.41 percent, top-performing community bank capital ratio 49.8 percent higher. the effect consolidation evident community bank large bank organizations. comparative number show 7,300 community banks, compare 11,000 twenty year ago. many different factor contribute consolidation, i mention earlier. critically, reduction number community bank misinterpret signal bank charter somehow become le attractive--far it. let's look past five years. it true june 2005 1,033 few commercial bank end 1999. that decline, however, really interest part story. over 4/6 period, accord fdic, 718 new commercial bank charter granted. do little arithmetic, figure suggest every five time one bank acquire another bank, somewhere two new charter issued. moreover, new charter bring $5.7 billion new capital bank industry. both number new charter magnitude new capital injection eloquent testament attractiveness vibrancy bank franchise. issue interest supervisor overall, bank industry healthy. however, issue warrant attention banker supervisors. one credit risk management issue news quite bite lately home mortgage lending, particularly surge origination nontraditional mortgages, interest-only loans, payment-option loans, various hybrid form adjustable-rate loans. these type mortgage typically involve low monthly payment borrower. they sometimes call "affordability products" low payment make possible household qualify higher-priced home could afford use traditional thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages. the credit risk concern is, course, household stretch qualify loan severely challenge if, example, interest rate rise, cause adjustable rate hybrid loan reset much high rate. another concern despite low monthly payment, household eventually repay refinance principal loans, whether current home price sustained. this prospect especially trouble price payment structure mortgage lead negative amortization loan balance. federal reserve review indicate banks' hold unconventional mortgage loans, still small, rise significantly 2005. therefore, banks' risk management procedure must take account unique characteristic credit risk profile novel type loans, especially experience quite limited. move one last credit risk management issue: community bank loan finance real estate construction rise 7.4 percent second quarter. this increase continue remarkable trend commercial real estate--or cre--lending account virtually asset growth community banks. in 2001 2002, growth cre loan whole account two-thirds overall asset growth community banks. in 2003 2004, cre lend represent essentially asset growth. over first half 2005, cre loan expand twice much, dollar terms, total assets. the continue rapid growth cre lend accompany decline security holdings, home equity loans, consumer loans. this pattern sustain one-dimensional asset growth naturally raise question potential concentration credit risk cre loans. these question strike market commercial vacancy rate particularly high, competition among lender intense, potentially overheat home-price condition contribute sharp expansion new-home construction. there still indication credit quality loan begin deteriorate, potential concentration lend exposure remain ongoing area supervisory attention. interest-rate-risk management always key issue financial institutions, particularly current economic policy environment. although many large institution felt earn pressure flatten yield curve, net interest margin community bank 4.12 percent 2004--40 basis point high industry whole. the gap even wide 2005. a look community banks' balance sheet manage tell u lot community banks' margin fare better. the sharp growth construction lending, predominantly variable rate, one element allow community bank loan yield keep fund costs. community bank also reduce hold security past year, shorten maturity 5/6 remain holdings. a june, 15.8 percent commercial bank asset maturity beyond five years, compare 16.9 percent year-end 2004 peak level 18.5 percent year earlier. at time, community bank increase proportion time deposit maturity beyond one year, allow bank lock then-current rate rising. in response credit- interest-rate risk management issue i've discussed, federal reserve regulator have, course, concentrate evaluate banks' risk management capability. but agency also pay significant attention broad corporate governance issues, include internal control internal audit. corporate governance effective risk management. corporate governance framework different constituency within institution--owners, management, staff--interact make sure action take best interest corporation shareholders. the rule governance establish company determine presence effectiveness internal controls, well incentive behavior within organization. the choice bank make establish risk management corporate governance system important ramification institution well-being, regulators. these system affect institution function others perceive marketplace. bank whose governance system weak risk episode fraud control failure draw adverse reaction customer financial markets. conclusion a healthy vibrant bank system important element well-functioning economy. the unique structure regulatory framework u.s. bank industry significantly shape history market forces. a excellent condition u.s. commercial bank suggests, framework continue strike right balance durability adaptability. one key element balance that, despite ever-shrinking world emergence mega-financial institutions, community bank continue experience financial success attract real capital marketplace. in generally positive setting, issue keen interest supervisor remain. bank size benefit recent economic conditions, experience historically strong asset quality, benefit growth household wealth liquidity, surge demand financial products. at time, condition present community bank large institution important credit- market- risk management issues, well broad corporate governance issues. 6/6 kazumasa iwata: the role price stability anchor extricate japan deflation summary speech give mr kazumasa iwata, deputy governor bank japan, panel discussion “monetary policy strategies: a central bank panel”, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, wyoming, 27 august 2005. * * * introduction i would like talk issue relate monetary policy strategy future, light japan's experience last decade stagnation well deflation, subsequent struggle overcome deflation zero bind nominal interest rate. after pause growth trigger burst mini-bubble digital electronics sector spring 2004, japan resume growth exceed potential growth rate, rate change consumer price index, exclude institutional special factor oil, telephone charges, rice fresh food, register virtually zero recent months.1 currently good prospect exit decade-long period deflation. in context, i would like draw lesson previous policy development future conduct monetary policy, focus role price stability anchor. the quantitative ease policy price stability anchor japan apparently view country adopt inflation target policy. yet personal view japan implement implicitly price stability target within framework current quantitative ease policy (bank reserve target policy) introduce march 2001. this primarily strict observance commitment policy duration secure price stability. the precede "zero interest rate policy" period february 1999 august 2000 fail bear fruit, part due weak commitment policy duration. in contrast, quantitative ease policy, bank japan clarify strengthen commitment duration policy present october 2003 three condition end policy. the three condition summarize phrase "stably zero core consumer price index year-to-year basis" "never return deflation." this commitment send signal market bank japan find important secure price stability achieve positive inflation rates, although numerical upper limit announced.2 it serf anchor price stability prevent deflationary spiral condition zero bind nominal interest rate. 1 japan's economy resume recovery process pause growth trigger it sector-related inventory stock adjustment. the burst mini-bubble digital electronics sector associate downward cyclical phase liquid crystal silicon cycle initiate spring 2004. subsequently, non-it sector-related inventory stock adjustment due deceleration exports, notably china, curtail industrial production activity growth rate. currently, inventory stock adjustment process almost over. in addition, domestic private final demand first half 2005 sufficiently strong register growth potential growth rate (about 1 percent). 2 on lack upper limit, similarity lack low limit numerical definition price stability 2 percent initial stage monetary operation european central bank. 1/5 price level indeterminacy zero bind nominal interest rate under bank japan's quantitative ease policy, uncollateralized overnight call rate also rate long maturity least one year virtually reach zero. it well know monetary policy aim fix market interest rate face difficulty control money supply inflation rate. the difficulty augment zero interest rates, association money supply price level become much loose normal. therefore, important central bank provide price stability anchor market.3moreover, zero bind nominal interest rate erode market mechanism financial market well market discipline, thereby distort allocation fund market. in past several months, encounter difficulty achieve bank reserve target due undersubscription offer open market operations, allow temporary deviation low limit reserve target early june, end-july, early august. the intention maintain bank reserve target face diminish demand excess reserve banks. in words, measure design solve trade-off strict implementation commitment flexibility. it may note additional flotation government bond frontload rollover exist government bond concentrate fiscal 2008 make difficult maintain reserve target.4bank england governor mervyn king (2004) point importance debt management policy, namely, shorten maturity structure government debt, japan's exit deflation. the cash management government sector also seem relevant facilitate efficient implementation monetary policy. at rate, best preempt emergence zero bind nominal interest rate, even though room remain central bank affect expect future path short-term rate implement commitment policy duration long usual. however, strict implementation commitment tend limit flexibility conduct monetary policy. effect quantitative ease policy interest rate a number proposal make overcome japan's deflation. one recommend widen application zero interest rate long maturity deflation disappears. in process raise bank reserve target, extent zero interest rate widen cover least one year. this effect arise due commitment maintain ultra-expansionary policy long anticipate market participant normal circumstances. we name "policy duration effect." the increase bank reserve target seem exert signal effect solidify commitment thus strengthen policy duration effect, aside ample liquidity the ecb redefine price stability add low limit 1 percent, yet final goal set close 2 percent. 3 it may note japan market interest rate zero, contrast assumption adopt several theoretical models. 4 the amount government deposit government surplus bank japan account 35 trillion yen, part due frontloading rollover exist government bond increase tax revenue. inefficient cash management arise rigid account rule result significant revenue loss. moreover, fluctuation budgetary fund japan quite large, compare major countries. this tend limit capability implement ultra-easy policy. 2/5 provision avoid systemic risk deflationary spiral. both effect work support recovery prompt restructure process debtor company strain balance-sheet adjustment, maintain low interest rates. the price stability anchor implicit commitment specify term time frame, highly data-dependent, define achievement positive inflation rates. market participants, appear skeptical scenario register 0.3 percent rise core cpi fiscal 2006, seem anticipate likely end current policy regime within one year, observe euroyen future market interest rates. this lead pickup interest rate wide range maturities. in sense market inform u exit coming. president san francisco federal reserve janet yellen ask deflation subside despite existence output gap. my answer was, "it speed limit effect." the narrow output gap bring lengthy sustain recovery phase 2002. it may noteworthy effect speed limit (narrowing output gap) dominate effect level output gap deceleration deflation.5 now reach stage say long time need satisfy condition end quantitative ease policy. dynamic price stability target policy to extent combination provision price stability anchor monetary ease policy base clear commitment succeed bring japan's economy virtually zero inflation rate, compare deflation core cpi 1 percent 2001, seem reasonable maintain key element underlie quantitative ease policy framework succeed stages. about two year ago, i describe step-by-step approach attain ultimate price stability "dynamic price stability target policy" extricate japan deflation, contrast "timeless perspective" price level target policy. i identify three phase dynamic adjustment process move deflationary equilibrium normal equilibrium, thereby avoid over- undershoot inflation rate long-term interest rate, notably transition period. recently, former federal reserve governor laurence meyer (2005) present three-step strategy future japan's monetary policy. he identify three phases: namely, quantitative ease policy, zero interest rate policy, interest rate policy. in between, two transitional phases: one dismantle bank reserve target require reserve level (about 6 trillion yen), shrinkage zero interest rate uncollateralized overnight call rate. another raise short-term interest rate neutral level achieve price stability long term. i personally find desirable provide appropriate anchor price stability numerical form embark new policy regime return zero interest rate policy. it seem necessary retain transparent commitment policy duration order prevent abrupt change long-term interest rate transition process reach new 5 in japan, output goal explicitly state newly establish bank japan law 1997, contrast case unite states, dual mandate maximum employment price stability prescribe federal reserve act. yet absolutely necessary pay due attention movement output gap, notably size narrow deflationary gap. in process overcome deflation, output goal may serious conflict goal price stability. 3/5 equilibrium, risk entail inflation (overshooting) deflation (undershooting) preempted.6dynamic price stability target policy timeless perspective policy the dynamic price stability target policy "strategically coherent" (to borrow phrase professor bennett mccallum [2005]) attain final price stability, "timeless perspective policy" put emphasis time consistency monetary policy.7 the price level target policy recommend achieve prescribe path price level constant rate inflation, regardless initial conditions. yet seem difficult accept temporary overshoot inflation rate long-term interest rate transition path return desire price level path persistent deflation, particular circumstance large-scale accumulation government debt persistent budget deficit japan. however, recognize importance "history dependence" conduct monetary policy. in context, i would like stress maintain reserve target level current stage imply increase degree monetary easing, since excess supply bank reserve intensify maturity short-term monetary operation instrument lengthened, result extension zero interest rate market. moreover, accord several surveys, expect inflation rate turn positive recent periods. this imply short-term real interest rate negative despite zero bind nominal interest rates. if core message "history dependence" imply monetary policy effect become expansionary point close exit, bank japan's current policy line spirit inherent price level target policy. the role fiscal policy let conclude remark refer role fiscal policy extricate japan deflation. we observe government announce fiscal policy target achieve primary budget deficit zero ten years, automatic stabilizer effect dominate fiscal policy management 2001 koizumi administration. the coordination monetary fiscal policy become important, economy fall deflationary equilibrium (or friedmanian equilibrium), size deflation rate equal natural interest rate. on fiscal policy, identify two different types; namely, ricardian non-ricardian. if present value government debt future become zero regardless change path prices, classify ricardian policy. 6 this imply safety margin final numerical objective (aside bias inherent price index), give likely negative macroeconomic shock low natural interest rate japan's economy future conducive zero bind nominal interest rate. 7 this issue may relate issue discretion versus rule-based policymaking, risk management approach uncertainty versus rule-based policymaking. it seem sensible adopt risk management approach knightian uncertainty (greenspan [2004]). chairman greenspan critical "too inflexible" management rule-based monetary policy. yet "activist" rule-based policymaking seem posse sufficient flexibility uncertain circumstances. for instance, bayesian decision process risk management approach involve learn process. learnability play important role rule-oriented monetary policy secure stability equilibrium. rule-based monetary policy flexibility implement systematic revision contingent plan prescribe update process "timeless manner," discretionary policy revise contingency plan period period. in case, may arise conflict inconsistency risk management approach provision price stability anchor market participants. 4/5 a long fiscal rule aim reduce primary budget deficit medium term imply moderate increase nominal government bond supply, fiscal policy passive (or ricardian) normal equilibrium positive rate change price become active (or non-ricardian) deflationary equilibrium. thus, good reason expect gradual consolidation fiscal balance facilitate economy's exit deflation, couple monetary ease policy base price stability anchor. 5/5 t t mboweni: the challenge strong economic growth development south africa address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, fedusa third national congress, gold reef city, 15 16 september 2005. * * * introduction thank invitation speak fedusa third national congress. a constructive dialogue labour social partner crucial foster community consensus issue important accelerate growth improve quality life south africans. i welcome opportunity part dialogue. in speak challenge strong economic growth development i first briefly review economy currently stands, pay due attention statutory mandate south african reserve bank. the second part address direct debate much growth need south africa absorb unemployed within reasonable timeframe, – perhaps importantly – need do boost growth development momentum accordingly. recent economic development by time know south africa's economic growth rate second quarter 2005 amount 4,8 per cent, compare 3,5 per cent first quarter. most analyst forecast real gross domestic product increase around 4 per cent full calendar year 2005, signify increase 2½ per cent real income per capita. what particularly gratify current growth environment economy enjoy twenty-three quarter uninterrupted economic expansion. this long upswing record economic history south africa. the current recovery property well-trained long-distance runner, rather characteristic unfit sprinter load steroid perform admirably fleet moment. the improvement growth second quarter 2005 mainly bring sharp increase real value add manufacturing, reflect rise domestic final demand strong export demand certain category goods, alongside somewhat competitive level exchange value rand. real output agricultural sector bolster bumper maize crop predominantly harvest second quarter, simultaneously almost main sector economy display solid growth too. enterprise-surveyed employment outside agricultural sector record successive increase five quarter september 2004. private-sector job opportunity benefit economic recovery, also moderate increase public-sector employment. the pick-up enterprise-surveyed employment was, however, sustain last quarter 2004 first quarter 2005. over year march 2005 enterprise-surveyed employment rose, balance, 111 000. the strong increase record community, social personal service trade sectors, employment gold mining, finance manufacture shrink one-year period. whereas enterprise survey measure formal employment main non-agricultural sector economy, result household survey measure employment. household survey data indicate total employment south africa expand 500 000 job year march 2005, roughly half increase informal, domestic service agricultural sectors. 1/5 return narrow data base enterprise surveys, estimate labour productivity rise 2,6 per cent year first quarter 2005. worker engage strike action recent past: man-days lose industrial action increase three-fold first half 2004 first half 2005. nevertheless, nominal remuneration per worker rise 8,7 per cent year march 2005, noticeably slow previously. allow productivity changes, unit labour cost increase 5,9 per cent year march 2005, i.e. 1,3 percentage point low average rate increase 2004. wage settlement average 6 per cent first half 2005. these wage settlement remuneration increase modest compare high nominal increase record 1970s 1980s. however, distant increase erode equally high inflation. after allow fiscal drag little anything improve average worker's real disposable income. currently inflation much lower, consequence far le money illusion inflationary distortion misdirect economic decisions. in july 2005 cpix-inflation amount 4,2 per cent, register 23rd successive month within inflation target range 3 6 per cent. although one cannot deny difficult journey low inflation, benefit apparent: more certainty regard future purchase power money pockets, good planning, especially cash-flows household business use credit accordingly make interest payments. the cash-flow improvement follow sustain low inflation create scope nominal interest rate move low levels. the achievement sustain low inflation make possible household sector incur debt – largely house durable consumption purpose – without significantly heavy interest burden. since 1999 household-debt-to-disposable-income ratio, balance, rise 57 per cent 60 per cent, whereas debt-service-to-disposable-income ratio decrease around 10 per cent 7 per cent. reveal are, aggregate number show numerous household already over-indebted face uncomfortable circumstance include totals. nor show significant number people make end meet would dire strait fairly small interest rate increase take effect. nevertheless, employment real disposable income rise average debt-service ratio well contained, household still comfortable position likely persist, provide continue live within mean allow cushion shield unforeseen events. the south african reserve bank commit ensure hard-won gain fight inflation forfeited. with international oil price recently record record-high levels, shortage factor wait fuel inflation spiral. while immediate first-round effect rise energy price would accepted, monetary policy allow develop inflationary spiral. the bank continue honour mandate enshrine constitution south african reserve bank act give explicit content adoption government 3-to-6-per-cent target range cpix inflation. towards strong growth accelerate development these promise economic condition cloud high rate unemployment south africa: 26 per cent workforce unemployed. recently debate intensify regard way enhance growth capacity south africa order make meaningful inroad unemployment, poverty underdevelopment. a sustain real growth rate around 6 per cent per annum often mention context. it worthwhile reflect 2/5 key strand debate provide central banker's perspective these. at g-20 conference economic growth recently hold south africa co-organised bank, argue sustain vibrant growth development "good macro". in words, prudent consistent monetary fiscal policies, necessary order achieve sustain strong growth development, sufficient. what need beyond prudent stable macroeconomic policy arrangement unfortunately available standard recipe format, depend specific circumstance country. allow discus handful reform likely crucial enhance long-term health vigour south african economy. the maintenance, upgrade expansion infrastructure deserve prominent position among list reform need propel growth high plane. the real fix capital stock south africa rise 2 per cent 2004, 1 1½ per cent per annum precede four years. a continuation low rate increase capital stock clearly supportive real gdp growth rate 6 per cent per annum. assume capital stock would increase 4½ 5 per cent per year support real growth rate 6 per cent per annum, would require ratio fix capital formation gross domestic product rise current 17 per cent around 22 per cent order achieve growth sustainable basis. government – level – public corporation commit ambitious capital programmes. however, implementation almost invariably seem take long initially planned. institutional capacity rather money seem problem many instances. much say inadequate road rail infrastructure hind efficient movement worker residence place work, also inhibit movement good producer markets. similar concern voice regard certain ports. unfortunately sweep statement discredit infrastructural installation helpful. the challenge lie identify specific current future bottleneck microeconomic level, follow often thankless process budgeting, planning, implementation maintenance management. in process dedication, appropriate skill long-term commitment require deliver goods. those oversee process stay commit project, infrastructure creation, lengthy gestation periods, clearly would benefit high turnover management level. several excite microeconomic reform involve south africa's infrastructure pipeline. the introduction second fixed-line telephone operator, example, seem set increase competition reduce communication costs. de-mothballing power generate plant upgrade power distribution networks, water-supply infrastructure, railway line roll stock welcomed. while main airport currently seem cope well, project increase passenger number freight volume necessitate expansion. the cluster industry link infrastructure evidently go experience buoyant time come years. the accompany import machinery equipment might, course, initially widen deficit current account balance payments. however, foreign finance usually accompany imports, late improve infrastructure likely boost export supply side economy streamlined. a particularly sensitive area land reform. pattern land ownership evolve time sustainable, need change. however, great care need take process. what south africa cannot afford kind reform agricultural land use productively purchase taxpayers' money, transferred, end use far le productively before, subtract country's output 3/5 destroy job opportunities. farm modern business require specialise skill well financial capital. adequate attention pay train newly empower farmers, advisory services, financial support limit period. success improve growth create job hinge critically appropriate skill development. this require throw money problem, align system education train requirement modern economy. agriculture's share total value add economy dwindle 7,7 per cent 1975 3,4 per cent last year, mine 11,1 per cent 7,1 per cent period. construction's share fell 5,1 per cent 1975 2,4 per cent 2004 (but should, course, rise infrastructure spend get underway). at extreme, share finance, real-estate business service sector economy grow 12,5 per cent 1975 20,1 per cent last year, community, social personal service 16,1 per cent 21,0 per cent period. product line production process within various sub-sectors undergo revolutionary change introduction sophisticate information communication technologies. the skill requirement modern services-oriented economy (the tertiary sector currently generate 65 per cent total value add south africa) dramatically different requirement face entrant labour market 30 year ago. in reflect way systematically improve prospect growth, role exchange rate merit consideration. firstly, emphasise authority target inflation rate exchange rate. the exchange rate essentially determine supply demand foreign exchange market, reflect decision numerous participant – tourists, investors, importers, exporter like. but various reason bank cannot blind exchange rate, clear preference relatively stable competitive level exchange value rand. the preference relatively stable exchange value rand originate painful adjustment cost accompany large movement exchange rate. adjustment margin natural economic phenomenon, large movement exchange rate render entire sector uneconomical others extremely viable within short period time. the preference competitive level exchange rate reflect need sustainability – exporter move foreign market stay there. the preference relatively stable competitive exchange value rand seldom perfectly match economic outcomes. the foreign exchange market south africa highly liquid (turnover nowadays exceed us$13 billion per day) powerful force beyond control, international price commodities, considerable bear price formation foreign exchange market. practical experience central bank large-scale intervention foreign exchange market sobering. zealous intervention liquid market numerous financially strong participant costly largely futile exercise. in practice, bank prefer leave determination exchange rate market forces. the bank disseminate data balance payments, foreign exchange reserve relate matters, thereby help inform market participants' decisions. on rare occasion bank may comment evidence point possible excess price formation foreign exchange market. the best medicine one-way view regard direction rand's exchange value prevail early 1980s 2001, however, recovery rand past four years, bite deeply pocket rand pessimists. the bank may also build reduce international reserves; recent year emphasis accumulate international reserves, naturally price consequence signify adoption target level exchange rate. when abundant amount foreign exchange available market (and rand comparatively strong) present bank good opportunity buy foreign 4/5 exchange market, since hold gold foreign exchange low side. on balance bank increase gross gold foreign exchange reserve us$8 billion end 2003 us$19 billion present. conclusion despite progress make recent years, high level unemployment necessitate ambitious step strengthen south africa's growth potential. the reserve bank commit contain inflation, thereby provide launch pad enhance growth development. but sufficient condition economic success. enhance infrastructural development, implementation education train programme deliver skill necessary modern economy, careful land reform handful key ingredient necessary boost economic performance. and, monetary policy, element need nurture carefully take bear fruit. they require total dedication sustain attention detail successful. success hands. 5/5 susan schmidt bies: behind scene fomc - federal reserve determine monetary policy remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, academic speaker

wealth anecdotal information supplement torrent hard economic data feed analyzes. moreover, make recommendation board discount rate, rate feed charge loan financial institutions. the information reserve bank boards, along economic intelligence, summarize report know beige book, publicly release two week fomc meeting. the fomc also consult book colors. but i'm get ahead myself. let describe

business report manager system open market account new york fed, focus condition domestic international financial markets. that report follow presentation director board's division research statistic

economic forecast, staff's best estimate, scenario base possible alternative future events. then come first "go-round," every member committee offer assessment current economic conditions. we may usefully digress consider board staff arrive forecast describe role forecast play policymakers' deliberations. an important, perhaps obvious, point make - i repeat, - fomc's forecast. the economic staff reserve bank independently advise president. and economic staff reserve bank individual member fomc may may agree element board staff's forecast. indeed, fomc member sometimes couch presentation economic view term view coincide diverge greenbook's forecast. that description, itself, give sense staff's influence forecast. it set parameter discussion. so kind forecast it? it forecast base human

explain committee's analysis current economic conditions; third provide committee's assessment risk price stability economic growth; last provide committee members' votes. bi review 8/2005 3 the statement relatively recent innovation; decade old and, period, evolve quite terse missive almost loquacious form take today. before advent fomc statements, market observer infer shift monetary policy watch new york fed's open market operations, try guess whether feed ease tighten monetary policy. a may know, federal open market committee decide past december begin release minute meet accelerate basis. previously, practice release minute thursday follow next regularly schedule meet - is, typical lag bite six weeks. under new schedule, time cut half: minute release lag three weeks. this move late long sequence change federal reserve implement past decade enhance openness transparency monetary policymaking. before reach decision accelerate minutes, discuss pro con length december meeting. for number months, experiment internally accelerate preparation minutes, agree trial success. the minute contain complete nuanced explanation reason committee's policy decision view risk outlook possibly include brief post-meeting announcement. for reason, speed release minute see help market interpret policy action context evolve economic development good anticipate course interest rates. another advantage minute provide public up-to-date context individual policymakers' public remarks. that is, member fomc give speeches, know view compare range member last fomc meeting. we recognized, however, risk accelerate release: in particular, possibility that, times, market could misinterpret minutes. in end, clear consensus likely benefit outweigh risks, decide proceed release minute expedite schedule. we go "live" accelerate release begin minute december meeting, publish january 4. the document intensively cover press receive considerable attention financial markets. my impression investor agree change improvement openness transparency monetary policy. however, important note that, interpret minutes, reader keep mind simply long more-detailed version statement fomc issue meeting. the statement intend concisely convey committee's broad consensus. the minutes, however, intend reflect broad range view hold member committee, include view express members. thus, perfectly possible appropriate statement one part minute accord another passage minutes. if want detail discussion go fomc meetings, transcript release five years. these verbatim transcripts, name company provide confidential information redacted, encourage share forward-looking information fomc members, turn share information others discussions. member fomc also communicate public speeches, make various time year. a i note disclaimer i give start speech, give speeches, speak ourselves, necessarily fomc case board governors. the chairman also deliver twice-a-year report congress monetary policy, speak fomc. the chairman also testify congress, give view economic policy. these method communication important element transparency necessary independent central bank function within democracy. a i mentioned, goal - price stability maximum sustainable employment - set law, afford political independence make sometimes unpopular decision require achieve goals. appropriate transparency accountability offer necessary counterbalance independence. 4 bi review 8/2005 conclusion i hope give overview broad range purpose function federal reserve system, well insider view happen behind scene fomc. next time hear read news account fed's action change feed fund rate, i hope appreciate activity go behind decisions. bi review 8/2005 5 rakesh mohan: indian economy global set address dr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, 99th foundation day celebration function indian merchants’ chamber, mumbai, 8 september 2005. * * * i extremely happy 99th foundation day celebration function indian merchants' chamber mumbai 8 september, 2005. indian merchant chamber long heritage – i wish best year’s celebration next year’s centenary. in age globalization, i think would apposite share account india’s place global economy. where stand? have improve performance? these issue i attempt delve present address. in recent decade, india along china emerge engine global growth. this well reflect india’s share world gdp increase significantly 4.3 per cent 1991 5.8 per cent 2004. this period also one india initiate structural reform encompassed, inter alia, phase open indian economy external sector. these structural reform strengthen india’s external sector also impart degree dynamism indian economy. the open indian economy allow reap benefit globalisation india also contribute global growth. against backdrop, i discus india’s recent economic growth record order draw lesson realize potential globalise world. recent economic growth: overview issue economic development recent year indicate grow resilience indian economy. illustratively, even indian economy buffet exogenous shock emanate normal monsoon record high international oil prices, overall gdp growth almost 7 per cent 2004-05. effective macroeconomic management year ensure india remain one fast grow economy among emerge market economy environment macroeconomic financial stability. look post-reform period, real gdp growth step 5.8 per cent per annum 1980s 6.2 per cent per annum 1992-93 2004-05. over period, per caput growth record impressive increase 3.4 per cent 4.3 per cent. structural reform increase competitiveness indian industry reflect quite vividly robust merchandise export growth since 2002-03 – export grow (in u $ terms) 20 per cent per annum last three years. concomitantly, service sector contribute one-half gdp, grow contribution new impulse growth information technology, telecommunication transport sector revival foreign tourist arrivals. a noteworthy feature macroeconomic management success maintain price financial stability. inflation average close five per cent per annum since second half 1990s, significantly low around seven eight per cent previous three half decades. this possible due effective monetary management, enable reform fiscal-monetary interface. this soothe influence inflation expectations. thus, despite poor monsoon conditions, record international crude oil price sharp increase host non-oil commodity prices, inflation could contain around 5 per cent end fiscal 2004-05, reflect effective calibrate monetary measure support timely supply-side fiscal measures. inflation current year far ease 3.1 per cent, although need recognise pass-through international oil price domestic oil price remain 1/9 incomplete. we may also note unlike previous oil price rise episode international inflation also contain time. another notable feature post-reform period improvement health financial sector. reform financial sector introduce since early 1990s major impact overall efficiency stability bank system, reflect improvement capital adequacy ratio strengthen balance sheets. furthermore, indian bank do remarkable job containment npls consider overhang issue overall difficult environment. net npa fall two per cent net advances. the external sector continue robust. despite sharp increase oil well non-oil imports, india’s balance payment record large persistent surpluses, foreign exchange reserve around u $ 144 billion. increase earn export service remittance couple enhance foreign investment inflow provide strength external sector. in brief, indian economy exhibit strong performance since early 1990s environment macroeconomic financial stability – high gdp growth, low inflation, resilient external sector strong financial sector. all happen 1990s, otherwise turbulent decade term financial instability many countries. nonetheless, widely agree growth indian economy remain well-below potential. real gdp growth first three year (2002-03 2004-05) tenth plan period average 6.5 per cent, low tenth five year plan (2002-2007) target eight per cent per annum. while economy well many area gain need consolidated, also important weaknesses, which, correct could undermine even potential performance level. in context, interest note recent year (2001-02 2003-04) see india record surplus current account, i.e., able find investment avenue deploy domestic savings. it is, therefore, important impediment investment remove domestic save deploy home. of course, realise growth potential 8-9 per cent indian economy, domestic save also record commensurate increases. reform would intensify agricultural sector, factor market promote flexibility, bankruptcy exit procedures, fiscal consolidation physical social infrastructure sector accelerate investment. i address issue next. although poverty ratio decline since onset reform process, number people poverty line still remain high, wide variation across states. between 1977-78 1999-2000, proportion people live poverty line fell 51.3 per cent 26.1 per cent; period, absolute number poor people fell 330 million 260 million, number still sizable. in 2001-03, instance, india’s per caput income equivalent 9 per cent global average 2 per cent per caput income high income countries. with half people still dependent agriculture, key area concern agricultural growth remain low continue monsoon-dependent. growth agricultural ally sector decelerate 3.2 per cent per annum 1980-96 1.9 per cent subsequently. per caput agricultural gdp show significant upward trend 1996-97. the slowdown wide-spread across crop reflect broad base deceleration productivity growth. the deceleration output coincide downturn world prices, impact domestic farm price early decade great openness. the consequence farm income become variable decelerate output many cases. a relate cause concern, give 57 per cent population still agricultural dependent, role agriculture provide additional employment opportunity virtually zero 1990s. employment agriculture remain virtually unchanged 2/9 190 million people 1990s. concomitantly, annual employment growth economy, whole, decelerate two per cent 1980s 1.1 per cent latter half 1990s. with employment growth trail addition labour force, unemployment rate economy whole estimate increase 8.87 per cent 2001-02 9.11 per cent 2004-05, proportion far high country like ours. the generation productive employment is, therefore, key issue need address continuous basis. the slowdown agricultural sector reflect subdue public investment agriculture inadequate crop diversification. a step-up public investment rural infrastructural area irrigation, rural electrification rural road become possible reduction good target subsidy would enable great public investment promote growth. effort also need diversify crop pattern non-traditional activity line change agricultural demand pattern make use recent advance bio-technology. the process diversification call micro-level plan emphasis crop specific inputs, create proper market infrastructure, cold storage, transportation facility supportive policies. there need value addition agricultural product processing, packaging, supply chain management farm income expand, employment generate rural poverty alleviated. other initiative increase agricultural production could cover aspect good availability commodity derivative minimize impact price uncertainty; reduce monsoon-dependency scheme like water harvesting; and, augment flow credit rural sector. diversification agriculture would also provide stable additional avenue employment generation rural sector enable sector emerge main source growth employment rural areas. all measure promote competitiveness agricultural sector, necessary current global context. a regard social sector indicators, notwithstanding progress regard education health, india still far behind east asian neighbours. our social indicator low even comparison level achieve country twenty five year ago, first begin grow rapidly. the social indicator also show disturb gender gaps, large rural-urban difference wide variation across states. although literacy rate improve encouragingly 52.2 per cent 1991 64.8 per cent 2001 overall number illiterate country decline 329 million 1991 306 million 2001, least seven major state 15 million illiterate each, account nearly two-third total illiterate country. concomitantly, give india’s comparative advantage services, important quality secondary high education country improve adequate skill develop realize benefit knowledge economy. a regard health, combine government (centre plus states) expenditure health percentage gdp stagnate around one per cent gdp last decade half. total public expenditure health india remain even low many develop country brazil (3.4 per cent), thailand (2.1 per cent), sri lanka (1.8 per cent), china (1.9 per cent) malaysia (1.5 per cent). low public expenditure india extent compensate private expenditure 4.0 per cent gdp comparatively high country except brazil (4.9 per cent). however, low public expenditure cause concern vast majority population primary health care remain poor quality, unavailable inaccessible. the infant mortality rate india almost double china (63 india versus 37 china) maternal mortality rate 407 manifold compare china’s 56. hospital bed (per 1000 population) 0.7 india le one-half develop economy china (2.4), thailand (2.0) malaysia (2.0). a significant improvement social indicator necessary want create pre-condition general improvement welfare population genuine equality opportunity. 3/9 turn industrial sector, reform encompass removal industrial licensing, de-reservation, substantial open foreign direct investment trade liberalisation impart competitive edge indian industry. this reflect resurgence activity manufacture sector past two years, present phase appear sustainable, contrast exuberance – turn temporary - reflect high growth investment production industry 1993-94 1996-97. for industrial activity get entrench gather momentum, efficiency supply infrastructural input need large impetus. the subdue performance infrastructure sector recent month issue concern, give sector’s strong forward backward linkage economy. the increase demand-supply gap availability power become critical issue future india’s economic development. in recent period, shortage coal gas emerge serious constraint power generation supply fuel fall far short demand. in context, give fact indian economy among inefficient user energy, high urgent priority need give energy-saving measures, could include appropriate price policy incentive invest. with grow urbanisation, issue relate urban infrastructure come forefront. at present, investment urban infrastructure hamper fact local government yet creditworthy urban infrastructure project are, therefore, find commercially viable. strengthen plan good coordination various agency entrust maintenance urban infrastructure would positive impact overall productivity economic activity cities. give fact heavy concentration economic activity large cities, weak infrastructural facility impede growth large city overall economic productivity. it is, therefore, utmost importance quality urban infrastructure large city improve significantly maintain accelerate momentum economic growth productivity enhancement. for urbanise economy like india replicate experience develop country provision urban infrastructure, essential aspect city management, include foster professional workforce, strengthened. the maintenance vibrant growth manufacture sector depend crucially expansion small medium enterprise become significant player future. for potential realized, need increase credit availability sector reasonable costs. bank institution need improve credit assessment capability regard small-scale enterprise small-scale must equate high risk. recent initiative government reserve bank, new legislation aim develop credit information bureau help reduce information transaction cost lead low cost credit ssi sector. empirical evidence show wide availability credit history greatly expand flow credit potential borrower long tie local lenders. the service sector emerge large contributor growth country. advance information technology, liberalisation telecommunication sector availability skilled labour permit india reap advantage globalisation services. the initial impetus provide export software service get additional support exponential growth it-enabled sector (ites). accord national association software service company (nasscom), india’s software service export record strong growth 34 per cent 2004-05. the software sector [including ites-business process outsource (bpo)] employ one million people, record compound annual growth nearly 30 per cent employment period 1999-2005. the software sector also provide indirect employment 2.5 million people. these data bring forth grow role software sector, time, suggest order growth rate maintain future, investment social infrastructure – especially, education - need stepped-up. in context, necessary public expenditure education reverse 4/9 decline trend: total expenditure state government education budget decline 2.5 per cent gdp 2003-04 2.3 per cent 2005-06. moreover, give demographic profile, demand education slat increase further. accordingly, improvement state finance enable state increase expenditure education social service thereby improve quality overall social infrastructure india realise potential. it well-recognised monetary policy contribute long-run growth maintain low stable inflation. international experience indicate prudent fiscal policy remain single large prerequisite monetary stability. in india, reform monetary-fiscal interface 1990s key factor impart great flexibility monetary policy. these reform take significant step forward enactment fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act, 2003 centre. with centre’s gfd/gdp ratio 4.1 per cent 2004-05 (provisional accounts), frbm target 3.0 per cent 2008-09 appear within strike distance. however, revenue deficit 2.7 per cent 2004-05, elimination revenue deficit 2008-09 prove difficult. achieve target require continue focus action contain expenditures, increase tax revenue reduction tax exemptions. revenue augmentation would critically depend upon improvement tax/gdp ratio non-tax revenue set decline come years. with acceleration overall economic growth observe currently, renew effort tax compliance yield beneficial results. achievement frbm target revenue deficit zero per cent gdp free resource public investment also crowd-in private investment. overall, despite recent improvement fiscal position central government effort achieve fiscal consolidation continue. international crude oil price touch record high. in previous episode high oil prices, india often face balance payment crisis, low growth high inflation. in recent period, economy able absorb oil shock relatively comfortably far. however, case international oil price continue remain exist elevate levels, could negative influence growth prospect internationally. it important note oil intensity – oil consumption per unit output – india increase since early 1970s contrast behaviour major economy euro area, u japan. although oil intensity india still low advance economies, scope adopt measure enhance efficiency oil use economy. energy conservation measure backdrop high volatile international crude oil price could help indian economy weather adverse consequence relatively low output losses. in context, need policy permit flexibility domestic oil price respond up down international prices, albeit mechanism cushion impact common man. this also enable efficient use oil economy, especially view fact rise international oil price appear large permanent component. give volatility inflation rate 2004-05, need consolidate gain obtain recent year rein inflationary expectations. while sustain effort time help build confidence price stability, inflationary expectation turn adverse relatively short time noticeable adverse movement price take place. credible commitment policy fight inflation critical stop translation high oil price wage-price spirals. in addition, international price non-oil primary commodity may continue remain firm. on domestic front, manoeuvrability oil price get limit corporates high probability gain price power good industrial outlook. the price pressure, occur supply side, could get complicate continue overhang excess domestic liquidity. while economy resilience withstand supply shocks, upside risk exist. a such, inflationary situation, international domestic, need watch closely 5/9 persevere maintain inflation expectation complacency count could adverse consequence stability growth. global economic integration with grow external openness indian economy, give pace expansion size, debate recent period contour public policy context increase global economic integration also challenge likely face global economy account progressively increase global integration indian economy. the emphasis course successful integration doubt depend appropriateness public policy private sector responses. these issue address next. globalization several dimension arise enhance connectivity among people across national borders. in particular, economic integration occur three channels, viz., movement people, good and, finance capital. in manage process economic integration, develop country face challenge world order particularly burdensome them. it necessary public policy manage process view maximize benefit citizen minimize risks; path optimal integration highly country-specific contextual. on balance, appear great advantage achieve well-managed appropriate integration global process, would imply effective – necessarily intrusive extensive – intervention governments. in fact, infirmity intervention government, market experience market-failures cannot exist without externally impose rule prescription public policy. a poor, vulnerable underprivileged continue responsibility national governments, relevance national public policy – particularly relate global economic integration. against backdrop, external sector policy design progressively open indian economy, observe earlier, form integral part strategy structural reforms. in context, report high level committee balance payment (rangarajan committee, 1993) recommend improvement exports, merchandise invisibles; modulation import demand basis availability current receipt ensure level current account deficit consistent normal capital flows; enhancement non-debt create flow limit debt service burden; adoption market-determined exchange rate; build foreign exchange reserve avoid liquidity crisis elimination dependence short-term debt. it evident external sector policy 1990s, base report, pay rich dividend term growth resilience series external domestic shocks. various reform trade policy regime unlock entrepreneurial energies, step productivity gain improve competitiveness access overseas markets. india’s merchandise export rise rate 20 per cent per annum, u dollar terms, 2002-05. a result, secular decline india’s share world export two per cent 1950 0.5 per cent 1980s reversed. this share begin rise 1990s currently 0.8 per cent. these positive development external sector provide environment pursue rationalisation tariff view towards move single, uniform rate imports, say 10 per cent, simplify custom procedure strictly line best global practices. this help improve competition, export domestic consumers. the current external environment include level foreign exchange reserve enable move make little downside risks. while recent trend import may continue persist face high volatile crude price large increase domestic demand, intrinsic link merchandise import export emerge become entrenched. the large expansion import also spur vigorous export growth. give recent experience, especially fact worker remittance seem acquire semi-permanent, 6/9 permanent, character, current level trade deficit appear manageable stage appear consistent india’s growth aspirations. give adverse international experience unfettered capital account liberalisation, risk averse adopt policy active management capital account. the compositional shift capital account consistent policy framework, impart stability balance payments. the sustainability current account increasingly view consistent volume normal capital flows. the substitution debt non-debt flow also give u room manoeuvre since debt levels, particularly, external commercial borrowings, moderate raise event sustain pick demand external resources. there also cushion available foreign exchange reserves. india make significant progress financial liberalisation since institution financial sector reform 1992 recognise internationally. india choose proceed cautiously gradual manner, calibrate pace capital account liberalisation underlie macroeconomic developments, state readiness domestic financial system dynamic international financial markets. unlike case trade integration, benefit country demonstrable, case financial integration, 'threshold' term preparedness resilience economy important country get full benefits. a judgmental view need take whether country reach "threshold" financial integration approach cautiously, preferably within framework plausible roadmap draw embody country-specific context institutional features. the experience far show indian approach financial integration stand test time. the optimism generate recent gain macroeconomic performance warrant balance consideration financial liberalisation. at stage, optimism generate impressive macroeconomic performance accompany stability give rise pressure significantly accelerate pace external financial liberalisation. it essential take account risk associate reset accelerate pace gradualist approach. the recent experience many country show period impressive macroeconomic performance generate pressure speedy financial liberalisation since everyone appear gainer liberalisation, cost instability may generate process bear country, government poor sections. avoid crisis ultimately national responsibility. the approach manage external sector, choice instrument time sequence policy matter inform judgment, give imponderables. a note earlier, global development influence india, grow size india also implication global economy would also take account evolve demographic dynamic country india. over next half-century, population world age fast past half-century fertility rate decline life expectancy rises. in europe, demographic profile already tilt towards high age group 2050, project accelerate. projection suggest turn point 2010 2030 european union, north america japan experience substantial decline save rate relative investment may reflect large current account deficits. most high performer east asia china second stage demographic cycle. elderly dependency expect double country 2025. their work age population increase modestly first shrink. these projection suggest east asia could increasingly become important supplier global save 2025; however, rapid population age thereafter would reinforce rather mitigate inexorable decline global savings. india enter second stage demographic cycle next half-century, significant increase save rate share work age population expected. the share labour force population india expect overtake rest asia, include china, 2030. look ahead, rest world may increasingly rely 7/9 china india supply labour capital could significantly influence evolution global economy. it evident china india give high priority generate employment poise substantial increase productivity. the global economy contend implication development prices, exchange rates, wage structure employment industrialise countries. over medium term, felt outsource grow rapidly may also cover high-end research development activities. in manufacturing, china emerge leader india catch rapidly. though agriculture heavily subsidise major industrialise countries, subsidisation would difficult sustain fiscal point view, since many country concern poise meet mount pension liability speak burgeon health care cost maintain deteriorate demographics. one sector industrialise economy continue show considerable strength dominance financial sector, partly attributable confidence factor financial market favour industrialise economy traditional international financial centres. it essential india carefully monitor development real financial sectors, frame policy tandem global development global integration continue positive sum game countries. while economic integration india global economy continue take place, successful integration, due regard interest vast majority particularly, poor country would possible sound public policy – evolve redesign time time. give india’s demographic advantages, quality labour force (in term relevant skill need sustained, reorient upgrade globally competitive era) physical health workforce become crucial. education health, therefore, provide link supply demand labour increase productivity. in context, universal recognition need improve productivity output agriculture relate activity meet objective growth employment. there massive shift workforce agriculture non-agricultural avocation prepare large-scale migration workforce tune 10 million per year, rural semi-urban urban areas. the quality urban infrastructure even metropolitan cities, note earlier, conducive globally competitive economic activity. the inevitable large scale redeployment migrate workforce would, therefore, need institutional arrangements, public private sector, skill-imparting skill gradation. in two matter relate workforce, supply-led approach appear order, rather wait demand generated. enhance investment activity, particularly infrastructure area, would necessitate high domestic savings, especially public sector couple efficient financial intermediation. in addition, foreign save need attract absorb strong preference foreign direct investment sector though sector like banking, calibrate approach may warranted. at time, enterprise enable attain strong global presence sectors. in brief, global integration two way process, encompass movement people caveats, trade free equitable manner financial integration specially sequence basis. conclude observation the structural reform initiate early 1990s couple cautious calibrate approach external sector liberalization lead step-up economic growth india emerge one fast grow economy world. notably, growth achieve environment monetary financial stability, even series exogenous shocks, domestic foreign, hit indian economy 8/9 period since latter half 1990s. look ahead, evolve demographic profile favour young population suggest growth prospect indian economy remain strong, provide potential effectively utilised. at time, lot need do improve quality life. while proportion poor total population come down, absolute number poor people remain high. india’s rank term human development index gender development index continue low compare many develop countries. there need link growth development fill gap macroeconomic performance social sector development. in regard, globalisation throw opportunity challenge benefit societies. opportunity offer force globalisation offer india scope improve quality life people, provide appropriate policy put place. 9/9 philipp hildebrand: in focus swiss national bank - economic outlook monetary policy summary speech mr philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, wgz-bank, luxemburg, 9 september 2005. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * the world economy expand robust pace growth rate important economic bloc diverge considerably. in spite accommodative monetary policy industrial countries, inflation inflation expectation remain well contain may, among things, due process globalisation credibility central banks. switzerland, small extremely open, benefit recover global economy. the condition return path modest expansion look favourable. however, certain risk may affect global swiss economy negatively. most importantly, high oil price devastate effect hurricane „katrina”, well possibility increase long-term interest rate mentioned. a persistently high price oil could act brake demand dynamic growth prospect could also threaten soar long-term interest rates, effect could amplify house channel. in foreign exchange markets, structural cyclical factor continue determine value us-dollar. 1/1 david dodge: the evolution resolution global imbalance remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, spruce meadow roundtable, calgary, 9 september 2005. * * * good morning. i happy back spruce meadows, opportunity join friends, governor zhou noyer, round-table discussion: "changing fortunes-world monetary policy." our host, ron southern, ask u "integrative, comprehensive, anticipatory, apolitical." this tall order, i best oblige. today, i talk two type global economic imbalances. the first relate way save investment distribute across country increasingly uneven way. the second possibility that, next couple decades, global economy might face protract period desire save exceed plan investment, partly demographic trends. if economic policy-makers take appropriate measure quickly enough, even risk-albeit small one-that world economy could end classic dilemma-first spell john maynard keynes-of widespread demand deficiency persistent deflationary gap. but talk longer-term risk, let focus savings-investment imbalance currently exist across different region global economy. the unite state face large grow current account deficit, reflect excess investment spend relative domestic savings. this match grow current account surplus asia, oil-exporting nations, economy around world. geographical imbalance necessarily bad thing, large capital flow generate. indeed, process work world financial market allow saver one country lend borrower another. such process lead high global growth, since country surplus save invest country generate enough save internally. however, imbalance grow unsustainable pace, appear case present, form correction must take place. if market allow operate without interference, imbalance resolve reasonably smooth manner. but absence appropriately function market mechanisms, great risk correction abrupt disorderly. beyond disruption financial markets, disorderly correction might also lead government adopt wrong-headed protectionist measures, would exacerbate damage global economy. but regardless imbalance resolved, clear resolution require great net national save unite states. investment u.s. economy need finance domestic sources-be household, business, government sectors-and le foreign sources. this imply increase net u.s. export decrease net export elsewhere world, well increase domestic demand countries. exchange rate movement important role play regard, help redirect international trade investment flows. in context, effort country slow prevent require adjustment peg exchange rate are, end, counterproductive. i know governor zhou noyer fully understand that, frustrate market mechanisms, policy raise risk much large disorderly correction future, well outbreak protectionism. but look exchange rate movement alone resolve exist global imbalances. within unite states, high interest rate expect lead increase savings. authority could also encourage great national save tight fiscal policy. and could implement structural reform encourage national save taxation, social security premiums, measures. but unite state alone act resolve imbalance take step i've described, would leave global economy much weak aggregate demand. and number country must focus stimulate domestic demand. this task make urgent fact global economy currently operate somewhat capacity. the fact inflationary pressure absent globally evidence this. 1/3 so, stimulate domestic demand outside unite states? clearly, monetary authority bear responsibility stabilize domestic output short run move economy towards full production capacity. but monetary policy may effective could be, problem economy's structural fiscal policies. thus, appropriate policy prescription depend country's circumstances. structural reform remove market rigidity important us. many need improve develop financial system save effectively channel investment household improve access credit. for some, development social safety net would helpful, citizen feel need hold excessive precautionary savings. and few, stimulative fiscal policy would helpful. i'll say policy minutes, since also critical good performance global economy long run. but first, i want discus second type imbalance i mention beginning: challenge pose evolve economic demographic realities. a i see it, country appropriate structural policy place, risk prolong deficiency global demand future. let expand risk highlight two trend important next decade two. first, expect asia's share world economy continue grow. for various reasons, asian nation traditionally high rate save economies. and so, thing equal, expect global desire save rise. but thing equal. the second trend expect high desire save oecd economy baby-boom generation prepare retirement. take together, two trend certainly expect lead high level global desire savings. so critical policy-makers act now, increase demand investment compensate increase desire savings. how policy-makers handle event next 10 20 year critical prepare global economy period roughly 2020 on, proportion working-age population start decline many countries. canada likely position within 15 years. while demographic trend unite state likely le challenging, many oecd countries, old-age dependency ratio poise rise sharply. accord study european commission, 2025 european union go ratio roughly four working-age person every senior citizen ratio 3 1. indeed, without radical change fertility rates, life expectancies, migration patterns, population many part world start declining, even world's total population continue climb. accord unite nations, population eu could start decline 2025, china expect follow 2050. indeed, year, japan report drop male population, number death country begin exceed number births. but oecd countries, era decline labour force population still least couple decade away. before get there, first go period desire save likely rise. worker many country expect try increase save retirement. this accomplish short period rise price assets, houses. but next couple decades, increase save come current income, mean slow growth consumer spending. at time, governments-faced need prepare future increase public spend age population-will also slow rate increase current spending. to deal expect slow growth domestic demand, would typically expect monetary policy open economy encourage "crowd in" foreign demand high exports. but world whole one large close economy-we can't export another planet! if save increase one part world, offset increase domestic demand need elsewhere keep global demand line global supply. so, since can't export another planet, policy-makers support three remain component demand-private consumption, government spending, investment? in term investment, key point remember investment require expectation future profit compensate cost capital. of course, change financial condition play important role spur investment, since real interest rate decline point desire investment match desire savings. but, desire save strong, spread throughout global economy, could happen real interest rate would able fall sufficiently match desire save investment. with global inflation interest rate already low, could argue that, expect increase desire save materializes, 2/3 risk global nominal interest rate would hit zero real interest rate fall sufficiently restore balance desire investment savings. let stress prediction part. i say that, increase global demand offset expect increase desire savings, may difficult monetary policy effectively fulfill role main short-run economic stabilizer year ahead. so, policy-makers help u avoid keynesian deflationary gap future? a turn out, policy prescription i speak early context resolution today's imbalance would also address potential problem ahead. let return policy talk bite detail. first, one might look government provide expansionary fiscal policy. in economies, clearly room fiscal policy become stimulative order boost investment demand. certainly, economy emerge asia scope support demand fiscal policy. but north america, europe, japan scope fiscal policy spur demand appear limited, give current debt level country increase demand age population place government sector. the strain public purse meet need age population enormous. the situation serious country yet take step ensure public pension system able handle retirement baby-boom generation. unless ratio public debt-to-gdp reduce strain felt, government many country face difficult task reduce service raise taxes, both. in event, public debt country may already become large additional fiscal stimulus might actually counterproductive. households, anxious future tax liability viability public pensions, might cut back consumption. this could offset positive effect easy policy stance. but scope effective fiscal action, i would argue emphasis improve economic infrastructure way support production capacity economy while, time, help meet rise social need work population begin decline. this might include additional money education training, add human capital, would help maintain production capacity world economy. but one thing government stimulate demand, appropriate structural policies, i stress word "appropriate." structural policy promote economic flexibility important circumstances. we need take step improve flexibility labour market and, particular, make sure old worker want remain workforce discourage so. we also need recognize well-functioning credit market extremely important, household borrow future income, business able make investment future. the improvement labour financial market policy particularly important europe. in emerge asia, improve income-security policy essential order reduce need household build large amount precautionary savings. a well, stronger, efficient domestic financial system could go long way towards raise confidence promote increase spending. by effectively pool resources, strong financial institution market asia would help individual become le risk-averse. household would readily able borrow future income, business would appropriate access credit order finance investments. in closing, let stress key points. i'm say disorderly correction global imbalance certain happen. nor i say global economy inevitably head deflationary shortfall demand. what i say that, prudent policy-makers, must rely good fortune help u muddle through. we need get go policy issue now, late take remedial action. in particular, need make sure structural policy encourage maximum economic flexibility impede investment growth. we need make sure fiscal flexibility handle demographic challenge future. and must continue conduct monetary policy aim keep inflation low, stable, predictable, maximize chance economy operate full capacity. we must act meet challenge today, future, benefit citizens. 3/3 kishori udeshi: financial system stability basel ii - way forward address m kishori udeshi, deputy governor reserve bank india, 17th annual convention association professional bankers, colombo, sri lanka, 26 august 2005. * * * the initiative association professional banker – sri lanka organise conference financial system stability basel ii – way forward indeed commendable. basel ii important milestone bank regulation supervision ought view necessary process promote safety soundness bank sector thereby strengthen financial stability. what financial stability? in situation financial stability, financial institution market able efficiently mobilise savings, provide liquidity allocate investment. the grow role financial sector right allocation resource appropriate price could significantly enhance efficiency economy function. if financial market work well, direct resource productive uses. risk accurately price bear appetite absorb risks. real economic activity high investments, quantity well quality, would result growth macroeconomic stability few financial uncertainties. the objective financial macro-economic stability are, thus, mutually reinforcing. a governor reddy put it, ‘financial stability need particularly ensure financial system undergo structural changes’. financial stability mean total absence failure individual financial institutions, fluctuation price market financial assets. such event become cause concern lead impairment basic intermediation function severe misallocation capital. before talk indian financial system i must commend effort make sri lankan authority towards strengthen financial sector. it resilience bear fact tsunami devastation end 2004 affect stability sri lankan financial sector. indian financial system in recent years, considerable widen deepen indian financial system, couple increase globalisation financial services. india fast approach era financial conglomerisation ‘bundling’ provision financial services. these development opportunity market participant nevertheless pose serious challenge regulation supervision bank system. in india, pursuit financial macroeconomic stability emerge central plank financial sector reforms. stability financial system critical influence price stability sustain growth, constitute principal objective policy. a stable financial system facilitate efficient transmission monetary policy initiative smooth operation payment systems. from perspective regulation supervision, safeguard depositors’ interest, ensure strong risk management within payment, clear settlement systems, mandate reserve bank india (rbi). the rbi put place prudential supervisory report system, cover vital aspect wide range indicators, serf early warn signal well. macro-prudential indicator (mpis) compile since march 2000, collate data 1/7 various report receive regulatory supervisory wing bank. the review mpis cover area capital adequacy, asset quality, risk management, management soundness, earn profitability liquidity, interest rate, maturity structure asset liabilities, various indicator pertain major segment financial market debt, forex, capital market segments, besides macroeconomic indicator growth, inflation, interest rate exchange rate. the mpi review accompany review development global environment. a part effort disseminate financial soundness indicator (fsis), reserve bank start publish core set indicator various publications. financial sector reform adopt 1990s enhance strength bank financial institution india. a strike feature institution improve resilience domestic external environment. the reform process change relationship rbi commercial bank one micro regulation macro management. aid robust macroeconomic environment, banks’ bottom line improve significantly last two years. the aggregate capital ratio schedule commercial bank 12.83 per cent end march 2005 well stipulate level 9 per cent. the reserve bank, along government, initiate several institutional measure contain level npas. notable among include establishment debt recovery tribunals, lok adalats (people’s courts), asset reconstruction company (arcs) corporate debt restructure (cdr) mechanism. settlement advisory committee form regional head office level commercial banks. enactment securitisation reconstruction financial asset enforcement security interest (sarfaesi) act, 2002 help improve recovery climate country. the government amend relevant provision act address concern express supreme court regard fair deal borrower ordinance date november 11, 2004. the decline trend gross net npls schedule commercial bank continue despite adoption 90-day delinquency norm unprecedented surge growth advances. legislation since enact facilitate compilation dissemination credit information include data default financial system credit information bureau india ltd. (cibil). the legal provision practice bankruptcy real sector however still inadequate need reform. the reserve bank also make effort formulate policy deal risk arise account operation large complex financial institution pose systemic risk. a first step direction, inter-agency work group financial conglomerate (fc) comprise three supervisory bodies, viz., reserve bank, security exchange board india insurance regulatory development authority, june 2004, identify 23 fcs pilot process obtain information conglomerate initiated. the year 2004-05 witness surge credit off-take lead sizeable decline liquid asset bank. consistent shift function competitive economy adoption prudential best practices, major challenge face bank sector deployment fund quality asset management revenue costs. basel ii unlike basel i, simple, basel ii complex. therefore, bcbs expect basel ii adopt widely quickly. they believe country adopt option approach appropriate state markets, bank 2/7 systems, supervisory structures. supervisor adopt framework evolutionary basis use element national discretion adapt needs. why move basel ii under basel ii capital requirement risk sensitive directly relate credit rat counter-party instead counter-party category basel i. further, require bank hold capital credit market risk also operational risk (or) warrant interest rate risks, credit concentration risks, liquidity risk etc. this make basel ii comprehensive basel i. where bank require hold uniform level 8 per cent minimum capital basel i, supervisor discretion require bank hold high level minimum capital basel ii. basel ii advantage provide range option counter-party capital requirement process reduce gap require capital regulatory capital. basel ii recognise wide range collateral provide incentive improve risk management practices. an interest point note basel ii recognise element diversification risk sme sector assign low risk weight retail sme exposure standardise approach. the non-retail sme exposure would also attract low risk weight good external rat standardise approach. shift basel ii, therefore, could advantageous economy whose bank significant sme exposure. indian approach basel ii with commencement bank sector reform early 1990s, rbi consistently upgrade indian bank sector adopt international best practices. the approach reform one clarity destination also decide sequence pace reform suit indian conditions. this help u move ahead reform without disruption. with successful implementation bank sector reform past decade, indian bank system show substantial improvement various parameters. it become robust display significant resilience shocks. there ample evidence capacity indian bank system migrate smoothly basel ii norms. the policy approach basel ii india external perception india conform best international standard positive favour. commercial bank india start implement basel ii effect march 31, 2007. they initially adopt standardise approach credit risk basic indicator approach operational risk. after adequate skill developed, bank also supervisors, bank may allow migrate internal rat base (irb) approach. some regulatory initiative take reserve bank india, relevant basel ii follows: first, try ensure bank suitable risk management framework orient towards requirement dictate size complexity business, risk philosophy, market perception expect level capital. second, risk base supervision (rbs) 23 bank introduce pilot basis. third, encourage bank formalize capital adequacy assessment process (caap) alignment business plan performance budget systems. this, together adoption rbs, would enable factor pillar ii requirement basel ii. fourth, expand area disclosure (pillar iii), great transparency financial position risk profile banks. finally, try build capacity ensure regulator’s ability identify permit eligible bank adopt irb / advance measurement approaches. 3/7 a per normal practice, view ensure smooth migration basel ii, consultative participative approach adopt design implement basel ii. a steer committee comprise senior official 14 bank (public, private foreign) constitute representation indian banks’ association rbi. the steer committee form sub-groups address specific issues. on basis recommendation steer committee, draft guideline bank implementation new capital adequacy framework issued. implementation basel ii require capital bank india due fact operational risk capture basel i, capital charge market risk prescribe recently. though cushion available system, present crar 12 per cent, comforting, bank explore various avenue meet capital requirement basel ii. even decide take indian bank system simple approach basel ii, take initiative would clearly demonstrate intention either dilute standard pick le stringent option lay basel ii. through initiatives, prescribe stringent prudential requirement bank india e.g. regard adoption risk weight claim state governments, public sector enterprises, bank capital market real estate exposures. further even though bank allow use unsolicited rat standardise approach, would allow use unsolicited ratings. also, expand area disclosure great transparency regard financial position risk profile banks. illustratively, view enhance transparency, case penalty impose rbi bank also direction issue specific matters, include arise inspection, place public domain. such proactive disclosure regulator expect salutary effect function bank system. in addition above, penal action take foreign bank branch india also share home country regulator view enhance quality consolidate supervision. these initiative important supplement pillar 3 disclosure prescribe basel ii, opinion cause stable bank system. the way forward on way forward recognise implementation basel ii make considerable demand scarce resource term economic resource human resources. bank must take challenge convert opportunities. here i would like quote ms. susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system: “banking remain highly dynamic industry. supervisor especially attentive change best practice ensure basel ii inhibit adoption new bank practice financial instruments” “maintaining financial stability global bank financial market continue important objective regulators, bankers, market participants, particularly negative impact financial instability economy whole. basel ii, view, help improve financial stability…even though minimum regulatory capital ratio likely volatile basel ii, reflect great risk sensitivity.” some issue emerge economy particular would need address way ahead high capital requirements, improve it architectures, data issues, consolidation, capacity building, external ratings, use national discretion, validate concept economic capital corporate governance. 4/7 high capital requirement – the basel document prescribe minimum capital requirement bank need encourage hold capital minimum. a part strategy, bank expect operate level minimum take care fluctuation capital requirement response fluctuation quality risk exposures. further, necessary ensure element expect loss fully meet provision capital available exclusively support unexpected losses. high capital requirement could pose difficulty state own banks. this may require consideration option preference share innovative tier-i instruments, hybrid tier-ii capital instrument tier-iii capital instruments. improve it architecture/mis – the basic requirement implementation basel ii improve information system manage use data business decisions. bank should, therefore, encourage strengthen it architecture also improve information report systems. this would also equip bank cope appropriately pillar 3 disclosure requirements. consolidation – in normal course operation bank would constantly look opportunity inorganic growth. bank operate capital minimum level edge bank extent would able seize opportunity merger / acquisition available without loss time. however, would necessary bank improve internal control risk management system embark path inorganic growth. basel ii implementation would enable bank meet pre-requisites place situation take advantage opportunity arise. data issue – implementation basel ii, standardise approach irb approaches, would involve utilisation data compute capital requirements. while dependence data standardise approach would largely similar basel i, data requirement considerable advance approaches. bank would require adequate acceptable historical data compute capital requirement approaches. at minimum bank need historical data compute probability default, loss give default operational risk losses. while build data base bank also need ensure purity integrity data. capacity build – above all, capacity building, bank regulatory body serious challenge, especially regard adoption advance approaches. bank would need focus equip staff suitably handle advance risk management system supervisor need equip equal skill effective supervision. give demand skill sector, level attrition likely high. hence, bank need focus motivate skilled staff retain them. we initiate supervisory capacity-building measure india identify gap ass well quantify extent additional capital, may require maintain banks. the magnitude task, schedule complete december 2006, appear daunt since many 90 schedule commercial bank india. external rat – in situation country domestic rat agency extent rat penetration low capacity bank country relate capital requirement actual underlie risk seriously handicapped. it would necessary develop domestic rat agency look method increase rat penetration rat agencies. use national discretion – a i mention earlier, discretion available national supervisor basel ii framework many aspects. it would necessary national supervisor exercise discretion caution. there could various sector economy may deserve preferential treatment take account national relevance. it would order lighten burden basel ii sector within 5/7 limitation national discretion provide result capital requirement reflect underlie risk sectors. in case situation prevail country reflect high risk would perhaps necessary supervisor factor formulate national rule basel ii implementation. validate concept economic capital – the basel ii framework promote adoption strong risk management practice bank address major risk comprehensively. basel ii, risk sensitive, enable bank bridge gap economic capital regulatory capital. through pillar ii requirement basel ii, bank expect internal methodology assess risk compute capital requirement support risk even bank adopt standardise approach credit risk. this would aid bank move direction build economic capital models, direct business strategies. it possible many bank emerge economy might develop internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap). implementation basel ii would require bank place icaap meet basel ii specifications. the regulator would perhaps require take initiative regard enhance level understand icaap banks, benefit may accrue adoption icaap likely focus supervisory assessment regard. improve governance standard oversight – the basel ii framework place considerable emphasis internal process manage risk manage capital requirements. this along pillar 3 disclosure requirement place tremendous demand governance oversight standard within bank. bank therefore focus energy raise governance oversight standard great heights. the basel committee recognise primary responsibility good corporate governance rest board director senior management banks. corporate governance improve address number legal issue protect promote shareholder rights, clarify governance roles. ensure corporation function environment free corruption bribery; align interest managers, employee shareholder appropriate laws, regulation measures. all help promote healthy business legal environment support sound corporate governance relate supervisory initiatives. in india governance issue address prescribe guideline corporate governance banks. these include fit proper standard board director also shareholder chief executives. in regard, might appropriate mention importance corporate governance relevant state own bank also. the focus standard be, least, equip board bank ask right questions. conclusion basel ii expect foster financial stability risk sensitive framework encourage bank adopt improve risk management practices; require supervisor review efficiency banks’ risk management practice capital allocation methodologies; empower market participant make inform judgement efficiency bank accordingly punish reward banks. while true implementation basel ii end subject financial stability must recognise bank “special”. their sound efficient function critical growth real sector also strengthen social infrastructure. internationally, therefore, bank move centre-stage performance cynosure eyes. acknowledgement input due k. damodaran dr. n.d. jadhav, reserve bank india. 6/7 references: y v reddy: bank sector reform india - overview - institute banker pakistan, karachi, may 2005. jaime

thoroughly understand appropriate interpretation could made. economic statistic often approximation underlie reality attempt measure. even data perfectly measure often discrepancy economic concept would want measure real phenomenon statistic attempt measure. for example gross domestic product seek measure total economic activity, value add take place economy time. it almost impossible measure directly. instead much data estimate surveys. this give rise measurement issue relate coverage, sample non-response, undermine integrity. it therefore normal revision new information improve accuracy

one main reason switzerland's growth slump today. external trade policy always domestic market policy well. consequently, external trade policy instrument effective open domestic market outside. this openness external trade utmost importance, therefore, exporters, also domestic market. be open towards europe towards trade block mutually exclusive. ultimately, open mean pit oneself best,

symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, wyoming, 27 august 2005 * * * my perspective interest stimulate paper raghu rajan much influence observe alan greenspan's approach development financial system regulation past eighteen years.1 i believe greenspan doctrine, i may call that, reflect chairman's analysis deeply hold belief private interest technological change, interact stable macroeconomic environment, advance general economic welfare.2chairman greenspan welcome ability new technology financial market reduce transaction costs, allow creation new instrument enable risk return divide price good meet need borrower lenders, permit previously illiquid obligation securitized traded, make obsolete previous division among type financial intermediary across geographical region operate. at intersection market development monetary policy, lead federal reserve's effort understand implication change financial technology, grow ease house equity extraction, use newly available information market expectation price risk embody market prices. the greenspan doctrine hold developments, balance, improve function financial market real economy support. by allow institution diversify risk, choose risk profile precisely, improve management risk take on, make institution robust. by make intermediary robust give borrower great variety lender tap funds, development also make financial system resilient flexible - good able absorb shock without increase effect shock real economy. and facilitate flow save across market national boundaries, development contribute good allocation resource promote growth. that say greenspan doctrine hold private market always get right. price market drive tendency human nature project recent past - wave complacency gloom - hence subject overshooting. and private parties, leave entirely devices, always produce market structure market relationship consistent adequate protection financial stability. however, action private party protect - chairman greenspan call private regulation - generally quite effective. government regulation risk undermine private regulation financial stability distort incentive moral hazard promise effective role promote financial stability deliver. in situation, government regulation function base clear objectives, narrowly tailor meet objectives, and, give iron law unintended consequences, clearly superior private regulation. regulation justify incentive private regulation weak - perhaps government programs, deposit insurance - market participant likely ineffective, example small saver borrowers. regulation may also justify promote great flow accurate information enable private participant make good inform decisions. 1 the view necessarily reflect member board staff. i thank athanasios orphanides, matthew pritsker, patrick parkinson, vincent reinhart, board's staff, valuable comments. 2 chairman greenspan spell view market regulation many places, much follow synthesis material. his remark "government regulation derivative contracts" february 21, 1997 especially valuable source approach government regulation financial market new technology change market structure imply regulation constantly review; time roll back regulation - example, lift glass-steagall restriction bank organization - benefit competition help financial sector deliver service efficiently effectively. moreover, regulation benefit competition. run regulate unregulated market side side give people choice whether want protection help constrain regulation. some purpose serve multiple regulator function; circumstances, possible adverse consequence competition laxity may small potential regulatory conformity regulator risk-aversion impinge innovation change. the greenspan doctrine perceptible influence evolution market regulatory structure apply them. raghu rajan voice concern evolution. in particular, posit shift depository intermediation professional asset management increase tail risk socially excessive level leave world vulnerable rare potentially serious tail events; suggest way regulation increased. in assess argument, might find useful separate question whether world risky question whether systemic risk risen. the increase ability disentangle risk tailor risk profile mean risk come lodge line investor appetites, change probably tend reduce price risk encourage risky capital project funded. but individual investor great risk need imply increase systemic risk - fat tail great potential loss feed back macroeconomy. in fact, industrial economy mark much le variability output inflation past twenty years. many reason give so-called great moderation, development financial market likely play role make economy resilient. a consequence great diversification risk source funds, problem financial sector le likely intensify shock hit economy financial market . the experience 2001-03 instructive. unusually large decline equity price increase default risk spread - surely tail event definition - reduce wealth raise cost capital aggravate downturn impinge flow funds. financial intermediary trouble cut provision credit, case, many borrower alternative source funds. in addition, see clear upward trend volatility financial asset price past twenty-five years, one might expect herd increase importance. judge option prices, market participant expect volatility financial asset price damp future; also require lower-term premium place fund long terms. i share raghu's nostalgia systemic-risk implication bank-dominated finance. old-style crisis involve impair depository institution substantial spillover effects; repair take time, economic activity affected; emergency measure deal often involve moral hazard aim stabilize ail intermediaries. i think would agree industrial economy suffer great systemic strain problem financial sector past fifteen year japan, remain tie commercial bank model raghu find safest. the macroeconomic effect new-style crisis involve market liquidity, 1998, outsized movement asset price may readily cushion monetary policy aim bolster general level liquidity reduce interest rates. such policy also carry le risk increase moral hazard. although investment manager receive substantial fund directly households, many counterparties sophisticate investor position fiduciary responsibility.

bank england, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, wyoming, 27 august 2005. * * * jackson hole speaker normally draw lesson economic theory one specific area policy. but year try distil lesson practice monetary policy unite state - extraordinarily successful quarter century leadership alan greenspan – theory monetary policy. at celebration long successful career, invite speaker talk length great man allow minute end. it remarkable tribute alan occasion tradition turn head. we remain intrigue say. in minute i allowed, i want describe three important lesson i learn alan time bank england. first, successful central banker require extraordinary degree objectivity. the key recognise economics tell think, think. it set settle conclusion issues. above all, vital never confuse world model. the whole point model abstract wide range factor order think clearly one particular issue. let describe example i shall call “the greenspan approach economics”. it concern ‘lucas critique’. robert lucas’ 1976 paper encourage economist construct model incorporate explicit optimise behaviour household firms. unfortunately, urge policy-makers apply lesson model literally enthusiast engineer approach macroeconomic policy do 1950s 1960s. the greenspan approach economics would advise great caution. the insight lucas critique need think response rational household firm analyse consequence alternative policies. but likelihood particular model capture real economy would respond give change policy vanishingly small. lucas pretend exist single “true” model could draw unequivocal prediction impact policy changes. the second lesson alan’s time federal reserve empirical knowledge confine econometric analysis official statistics. there often crucially important piece information come u qualitative form. these include information business see happen economy. perhaps famous example recent year productivity acceleration u mid-1990s. the extensively revise official u data show productivity begin accelerate 1995. however, visible vintage release 1998. but alan blind ricardo reiss remind u conference, chairman greenspan wait 1998 conclude underlie rate productivity growth might increasing. the key reason talk listen people work business. already may 1996, fed’s model forecast increase inflationary pressure go forward, alan say “it difficult take exist structure nairus, capacity limits, usual potential analysis square measurable way sense anecdotal reports”.1 in uk, seem productivity miracle. but many example importance qualitative data make judgements. for instance, significant flow migration expand potential labour force. by nature, flow accurately reflect official data. but bank england’s business contact able tell u ability recruit new migrant worker grow significant response tight labour market. the third lesson alan teach u consistency time policy framework sustain market economy, achievement unite state last 200 year show clearly. alan, course, stress context price stability. but apply 1 transcript fomc meet 21/05/1996. bi review 56/2005 1 equally well system taxes, property right public good provision prosperity market economy relies. alan famously define price stability follow terms: “price stability best think environment inflation low stable time materially enter decision household firms.” 2 i would suggest implicit prescription alan might write economic policies, monetary policy: namely, economic policy stability best think environment decision household firm materially affect need insure future arbitrary mischievous change government policy. just alan would define good monetary policy one lead people stop talk inflation, i think would call good tax policy one people stop talk tax system. in last decade debate whether stability implement quantitative target not. in monetary policy see spread ‘inflation targets’, target begin permeate area economic policy too. you surprise learn i think numerical target role. but whether appropriate subsidiary question, one relate political economy ensure transparency policy, accountability responsible it, way household firm form expectation policy: monetary, fiscal other. since political economy vary one country another, appropriate method achieve price stability particular, economic policy stability general. the crucial override point market economy cannot flourish policymakers behave way lead private agent expect future economic policy – future monetary, fiscal, legal policy – subject arbitrary capricious changes. of course, expectation stable regime rarely translate stable outcomes, would irresponsible policymakers let misconception take hold. a well design set institution lead response predictable, cannot guarantee outcome be. and press issue here. in us, inflation low rather stable. over past decade vary 1.0% 3.8%, justification say inflation long “materially enter[s] decision household firms.” in uk inflation has, anything, even stable. but success carry risk future. inflation expectation may sensitive large temporary shock move inflation outside range within remain years. with belief stability jolted, households’ inflation expectation might move much justify temporary nature shock. that would make difficult central bank bring inflation back target. the moral particular story may risky infer observation inflation expectation stable well. there time large persistent shock occur, would unwise count inflation expectation remain stable actual inflation start deviate substantially recent range. so three lesson i learn alan: (i) recognition economics set doctrine way thinking; (ii) importance use qualitative quantitative information range sources; (iii) small number fundamental objective crucial judge greenspan yardstick whether free business household burden expend resource deal unnecessary policy volatility. alan’s departure central bank scene deprive u source wisdom, inspiration leadership. to sure, alan’s words, whether speak written, surely still reach u sidelines. to use tennis analogy, i see alan central bank equivalent non-playing captain davis cup team, encourage young le talented members, stress importance footwork, time get position early. alan, thank raise respect others give discipline economics profession central banking. 2 transparency monetary policy. at federal reserve

federal reserve approach implement monetary policy. the federal reserve system create 1913 counter recurrent credit stringency frequently experience early decades. a lender last resort, mandate that, least view today's perspective, limited. we engage systemwide open market operation 1920s. and recently 1950s, framework within open market operation formulate still developed. credit ease economy

please note since introduction current offer mechanism place bank october 2001, hkmc retail bond warmly welcome retail investors. so far, issue seven retail bond total amount hk$10.4 billion. the success mortgage corporation’s debt issue attribute high credit rat (which hong kong sar government) wide range notes, meet different investment need retail investors. the upcoming issue hong kong dollar u dollar denominate notes. this first time hkmc issue u dollar notes. apart diversify fund sources, hkmc’s issuance usd retail bond also serf provide additional investment channel retail investor hong kong. the minimum subscription amount usd bond us$5,000, set reasonable threshold make debt accessible large segment retail investors. this move hkmc issue usd denominate bond fit well

trillion hk dollar deposits. our bank also equivalent hk$1.8 trillion foreign currency deposits. about 70% us$164 billion u dollar deposits. the loan-to-deposit ratio hong kong dollar deposit 87%;

thank invitation evli bank. i intend devote bulk speech subject discussion fairly long time nevertheless become le topical important, namely development house market rise household debt. these factor potentially significant implication task assign riksbank – assignment safeguard financial stability monetary policy objective price stability. that course mean also consequence effort keep real economy good balance. thereafter, i intend say word current monetary policy situation decision take week ago leave repo rate unchanged. a know, executive board occasion – incidentally first time one half year – unanimous decision. since i one different opinion may appropriate elaborate somewhat line reasoning. i want underline, however, question subtle difference assessment reason overdramatise. house price financial stability household increase borrow rapid rate fairly long time now. the rise household debt accompany fast upswing price house market. there clear sign date development begin moderate earnest. in likelihood, limit long continue. the riksbank’s assessment also rate increase slow come year interest rate rise. development property market, chiefly regard commercial property also housing, play important part riksbank’s analysis factor affect stability financial system. a central question judge whether house price development potential pose threat financial stability extent assume drive exaggerate optimism speculation. if drive force significant risk household could difficulty meet interest payment interest rate rise; further, downward adjustment price could dramatic lack realism estimate finally become evident. the combination households’ payment difficulty sharp fall collateral value could potentially cause problem banks. however, unlikely happen sweden several reasons. one house price development country whole – indicate analysis financial stability report publish month ago – seem explain pretty well normal underlie factors. these include course interest rate level, relatively long period low. at end 1996, house price begin rise crisis years, average nominal mortgage rate household around 9 per cent. today, approximately 4 per cent. furthermore, households’ disposable income grow firmly period. another factor, course, development supply side, construction new home modest. this fell dramatically conjunction crisis 1990s begin pick recent years. so appear upswing house price drive general over-optimism among household lenders. it might also worth mention one reason element pure speculation probably small swedish households, unlike countries, mainly buy home live investment. the risk speculative price formation increase country common buy-to-let, investor wait home rise value realise capital gain. this kind speculation likely push house price australia, presumably also uk, u ireland. bi review 88/2005 1 another reason development house market households’ high debt level unlikely pose threat financial stability households’ ability service debt good. on whole, household judge financial margin enable cope rise interest rate temporary loss income without encounter payment difficulties. in addition, banks’ earn good. past experience also show unusual household sector cause banks’ particularly large loan losses. this fairly natural one sense. the decision invest home one important household makes, decision take household often prepare make rather big sacrifice meet obligations. it worth note crisis year begin 1990s, loss loan household sector account 7 per cent banks’ total loan losses. instead, commercial property market account major loss bank system property crisis. this, too, fairly natural explanations. an office build differ home sense interest expenditure intend cover rental income, i.e. income generate investment itself. if office cannot let, income materialise company make investment may force bankruptcy. a household, instead, pay interest income sources. moreover, early 1990s price commercial property push long period without correspond increase rental income. the price rise obviously drive expectation continue strong upswing price future. when eventually become clear expectation go materialise become difficult let premise economic condition weakened, price fell dramatically. today, though, situation commercial property market significantly different. there prolong price upswing kind see house market. in connection equity market decline 2000, demand office premise weaken rent price market office property begin drop. the price fall appear today moderate region price office premise risen. vacancy level still high, though, contribute restrain general upswing rent prices. at time, property companies’ earn ability pay good. our assessment therefore commercial property market either pose threat stability financial system. however, fact presently cannot see general overvaluation house market rule possibility household may base decision overly optimistic estimates. for example, may interpret currently low interest rate le permanent state, rather exception. these household could course run problem interest rate normalise. one question might least worth reflect context whether over-optimism among household could undesirable “side-effect” – albeit temporary one – successful low-inflation policy many countries. what happen past ten year interest rate come fairly dramatically time real economic performance many area remarkably good compare previous periods. it presumably cannot rule situation lull household false sense security, cause make overly optimistic investment decision subsequently prove le well-founded. to extent over-optimism exists, though, should, i mentioned, temporary phenomenon disappear household gain experience economy function low-inflation regime. that household – lender – must endeavour base decision realistic estimate something recommend many time recently, worth repeating. so envisage problem financial system economy whole rather individual household could run difficulties. that course unfortunate enough. that appear general overvaluation house market way mean price cannot fall future either. at least medium report conjunction financial stability report impression riksbank almost guarantee future price decline would happen. that course something cannot do. in main scenario expect average house price inflation moderate gradually – still remain positive – interest rate normalise, mean house price cannot fall part country highly elevated. nor rule general drop price period ahead, even though decline likely le drastic price shoot way could explain development underlie factors. that could case if, example, 2 bi review 88/2005 income fall way cannot foresee today. of course, thing also happen beyond forecast horizon cause house price drop. allow come back moment say even event general price fall deem immediate risk problem financial stability. the reason i give earlier, chiefly household whole afford home experience show household sector seldom cause significant problem banks. so riksbank view development house price household debt danger stability payment system. house prices, demand inflation a i indicate beginning, development house price important monitor also, perhaps even mainly, potential implication riksbank’s second objective – price stability. if house price fall, households’ willingness consume good service – demand– declines. if price drop measure rate long period problem. if price decline occur rapidly reason great vigilance. how house price affect activity level economy? this happen various channels. one channel – i intend mention pass – house construction. the high house price are, profitable build them, thing equal. in likelihood, fast upswing price contribute fact house construction appear pick earnest, although low level interest rate keep finance cost probably also play important role. change house price also affect household consumption alter size households’ wealth. since household consumption comprise half total economic demand potential effect inflation considerable. the impact consumption increase wealth come different ways. one household feel rich therefore become incline consume. in addition, size wealth affect ability obtain loans. the large collateral household put loans, great chance borrow thus consume. when value home own household rises, also create possibility mortgage home further, e.g. build extension renovate raise value home consume goods. another effect high valuation enable household refinance second mortgage part first mortgage thereby reduce interest cost debt. historically, almost surprisingly strong relationship change value households’ real wealth – house tenant-owned apartment – large proportion income household choose consume, so-called consumption ratio. when wealth risen, consumption also do so. in current decade, though, relationship seem weak previous decades. the exact cause entirely clear. a number hypothesis exist.1 one sharp equity market decline begin 2000 may play part. households’ financial asset decrease substantially value time. this may prompt many household high save financial asset order rebuild wealth. that turn counter positive effect consumption rise house prices. another hypothesis weak relationship development wealth consumption reflect fact labour market growth relatively weak despite comparatively high gdp growth. that may give rise great uncertainty future labour market condition future incomes, may induce household high precautionary saving. in assessment make main scenario, continue economic upturn, equity price continue rise labour market situation finally begin improve mark way. that anticipate induce household scale back save cause rise consumption ratio. at time, i say earlier, expect rate increase house price gradually moderate interest rate level normalise. nonetheless, get away fact house price development effect consumption uncertainty factor assessment future economic situation. 1 see box “households’ consumption, debt saving” inflation report 2005:3. bi review 88/2005 3 the debate role asset price monetary policy before i go current monetary policy situation, let briefly say word debate ongoing recent year academic circle central bank world relevance i speak far. i refer role asset price play generally conduct monetary policy. it claim quarter monetary policy focus keep inflation low stable enough guarantee favourable macroeconomic outcome. this claim base observation asset price fluctuate fairly sharply also regime low stable inflation. an example build-up it bubble equity market subsequent dramatic decline market. some even argue risk financial stability increase low-inflation regime. against background, number economist recommend inflation-targeting central bank adjust interest rate basis forecast inflation real economy also respond ”separately” change asset prices. the debate subject easy follow, least various conclusion debate base different model specific assumptions.2 however, i think say dominant view today, least central bank world – i understand – also academic circles, describe follows. a flexible inflation-targeting policy sufficiently good “tool” deal problem arise via price development asset markets. a forward-looking central bank keep mind long-term consequence of, example, prolong rise asset price make interest rate decisions, reason take account asset price consequence ultimate objective – price stability real stability. on hand, situation may necessary central bank attempt look future normal order ”include” impact inflation real economy asset price development may give rise long term. this important dimension flexibility flexible inflation-targeting policy. the reason i bring problem it, opinion, least bear monetary policy consideration face today. i come back moment. the current monetary policy situation let proceed current economic monetary policy situation. the outlook present late inflation report briefly summarise follows. on whole, situation look bright swedish economy. the recent months’ data release reduce uncertainty economic developments, sweden internationally. growth expect firm next years, partly account expansionary economic policy firm export market growth. much also suggest demand labour finally begin pick markedly. a regard price developments, note inflation still low, largely various supply factor contribute low cost pressures. however, inflation expect rise period ahead resource utilisation increase sweden abroad, albeit relatively slow rate. the forecast inflation report’s main scenario mean inflation couple year ahead estimate roughly line target two per cent. the risk high inflation rate, though, mainly stem uncertainty oil price development krona, currently deem large risk low inflation rate. a know, executive board decide leave repo rate unchanged late monetary policy meeting. at time, however, agreement swedish business cycle fairly close point reasonable give monetary policy le expansionary stance. although endorse outlook inflation economy inflation report number u opinion provide scope somewhat different interpretation exactly interest rate need raised. i two member 2 for detail overview debate; see bean, c. (2003), "asset prices, financial imbalance monetary policy: be inflation target enough?", speech bi conference "monetary stability, financial stability business cycle", 28-29 march 2003, basel, switzerland. (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2003/speech200.pdf) 4 bi review 88/2005 interpret analysis way deem increase 0.25 percentage point warrant already time monetary policy meeting. allow say something reason that, opinion, suggest would appropriate take first step towards le expansionary monetary policy begin december. one hardly doubt midst strong, stable cyclical upswing. the economic climate improve u asia swedish labour market show clear sign recovery – least statistic staff company point pick-up demand labour. another reason interest rate rise would reduce risk krona weaken monetary policy country gradually become le le expansionary. the interest rate differential relation euro area u seem recently great significance development krona exchange rate. a third reason – perhaps important – i speak today. my assessment house price household debt may well reach level risk arise self-reinforcing negative spiral fall house price weak demand growth business cycle eventually turn down. even – i already point – case correction overvalue market, adjustment could comparatively abrupt. in opinion, early initiate gradual raise interest rate would increase chance orderly slowdown rate price increases, roughly way uk australia. if i may take liberty make own, perhaps slightly partial favourable, interpretation argument could say fairly well line what, i maintain earlier, appear prevalent view asset prices’ principal role flexible inflation-targeting regime – development asset price situation might make necessary central bank try take account happen beyond normal forecast horizon. so situation, opinion, early initiation shift policy would help reduce risk negative self-reinforcing spiral cyclical slowdown sooner late come. thus, see longer-term perspective, measure could foster stability real economy inflation. i want underline i course mean colleague executive board take kind consideration account, make somewhat different assessment risk currently may appropriate action. so question – i note initially – subtle difference opinion rather case completely different idea economy develop fundamentally need done. when executive board convene

xiaochuan: speed financial reform support economic development west region china speech mr zhou xiaochuan, governor people’s bank china, high-level forum economic development financial service three gorge area, chongqing, china, 15 november 2005. * * * honorable secretary huang, mayor wang, lady gentlemen, i feel please participate high-level forum. within short period 6 year since central government take decision implement strategy develop west region, tremendous change take place chongqing, city long history locate southwest china. though le develop term economic success, west region boast great potential future development. on today’s occasion, i would like share observation could improve financial service support sustainable economic development west region financial system reform innovation. development three gorge area play special significant role development whole west region. through discussion forum, people’s bank china financial institution gain good understand particular area well finance needs. on hand, many issue encounter process economic development area characteristic problem find development whole west region merit attentive research financial sector good solution via reform innovation. a see, exist strong demand west region enhance financial service many enterprise face difficulty like insufficient capital, difficult access direct finance relatively high asset-liability ratio etc. in recent years, despite fact policy commercial financial institution make great contribution economic development west region, constrain natural condition factor high cost long period investment well relatively large proportion traditional industry gdp, strengthen financial support need region modernize agricultural industry, develop small medium-sized enterprise promote economic restructuring. with national economy increasingly run market principles, shall neither rely conventional wisdom “allocating fund credit quotas” , shall excessively use policy loan meet finance need west region. but rather shall forcefully promote financial reform put place financial organization system good function strong competitiveness provide quality financial services. at time, shall make effort improve financial eco-system west region cultivate good market environment retain attract financial resource give market full play fundamental role financial resource allocation. improve financial service west region shall integrate overall reform strategy chinese financial system. in 2003, steer central government, reform state-owned commercial bank officially launched, important progress already make various fronts. in particular, industrial commercial bank china, bank china, china construction bank bank communication complete financial restructure transform join-stock companies. the bank communication china construction bank successfully go public. through reform measures, financial situation bank evidently improved, internal control mechanism strengthen corporate governance start play disciplinary roles. these bank maintain large branch network west region, branch offices, i believe, persistently improve business management adaptability market economy deepen financial reform, thus provide good financial service economic development west region. consistent steady growth chinese economy, policy bank also face problem business transformation. for foreseeable long period time, policy bank still need strengthen support economic development west region, however, due limitation bi review 88/2005 1 bank efficient resource allocation business development, traditional policy bank face challenge transformation business mode. from perspective international experiences, see start 1990s, policy bank various country embark journey business transformation. generally, policy bank transform universal development financial institutions. successful example include korea development bank german development bank (kfw). in line inherent requirement market economy, policy bank china shall transform development financial institution financial viability strong competitiveness mainly engage provide development finance medium long-term project continue provide policy financial service subject fiscal situation state. in case, policy bank could serve finance need industrial restructuring, infrastructure construction implementation “overseas investment strategy” enterprise west region country large sustainable way. though limit asset size capital strength, local financial institution also play important role support regional economic development. on account, need make great effort promote reform local financial institution encourage social participation restructure institution new mechanism feature self-discipline self-development could fundamentally establish ensure healthy growth financial business strengthen financial service regional economic development. in recent years, rural economic development set high standard financial services. in particular west region agricultural industry account large proportion gdp, exist urgent need improve financial service rural areas. the central government stand highly attentive financial work rural area many different occasion stress need “introduce reform innovation rural financial system”. financial reform rural area shall carry line local condition focus explore new path development rural finance. effort shall strengthen construct rural financial system improve functions, rationalize division labor, clear ownership effective supervision, pioneer develop new cooperative financial institution rural area well effective business model ensure combine policy commercial financial support rural economic development. in 2003, pilot reform program rural credit cooperative (rccs) conduct 8 province municipalities. chongqing one municipality participate pilot program far make good progress reform, create sound foundation future endeavors. with support government, rccs release financial burdens, mean complete reform. whether could make progress reform rccs depend critically transformation operate mechanism financial sustainability rccs. success area hold great significance viability development rccs themselves, also realization broad rural economic development strategy. with regard support economic development west region three gorge area, think financial support tilt towards development small medium-sized enterprises, particularly non-public smes, development external sector. a many observed, government orchestrate reform process large commercial bank rccs, large bank medium-sized bank tend emphasize service large corporate clients, emphasize restructure used-to-be loose credit management system, emphasize strengthen internal control consolidate management. however, neglect financial support smes, especially non-public smes. i much appreciate proposal mayor wang highlighted, i le similar viewpoint would like summarize follows: first, financial institution organize way capable provide financial service smes. second, continue provide quality service big corporate clients, large bank take high proportion financial market also strengthen internal research establish new department unit improve credit service smes. third, large enterprise likely turn capital market (equity market bond market) meet finance need future change exert great market pressure commercial banks. therefore, order improve business efficiency, commercial bank pay attention serve small medium-sized clients. 2 bi review 88/2005 fourth, market-based interest rate reform promoted. under leadership state council, people’s bank china gain important progress advance market-based interest rate reform recent years. in day come, continue deepen reform process. determine interest rate follow market principle enable lend institution good cover risk thus improve credit service small medium-sized clients. fifth, mayor wang mentioned, great effort make effectively promote micro credit business. while micro credit business make certain progress rural areas, still long way go meet finance need rural economy. in recent years, many develop country world gain useful experience grow micro credit business worth learning. we need make careful study research matter advance micro credit business prudently. sixth, financial product innovation encouraged. the financial industry industry feature brisk innovation activities. the frequent change introduction new product aim improve allocation economic resource good meet finance need market. in term develop new financial products, gain past unsuccessful experience lesson need draw improve innovation capacity financial institutions. only improve capability product innovation, financial institution good serve finance need smes, non-public enterprise economy three gorge area. finally, i would like stress receipt financial resource region closely associate condition financial eco-system. whether development commercial financial business, sound financial eco-system prerequisite ensure success. in recent years, steady improvement internal control risk management systems, national bank start set internal rat system accordance stipulation basel capital accord ii, adopt approach ass condition financial eco-systems across various regions, guide exercise internal fund allocation, credit plan authorization credit lines. this large extent determine direction amount financial resource movement across regions. in west region industrial foundation relatively weak economic development backward, great effort make improve local financial eco-system attract financial resources. of course, backwardness economic development necessarily imply poor financial eco-system. but financial eco-system west region could effectively improved, would helpful quickly develop comparative advantage attract financial resource provide sustain credit support industrial development restructure region. in term build sound financial eco-system region, apart effort central government establish good legal enforcement system, local government also create favorable platform ensure justice judiciary system provide good protection claim financial institutions, improve credit environment foster mutually beneficial relationship bank enterprises. lady gentlemen, many issue remain deeply study deliberate regard accelerate financial system reform give financial industry great role resource allocation effectively support economic development west region three gorge area particular. in respect, i would like commend valuable research experiment conduct province municipality three gorge area. i also read excellent research paper contain good proposal present conference. i think financial industry support favorable police tailor state facilitate development west region three gorge area bid improve financial service end. i also believe leadership cpc central committee state council concert effort relevant parties, vast west region include three gorge area definitely able embrace economic take-off early date. thank you. bi review 88/2005 3 r jayamaha: basel ii operational risk keynote address dr r jayamaha, deputy governor central bank sri lanka, 10th seacen-fsi regional seminar bank supervisor regulators, colombo, 12 december 2005. * * * it indeed honour invite deliver keynote address seacen - fsi regional seminar bank supervisor regulator implementation basel ii operational risk. i would like take opportunity share think important subject, currently engage attention bank regulators, region, worldwide. i first deal basel ii require separate capital allocation operational risk intend accomplish. next, i discus basel ii deal operational risk contribute financial system stability. finally, i wish mention step regulator take preparation adopt basel ii mitigate operational risk. 2. deregulation globalization financial services, together grow sophistication financial technology make activity bank risk profile complex. in context, well know credit, interest rate market risks, also risk substantial threaten stability financial system. a grow number high-profile operational loss worldwide lead bank supervisor increasingly view operational risk integral part risk management policy. management specific, common day-to-day operational risk new practice; always important bank prevent fraud, maintain integrity internal control reduce error data transaction processing, ensure availability information technology infrastructure back system needed. more often not, operational risk take give little attention pay it. operational risk intrinsic financial institution important component firm-wide risk management systems. however, operational risk hard quantify model market credit risks. operational risk differ bank risks. it risk willfully incur return expect reward implicit ordinary course bank business potential affect risk management process. however, ignorance operational risk failure properly manage risk result misstatement institution's risk profile expose institution significant losses. such institution become regulatory burden. these factor lead basel committee recommend separate capital operational risk. 3. definition operational risk evolve rapidly past years. first, commonly define every type unquantifiable risk face bank, refine considerably include modern day risks. accord basel committee bank supervision, operational risk “risk loss result inadequate fail internal processes, people system external events”. this definition base underlie cause operational risk broad level include legal risk, exclude strategic reputational risks. the basel committee also asserted, “the important type operational risk involve breakdown internal control corporate governance.” that’s basel ii align variety regulation support framework enhance corporate governance. 'management operational risk thus take mean 'identification, assessment / measurement, monitor control mitigation risk. while many risk inherent visible day day operation banks, component applicable supervisor regulators. 4. the bank industry’s awareness operational risk effort manage accelerate recent years, drive part increase desire improve operate efficiency, reduce earn volatility, rationalize allocation capital compete businesses. it easy get bank identify ass operational risk inherent material products, activities, process system particular follow practice new product introduced. to encourage bank focus attention assessment operational risk product processes, regulator aware new products, improvement management information system compute technology open way improve operational risk measurement bi review 88/2005 1 management. in next years, financial institution regulator continue develop various approach operational risk management capital budget techniques. 5. let focus key area operational risk regulatory responsibility interest financial system stability. 6. sound management operational risk particularly important payment, clearing, settlement system risk spread across systemically. all owner operator payments, clear settlement system face operational risk degree may vary system system country country. operational problem payment, clearing, settlement system may impede control of, even exacerbate, type risk market, liquidity, credit risk unanticipated way could pose systemic risk, result participant incur significant losses. it may stop there. payment settlement relate operational risk could filter business banks’ clients, government country’s international correspondent well. this aspect bank operation ignore many year fairly recently regulator bank start address payment settlement relate operational risks. today’s consensus payments, clearing, settlement system must safe, reliable, efficient, secure, critical financial system stability. that’s regulators, central bank particular, become owner operator clear settlement systems. although tendency outsource function, many regulator stage own operate systems. 7. another technology relate risk desire bank acquire lead edge propriety systems, stand alone system specific it systems. bank tend hang onto short-lived approach. individual system costly bank themselves, also customers. the norm attract customers, reduce operational risk reduction transaction cost customers. both often forget ignore bank continuous remind become regulatory responsibility. despite moral suasion bank many country realize gain common atm platforms, back-up sites, disaster recovery site share costs. 8. it may also necessary bank recognize different risk matter different line businesses. a comparison business unit economic capital requirement risk type indicate operational risk high fund management, private banking, retail bank compare corporate banking, insurance business (if bank allow engage in). the new operational risk element expect hit bank specialize area - custodian arrangement asset management. the regulator mindful high operational risk business bring attention banks. 9. uncertainties, regulatory challenge promote bank in light vein, operational risk categorize two, i.e. man-made risk (mistakes, faulty models, frauds, terrorism, war etc.,) god-made risk (earthquakes, floods, tsunami disasters, electrical blackouts, telecom interruption etc.) some well know bank handle ways. complexity assessment process require change it, uncertainty implementation date basel accord, u european banks’ attitude towards implement accord, variability data report factor create uncertainty bank well regulators’ minds. i believe challenge overcome bank encourage adopt systematic approach set basle ii. first foremost, regulator get bank commit risk mitigation cycle consist (a) risk diagnosis (i.e. prioritization objectives, documentation review/meetings build risk control culture profile); (b) risk identification within framework; (c) risk assessment preparation action plan; (d) risk reporting. 10. the choice approach/models bank wish adopt may significant implications. score card, loss distribution internet model popular risk models. all implementation challenges, particular, skill shortage, non-availability reliable data suitable it systems. in-house train course tailor business unit, commitment senior management banks, understand benefit implement basel ii stakeholder hire right skill would help mitigate skill shortage relate risks. regulator supervisor ass progress within reasonable time frame. 2 bi review 88/2005 11. without data, model without models, risk management capability reduced. this mean commonsense approach handle matter discard altogether. give heavy competition highly leverage nature businesses, banks, minimum, record historical data compute probability default loss, operational risk losses. this difficult task. the challenge bank build database operational losses, historical potential future losses. the challenge regulator ensure bank start collect type data systematic manner. bank often see regulator pain neck due constant nagging. perhaps, moral suasion organize peer pressure might encourage banks. 12. unbundling risk relate capital charge new basel ii capital accord require explicit capital charge operational risk. calculate capital charge prove extremely difficult lack accept methodology credible industry data. this require adoption strategy permit bank use internal measurement approach – subject quantitative qualitative criterion and, transitional basis, minimum floor capital charge. assess validate different internal risk mitigation measure would regulatory challenge. 13. the basel committee put forward framework consist three option calculate operational risk capital charge ‘continuum’ increase sophistication risk sensitivity. there three approach pillar i: (i) basic indicator approach operational risk i, require flat rate 15% fix percentage gross annual income; (ii) standardize approach operational risk ii require risk charge base annual income per business line, multiply risk factor per business line; (iii) advance measurement approach operational risk iii require full reliance bank’s internal risk management system subject supervisory review. many central bank include central bank sri lanka propose initially allow bank adopt basic indicator approach compute regulatory capital operational risk. they expect move along range towards sophisticate approach develop acceptable operational risk management system practices, meet prescribe qualify criteria. accord dc independent survey 2003 kpmg’s 2nd global survey basel readiness assessment 190 institution 19 countries, increasingly, bank appear move towards advance measurement approach rather standardize approach deal operational risk. a central bank sri lanka, decide follow consultative process implement basel ii norm move gradual, sequential co-coordinated manner, dialogue already begin banks. a steer committee comprise representative bank supervisor take stock issue relate implementation. here too, regulator need top thing ass readiness banks. 14. conclusion let sum key message address. today, degree sophistication financial market urge market participants, include regulator supervisors, increase focus risk management effort build robust sound financial system position participate fully complex fast-paced financial environment. in sense, basel ii, aim strengthen soundness stability international bank system, offer unique opportunity respond concern pay attention main source risk vulnerability could pose challenge financial system stability. 15. implementation basel ii describe long journey rather destination itself. the journey certainly tough thought. undoubtedly, would require commitment substantial capital human resource part bank supervisors. for banks, main challenge appear skill shortage data inadequacy couple uncertainty regard cost associate implementation. bank world start voice concern mount regulatory costs. it regulatory responsibility encourage bank phase implementation programme start traditional baseline scenario identification operational risks, assessment, awareness monitor integrate element period. basle ii implementation operational risk mitigation process put heavy burden supervisor detect problem banks, stay top late advance risk management avoid abuse many power give supervisors. all much supervisor bear many u still learn curve. exchange information within outside region would important particularly capacity build evaluation validation risk assessment model banks. this seminar one joint effort central bank sri lanka bi review 88/2005 3 seacen centre, would provide good opportunity exchange information learn other. 16. basel ii expect foster financial stability risk sensitive framework encouragement bank adopt improve risk management practices. supervisor regulator require review efficiency banks’ risk management practice capital allocation methodologies, empower market participant make inform judgment efficiency banks. despite challenges, many researcher suggest basel ii lead rise reward discipline bank industry. the indicator pay back get basel ii right look beyond mere compliance real business benefit great originally anticipated. encourage bank understand believe enhance economic capital framework would key high performance undoubtedly regulatory challenge. 17. i believe deliberation seminar improve knowledge way mean deal regulatory challenge pose basel ii operational risk mitigation measures. i wish seminar success thank attention. 4 bi review 88/2005 xiang junbo: deepen financial reform create favorable environment enterprise speech mr xiang junbo, deputy governor people’s bank china, euro finance china conference 2005, shanghai, 9 november 2005. * * * lady

schieritz publish financial time financial time deutschland 19 december 2005. * * * mr papademos, responsibility ecb vice-president financial stability issues. be risk financial stability interest rate remain low great risk involve short-term rate rising? a comparison risk involve short-term rate rise risk financial stability rate remain low easy, depend relative assessment two type risk magnitude potential increase short-term rates. on whole, i would expect potential increase global interest rate – necessarily euro area – moderate anticipate involve risk financial stability. needle add, size possible risk differ across country sectors. let elaborate. when interest rate remain low level long period time, may entail risk financial stability result effect households, corporation financial institutions. for example, low interest rate contribute rapid rise household debt fast increase house price many country euro area, also elsewhere. the sustainability household indebtedness relate credit risk interest rate rise depend ability household service debt buffers. in euro area, despite increase indebtedness, household comfortable buffers. debt-to-asset ratio sufficiently low euro area whole, ability household service debt expect substantially affect potential future increase interest rates. of course, impact high rate household debt-servicing cost differ across country socio-economic groups. among investors, low level global interest rate contribute so-called “search yield” flatten yield curve. at least investor tend acquire asset high risk without require commensurate high rate return. the low interest rate may influence investors’ risk-return preferences. and environment high interest rates, may readjustment preference consequence level long-term interest rates. for corporations, low level interest rate help improve balance sheet period excessive investment borrowing. this restructuring, repair balance sheets, important euro area. more recently, however, low interest rate fuel increase borrow tendency firm borrow short term, rather long term. but despite development past year, ratio short-term long-term obligation euro area firm high. the flatten yield curve exert pressure bank profits. however, profitability euro area bank evolve satisfactory manner result positive influence factors, increase lending, especially mortgage lending, high non-interest income consequence cost cut reduction flow provisions. low interest rate may encourage bank increase hold risky asset could implication credit condition change interest rate increase. be say risk economic growth rise interest rates? it thing, present circumstance consequence would similar. with respect specific adjustment monetary policy stance ecb take place early month, i would expect significant adverse effect, any, ongoing economic recovery euro area. will general global monetary policy tighten impact euro area growth? bi review 87/2005 1 in principle, tighten monetary policy – global domestic - would expect contain aggregate demand growth. the extent, however, effect depend initial condition influence variety factors. in us, despite substantial increase interest rate since middle 2004 follow fairly long period low interest rates, economic growth remain robust cumulative impact previous monetary accommodation factor least partly counterbalance effect high interest rates. an important channel monetary policy influence economy effect long-term interest rates. if long-term interest rate remain low level – result favourable inflation expectation influence credible monetary policy orient towards price stability consequence impact factors– effect economic activity rise short-term interest rate go muted. moreover, expect strength euro area economic growth come year mainly base project evolution internal demand. which effect strong - impact high short-term rate growth, beneficial effect low long-term rates? well, depend course term-structure debt proportion long-term debt variable rates. but general point i would like emphasise although high level short term rate expect dampen growth principle, may dampen growth practice influence factors, include determine function labour market productivity growth. could recent move ecb represent case increase interest rate might stimulate growth? i would agree this. public perception expectation future inflation favourably influence change monetary policy stance aim preserve price stability. it [a high level interest rates] could foster expectation low inflation high real disposable incomes, increase confidence, particularly country public perception current inflation le favourable actual inflation financial markets’ inflation expectations. [so] expect adjustment high interest rate orderly? your question suggest certainty high interest rate coming. i think clarify decided, ex-ante, engage series interest rate increases. so i answer question general way, hypothetical question whether evolution interest rate towards high level orderly? a far policy rate [set central banks] concerned, important future change well understand market public predictable. a regard change market rates, particularly potential adjustment long-term rate partly response change monetary policy stance, i would say likely scenario would one orderly adjustment, although relationship long-term short-term rate complex. although risk abrupt correction level long-term interest rate result impact developments, likely outcome basis currently available information. be risk house price bubble bursting? it always difficult identify whether property price rise indicative bubble property price influence change fundamental well speculative behaviour. we know number countries, include house price increase fast pace, france, spain italy, fundamental factor account least substantial part change prices. on basis estimate make try ass extent bubble exist, one say country indication overvaluation property prices, many caveat associate estimate difficulty disentangle fundamental speculative effects. on whole, i would say slowdown pace increase house price likely risk correction – is, decline – small period ahead. needle say, condition house market size associate risk differ considerably across countries, even across region within countries, euro area. 2 bi review 87/2005 will ecb raise interest rate come months? the change ecb’s monetary policy stance early december necessary prudent. it necessary order preserve price stability medium term view several upside risk price stability identify order send clear signal ecb determine continue pursue credible policy preserve price stability medium term continue anchor inflation expectation price stability. it prudent act promptly view increase upside risks, take account long lag involve change monetary policy effect price developments. it also prudent decide moderate change stance, take account uncertainty surround evolution effect determinant inflation dynamics. with regard future, decide ex ante engage series interest rate increases. in future assess, usual, relevant information analyse order reach conclusion outlook price stability medium long term. on basis assessment, decision take regard monetary policy stance reason case communicate anything said. what perfectly clear ecb’s commitment determination fulfil mandate deliver price stability. in general, ecb follow different strategy follow u feed raise interest rates? do difference relate change economic circumstances, conceptual differences? the difference mainly relate economic circumstance and, precise, difference assessment economic outlook particular outlook price stability. in us, policy stance change decision preannounce measure increase interest rate make time interest rate low level 1 per cent stay level considerable period also time assess inflationary pressure build demand supply side american economy. our case somewhat different. first, high level interest rate decision take change monetary policy stance. second, assessment outlook price stability inflation expect stay 2 per cent period time expect moderate gradually.. in absence second-round effects, relatively modest increase unit labour costs, partly relate fact pace recovery moderate still output gap high rate unemployment, expect help contain inflationary pressures. but several significant upside risk surround assessment. it therefore important second-round effect oil price avoid monetary policy help minimise likelihood risk materialise. from conceptual point view, i agree monetary policy predictability desirable feature enhance policy effectiveness. however, predictability require, general, give explicit signal pre-announcing medium-term evolution monetary policy stance. what perspective long- term growth potential eurozone? have low estimates? in past, report range estimate potential growth 2 2.5 per cent euro area obtain academic research. there risk that, unless change policy – reform labour product market - well behaviour private economic agents, range may revise downwards. but work assumption action take strengthen potential growth euro area. to cut long story short, main way potential growth could increase policy boost productivity growth raise labour utilisation increase average hour work participation rate labour market make market flexible adaptable. i would agree pace reform area relatively moderate, progress make number country overall sentiment need for, support of, reform change right direction. the experience nordic country illustrate possible implement reform significant positive impact employment growth without time change fundamental way social model place. bi review 87/2005 3 what implication assumption potential growth productivity economist would see neutral level eurozone interest rates? a simple concept neutral, natural, rate interest long term one derive model long term economic growth equilibrium real interest rate determine productivity growth, demographic save preferences. estimate concept natural real interest rate range 2 3 per cent. the estimate range suggest uncertainty value – uncertainty great imply fact i mention range number. another, short-term, concept natural interest rate real rate ensure macroeconomic equilibrium every point time potential output level consistent price stability. this real rate fluctuate considerably precisely different factor shock impinge supply demand product asset market vary time. estimate concept real interest rate broadly similar range i mention early [2-3 per cent], though close low limit. but uncertainty surround estimate higher. these useful concept monitor see evolve time, play prominent role ecb’s strategy determine monetary policy stance. they useful benchmark – intermediate objective – use together measure – output gap difference unemployment rate could label ‘natural’ rate unemployment – provide information strength inflationary pressure economy. at unemployment rate inflationary pressure start build eurozone? there various estimates. recent research ecb academic economist international institution suggest natural rate unemployment nairu [non-accelerating inflation rate unemployment] currently close 8 per cent. this surprisingly disappointingly high, imply that, thing equal, certain limit impose function labour market conduct stability-oriented monetary policy. these estimate emphasise importance reform would contribute reduce unemployment rate compatible price stability. if nairu reduced, high level employment low rate unemployment support monetary policy without create inflationary pressures. some eurozone politician suggest eurozone eurogroup could form basis enhance cooperation within european union. if eurozone develop political character, survive long term? there suggestion may potentially useful i see precise proposal specify framework mechanism achieve enhance cooperation practice. a central banker i feel would appropriate comment mean enhance political integration euro area. if change institutional structure deep political integration within euro area, monetary policy function effectively? my answer would straightforward yes, without imply certain institutional improvement economic political front would help enhance function european monetary union. what important economic policy and, particular, fiscal policy consistent with, supportive of, objective monetary union, include objective price stability. the present institutional framework overall adequate allow ecb perform task effectively. otmar issing step executive board member next may. would like take role ecb chief economist? i read speculation press i prefer comment. the decision take executive board together new colleague. 4 bi review 87/2005 david dodge: promote economic integrity remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, rcmp management retreat, ottawa, 25 october 2005. * * * thank you, good evening. when commissioner zaccardelli ask speak retreat, i glad accept. in fact, i'm honour part inception rcmp's new strategic priority - economic integrity. it's surprise bank canada interest promote economic integrity. after all, bank canada act mandate us, far possible within scope monetary policy action, "promote economic financial welfare canada." we commit promote economic well-being country citizens. we monetary policy, role federal government's banker, issuance canada's paper currency. and constantly work promote confidence sound, safe financial system. a year ago, commissioner coin phrase "safe homes, safe communities". your new strategic priority add third element phrase - "a safe economy". more ever before, law-enforcement community critical role play strengthen preserve security economic interest canada. now ever, bank canada, rcmp, police agency across canada work together achieve goal. good police economic police a focus promote safe economy new rcmp police agencies. it part everyday police - provide safe place citizen live work. but mean safety economy? for u involve nation's finances, mean prevent activity undermine canadians' confidence economy. it mean fight counterfeit currency goods, credit card fraud, identity theft, money laundering, on. and mean prevent erosion confidence financial markets. public company need capital invest create jobs. government need capital build infrastructure. investor provide capital expectation put good use yield good returns. in turn, investor rely return finance needs, homes, retirement, education children. all activity take place unless player confident treat fairly, operate level play field. we know investment subject risk loss - nature markets. properly-functioning financial market price investment accord degree risk economic merit. but market function properly, price appropriately, information function correct. if misinformation deception - suspicion fraud - market cannot work efficiently. let explain further. when fraud, market operate incorrect information. clearly, result private loss individual investor act wrong information. but also cause general loss confidence - loss affect economy whole. in absence trust information correct, market cannot function, society whole poor it. that's account standards, security regulations, law prohibit economic crime. there significant social benefit properly function market. and severe social cost market function poorly. economic crime erode faith canadian foreign investor integrity financial systems, currency, governments, businesses, products. these crime undermine financial health reputation country. they far victimless. ultimately, bi review 87/2005 1 victim crimes, erode confidence financial system. and take long time lot effort investment re-establish public confidence lost. that's view economic crime every bite serious certain crime violence. it true fraud le physically dangerous arm robbery. but social damage every bite severe. both type crime undermine trust people society. that's computer hacker steal company much criminal bank robber steal bank branch. and illegal inside trader hijack million dollar pocket investor le criminal thief commit arm robbery. in cases, specific loss property exacerbate widespread loss confidence. let's look example that's close home bank canada - paper currency, one tangible product. when individual get stick fake bill, amount lose may small. but again, aggregate impact matters. cash transaction still account large percentage economy, use cash continue grow every year. if people lose faith currency, economic social cost immense. the impact windsor $100 counterfeit year back last reminder costs. maintain public's trust canada's paper money job bank take seriously. many police agency already working, either implicitly explicitly, protect economic integrity. you've fight economic component conventional crime - launder proceed drug sale - well economic crime - fraud, counterfeiting, computer hacking. by improve ability fight specific economic crimes, improve ability fight crime. in matter personal public safety, police organization know long time enforcement cannot effective without active cooperation citizen communities. enforcement alone sufficient improve safety home streets. prevention, education, community initiative role play. police officer also rely help broad range complementary experts: psychologists, lawyers, community workers, public health officers, on. that spirit cooperation vital come protect economic integrity. no one police agency fight alone terrorist financing, money laundering, counterfeiting, financial market fraud. this become especially true recent years, grow sophistication financial instrument trade technologies. it's much easy hide one's identity, steal someone else's, use internet anonymous networks. and easy confuse people ever complex financial schemes. the good news we've already see effective police mount sustain coordinate effort reduce type crime. integrate proceed crime team make increasingly difficult criminal profit illegal activities. the launch integrate market enforcement team 2002 help boost public confidence capital markets. these still early days, work team noticed. the bank solidly behind integrate approach enforce law economic crime. special team skill resource need conduct complex investigation lead successful prosecution so-called "professional criminals." this year, develop national counterfeit enforcement strategy. a result initiative, appear may soon specialize integrate counterfeit enforcement team (icets) place, fight serious threat pose currency counterfeiting. be assure colleague i applaud strongly support vital efforts. however, i know difficult generate support fund new initiatives. i understand frustrate must investigate complicate crime without adequate skilled resource support. and i understand frustration police spend time resource investigate offences, see criminal walk away little punishment social cost crime always fully recognized. that's bank work law enforcement community train material legal tool help prosecutor present case effectively. further progress require coordinate effort multidisciplinary approach. vocal championship leader public private sector need canadian government appreciate support investment specialize enforcement team effective prosecution sentencing. a governor canada's central bank, responsibility 2 bi review 87/2005 intention i increase awareness importance protect economic integrity. that bank been, continue be, commit partner law-enforcement authority participant legal system. challenge protect economic integrity you bank canada share compel objective: make canada safe place earn living, business, invest. so, challenge face regard? canada strong financial system, low stable inflation, healthy economy. our regulatory governance structure sound, evolve meet challenge new technology. so canada's bank note - contain best security feature world but evidence canada risk become safe opportunistic criminal deal white collar crime. this may lack adequately resourced enforcement regime strong sentence precedents. it may also perception market may safe be, perception enforcement tough ought be. so we're battle two fronts: need thwart opportunistic criminals, must see so. another challenge also traditional strength canada's economy, openness. this openness help u become one world's great trade nations, model multiculturalism. canada see attractive place people live, invest, business, trade with. but, i've said, open economy make u target international economic criminals. that's need effective public private sector governance sound regulatory enforcement practice nurture strong business sound financial systems. a third challenge need ensure law current judiciary well-informed. the mere detection crime - speak prosecution - sophisticate activity. it require accountants, actuaries, commercial lawyers, financial specialists, computer experts. most importantly, need skilled investigator able collect, analyze, assemble complex evidence. and require inform prosecutor able effectively marshal evidence courtroom. to meet three challenges, need continue work efficiently together - across specialty institutions. no single institution gather manage expert cooperate new environment. police know role fight economic crime. but manufacturers, issuer high-value instrument (such currency, securities, passports), financial institution also key role play. we must make product service secure possible. and must remain profitable or, case public sector institutions, cost effective. now ever, entail considerable expenditure create deploy highly sophisticated, reliable, easy-to-use product services. our new canadian journey series bank note good example effort make regard. a organization make investments, must put even great emphasis security, quality, service. they must audit supervise high standards. regulators, overseers, users, board directors, legal community, general public stake outcome. track bad guy collect evidence responsibility rcmp law enforcement agencies. bring strong case court crown rest prosecutors. by work together, hope sentence reflect importance crime. but achieve goal require active collaboration. that easy say, devilishly tough achieve. knowledge share difficult even within homogeneous organization. share information expertise across separate independent organization even harder. but critical succeed. the rcmp's creation strategic priority economic integrity tremendous step towards achieve goal, two reasons. first, initiative vehicle internal resource mobilized. the imets excellent example i'm confident icets be, too. second, initiative become conduit share knowledge, information, resource bi review 87/2005 3 partners, include bank canada. through well-organized partnership, succeed goal enhance preserve economic integrity country. on behalf bank canada - i'm sure i speak security commission market regulator - let say appreciate efforts, full enthusiastic support. conclusion everybody room commit make canadian secure, homes, communities, business work lives. a so, imperative continually remind crime extend beyond physical. economic crime hard investigate prosecute. but every bite damage well-being canadians, important fight effort. that's i applaud decision make economic integrity strategic priority. and i renew bank canada's commitment work together rcmp enforcement agency help make canadian economy safe place investors, businesses, fellow citizens. 4 bi review 87/2005 niklaus blattner: switzerland’s real estate market introductory remark mr niklaus blattner, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 15 december 2005. * * * competition swiss real estate market undoubtedly become stiff recent times. this basically good thing. moreover, different market player observer point time bank become competitive, also le cautious. mortgage lend part banks’ core business. the swiss national bank (snb) therefore decide analyse current situation development swiss real estate market detail. the snb mandate contribute stability financial system. the question ask following: be sign fierce competition real estate market associate excessive risk may ultimately threaten stability bank system? the national bank’s analysis base statistical data regard bank activity result survey conduct among number bank specifically purpose. the random sample cover bank total market share 70%. the main result survey show strong competition real estate market far destabilise effect bank sector switzerland. modest rise swiss real estate price overall among things, assessment base development real estate prices. in switzerland whole, real estate price experience moderate rise past years. moreover, general price level still considerably low record high reach ten year ago. by contrast, owner-occupied apartment interest deviation trend. they rise sharply late, almost equal 1990 high. econometric estimate equilibrium price additionally carry also fail indicate overheat swiss real estate market whole. we arrive conclusion even assumption significantly high interest rate level today’s, would result mark correction capitalise value real estate. our assessment base observation switzerland whole. it exclude possibility excess individual region certain part real estate market. bi review 86/2005 1 graph 1: development mortgage claim real estate price source: snb, wüest & partner no sign bank take great risk since end 2002, mortgage claim record annual growth rate 6%. this quite substantial compare rather moderate trend real estate prices. it appear expansion mortgage claim drive much real estate prices, number loan requests. consequently, grow demand loan likely attributable factor expectation speculative boom real estate prices. the crucial question following: be high demand loan due excessively harsh competition among bank lead cheap credit reflect actual risk incurred? how relatively strong growth mortgage loan impact bank risks? to answer question, take close look banks’ risk behaviour. several indicator lead u believe bank hardly engage excessive risk taking. while true interest rate margins, i.e. spread mortgage rate banks’ finance costs, fall slightly mid-2005, bank expense decline time. in final analysis, therefore, profit margin virtually constant even slightly higher. the profit margin correspond difference interest rate margin total operate expense express percent loan volume – reflect expect risk – total value adjustment provisions. the banks’ profit margin thus also serf cover unexpected risks. give profit margin remain constant move slightly higher, banks’ risk-taking capacity diminish spite pressure interest rate margins. this presupposes, however, bank make realistic value adjustment provisions. we currently assume case. moreover, average lend limit mortgage loan change insignificantly may regard cautious. for instance, proportion low-risk first mortgage – i.e. mortgage low lend limit – 90%. the criterion use extend loan also rat conservative. a rule, assessment debtor’s future solvency base considerably high interest rate current ones. mortgage debtor therefore able meet liability even mark increase interest rate level. our analysis focus system-relevant bank different group banks. we rely aggregate data random sample bank group banks. problem individual institution cannot exclude threaten system stability. increase interest rate risk these assessments, far positive, become slightly cloud high interest rate risks. small bank particular see relatively strong increase direct interest rate risks. a sharp rise interest rate level could affect valuation asset liability bank extent capital resource would case reduce considerably. while loss could still absorbed, would, however, consider rise interest rate risk critical. 2 bi review 86/2005 graph 2: interest rate risk bank group (reduction net present value percentage equity follow interest rate shock +100 basis points) source: snb conclusion: increase efficiency without high risk the slight narrow interest rate margin support assumption increasingly fierce competition mortgage market. from viewpoint consumer economic efficiency, would welcome development. however, bank business always danger fierce competition might encourage excessive risk take banks. a bank outperform competitor offer favourable condition time accept poor risk cover. however, already mentioned, aggregate analysis suggest caution waned. banks’ gross margin decline slightly cost save improvement efficiency pass customers. the capacity absorb risk compromise grant customer good conditions. currently, positive aspect healthy competition take hold without apparently negative side effects. the snb nevertheless keep close watch trend real estate market. in particular, monitor interest rate risks, already reach high level. with appropriate normalisation money market rates, snb contribute limit danger abrupt rise interest rates. in current environment historically low rates, however, guarantee future trend interest rate moderate. sharp fluctuation market rate possibility. this fact bank must bear mind manage interest rate risks. bi review 86/2005 3 jean-claude trichet: european financial integration speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, 10th symposium finance, banking, insurance, university karlsruhe, karlsruhe, 16 december 2005. * * * 1. introduction lady gentlemen, i please speak today occasion 10th symposium finance, banking, insurance. i would like congratulate organiser arrange internationally esteem conference university karlsruhe. karlsruhe, former residence duke baden, beautifully locate rhine black forest, also situate right middle europe. and europe heart topic i discus speech today. this symposium traditionally aim strengthen link theory practice, address late development wide range finance issues. this second factor underlie choice topic. today, i talk european financial integration. this subject interest market participants, policy-makers academic alike, utmost interest european central bank (ecb). in fact, govern council ecb formulate mission eurosystem (comprising ecb euro area national central banks) follows: “we eurosystem primary objective maintenance price stability common good. act also lead financial authority, aim safeguard financial stability promote european financial integration.”1 i structure remark follows. first, i explain link financial integration monetary policy financial stability. i present current state financial integration euro area base indicator financial integration recently publish ecb. finally, i mention specific activity eurosystem contribute foster financial integration, i highlight topical eu policy issue field european financial integration. 2. the link financial integration monetary policy financial stability in accordance task refer eurosystem’s mission statement, i first discus link financial integration monetary policy, address relationship financial integration financial stability. in line good academic practice, i start definition. the ecb define financial integration follows: consider market give set financial instrument service fully integrate potential market participant market (i) subject single set rule decide deal financial instrument services, (ii) equal access set financial instrument services, (iii) treat equally operate market. while definition describe state full, perfect, integration, know practice face process. the two actor strive foster financial integration market participant relevant public authorities. more specifically, eurosystem view financial integration first foremost market-driven process. in addition this, believe basic task relevant public authority create framework conducive foster financial integration. if opportunity create exploit market forces, true financial integration achieved. 1 see ecb’s website http://www.ecb.int/ecb/html/mission.en.html. bi review 86/2005 1 financial integration affect three major component financial system, namely financial markets, relate market infrastructures, financial institutions. in fact, financial integration affect component simultaneously alter function interaction. financial integration therefore directly relevant ecb’s tasks. with regard relationship financial integration monetary policy, first, well-integrated financial system essential implementation monetary policy enhance smooth effective transmission monetary policy impulse throughout euro area, process monetary policy decision affect price level particular economy general. in fact, financial system fully integrated, possibility single monetary policy decision would sometimes channel country completely uniform manner. the degree financial integration therefore important determine effectiveness transmission: high degree financial integration, effectively transmission work practice. second, generally accept financial integration key factor development modernisation financial system, which, turn, lead efficient allocation capital increase potential economic growth. the recently renew lisbon programme two main goals: strengthen growth increase employment europe. the ecb fully support programme. the structural reform necessary respect, improve flexibility adaptability labour market increase competition market good services, also enhance effectiveness monetary policy maintain price stability minimise output volatility response adverse price shocks. the need proceed structural reform fully apply european financial integration. financial market yet fully integrate potential increase economic growth must exploited. for example, study estimate potential result integration european bond equity market term additional gdp growth around 1% ten-year period, approximately eur 100 billion.2 moreover, 311 million people euro area, or, generally, 459 million citizen european union, expect europe deliver economic benefits. a central banker, i conscious fact implementation structural reform increase economic potential euro area also facilitate conduct monetary policy. to summarise, enhance european financial integration increase potential great sustain non-inflationary economic growth. i turn link financial integration financial stability. the task contribute safeguard financial stability provide treaty establish european community. the ecb provide outcome monitor euro area-wide financial stability financial stability review make available public. our late report publish one week ago.3 let first make general remark task ass stability financial system. although, like case monetary policy assessment, yet widely accepted, rigorous framework summarise development financial stability single quantitative measure, many financial stability assessment undertake grow number central bank around world base broad forward-looking notion financial stability.4 financial stability often see perspective avoidance financial crises, large dimension. financial system stability require financial system’s principal component – financial markets, relate market infrastructures, financial institution – jointly capable 2 london economics (2002), “quantification macro-economic impact integration eu financial markets”, report european commission. 3 the december 2005 ecb financial stability review, publish 8 december 2005, available ecb’s website http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/financialstabilityreview200512en.pdf. 4 see special feature “assessing financial stability: conceptual boundary challenges”, june 2005 ecb financial stability review, “measurement challenge assess financial stability”, december 2005 ecb financial stability review, ecb’s website http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/financialstabilityreview200506en.pdf http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/financialstabilityreview200512en.pdf, respectively. 2 bi review 86/2005 absorb adverse disturbances. it also require financial system facilitate smooth efficient reallocation financial resource saver investors, financial risk assess price accurately risk efficiently managed. financial stability important forward-looking dimension: inefficiency reallocation capital shortcoming price risk can, lay foundation future vulnerabilities, compromise future financial system stability and, therefore, economic stability. a lack stability directly relate inefficiency may arise non-integrated financial system. be aware link financial integration financial stability therefore essential. the link financial integration financial stability twofold. on one hand, integrate financial market offer good opportunity finance risk diversification, thus help improve capacity economy absorb shocks. cross-border bank broaden deepen financial market increase liquidity risk sharing. a pool available asset investment broadened, potentially enhance heterogeneity financial institutions’ portfolios, ensue wide spread portfolio-related risk reinforce resilience shock-absorption capacity financial intermediaries, thus improve soundness robustness integrate financial system. on hand, intermediary benefit great availability assets, parallel convergence individual portfolio may result. we therefore need good degree understand effect cross-border linkage increasingly integrate financial system. to summarise, financial integration progressively strengthen stability financial system time. but structural transformation financial system enhance financial integration, include creation intensify cross-border financial links, require closely monitor financial integration process. i would finally like emphasise financial integration relevant monetary policy financial stability. this bring neatly second part speech, namely illustrate current state evolution financial integration euro area. 3. the state european financial integration in discussion topic, argument often qualitative nature, state general need enhance financial integration view relate benefits. notwithstanding this, quantitative measure offer advantage able ass current level financial integration well evolution time, i.e. whether integration progressing, stable, even regressive. the ecb therefore seek devise way capture, quantitative terms, state financial integration euro area. about two month ago, first time, ecb publish set indicator regard state integration euro area financial bank markets. with accompany explanatory report, publish annual basis, ecb aim measure monitor financial integration euro area time.5 before turn actual assessment state financial integration, let briefly mention conceptual issues. first, check validity law one price natural basis development quantitative measure financial integration. the law one price state asset identical risk returns, price identically regardless transacted. the law one price implication definition financial integration, i mention earlier. and, fact, integration measure explicitly depend it. still, case law one price directly applicable. for instance, asset may allow list another region’s exchange. while law one price little say case, would consider important obstacle financial integration. 5 the ecb report available http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/indicatorsfinancialintegration200509en.pdf ecb’s website. the statistic underlie financial integration indicator access http://www.ecb.int/stats/finint/. the financial integration indicator update semi-annually. bi review 86/2005 3 i like note first publication indicator financial integration expanded. while first publication contain total 20 indicators, cover main euro financial bank markets, coverage indicator enhanced, particular add indicator relate integration market infrastructure financial institutions. second, start definition financial integration, two broad category indicator considered: price-based indicator quantity-based indicators. price-based indicator measure discrepancy asset price base geographic origin. in perfectly integrate market, price asset similar characteristic mostly influence common euro area factors. quantity-based indicator use investigate extent investor engage cross-border asset portfolios. finally, note indicator either compute model-based. compute indicator – standard deviation ratio – summary measure underlie data, whereas model-based indicator derive econometric models. obviously, estimate depend specific set model assumptions. now i address conceptual issues, i report result form assessment state financial integration euro area. now then, i additionally mention figure unite state usefully serve comparison euro area. our first publication cover money market, government bond market, corporate bond market, equity market bank markets. the euro act major catalyst integration euro financial markets. however, degree integration differ market segments, integration advance market segment close single monetary policy, money market. our indicator measure financial integration euro money market base dispersion lend rate actual transaction rate offer eonia, euribor eurepo panel banks.6 the unsecured interbank deposit market almost perfectly integrate right start monetary union. this sine qua non monetary policy implementation, since integrate interbank market ensure even distribution central bank liquidity homogeneous level short-term interest rate across euro area. this rapid integration mostly support establishment relate payment system infrastructure, i.e. target system operational since first day monetary union. in fact, cross-country standard deviation average overnight lend rate among euro area country low three basis point early 1999 since decrease even one basis point. by comparison, january 1998, i.e. one year start monetary union, indicator stand high 130 basis points. our indicator one-month 12-month maturity also consistently show highly integrate unsecured money market. while respective cross-country standard deviation euribor lend rate among euro area country stand 100 basis point one-month maturity, around 50 basis point 12-month rate january 1998, since early 1999 indicator show value high than, normally below, one basis point. finally, indicator also confirm relatively high degree integration repo market. the eurepo index launch march 2002, since then, euro area cross-country standard deviation one-month eurepo rate around, normally below, one basis point. the indicator 12-month maturity show standard deviation around, normally below, two basis points. the decisive role euro enhance financial market integration also visible interest rate derivative markets. the total euro interest rate otc derivative contract reach daily turnover around eur 380 billion, thereby large u dollar segment (a daily turnover around eur 290 billion). a particularly important segment euro interest rate swap market (including, example, euro overnight index swap market). this is, fact, large interest rate 6 data refer time introduction eonia euribor average overnight, one-month, 12-month rates, respectively, euro area countries. 4 bi review 86/2005 swap market world. with daily turnover around eur 250 billion, euro interest rate swap market one third large equivalent u dollar segment (around eur 160 billion).7 the least integrate money market segment short-term security market. compare equivalent u commercial paper market, outstanding amount around eur 1.3 trillion, aggregate size commercial paper certificate deposit market europe around eur 0.8 trillion. in addition, u market integrated, short-term security market europe continue segmented, de facto several market base several market places. issuer investor european short-term paper market therefore face reduce depth liquidity le diversification opportunity us. i turn government bond market. our indicator integration government bond market encompass standard deviation government bond yield spreads, measure base regressions, evolution beta coefficients, variance ratios. government bond market achieve high degree integration, mainly due disappearance intra-euro area exchange rate risk. since then, government bond yield different euro area country drive mainly euro area-wide factor news. naturally, one expect common factor fully explain change bond yields, different assessment concern credit liquidity risk continue impact bond yield different countries. the euro corporate bond market grow considerably since 1999. while market predominantly open high quality credits, since broaden facilitate fund need risky issuers. however, gap u market still large term absolute size, outstanding volume bond issue non-financial corporation around eur 2.5 trillion unite state around three time large euro area. the degree integration euro corporate bond market reasonably high. the yield corporate bond depend typically number factors, credit rating, time-to-maturity, liquidity cash flow structure. our indicator state integration euro corporate bond market base (econometric) models, investigate whether risk-adjusted yield spread systematic country component. our study suggest market segment fairly integrate sense country issuance marginal importance explain yield differentials. other market segment even potential great integration. in fact, euro area equity market still quite fragmented, gradual integration process ongoing. for example, indicator show stock price across euro area increasingly react euro area-wide factor news. another indicator measure degree integration euro area equity market relative importance sector versus country-based investment strategies. the indicator derive calculate compare cross-sector dispersion cross-country dispersion equity returns. the integrate euro area equity market, great benefit spread investment across sector oppose country-based equity investment strategies. our statistic show elimination intra-euro area currency risk encourage integration sense “home bias” equity hold institutional investor significantly reduced. nevertheless, country effect still important conclude euro area equity market satisfactorily integrated. a regard bank markets, integration generally lag behind, degree integration different type bank activities, i.e. capital market-related activities, interbank (or wholesale) activities, retail banking. cross-border interbank loan hold security have, relative terms, experience substantial growth. while security issue non-monetary financial institution another euro area country account 16% security hold euro area monetary financial institution (mfis) end 1997, share reach almost 40%, point high degree capital market integration euro area. in addition, although loan grant domestic mfis still account 50% total eu mfi loans, respective euro area cross-border activity increase 15% end 1997 around 23% present. 7 see bi triennial central bank survey - foreign exchange derivative market activity 2004 (march 2005). bi review 86/2005 5 last least, integration retail bank has, contrast, progress great extent, show price quantity-based indicators. for example, share euro area cross-border mfi loan grant non-mfis stand 2% end 1997, figure rise 3.5% today. also, take price-based indicator, cross-country standard deviation interest rate consumer credit rather high constant, average 0.9% past three years. to give final indicator level retail bank integration, cross-country dispersion interest rate lend house purchase amount to, average, 0.5% past three years, clear decline trend visible yet, thereby confirm benign picture euro area credit market integration. 4. eurosystem contribution foster financial integration topical issue relate eu policy framework financial integration an analysis state financial integration monitor progress time prerequisite possible action field analysis identify gap shortcomings. let provide example eurosystem contribute foster financial integration. i list use sequence financial bank market i use describe state financial integration. start money market, obvious example central bank service conducive foster financial integration large-value payment system, “target”, run. in addition, launch single share platform, “target2”, plan november 2007. this enhance financial integration even further, give provide harmonise service level, ensure level play field bank across europe, support single price structure domestic cross-border payments. another example short-term paper market. here, i expect current fragmentation reduce help so-called short-term european paper (step) initiative, set lead aci – the financial market association. this initiative aim promote convergence standard practice prevail european short-term security market market players’ voluntary compliance standard set step market convention, cover aspect information disclosure, documentation, settlement, provision data production step statistics. the step initiative expect provide impulse towards integration, thereby increase depth liquidity market europe. the promoter initiative expect first step-labelled programme early 2006. the eurosystem act catalyst support market-led initiative. specifically, eurosystem provide technical support label process time produce publish step statistic yield volume ongoing basis. furthermore, european master agreement (ema) another example integration relate legal infrastructure. the ema, major european legal documentation initiative, contribute financial integration permit cross-border trade basis master agreement domestic pan-european standard. it first project undertake european level develop pan-european market standard trade operations. the ema multi-lingual, multi-jurisdictional, multi-product master agreement may used, particular, document repurchase agreements, foreign exchange, derivative security loans. the ecb participate draft ema use since 2001 european foreign reserve management fund repo counterparties. since june 2005, ecb also use ema derivative operation 15 european jurisdictions, thereby maximise cross-product netting, cross-product margining possibility reduce documentation basis risk. a regard integration security (bonds equity) markets, prominent role attach security clear settlement infrastructure. the eurosystem strongly support integration security infrastructure, lack has, among others, also identify giovannini group barrier integration removed. to end, ecb participate clear settlement advisory monitor expert group legal certainty group, set european commission. furthermore, also central bank’s capacity act catalyst collective private-sector activities, meet hold contact group euro security infrastructures, bring together representative bank security settlement industry euro area discus integration euro security settlement industry. furthermore, i would like highlight work carry since 2001 cooperation committee european security regulator (cesr), 6 bi review 86/2005 publish october last year 19 standard security clear settlement system european union.8 these escb-cesr standard aim adapt international recommendation european context. they promote harmonise approach conducive integration eu capital markets, place emphasis common solution interoperability systems. last least, i come bank retail markets. i use mortgage market example. the importance retail market segment evident size, outstanding volume eur 4 trillion residential mortgage debt eu correspond around 40% eu gdp. i mention early cross-country dispersion euro area interest rate lend house purchase show clear decline trend past years. furthermore, one compare euro area mortgage market u counterpart, reveal that, past three years, cross-country dispersion rate euro area high cross-regional dispersion mortgage rate unite states. all suggest euro area mortgage market yet fully integrated. in respect, i highlight recent initiative european commission lead green paper mortgage credit eu. with public consultation, commission launch broad discussion possible benefit way integrate european mortgage markets. the eurosystem view kind investigation possible benefit obstacle integration european mortgage market much warranted. the eurosystem therefore explain view detail recently publish contribution consultation commission’s green paper.9 more generally, contribution also see example eurosystem’s role provide advice shape legislative regulatory framework financial system conducive financial integration. and, security markets, retail market also need integrate infrastructure order reap full benefit financial integration. the european citizens’ possible cross-border bank activity also depend possibility cost cross-border payments. this bring last example eurosystem activity i would like highlight today, namely eurosystem’s support, together european commission, bank industry’s initiative create single euro payment area (sepa). the first sepa milestone that, 2008, european citizen able make payment throughout euro area single bank account, use single set payment instruments, easily safely national context today. this mean that, parallel national instruments, bank provide customer also sepa instruments. a second milestone involve national infrastructure migrate pan-european payment infrastructure end 2010, full competition apply euro area infrastructures. the way achieve would demand complete interoperability sepa compliant infrastructures. act catalyst private-sector activities, ecb actively support european payment council (epc), high-level coordination eurosystem bank industry take place regular basis. furthermore, ecb arrange number meet involve sepa end-users, include consumer organisations, small medium-sized enterprises, retailer corporate treasurers. the ecb recognise major achievement epc’s work define standard business rule sepa cards, credit transfer direct debits. at time, note large amount work still ahead. for this, count industry’s commitment undertake necessary sepa investment deliver result sepa project foreseen. my reference slow pace integration bank retail market lead last theme i would like address today, namely eu policy framework financial integration. a know, european commission recently issue white paper financial service policy (2005-2010).10 among others, integration retail market target ongoing future projects, white paper mortgage credit, release 2006, 8 see ecb’s website

commission’s website http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finances/policy/index_en.htm, date 5 december 2005. bi review 86/2005 7 proposal payment service directive. in ways, also complement financial service action plan (fsap) past five year focus mainly wholesale markets. in line provision advice shape legislative regulatory framework financial system conducive financial integration, summer 2005, eurosystem provide response european commission’s consultation priority financial service policy next five years.11 a explain contribution, eurosystem support key policy orientation financial service policy next years. with regard regulatory framework financial system, need proceed adoption remain measure envisage fsap hence effective implementation enforcement measure national level. also, agree commission’s proposal “better regulation” base open, transparent evidence-based policy-making, include ex ante evaluation possible cost benefits. a far supervisory framework concerned, order realise economy scale scope offer financial integration, framework facilitate development cross-border consolidation financial institution cross-border exchange service products, maintain effectiveness supervisory standard action integrate financial system. it view current institutional set-up, particular lamfalussy framework, provide appropriate structure achieve broad policy objectives, use maximum extent possible. to end, work level 3 committees, i.e. committee european bank supervisor (cebs), committee european insurance occupational pension supervisor (ceiops) committee european security regulator (cesr), expect strongly promote supervisory convergence cooperation. furthermore, integrate financial system, increase supervisory cooperation across financial sector required. in respect, level 3 committee recently sign joint protocol aim foster cooperation coordination task common interest.12 overall, review lamfalussy approach due end 2007 provide opportunity form comprehensive judgement progress made. * * * in conclusion, lady gentlemen, let tell i appreciate today’s symposium finance, bank insurance. a i point out, financial integration heart european construction ecb eurosystem strongly attach foster historical process financial integration mean domain responsibility. equally trust research field extreme importance. we must understand good complex transformation stake. and reason permanent dialogue academic world fundamental importance. 11 see http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/ecgreenpaperfinancialservicespolicy2005en.pdf, date 1

basant roi: overview macroeconomic policy mauritius address mr r basant roi, governor bank mauritius, bank mauritius’ annual dinner major economic stakeholders, flic-en-flac, 2 december 2005. * * * honourable judge lady gentleman good even i please welcome bank mauritius annual dinner. in last seven end-of-the-year addresses, i persistently focus regulatory supervisory issue monetary policy issues. the repeat emphasis desirability sound strong bank industry motivate several critical important considerations. against backdrop recent development export market evolution balance payment position i find quite appropriate briefly look back order throw light future orientation macro-economic policies. the 1980s witness rapid process financial sector liberalization part world. the long repress financial sector develop country undergo process gradual deregulation. layer upon layer direct control financial sector, fashionable 1950s, 1960s early year 1970s, gradually removed. decision maker mauritius rightly bend prevail wind change. direct control interest rate determination, ceiling bank credit expansion exchange control do away with. with hindsight, appear wide-ranging implication move system direct control fully liberalize financial system fully appreciated. financial sector liberalization imperatively require monetary discipline, fiscal discipline, financial market discipline, labour market discipline importantly sound solid financial industry. these requirement all, one way other, closely related. the lack appreciation complexity relationship among seem trigger criticism bank mauritius regulatory supervisory policy policy stance. the emphasis regulatory supervisory issue relate bank industry drive four principal considerations:- 1. financial sector liberalization intensify competition. obviously, bank operate country necessarily sound strong, otherwise competitive force would drive market inefficient ones. i need overstate take one small bank fail undermine confidence bank system threaten financial stability small economy like ours; 2. the process financial sector liberalization, throughout world 1980s, quite likely follow process trade liberalization level individual countries, regional level well global level. have take view that, stage, trade liberalization might eventually affect balance sheet bank thereby undermine soundness, bank mauritius far-sightedly intensify regulatory supervisory activity bid stave far possible adverse impact; 3. there exist solid body research strongly suggest improvement financial arrangement precede contribute economic performance. develop country relatively deep efficient financial market 1960s 1970s grow fast relatively shallow markets. the bank mauritius thus commit initiate credible regulatory supervisory measure view strengthen bank industry; 4. the efficacy monetary policy implementation liberalize financial system depend greatly strength efficiency player financial marketplace. we bank-centered financial system. in words, bank epicentre financial system. evidently, player market bank bankers. bank medium monetary policy impulse bank mauritius transmit rest economy. the weak medium transmission monetary policy impulse bi review 86/2005 1 less efficacy achieve desire objectives. the medium, banks, strengthen hence repeat emphasis need sound solid bank industry. these inter-related objective envision approach adopt bank mauritius last seven year regard bank sector. despite number hurdle unforeseen happenings, bank mauritius relentlessly pursue objectives, best interest economy bank industry sufficiently strong meet emerge challenges. all road travel far, bank mauritius short criticism commentators. in january 1992, financial time carry headline “man bite watchdog”. the man robert maxwell. in list watchdogs, pension fund trustees, external auditor accountants, institutional shareholders, bank england number regulator identify potential scapegoats. in private conversation medium everyone favourite scapegoat. some carefully avoid include list potential candidate scapegoats, case mauritius. the history trouble financial institution litter eventful episode “men bite watchdogs”. “watchdogs bite watchdogs” however uncommon happening. i guess must familiar story man discontentedly wailed, “we poor childhood, could afford dog; barking.” certain recent remark regulator bank industry give incorrect perspective role regulators. some smart – pretentiously smart - necessarily person enviable integrity probity attempt advertise colossal untruths. i refer smart persons, fully conversant law bind bank mauritius regard duty confidentiality bank transactions. they equally aware bank mauritius certainly interest street fight “respected” delinquent borrower however provocative unpleasant unfair remarks. any form public retaliation certain “law-abiding” delinquent borrower obviously business regulator. the bank mauritius wisely choose take aspersion level cool headedly – elevate sense respect law govern bank industry. they talk talk. we walk walk. in last six year bank mauritius involve clear bank system, thick thin, outdated practices. we today tail end clear process. and rich experience tackle problematic bank ‘gentlemen’ delinquent – i mean habitual delinquent borrower make good, open public show piety monk monasteries. it generally wonder bank mauritius aggressively resolve problem afflict certain financial institutions, whether board director level managerial levels. ail financial institution never bring back rail simply apply mechanical procedure complex operational problems. it’s like man undergo several medical procedure simultaneously. one physician charge head injury, someone else set break leg, another physician work displace shoulder still another one get rid gallstone. each operation perfect indeed success. but dismay physician patient dy - dy shock. it certainly interest regulator - interest society - give shock kill financial institutions; primary concern rather rescue ail institutions, help restore financial soundness sustain overall financial stability. break problem small piece manage pieces, problem stem high level decision-making financial institution, sure way crash. the regulator’s responsibility case manage dynamics, pieces. no regulator would ever envy plight ambulance crew scene car crash. i regret use metaphor i bind duty confidentiality even respect ‘gentlemen’ delinquent borrowers. institutional shareholder individual shareholder enterprise, financial institution non-financial enterprise, expect first foremost watchdog operations. the watchdog suppose look best interest enterprise rather use authority advance agendas. a generally observe sinew good behaviour hardly reinforce regulation. financial regulation design catch deceit create market promote good corporate habit - habit indeed transparent saver investor vote money feet, need arises. the dissemination reliable information public large ability trust pillar market-based economies. a former professor harvard rightly observe trust 2 bi review 86/2005 constitute decisive ingredient society successful capitalist society. people, trust neighbours, trust groups, trust distant people, cannot trade among themselves. the economy reduce level bazaar economy. the regulator need trusted. i absolutely certain none u would ever wish economy reduce bazaar economy. a i say earlier, reach tail end clear process. we process construct framework implementation basel ii, take account specificity economy. the year 2006 quite likely mark acquisition bank industry. we number expression interest take-overs several bank good reputation. despite consequential setback beyond control, business confidence economy bad painted. once economic system path financial sector reform, process self-reinforcing; cannot stop one measure reform engender reforms. the mauritius credit information bureau launch wednesday last innovative step expect go long way towards impose discipline credit market. in long term bureau definitely play catalytic role improve quality financial sector. let clear one misconception. the bureau repository credit information borrowers. when process application loan bank require consult bureau electronic network decide whether approve application loans. the decision whether approve loan however rest bank themselves, bank mauritius. lady gentlemen, right outset i mention financial sector liberalization necessarily require monetary discipline, labour market discipline fiscal discipline. wage salary level productivity level persistently last protract period time combine unsustainable budget deficit bind influence monetary policy-making. i reiterate point i stress here, previous annual dinners, elsewhere bank mauritius operate isolation, irrespective development domestic economy development major trading-partner countries. it policy design light dynamic domestic economy development foreign exchange market abroad. in large resourceful economies, economic growth quite extent drive consumption expenditure. consumption expenditure, amongst things, propel force investment that, turn, generate economic growth. in small economy like investment propel economic growth that, turn, give rise consumption expenditure. ours investment drive economy consumption drive economy. the point i wish make highly open economy like ours, overwhelmingly dependent imports, rise level consumption expenditure, match production exports, rather lead deficit trade balance. after four successive year surpluses, current account balance payment post deficit rs5 billion fiscal year 2004-05 - close 3 per cent gdp. the good account, commonly understand merchandise account, post deficit rs20 billion, roughly twice deficit record precede year. may i underline rupee value petroleum product import fiscal year 2004-05 amount rs11 billion, twice value record three year ago. it project attain rs13 billion current fiscal year. for every rs100 worth imports, rs13 account petroleum products. only society embrace self-criticism decision-making process produce real fact cope real problems. a back-of-the-envelope arithmetic show certain organizations, employees, make allowance week-ends, vacation leave, casual leave sick leave entitlements, work 200 day year; i wish say consume 400 day year. household consumption expenditure grow 8 per cent 2005, twice average growth rate 4 per cent four year end 2003. fortunately, incisiveness bank mauritius lead accumulation net international foreign currency reserve amount rs54 billion today. we cannot lean wind long. the policy implication development fiscal rectitude strong demand management policies. why fiscal rectitude? let explain. two different hypothesis exist regard relation trade deficit budget deficits. one twin deficit hypothesis postulate budget deficit cause trade deficits. the policy implication theory budget deficit need reduce restore trade balance. the hypothesis economist refer ricardian equivalence hypothesis: increase government expenditure absorb rise private save therefore increase consumption expenditure, case, mean increase import therefore impact balance trade. contrarily, consumption rate bi review 86/2005 3 go mean save rate go down. trade deficit widened. the first hypothesis seem valid case economy. although one one relationship budget deficit trade deficit context, case reduction budget deficit strong. fiscal dentistry need carry out; cavity need fill in. on monetary policy side, stringent demand management policy order day. finally, let share reflection make 1980s former prime minister u.k. state mind british public, “i think we’ve period many people give understand problem, it’s government’s job cope it. ‘i problem, i’ll get grant.’ ‘i’m homeless, government must house me.’ they cast problem society. and know thing society. there individual men women, families. and government anything except people, people must look first. it’s duty look then, also, look neighbours. people get entitlement much mind, without obligations. there thing entitlements, unless someone first meet obligation.” aren’t reflection equally valid mauritius? lady gentlemen, way forward carry really big rapid change rather proceed small gradual changes. a plunge cold water le painful slow submersion. we open economy, without form deleterious barriers. problem exist continue exist. they exist redefine transformed. they exist tackle overcome. a problem share problem halved. let behalf board directors, staff bank mauritius behalf wish family merry xmas prosperous new year 2006. thank you. 4 bi review 86/2005 alan greenspan: the role resilience open competitive market remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, acceptance new york university honorary degree, new york, 14 december 2005. * * * president sexton, provost mclaughlin, chairman lipton, faculty students, day nostalgia back new york university, especially opportunity visit bob kavesh--my classmate

hear short ago, achieve exemplary record steward economy unite kingdom and, indeed, without peer among world’s economic policy makers. gordon, i would like thank particular leadership group seven past year. it challenge year, voice vision indispensable g-7's effort maintain global stability growth face terrorism, rise global oil prices, protectionist pressures. in fifty-seven year since i receive first degree university, i front-row seat observe exceptional growth world live standards. with exposure, inevitable i would gain useful insight role open competitive market engender wealth nations. but evident, especially retrospect, thorough ground fundamental i receive university essential preparation. the resilience open competitive market particularly evidence aftermath terrorism september 2001. fear widespread contraction international commerce would halt widen globalization previous half-century. and, short while, fear realized. global trade faltered. travel contracted. new project postponed. but free market previous quarter-century impart flexibility enable cross-border commerce quickly stabilize and, early 2002, resume expansion. despite worrisome pocket violence destruction, commerce wealth-building continue apace. on average, world standard live rising, large part widen embrace competitive free markets, especially populous grow china india. since autumn 2001, global gross domestic product per caput grow 8 percent. and growth develop asia, many world’s poor reside, considerably faster. open free market antithesis violence. they rest voluntary exchange also necessary condition voluntary exchange: trust word business. to sure, market economy require rule law function--laws contracts, protection property rights, general protection citizen arbitrary action state. yet, even small fraction legally bind transaction require adjudication, court system would swamp immobilized. in practice, virtually transactions, whether customer colleagues, rely word business. if could so, good service could exchange efficiently. the trillion dollar asset price trade daily financial market legal confirmation illustrate critical role trust. even law follow letter, appeal legal authority guide day-to-day decision require business financial managers. the rest govern whatever personal code value market participant bring table. commerce inhibit cannot trust reliability counterparties' commitments. indeed, willingness rely word strange integral sophisticate economy. this necessary condition commerce particularly evident freewheel nineteenth-century america, reputation trust become value assets. throughout much century, laissez-faire reign unite state elsewhere, caveat emptor prevail prescription guard wide-open trade practices. a reputation honest deal thus particularly bi review 85/2005 1 valued. even incline le scrupulous private deal adhere ethical standard market transactions, risk drive business. to sure, history world business strew fisks, goulds, numerous others tread on, over, edge legality. but distinct minority. if situation otherwise, nineteenth-century market economy would never achieve high standard living. over past half-century, society embrace protection myriad initiative partially substitute government financial guarantee imply certification integrity business reputation. a consequence, value trust prominent nineteenth century seem 1990s le necessary. most analyst believe world good consequence governmental protections. but corporate scandal unite state elsewhere clearly show plethora law past century eliminate less-savory side human behavior. we surprised, then, see reemergence recent year value place market trust personal reputation business practice. after recent revelation corporate malfeasance, market punish stock price corporation whose behavior cast doubt reliability reputations. there may good antidote business financial transgression. corporate scandal evidence fraud malfeasance notwithstanding, history rise standard live world fearful violence extraordinary testimony resilience free people engage commerce. our system work fundamentally trust individual fair dealing. we need look around today’s world appreciate value trait consequence absence. while market economy achieve much regard, remain done. prejudice whatever stripe unworthy society build individual merit. a free-market capitalist system cannot operate effectively unless participant economy opportunity achieve best. if succeed open opportunity everyone, affluence within border almost surely become equally distributed. of even great import, people come recognize part system fair worthy support. * * * america’s found fathers, whose think deep root concept british scottish enlightenments, bestow upon u system government culture enterprise propel unite state great material prosperity world ever experienced. today’s students, nyu throughout country, carry forward traditions. i know improve upon inheritance democratic government free market way yet imagine. 2 bi review 85/2005 zeti akhtar aziz: enhance financial literacy sustain economic prosperity dinner address dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor central bank malaysia, citigroup-insead financial education summit 2005: a forum promote financial education asia pacific, kuala lumpur, 12 december 2005. * * * it great pleasure tonight second citigroup-insead financial education summit. malaysia particularly please host year's summit kuala lumpur give enhance level financial literacy accord high priority agenda. effective participation economy essentially need inform participation. this ever before. we live environment rapid change. the advance technology, product innovation, removal regulatory restrictions, deregulation great competition dramatically transform financial system economy. the environment mark increase access financial services, broad range product services, far competitive financial service industry complex financial transactions. it demand new environment create great need financial literacy ensure efficient function financial system also enhance potential economy prosper thrive. this evening, i would like focus financial literacy perspective central bank, give function central bank widespread implication financial markets, business public large. the main responsibility central bank include formulation implementation monetary policy, ensure soundness stability bank system, finally ensure integrity reliability payment systems. in areas, action central bank direct implication business community public large. the ultimate aim policy make economy strong, ensure health financial system vital support economic growth development process. knowledge central bank reason action essential efficient function financial market effectiveness policy initiatives. in areas, behavior business consumer large important determine final outcome. have knowledge understand issue would good equip consumer manage financial matter make well inform decision regard finances. in addition, would also contribute soundness bank system efficiency payment system. in current environment, issue financial literacy perspective become urgent, particularly emerge market economy asia, household consumption become important driver growth. the expand cumulative domestic market asia become massive, factor important facilitate intra-asian trade thus drive economic integration asian region. this trend potential contribute rebalancing global growth thus address structural imbalance currently prevail global economy. household therefore need financially strong trend sustainable. financial literacy allow household increase confidence make sound decision regard consumption expenditure. of importance central bank consumer credit remain within prudential limit impose undue risk consumer often result financial stress. consumer need able ass capacity expenditure, save debt also able select array financial product delivery system best meet requirements. household need also aware understand financial risk associate transactions. great financial literacy contribute mitigate financial risks. the growth household debt increasingly evident phenomenon asia. over period 2000 2004, volume consumer loan across seven major asia pacific economy grow average annual rate 9 percent, relative total loan growth 5.2 percent corporate credit growth 2.6 percent. the risk emerge debt reach level cannot sustained, ultimately lead increase financial stress. it therefore important borrower financially savvy manage financial risk proactive constructive manner. bi review 85/2005 1 the environment operate become increasingly challenging. individual may know seek information comparative shopping. the aggressive market financial institution may lure naãƒâ¯ve borrower financial transaction cannot sustain long term. a number regional economy see aggressive market credit cards, lead situation financial institution eventually compel write-off many bad loans. the observation survey many consumer fully understand relatively simple financial calculations, hence realise risk involved. for countries, cost borrow may increase substantially depend prevail conditions. this may result difficulty service debt. also would depend extent household gearing. for asia pacific economies, ratio debt service total income range low two percent economy sophisticate financial systems, 74 percent high-end, consumerism well entrenched. while magic number determine prudent gearing, ratio use ass whether financial risk increasing. over time, could provide indication level debt manageable. basic financial literacy would necessary self-assessment. a risk, link closely high cost borrowing, reliance finance informal financial sector. very often type predatory lend result perpetual debt since interest rate prohibitively high, borrower recourse legal aid proper financial advice give transaction take place informal financial sector. increase financial literacy would avoid recourse finance would facilitate great reliance formal financial service providers. an important objective enhance financial literacy achieve great personal accountability post-retirement financial, medical social needs. unlike develop economies, financial burden retire respect health retirement cost usually bear individual. this require understand various insurance product health care plans. the sustainable approach mitigate type risk inform participation health retirement fund schemes. great understand knowledge financial risk improve financial literacy first step towards actively manage risks. enhance financial literacy also contribute towards stable sound bank system. a discern household sector drive great innovation, great efficiency term low fee charge good quality services. this combine monitor central bank ensure financial service provide fairly ensure appropriate risk management governance practice adopt industry increase potential enhance stability performance industry. this turn enhance potential industry provide finance household enterprise thus contribute economic growth process. another instance efficiency potential industry enhance migration paper-based payment electronic payments. this would provide significant benefit party provide efficient reliable payment instrument attract low costs, increase convenience high level security. in promote financial literacy, several issue need addressed. one critical issue apathy towards information. irrational behavior, inability comprehend complex information, perception information unreliable, often reluctance invest time study information, reason increase apathy. in address financial literacy, information provide consumer need simple, brief, contextualised need consumer deliver right time. an example provide special, inclusive programme financially exclude group different level development face different challenge manage financial affairs. the emerge best practice enhance financial literacy clearly suggest integrate coordinate delivery financial literacy initiative need address issue highlight above. this require comprehensive approach involve central banks, government ministries, ngo corporation work collaboratively promote financial literacy. attention need give great strategic focus outcome achieve financial literacy programs. it require concerted, deliberate sustain effort party concerned. finally, progress make advance financial literacy need tracked. this allow insight ass capacity financial system handle great level innovation free market practices. 2 bi review 85/2005 in malaysia, comprehensive approach adopt enhance financial literacy country. the financial sector master plan, launch 2001, include 10-year consumer education program. this agenda include infrastructure institutional capacity development area financial education, advisory services, distress management rehabilitation. for purpose, central bank partnership financial industry government agencies, introduce financial mediation bureau, deposit insurance scheme, basic bank service framework, credit counsel debt management agency, well create new class license financial advisers. these initiative also reinforce high level transparency disclosure. a series consumer education program introduced, bankinginfo insuranceinfo, deliver various channels. these include road shows, pamphlet branch financial service provider dedicate internet site host central bank. save education program also promote schools. more recently one-stop centre establish within central bank public obtain information financial service malaysia provide face-to-face customer service general enquiry complaints. this centre establish act centralise point contact facilitate rapid effective response member public small medium enterprise (smes) matter relate requirements. also credit counsel debt management agency launch early next year. the credit counsel debt management agency establish undertake credit counsel loan restructure individuals. this institutional arrangement help consumer encounter difficulty meet financial commitments. apart source information advice financial management, arrangement would represent cost effective prompt mean debt settlement out-of-court procedures. all measure enhance financial literacy involve party concern - consumers, financial service providers, regulator relevant government ministries, corporate ngos. this collective approach reflect importance share responsibility help consumer manage financial risk effectively. in regard, financial institution first line contact consumers, bear major part financial risk event consumer suffer financial stress, need play great role help create inform participation financial system. the dividend term low non-performing loan increase profitability make win-win proposition. financial institution extensive branch networks, qualify financial management officer extensive experience assess risk face consumer best position increase level institutional capacity enhance financial literacy. we need recognise share responsibility equip community country necessary skill confidence manage personal financial matters. collective effort develop institutional capacity share information knowledge financial literacy across region also bring mutually reinforce results. financial literacy need elevate important level national international agenda great share economic prosperity. on note, thank attention. bi review 85/2005 3 david dodge: our approach monetary policy - inflation target remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, regina chamber commerce, regina, saskatchewan, 12 december 2005. * * * i happy opportunity speak regina saskatchewan's centennial year. throughout 2005, people saskatchewan celebrate many remarkable contribution province citizen make canada. gerald bouey gordon thiessen, two predecessor governor, example individual deep saskatchewan root make great contribution bank country. a province turn 100, proud history, also modern, increasingly diversify economy position saskatchewan success future. this year also mark 70th anniversary creation bank canada, take time celebrate contribution canada. at times, appropriate look back celebrate history accomplishments, also good opportunity look forward think headed. in spirit, i'd like talk today one main responsibilities; is, conduct monetary policy. i want recount bite bank's history talk develop current framework conduct monetary policy. at bank canada, strongly believe target inflation best way u fulfill mandate canadians. i also want look forward bit, talk future inflation targeting, prepare renew inflation-targeting agreement federal government next year. the bank's mandate let begin brief discussion bank's legislative mandate. the preamble bank canada act instruct u "regulate credit currency best interest nation." it go say bank mitigate "fluctuations general level production, trade, price employment, far may possible within scope monetary action, generally . . . promote economic financial welfare canada." so question is, how bank best provide condition sustainable economic growth, bear mind word mandate: "so far may possible within scope monetary action"? over time, become clear best way monetary policy promote sustainable economic growth anchor expectation future purchase power money. in words, important canadian confidence value money erode time. focus domestic price stability best contribution monetary policy make economic stability sustainable long-term growth. after bitter inflationary experience 1970s, become clear central bank need focus achieve low inflation. but monetary authority around world struggle figure best this. at bank canada, try determine achieve price stability way would allow u accomplish three things: first, i said, want anchor canadians' expectation future purchase power money; second, want operational framework conduct monetary policy; third, want approach would help markets, politicians, canadian public understand doing, action could expect us. throughout 1980s, bank work come approach. by 1991, decide target inflation best way achieve high, sustainable growth output employment. and bank government canada agree series explicit target inflation. to clear, however, inflation target end itself. rather, i said, best mean fulfil commitment promote economic financial welfare canadians. the canadian version inflation target once bank government agree concept inflation targeting, need make choice put concept practice. like many central banks, choose target bi review 85/2005 1 annual rate inflation. initially, focus reduce rate inflation, run 5 per cent annually 1991. the target set bring inflation gradually - first, 3 per cent midpoint 2 4 per cent target range end 1992, 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent range end 1995. the target remain since then. let take key decision make 1991, rationale behind choices, set detail framework. first all, choose consumer price index (cpi) measure inflation? the key reason cpi measure inflation familiar relevant canadians. choose well-known indicator target make easy explain action accountable. second, range? this component cpi - energy food item - whose price tend move lot, down. these movement cause large fluctuation index. if try target inflation precisely, would adjust policy interest rate sharply frequently, would lead great instability economy. have range reflect inherent volatility cpi. but clear, range zone indifference - aim achieve 2 per cent target. another concern volatility obscure underlie trend inflation. so operational purposes, use measure core inflation. this measure strip eight volatile component cpi effect change indirect tax rest items. in way, core inflation provide good forward-looking indicator trend inflation. finally, since today's monetary policy action affect future inflation, need choose time frame achieve target. from beginning, say inflation push target, would conduct monetary policy return inflation target period 18 24 months. this research suggest historically take 12 18 month change interest rate impact output, 18 24 month impact prices. of course, always uncertainty lag involved, i'll say late on. before i move on, i want emphasize three point inflation-targeting framework. the first operate symmetric way, make clear everyone so. by this, i mean worry much inflation fall target rise target. when demand good service push canadian economy limit capacity, inflation poise rise target, bank raise interest rate cool economy. and economy operate production capacity, inflation poise fall target, bank low interest rate stimulate growth. pay close attention sign inflation move away target - either direction - promote timely action. this keep economy operate near full capacity thus keep inflation low, stable, predictable. the second point i want stress inflation target anchor helpful term bank's accountability. if inflation persistently deviate target, commit explain reason why, return target, long expect process take. the third point central bank run independent monetary policy target inflation must allow currency float. it simply possible central bank successfully control domestic external value currency time. we one instrument - policy interest rate - one target. thus, inflation target, naturally operate float currency. canada's experience inflation target now, let quickly review record inflation targeting. a look inflation economic growth canada since 1991, quite clear benefit hop would come inflation target have, fact, materialized. we expect inflation become stable - so, sooner anticipated. since settle 2 per cent target inflation end 1995, actual inflation average close 2 per cent. and remain within 1 3 per cent target range, rare exceptions. we expect credibility increase inflation expectation become well anchor - also happened. 2 bi review 85/2005 we also think inflation target would help economy avoid exaggerate "boom-bust" cycle previous decade - has. the business cycle still us, economic volatility diminished. by keep inflation close target, monetary policy help keep economy operate near potential. finally, importantly, transparent framework allow market analyst good predict react different economic outcomes. within bank, too, focus inflation bring increase discipline clarity monetary policy decision process. canada second country new zealand adopt explicit inflation targets. but past decade half, 20 central bank also adopt framework. some, like central bank unite kingdom sweden, advanced, industrialize economies. others, central bank chile brazil, emerging-market economies. in every case, inflation target success: inflation rate reduced, central bank generally able hit targets. inflation become le persistent inflation target practiced, reasonable assume well-anchored inflation expectation good part reason why. give success, seem likely country join rank inflation targeters come year - indeed, last week central bank turkey announce move formal inflation target next year. inflation target also discuss unite state ben bernanke, alan greenspan's designate successor federal reserve, enthusiastic proponent. however, argue inflation target limit approach, constrain central bank's ability act apply judgment case extraordinary events. but experience canada. for example, immediate aftermath 9/11 terrorist attacks, low interest rate quickly decisively underpin confidence. when major loss confidence materialize, able reverse course fairly short order withdraw monetary stimulus. our inflation-targeting framework restrict ability act. indeed, framework transparent, financial market able appreciate make rapid rate adjustments. the bank canada focus inflation national level. this lead suggestion canada's region may appropriate policy particular circumstances. we hear comment often time these, economic prospect growth rate vary sector sector - geographic concentration sector canada - also region region. these comment reflect fairly common misunderstand monetary policy. remember market economy, adjustment always take place. market price send clear signal indicate economic resource allocated, shift resource rapidly grow sector slower-growing ones. because monetary policy target inflation country whole, try mask important price signal - it. to would impede adjustment process and, ultimately, lead low economic growth. but mean ignore happen regional basis - far it. indeed, information receive five regional offices, business outlook survey, important input monetary policy deliberations. our job add go across country conduct monetary policy achieve inflation target country whole. the future inflation target despite success date inflation targeting, i leave impression somehow represent end monetary policy history. prudent policy-makers always strive find good way get thing done. a i say beginning, agreement federal government renewal next year. so bank, busy think element framework would want change, well others change might considered. from bank's point view, basic arrangement aim inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent target range serve canadian well, along use total cpi target, measure core inflation operational purposes. the bank also continue recognize importance communication transparency. inflation target good job bi review 85/2005 3 anchor expectations, work good central bank communicate well. i expect basic element framework remain place. this say examine elements. indeed, ask 2 per cent right target. when last renew inflation-targeting agreement 2001, look closely issue. at time, research could convincingly demonstrate benefit move low target would outweigh costs. more recent research, still inconclusive, provide little support low target. of course, continue look question, evidence would quite compel target would changed. another issue continue examine whether target actual level price rather inflation rate. let explain i mean. have annual rate inflation exactly 2 per cent since 1995, settle figure target, consumer price index would rise level 102.8 december 1994 127.6 october year. the actual price level october 128.5 - minimal difference, turn out. but future, possible could get series shock move inflation predominantly one direction, either down. and so, price level could move significantly away would hit 2 per cent target exactly period years. under price-level targeting, monetary policy would set offset deviation desire price level. but inflation targeting, past price-level movement essentially forgotten; would change conduct policy go forward. economic theory tell u that, long term, certainty future price level would yield somewhat great benefit certainty future rate inflation. but date, possible conclusively measure cost benefit target price level versus target inflation rate. we still work build good analytical tool method examine questions, continue look new evidence become available road. another issue look appropriate time frame return inflation target follow various kind shocks. a i say before, conduct monetary policy goal bring inflation target within 18- 24-month time frame. but question whether time frame appropriate every type unexpected development could affect inflation. there could reason look adjust time frame response inflationary pressure major movement asset price - real estate, equity prices, exchange rate. give success date deal various shock within 18- 24-month horizon, change horizon lightly. but inflation target global economy evolve, need continue consider appropriate time horizon issue i discuss today. the bank canada remain commit conduct encourage research important areas. conclusion i want conclude emphasize key points. despite issue i've raised, economic record past 15 year show inflation target serve canada well. the bank's symmetric approach keep inflation low, stable, predictable lay groundwork solid, sustainable growth output employment. with inflation targeting, monetary policy focused, communication clearer, inflation expectation solidly anchored. a look forward, important maintain anchor keep monetary policy focused. from perspective, inflation target best anchor we've seen. 4 bi review 85/2005 zeti akhtar aziz: migration e-payments keynote

create regional rural bank also take bank service poor people. the branch commercial bank rrbs increase 8321 year 1969 68,282 branch end march 2005. the average population per branch office decrease 64,000 16,000 period. however, certain under-banked state bihar, orissa, rajasthan, uttar pradesh, chattisgarh, jharkhand, west bengal large number north-eastern states, average population per branch office continue quite high compare national average. a would aware, new branch authorization policy reserve bank encourage bank open branch bank state bank area states. the new policy also place lot emphasis effort make bank achieve, inter alia, financial inclusion policy objectives. one benchmark employ ass degree reach financial service population country, quantum deposit account (current savings) hold ratio adult population. in indian context, take account census 2001 (ignoring incremental growth population thereafter), ratio deposit account (data available march 31, 2004) total adult population 59% (details furnish table). within country, wide variation across states. for instance, ratio state kerala high 89% bihar mark low coverage 33%. in north eastern state like nagaland manipur, coverage meager 21% 27%, respectively. the northern region, comprise state haryana, chandigarh delhi, high coverage ratio 84%. compare develop world, coverage financial service quite low. for instance, per recent survey commission british bankers' association, 92 94% population uk either current save bank account. step towards financial inclusion in context initiative take extend bank service small man, mode financial sector development 1980’s characterize • hugely expand bank branch cooperative network new organizational form like rrbs; • great focus credit rather financial service like save insurance, although bank cooperative provide deposit facilities; • lend target direct range ‘priority sectors’ agriculture, weak section population, etc; • interest rate ceilings; • significant government subsidy channel bank cooperatives, well relate government programmes; 4 bi review 83/2005 • dominant perspective finance rural poor people social obligation potential business opportunity. it absolutely beyond doubt financial access mass significantly improve last three half decades. but basic question is, good enough. a i mention earlier, quantum deposit account (current savings) hold ratio adult population uniformly encouraging. there tremendous scope financial coverage improve standard life deprive people. with view enhance financial inclusion, proactive measure, rbi annual policy statement year 2005-06, recognize concern regard bank practice tend exclude rather attract vast section population, urge bank review exist practice align objective financial inclusion. in mid term review policy (2005-06), rbi exhort banks, view achieve great financial inclusion, make available basic bank ‘no frills’ account either nil minimum balance well charge would make account accessible vast section population. the nature number transaction account would restrict make know customer advance transparent manner. all bank urge give wide publicity facility frill account ensure great financial inclusion. further, order ensure person belong low income group urban rural area face difficulty open bank account due procedural hassles, kyc procedure open account simplify person intend keep balance exceed rupee fifty thousand (rs. 50,000/-) account take together total credit account take together expect exceed rupee one lakh (rs.1,00,000/-) year. the way forward the bank come inhibit feel aggressive competition policy social inclusion mutually exclusive. a demonstrate elsewhere, mass bank no-frills etc. become win-win situation both. basically bank service need “marketed” connect large population segment may justifiable promotional costs. the opportunity plenty. • in context india become one large micro finance market world especially growth

2005. * * * israel's economy experience fairly rapid growth, annual rate 4.8 percent third quarter 2003 third quarter 2005. this express by, among things, improve figure employment unemployment, particularly business sector, show data issue last week central bureau statistics. against background, assume government's macroeconomic policy continue, bank israel publish forecast 2006, accord gdp expect rise 4 percent, business-sector product 5 percent. these certainly high rate growth. it important bear mind, however, current favorable situation israel's economy simply occur chance. it outcome three main factors: first state global economy; second israel's macroeconomic strategy; third security situation. the first external, relate positive effect israel global economy, show clear growth trend. this reflect inter alia expectation global growth rate 2006 relatively high 3.5 percent. the main domestic economic explanation israel's economic situation macroeconomic strategy decide upon. thus, last two-and-a-half year clear strategy pursue reduce government's share economy, low tax burden government-debt/gdp ratio. yet despite reduction achieve latter, still long way go, ratio government debt gdp israel still extremely high compare advance countries. it clear adopt approach did, would eventually pay price, form high rate interest financial market low rate growth employment, among things. at time government spearhead series structural reforms, labor market, public sector, capital market, ports; implement privatization, e.g., bank leumi, discount bank, bezeq el al; invest infrastructures, railways. the step already take continue bear fruit future. but work area far over. the bank israel also play part strategy, mainly carry interest-rate policy underpin price stability, accord government's target, support financial stability. this strategy essential, create condition sustain growth. the great importance economic growth calm security situation - expectation regard peace process - must go without mention; positive effect economy, particular via tourism domestic foreign investors' desire invest israel's economy. nevertheless, despite may rest laurels. various goal confront us, i refer two important ones: the first sphere israel's economic strategy. we already election period, height democratic process. at time many question raise past raise again, natural accompany uncertainty regard follow. since economic stabilization program 1980s, especially since 1990s, israel's economy follow path openness exposure global economy towards adoption economic norm base accept advance economies. it great importance uncertainty political arena allow become uncertainty regard economic strategy broad mean term. clearly, israel's economic strategy end mean important objective sustain growth. on face thing would seem clear enough everyone objective important, worth focus one two point regard. bi review 82/2005 1 continue growth vital enhance welfare israel's citizens, improve israel's ability attract immigration, include advance countries, boost israel's security, improve ability tackle social problems, particular, reduce poverty. this bring second objective face us. we must deal social problems. this subject important u human beings, also economists; all, economics society two side coin. responsible policy towards social issue one act within framework strategy describe above, undermine it. it little avail achieve economic growth long term attain european standard live without attend social issues. but cannot handle properly without growth, would even quickly increase severity. for example, one could deal question social gap mean drastic hike tax transfer payments, policy would also serious adverse effect growth, year would lead situation would equal, also poorer. that way attract immigration; contrary, would boost emigration. and position want in. before deal social problem examine realistically, sine qua non formulate appropriate policy. the problem poverty complex view one aspect, must analyze several aspects. for example, although generally accept measure poverty relative terms, thus consider problem poverty question social gaps, aware possibilities. to illustrate: poverty view absolute terms, i.e., way poverty line determine term level real income consider minimum require buy certain basket goods, food, clothe housing. if define poverty line 1997 level income define poverty absolute terms, would get result rate poverty, use definition, hardly change 1997 2004, actually go little. it decline 2001, rise somewhat thereafter. the bank israel engage complex matter measure different aspect poverty, i hope bank's annual report 2005, due publish first quarter 2006, able refer subject great depth, contribute public debate formulation policy issue. an aspect poverty see another angle identification population suffer poverty. we know high incidence poverty ultra-orthodox ("haredi") arab sector population, mainly low participation rate haredi men arab woman labor force. accord estimate carry out, sector population account 40 percent poverty israel. this important purpose adapt policy instrument effective groups. although specific step deal poverty important short run, measure equal importance medium long terms, must forgone. one attainment continue growth basic solution problem poverty. but all. another require step policy enable israel's citizen realize full potential. this would contribute economic growth help vulnerable avoid fall poverty trap. in context follow step promoted: increase resource education budget allocate weak stratum order improve ability next generation achieve great equality opportunity; enhance government's system professional retraining, focus essential skills; encouragement professional retrain business sector, example adapt encouragement capital investment law focus human capital; extend program provide adult basic education. it also important promote policy measure deal problem poverty short term. such policy base principle provide incentive capable working, give assistance poor worker (in way encourage stay labor market), provide relief unable work, handicap elderly. the follow example policy measure consistent principles: first institute system negative income tax. this one step bank israel supports, feature discussion hold team head yossi bachar representative bank also participate. a second example government participation cost connect encourage weak section population go work, example, day care center 2 bi review 82/2005 children, transportation. a third example establish legal supervisory infrastructure would encourage institution reverse mortgages, would enable elderly obtain monthly income flow apartment own. the bank israel engage subject poverty long time, publish position papers, policy proposal many research paper it. i hope government's economic advisor able contribute matter, two main fields: government's social policy, le important, public debate social problems, high importance. and important, must analyze extremely carefully, particular must understand problem poverty cannot resolve medium long term without persist need continue economic growth. bi review 82/2005 3 davíð oddsson: the central bank iceland’s commitment price stability speech mr davíð oddsson, chairman board governor central bank iceland, seminar organise iceland chamber commerce, reykjavik, 5 december 2005. * * * on december 2, 2005 central bank iceland raise policy interest rate 0.25 percentage point last weekend. i expect decision come surprise. some people may well read bank write connection policy rate hike september increase time would greater, 0.50 even 0.75 percentage points. no decision embody writings, although bank make clear commitment take mandatory role seriously would flinch follow full force. those declaration stand firm. monetary bulletin, publish central bank’s website last friday, include detail account bank’s assessment economic monetary development prospects, argument underpin decision raise policy interest rate now. the scenario face september 27 change several ways. uncertainty wage settlement dispelled, although admittedly considerable cost. the consumer price index fell somewhat last measurement. house price inflation slow sign turn point reached. credit institution proceed cautiously lend sector interest rate term changing. oil price seem stabilising, spite mount labour market pressures, wage drift contained. the central bank’s policy rate hike begin spread economy; monetary policy transmit inherent lag cases, even exaggerate iceland’s unique economic condition present. the important change wake september policy hike, however, index bond yield begin rise last. it vital monetary policy begin effect part economy show clear sign overheating, i.e. soar private consumption growth. although point represent interest positive development, justify change policy central bank pursuing. substantial pressure still exist economy, demand buoyant undeniably sizeable imbalances. these factor must see context. while recent information short-term outlook obviously observed, even vital look indicator longer-term developments. in effect central bank option – like god’s mills, bank’s instrument grind slowly, grind exceedingly well, patience foresightedness guide way. the central bank make secret current strength króna sustainable long run. an important change autumn far winter large-scale issue króna-denominated bond international markets. in particular, issue drive wide interest-rate differential iceland develop countries. the current monetary bulletin attempt analyse impact issues, include separate article dedicate topic. their impact positive. for example, lead efficient foreign exchange security market iceland, thereby benefit domestic economic developments. however, issue also – least temporarily – create uncertainty transmission monetary policy even intensify impact effect exchange rate channel. such pass-through hit export sector hard, little subdue private consumption growth. one standard assumption underlie inflation forecast publish current monetary bulletin policy rate remain unchanged day forecast. on basis scenario, board governor decide raise policy rate 0.25 percentage points. the central bank’s monetary policy medium term need ensure exchange rate adjustment appear inevitable long run result high rate inflation compatible target. a tight monetary stance require so, long capacity labour market pressure pose inflationary threats. furthermore, sufficiently wide interest-rate differential abroad must maintain contribute smooth exchange rate adjustment. the surge house price inflation reach peak. if króna remain relatively strong stable, good price also quite likely fall. thus outlook slowdown inflation rate come months, least depreciation króna year pass bi review 82/2005 1 domestic price level limit extent. if house market cool quickly central bank forecasts, house price inflation likely slow even sharply currently expected. foreseeable exchange rate developments, ongoing surge private consumption greater-than-expected rise unit labour costs, however, outweigh factor long run. the central bank repeatedly caution idea inevitable difficulty accompany tight monetary policy avoid abandon inflation target temporarily, “letting inflation through”, sometimes called. this unrealistic option. such volte-face central bank policy would immediately push inflation expectations, fuel even high wage increase catalyse depreciation króna inflation. ultimately policy rate would need raise even bring inflation back down. business household would suffer rather le policy. nor forget large share household business debt either price-indexed exchange rate-linked. due distinctive feature icelandic financial system, even short-term benefit household business accommodative monetary stance could prove minimal even negative. however, tight fiscal policy contribute soft landing. buoyant demand soar business profit generate revenue treasury year far excess forecasts. a similar position could card 2006. it vital central local government authority respond boost revenue ease restraint expenditure side, rather plan achieve increase surpluses, appear aim behind budget currently parliament. a announce recently, change make monetary policy implementation whereby interest decision make six fixed, preannounced date next year. three coincide publication monetary bulletin. on dates, board governor announce decision press conference, irrespective whether policy rate change not, together support arguments. this change make monetary policy even transparent. the central bank thereby say increase formal interest rate decision date four six, publication date monetary bulletin already recognise effect. nonetheless, board governor course decide change interest rate preannounced date consider justified. the first formal interest rate decision date next year thursday, january 26. icelandic economic condition give time broadly correspond go elsewhere world. however, occasional task differ call specific measures. this see central bank iceland’s policy rate moment. it reflect anywhere else. the explanation picture iceland unique, maintain low stable inflation rate current climate would widely think ambitious aim. first, large single investment programme iceland’s history way, landsvirkjun foreign business partner mean investor plan major projects. second, simultaneously experience largest-ever overseas expansion icelandic bank system, accumulate foreign debt unprecedented scale accompany capital inflows. third, icelandic credit market sharply transformed, open invitation everyone join in. fourth, tax cut implement announce come months. and add ice cake, wage earner compensate inflation cause broad rise house price take place cost them. this climate aim ensure medium-term inflation obey principle set central bank act joint declaration central bank government iceland. this must surely consider ambitious goal. sizeable imbalance see global economy. the massive u current account deficit eat large share total global save present. manage exchange rate elsewhere, example china, delay market respond problem. economist claim change inevitable, late comes, upheaval cause eventually does. a far iceland concerned, however, external condition favourable far. it enjoy high creditworthiness wide open access markets. interest rate low product price high, make strong position króna – last forever – much easy otherwise many weather. but need make 2 bi review 82/2005 sure favourable external condition area become fundamental precondition success. in opinion – week central bank iceland –one main reason management employ pay particular attention risk economy. i shall mention follow illustration. of course perfectly normal progressive rapidly grow banks, feel constrain small size icelandic market, eager foreign capital effort expand reap profits. the financial system infrastructure criterion assess supervisory authority rat agency excellent shape. all market therefore stand open icelandic bank foreseeable future. however. necessarily certain important precondition factor work give time. they market condition normal market volatile, especially climate global economic imbalances. the u economy buoyant dynamic present. this welcomed. however, sign le encouraging: low level saving, wide fiscal deficit current account deficit repeatedly hit record levels. europe still recover recent rise ecb minimum lend rate harshly criticise concern stagnation grow unemployment. all aspect environment call normal caution exercised, least background rapidly grow increasingly prominent foray icelandic financial institution international capital markets. under condition endorse comment colleague, governor central bank denmark, say day ago important observe speed limit economic policy roads. now i would like allow word house issues. it definitely easy make reasonable case government could consider matter carefully make radical change house policy onset upswing 2003, would prudent postpone boom come end. (i presume people realise prime minister criticism level at). but even strong argument claim that, spite questionable timing, represent positive reform house system framework, government proud of. however, response bank system certainly catch government surprise. a thing developed, secondary consideration. the banks’ response render house system old form virtually obsolete overnight, whether like not. mortgage interest rate admittedly still high iceland. that mean interest point current debate, however. access credit finance term buy build house iceland never better. but seem obvious large part bank system probably subsidise mortgage lend moment. of course may deliberate risk take faith that, since lend long-term, lender eventually reap handsome profit interest rate move line countries. disregard speculation, competitive position house market clearly untenable one player enjoy credit rat sovereign, pay fee treasury guarantee exempt various charge levy upon rivals. it quite true credit institution already know aggressively intensify participation mortgage market. but i said, secondary consideration task ahead must normalise arrangement soon possible. lady gentlemen: since become chairman board governor central bank iceland i move part icelandic society attract word concern caution directions. and i feel sensible arrangement assign role single body – must capability ass position respond correctly. i hope central bank iceland position. it certainly true central bank play sort role economic upswing air traffic controller, pay attention land takeoff. but true, sometimes implied, bank care whether land hard soft one. bi review 82/2005 3 ardian fullani: microfinance albania speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, euro mediterranean conference micro credit, rome, 5-6 december 2005. * * * distinguish participants! i’m glad participate euro mediterranean conference micro credit, important event associate announcement year 2005 “international year micro credit” unite nations. authority country usually aim achieve sustainable economic growth non-inflationary environment. ideally, free market, capital go opportunity represent efficient profitable investments. but, develop country, market several imperfection issue capital could easily misallocated. it could go investment opportunity provide high risky quick return low efficiency venture nearly safe. this behavior could however problematic future economic growth country. many sector enormous long term growth potential leave unexploited. this mean area economy booming, area considerably lag behind lead unbalance economic development. also, various group population, particularly low income groups, probably exclude finance opportunity increase odds become poorer. a result, social problem issue may arise as: job losses, loose population movement illegal establishments, etc, stretch public facility cope situation. therefore, important find ways, ensure balance development opportunity sector economy group population. albanian economy, large relies, micro-businesses. nearly enterprise albania fall category small medium enterprise sme-s. more 90 percent albanian enterprise classify small medium-size accord instat data. the majority company engage trade services, reflect micro business nature, le industry. a employment, sme-s account 40 % total employment enterprise sector. there high concentration region tirana-durres private enterprise regions, industry concentrate mainly elbasan. this new private sector especially sme-s need financial support grow. until bank sector able meet needs. the situation problematic sme-s develop financial sectors. usually, country also difficulty access international financial markets. i don’t want get wrong role financial sector. financial sector make considerable step albania. today, financial sector include many bank non-bank financial institutions, save loan association unions, insurance reinsurance companies, pension funds. one say though development financial sector institution noticeable bank sector insurance sector. the bank system currently comprise 16 operate institutions, total asset around 53 per cent country’s gdp. the system well capitalize liquid. it intermediation role increasing. the lend activity although small (accounting around 23 percent total bank asset around 12 percent gdp), strongly pick up. other financial institution try hard increase modernize activity. however, many problem primarily legal property right relate outside financial sector make difficult increase credit lines. microfinance prove effective way deal problems. with inventive formula make financial resource become accessible small medium business account aggregate production development stages. these resource often use finance small project area like agriculture, livestock service like handicraft, small food store etc. the first microfinance institution albania, set 1994 development project co-financed albanian government world bank. 13 donor cooperate albanian government support development sme-s albania. from 1992 large share fund allocate albania donation, portion spent. most fund bi review 88/2005 1 give soft loan albanian government. aid represent around 30 % 5 % direct commercial loan co-finance private investment. this sort finance, call “development projects”, mainly use finance sme-s’ credit need accompany technical assistance. the credit line fund give donor soft loan government allocate bank use commercial loan without harm bank practice use bank capitals. a consequence, large part financial credit source convert commercial funds. today, microfinance institution operate self sustain institution increase customer base. in last 5-7 year several institution focus microfinance. currently 133 individual save loan association organize 2 unions, operate rural areas. the number member around 18 thousand stock outstanding loan around 12 million euro. in addition, 7 microfinance institution total asset amount 50 million euros, loan 43 million euros. bank also get active microfinance despite little interest far. this explain tighten competitive condition market need explore new investment opportunities. now see increase amount credit go small businesses, often help initial stages. bank particularly active microfinance urban areas. in fact, one bank initially start operate microfinance institution. it still hold respectful position market segment, particularly urban areas. lend microfinance sector count 10 per cent whole lend portfolio bank system. the quality microfinance loan satisfactory. on average, portfolio risk 1.5-2 percent, accord reports. this small size (usually 1.5 thousand euro each), also diversity projects, ensure diversification loan portfolio. one also say experience gain microfinance institution area, also play important role good quality. the legal framework microfinance complete 1996, approval special law

tůma: monetary policy governance - comment institutional set-up inflation target albania speech mr zdeněk tůma, governor czech national bank, bank albania open forum "preconditions launch inflation target albania", tirana, 1-2 december 2005. * * * monetary policy without doubt one powerful tool macroeconomic management. while theoretical background target-setting well established, task make practical arrangement conduct policy order achieve target efficient way certainly difficult one. design well-functioning system decision make thus top agenda central bank strive establish sound monetary policy framework. it therefore highly commendable bank albania address relate issue well advance. today, i would like make several comment issue i feel czech national bank pas observation know-how base almost eight-year experience decision make inflation target regime. the discussion propose institutional set-up albania provoke general debate property ‘ideal’ monetary policy decision-making system. such discussion general issue could reveal practical implication bank albania. indeed, regardless whether decision take general bank board specialize policy committee, ‘ideal’ system decision-making encompass follow basic properties: a) diversity opinion b) regularity c) separateness d) staff independence e) openness f) deal uncertainty diversity opinion consequence basic lesson learn history monetary policy. milton friedman say 1968: ‘the first important lesson history teach monetary policy – lesson profound importance – monetary policy prevent money major source economic disturbance’. this imply relative smoothness practical decision make seem desirable monetary policy practice. in regard, international experience experimental research1 show decision take ‘decision-making body’ seem superior ex post decision take individual, latter vulnerable sudden change monetary policy stance. it argue significant improvement policy conduct associate policy maker learn other’s decisions. regularity mean decision-making body meet regular basis, particular decision-making process take standard framework base standard set policy documents. all more, ad hoc policy meet base ad hoc policy document minimized. this help central bank communication public, also help decision-making body maintain internal discipline. separateness emphasize special attention pay monetary policy central bank’s agenda. in order avoid attempt displace policy agenda ‘extremely 1 for detail see lombardelli, proudman talbot’s article ‘committees versus individuals: an experimental analysis monetary policy decision making’, publish international journal central banking, vol. 1, no. 1, may 2005. bi review 88/2005 1 important’ issue, separate meet establish policy discussions. indeed, policy decision worth special ‘policy day’, split into: (i) staff presentation, staff present outcome analysis (based standard set policy documents) (ii) discussion analysis (iii) policy decision (iv) communication decision public staff independence protect member decision-making body filter undesirable information occur whenever particular decision maker directly manage ‘economic department’. although behaviour is, high probability, intentional, member influence interpretation ‘staff’ analysis way convenient opinions. it could happen rest decision-making body member receive bias analysis. move role ‘chief economist’ towards director ‘economic department’, let independent particular body member (making responsible decision-making body whole), help solve problem information filtering. openness consequence ‘staff independence’. allow staff independent time require decision-making body member take active approach towards analysis produce staff. since perfect understand message contain ‘policy documents’ prerequisite proper policy conduct, interaction decision-making body member staff assure different levels. and finally, need deal uncertainty properly arise consequence uncertainty surround monetary policy practice. therefore, highly desirable discus imply risk different levels: (i) first, risk discuss staff. (ii) second, evaluation risk perform interactively decision-making body member staff (alternative scenario produce basis discussions). (iii) third, risk alternative scenario discuss decision-making body member policy meeting. it clear above-mentioned property satisfy either bank board policy committee make decisions. over year prove system work well. on one hand, policy committee automatically encompass property separateness full devotion member towards monetary policy. on hand, bank board member probably identify closely institution offer diversify view policy conduct. indeed, really difficult distinguish system superior; prevail solution determine tradition local conditions. nevertheless, is, fact, critical importance legal framework use background decision making. the decision-making body’s mandate arise directly central bank law, even constitution, sufficiently ‘clear’. any internal agreement shift policy responsibility towards somebody explicitly refer central bank law, thus assume policy responsible, could highly vulnerable unstable. this could become apparent soon period tough decision arrives. the implication split two groups. the first group cover rather general implication summarize as: policy decision-making role perform body well define central bank law. in addition, regardless whether decision-making body bank board policy committee, fulfil property diversity opinions, regularity, separateness, staff independence, openness, deal uncertainty. the second group implication offer practical view summarize follows: a) ‘policy decision-making’ body strong background law, b) meet devote monetary policy deal issue, c) forecast economic analysis submit staff constrain ‘information filtering’, d) decision maker interact staff. 2 bi review 88/2005 y v reddy: corporate governance bank india luncheon address dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, seminar corporate governance bank director organise indian institute management, bangalore; international institute finance, washington indian banks’ association, mumbai, 16 december 2005. * * * friends, i thankful organiser invite give luncheon address. there several reason i compel accept responsibility. first, eminence presentors, namely indian institute management, bangalore, international institute finance indian banks’ association. second, persuasive skill mr. sinor bring bear persona whole bank community subject. third, grow importance accord governance bank reserve bank india (rbi) recent years. this program address bank director indian bank rbi would like see supportive effort equip director bank address commercial-cum-governance issue general fulfil fiduciary responsibility implicit board banks, particular. since many substantive aspect subject address highly qualify professionals, i initially make general observation subject devote rest enumeration reserve bank’s recent initiative think way forward. general observation a aware, corporate governance, subject significance public policy markets, recent origin. it useful recognise dynamic concept, term scope, thrust relevance. for example, issue approach differently today compare original view cadbury committee subject. east-asian crisis give new dimension corporate governance context financial stability. in u.s.a., regulatory regimes, post-corporate scandals, different early 90’s. the oecd set corporate governance principle 1999 revise 2004. basel committee bank supervision (under aegis bis) publish guideline corporate governance bank 1999. a update, july 2005, basel committee issue consultative document enhance corporate governance bank organisations, seek comment end october 2005. i would advise document final document release bis, compulsory read regulator concern director board banks. the point note corporate governance view ongoing process subject rapid change base experiences, development policy-setting. there considerable divergence understand practice corporate governance general, respect banks, particular, also increase tendency towards convergence. the cultural context may difficult capture legal, institutional attitudinal context vary perceptibly across countries. difference notice even amongst industrialise country – say anglo-saxon, european japanese situations. at time, trend towards great convergence several reasons. the corporates get list multiple stock exchange different country carry corporate operation several jurisdiction cross-border financial flow seek assurance commonly understand standard governance, mutually reinforce tendency. banks, particular, subject special interest governance, especially view fiduciary role. the cross-border operation bank provide add impetus convergence standards. public policy framework regard corporate governance typically involve multiplicity agency countries. for instance, india, department company affairs; security exchange board india respect list entity apart bank regulator respect banks. harmonise policy dynamic set daunt task policy maker add complexity corporates bank concern ensure compliance. in regard sector bank india ownership government dominant, additional issues. government, owner, accountable political institution term broad bi review 88/2005 1 socio-economic objective hence, goal may necessarily compatible purely economic incentives. mix ownership, government major shareholder, bring sharp focus possible divergent objective share-ownership corporate bank issue relate right minority shareholders. the problem get complex public ownership exercise separate legislation company law, normally applicable compete entities. the role director divergent organisational settings, therefore, need nuanced appreciation. let end general observation anecdote. when i work world bank late 1970s, i join george washington university get taste education foreign university. i take course management services. the professor emphasise various aspect organisational behaviour. i find best interest organisation one serf miss analysis. when i queried, said: “it bos interpret you, good organisation”. when i persisted, added, “we deal corporate behaviour context north american male u.s.a.” i must confess i continue old-fashioned. any institution has, case, character, culture interest worth pursue even appear variance sum interest individual, minority majority stakeholders. i leave think view corporate governance broad term extend beyond immediate constituent stakeholder occasion divergence interest might arise. with this, let move rbi subject. reserve bank’s approach the formal policy announcement regard corporate governance first make distinguish predecessor, dr. bimal jalan mid-term review monetary credit policy october 21, 2001. pursuant announcement, consultative group constitute november 2001 chairmanship dr. a.s. ganguly: basically, view strengthen internal supervisory role boards. an advisory group corporate governance chairmanship dr. r.h. patil early submit report march 2001 examine issue relate corporate governance bank india include public sector bank make recommendation bring governance standard india par best international standards. there also relevant observation advisory group bank supervision chairmanship, shri m.s. verma submit report january 2003. keep recommendation view cross-country experience, reserve bank initiate several measure strengthen corporate governance indian bank sector. in june 2002, report ganguly group transmit bank consideration simultaneously transmit government india appropriate consideration. it may note basic difference private sector bank public sector bank far reserve bank’s role governance matter relevant bank concerned. the current regulatory framework ensures, large, uniform treatment private public sector bank reserve bank far prudential aspect concerned. however, governance aspect public sector banks, though bear prudential aspects, exempt applicability relevant provision b.r. act, govern respective legislation various public sector bank set up. in brief, therefore, approach rbi ensure, extent possible, uniform treatment public sector private sector bank regard prudential regulations. in regard governance aspect relevant banking, reserve bank prescribe policy framework private sector bank suggest government framework adoption, appropriate, consistent legal policy imperatives. a follow-up ganguly committee report, mid-term review monetary credit policy november 2003, concept ‘fit proper’ criterion director bank formally enunciated, include process collect information, exercise due diligence constitution nomination committee board scrutinise declaration make bank directors. in regard, useful refer rbi guideline ownership governance private sector bank release recently. it hearten note base guideline issue rbi, bank private sector carry out, nomination committees, exercise due diligence respect director boards. in cases, track record director consider 2 bi review 88/2005 satisfactory, director vacate positions. in regard others, on-going process ensure ‘fit proper’ status directors. in regard, may useful distinguish issue composition board ‘fit proper’ status individual non-executive director chief executives. the first relate collective expertise board available meet competitive challenge bank ensure commercial activity maintain soundness. the exist legal provision regard bank stipulate specific area background director draw accountancy, banking, economics, finance, agriculture, etc., specify extent degree professionalism expertise require regard area. hence, leave good faith shareholder elect director various specify area qualification experience appropriate bank. in regard public sector banks, good faith expect director nominate government. however, issue ‘fit proper’ status non-executive director come up, norm seek ensure candidate come adverse notice law regulation professional body objection rbi. in case non-executive director satisfy ‘fit proper’ criteria, prescribe due process follow rbi disqualify directors, include opportunity heard. the position regard ceo private sector bank different foot reserve bank position exercise judgement suitability candidate proposed, much approval reserve bank require appointment rbi may seek removal also. these provision broadly consistent global best practice though scope enhance effective implementation. there legal provision reserve bank insist ‘fit proper’ status director nominate government elect shareholder board public sector banks. the appointment ceo public sector banks, well removal, also matter decide government india. there is, however, active consultation reserve bank regard appointment ceos. thus, large, de facto compliance many governance requirement public sector banks. . way forward a step towards distance regulator function boards, reserve bank withdraw nominee director almost private sector banks. observer appoint transitional measure mostly respect bank yet fully comply reserve bank’s guideline ownership governance. it hop need observer also diminish quality governance improves. second, legislative amendment propose regard public sector bank remove provision mandatory nomination rbi officer board thus, bring par private sector bank regard. third, government request keep view policy framework governance private sector bank decide appointment director boards’ public sector bank constitution various committee board. fourth, rbi, far possible, recently refrain issue circular instruction specifically address public sector banks. it expect exist instruction specifically applicable public sector bank review reserve bank uniformity regulatory framework different category bank formally established. fifth, several amendment bank regulation act propose would enhance rbi’s capacity ensure sound governance specially relevant banks, consistent global best practices. in regard urban co-operative bank (ucbs), unique problem need addressed. since governance aspect urban co-operative bank fall entirely within jurisdiction state governments, prudential aspect rbi’s domain, difficult ensure effective co-ordination owe problem dual control matter governance bear prudential regulation. further, market discipline term shareholders’ influence governance exist regard urban co-operative bank since depend equity market funds. moreover, governance structure ucbs bi review 88/2005 3 seem tilt favour borrower ucbs, thus, possibly undermine interest depositors. currently, avoid problem dual control, mechanism memorandum understand (mou) state governments, attempted. rbi enter mous andhra pradesh, gujarat karnataka provide facility upgrade skill member board management ucbs, states. the problem dual control even acute regard rural co-operative credit structure. however, currently address government india light recommendation vaidyanathan committee. the rrbs yet another category bank actually owned, pre-determined pattern, state, centre sponsor banks. the sponsor bank virtually manage rrbs issue governance institution yet addressed. deposit take nbfcs and, perhaps, nbfcs systemic implication may also need consider careful review current governance practice view unique role expand importance financial sector. conclusion let conclude reiteration reserve bank continuously strive ensure compliance international standard best practice corporate governance bank relevant india. rbi also interact closely government sebi regard. increase regulatory comfort regard standard governance bank give great confidence shift external regulation internal system control risk-management. each director bank role continually enhance standard governance bank combination appropriate knowledge values. thank you. 4 bi review 88/2005 toshihiko fukui: overview japanese economy summary speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, meet business leaders, nagoya, 8 december 2005. * * * introduction i understand active full year chubu region open central japan international airport (centrair) success expo 2005 aichi japan. the japanese economy also recover vibrancy, absorb dynamism region. i attend meet g-7 country london last week. the g-7 country share view overall global economic growth remain continue solid although risk factor high crude oil price increase inflationary pressures. in remark today, i present bank's view regard recent economic financial developments, explain think conduct monetary policy. the current state japan's economy outlook japan's economy continue recover, emerge temporary pause begin second half 2004. the economy likely experience sustain period expansion pace slightly potential. the bank release october outlook economic activity price (the outlook report) month ago. this outlook report project economic growth continue rest fiscal 2005 fiscal 2006. in addition continue expansion overseas economies, another major factor behind ongoing recovery corporate sector essentially complete adjustment "three excesses," namely, production capacity, employment, debt. in relation financial system, may also note financial institution mostly overcome nonperforming-loan (npl) problem recover management stability. in corporate sector, corporate profit increase three consecutive year since fiscal 2002, trend continue fiscal 2005 ratio profit sale primarily large firm surpass level record bubble era. the semiannual book close first half fiscal 2005 indicate high profit maintain across wide range industries. a background favorable corporate profit past three four years, firm reduce "three excesses," effective greatly low break-even points. amid developments, global economic growth rate accelerate 2003-04, domestic private demand firm predict fiscal 2005, push sale strongly support recent improvement profits. domestic private demand firm expect business fix investment increase background high corporate profits, strong corporate performance positively influence household sector via increase wage employment, well increase dividend stock prices. accord tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), large small firm believe presently face great personnel shortage 13 eight years, respectively. under conditions, number part-time employee peak early fiscal 2005 number full-time employee growing. turn wage per worker, regular payment rising, mostly increase wage full-time employees, special payment also increase background high corporate profits. accord survey private institutions, winter bonus large firm 2005 increase high rate, surpass rise summer bonuses. consequently, household income continue rise gradually. moreover, dividend income receive household grow year year, percentage dividend income interest income rise 40 percent 80 percent past three four years. amid improvement employment income situation, consumer confidence generally good private consumption steady. in manner, virtuous cycle begin whereby favorable corporate profit lead strong business fix investment spread household sector various ways, increase household expenditure feed back corporate sector via growth private bi review 87/2005 1 consumption. the economy thus unlikely fall recession due domestic factor time being. also, i mentioned, financial system improve significantly. the percentage npls financial institution decline greatly since peak end fiscal 2001, bank post record-high profit semiannual book close end september 2005, surpass achieve bubble era. bank lend (amount outstanding, adjust liquidation loan loan write-offs), long maintain negative growth, begin rise year year august 2005. while corporate sector whole continue repay debt, repayment pressure gradually easing, amid continue recovery business condition firm move ahead external fund activities, take advantage accommodative financial environment. additionally, land price adjustment advanced, especially major cities, increase housing-related investment, among others, another factor contribute rise bank lending. future risk factor of course, certain risk factor economic outlook. the bank pay particular attention rise crude oil price development overseas economies. crude oil price mark record high around end august 2005 (about 70 u.s. dollars/barrel wti crude oil) follow hurricane damage unite states, soften somewhat recently, remain rather high level. the rise crude oil price recent year largely attributable increase global demand, reflect development high growth emerge economies. therefore, high crude oil price may compatible expansion global economy oil-producing country oil-consuming country take adequate action deal increase demand. nevertheless, demonstrate rapid increase crude oil price u.s. hurricane damage end august, risk crude oil price may shoot level compatible demand increase accompany expansion global economy keen awareness refine capacity supply constraint intensifying. if risk manifest future, may influence global economy economy japan decrease real purchase power non-oil-producing country full-scale emergence global inflationary concerns. a overseas economies, price stability maintain unite state federal reserve raise interest rate prevent emergence inflationary pressure crude oil price remain high level. in europe asia, concern shift toward risk inflationary side. the european central bank raise interest rate begin december 2005. the maintenance accommodative financial environment price stability form part background expansion overseas economy recent years, future loss price stability could change structure exert negative influence growth global economy. while i mention japanese economy unlikely fall recession due domestic factors, must note unexpected slowdown overseas economy large external shock could decelerate economic growth japan. price condition outlook turn price conditions, domestic corporate good price currently rise pace slightly 2 percent year year, reflect increase crude oil international commodity price depreciation yen. while rate increase likely ease, corporate good price project continue rise strong upward pressure. the consumer price index (cpi; exclude fresh food, nationwide basis) move slightly previous year's levels, post zero percent rise 2004 recently release figure october 2005. the cpi figure january march 2006 expect show relatively clear positive year-on-year increases. this affect factor negative contribution low rice price dissipate influence electricity telephone charge reduction weakening. in addition, affect factor decline unit labor cost shrink rise wages, gap supply demand narrow japanese economy whole, indicate perception labor shortage tankan. the year-on-year change expect remain positive thereafter japan's economic growth 2 bi review 87/2005 project exceed potential growth rate. survey price development also indicate expectation price revise upward. financial market development against background positive turn outlook economic activity prices, net purchase japanese stock foreign investor post record highs, stock price rise substantially, nikkei 225 stock average recover 15,000 yen level begin december 2005, high level five years. meanwhile, yen depreciate foreign exchange market, fall 121 yen u.s. dollar early december continue decline trend euro asian currencies. it say recent depreciation yen reflect market participants' view differential japanese foreign interest rates, give great awareness inflation risk abroad heighten expectation high interest rates. the influence economic activity price financial market development include rise stock price continue warrant careful monitoring. the bank's conduct monetary policy the bank maintain quantitative ease policy since march 2001. the two pillar quantitative ease policy are: bank's provision ample liquidity money market outstanding balance current account bank substantially exceed amount require reserve 6 trillion yen; bank's commitment continue provision ample liquidity year-on-year rate change cpi (excluding fresh food, nationwide basis) register zero percent high sustainable basis. this commitment unprecedented central bank monetary policy, stipulate condition beforehand make possible market participant act base commitment contribute boost transparency effectiveness monetary policy. review subsequent policy effects, strong concern financial system stability, provision ample liquidity bank, meet financial institutions' liquidity demand, stabilize financial market maintain accommodative financial conditions, contribute avert contraction economic activity. in financial markets, bank's provision ample liquidity push short-term interest rate practically zero percent. longer-term interest rate remain stably low levels, commitment bank lead market expect short-term interest rate remain zero percent price continue decline. now concern financial system stability subside substantially price begin rise, commitment lose influence formation longer-term interest rates. thus, effect quantitative ease policy coincide effect short-term interest rate practically zero percent. after quantitative ease policy maintain accordance commitment, future monetary policy follow path process "reducing outstanding balance current account toward level line require reserves," "maintaining low interest rates," "gradually adjust interest rate level consistent economic activity price developments." in explicate process somewhat great detail, respect time change quantitative ease policy framework, bank judge whether year-on-year rate change cpi register zero percent high sustainable basis accordance commitment. assume development follow projection describe outlook report, possibility meet condition commitment depart present monetary policy framework likely increase course fiscal 2006. in reduce outstanding balance current accounts, bank need monitor financial market condition carefully, outstanding balance current account bank exceed substantially amount require reserve long period time. up point, outstanding balance current accounts, substantially level require reserves, keep short-term interest rate practically zero percent, minor fluctuation any. consider effect quantitative ease policy coincide effect short-term interest rate practically zero percent, change policy framework imply major change policy effect. if trend toward positive year-on-year bi review 87/2005 3 growth cpi become firmly established, real short-term interest rate effectively decline, provide powerful stimulus economic activity prices. the level time-path interest rate subsequent two process certainly depend economic activity price developments. if judge upward pressure price continue contain economy follow sustainable balance growth path, likely give bank latitude conduct monetary policy. the bank conduct monetary policy realize sustainable growth japanese economy price stability. at present, economic recovery continue environment influence price begin change. if year-on-year rate change cpi register zero percent high sustainable basis, mark sort milestone toward realize goal. the bank continue conduct monetary policy appropriately accordance change economic price condition provide support financial side good performance japanese economy long term. appropriate monetary policy also important perspective financial market stability. for example, long-term interest rate remain stable unite state part market confidence appropriate conduct monetary policy federal reserve maintain price stability future. in japan well, note outlook report, together maintenance appropriate monetary policy, bank's explanation think conduct monetary policy detail contribute smooth formation price financial markets. close remark chubu region take advantage manufacture strengths, vigorously develop private-sector business activities, pull japanese economy forward. such originality inventiveness base private-sector initiative utmost importance japanese economy realize sustainable growth. in sense, i look forward remarkable development chubu region. 4 bi review 87/2005 wu xiaoling: speed financial innovation promote development small medium-sized enterprise speech m wu xiaoling, deputy governor people’s bank china, high level seminar development investment small medium-sized enterprise (smes) east asia, beijing, 27 october 2005. * * * lady gentlemen: i please attend first high level seminar development investment small medium-sized enterprise (smes) east asia. the rise smes become important force behind rapid, sustainable sound development economy, also play active role structural adjustment job creation. hence, government attach increase importance development smes. in recent years, financial sector china take concrete measure accordance act promote small medium-sized enterprise policy state. progress make provide quality financial service smes. accord survey launch pbc, loan smes account 50% total credit asset past years, roughly equivalent contribution smes gdp. nevertheless, remain hard many smes obtain finance many entity expect improve management loan smes. i would like touch upon three issue occasion: i. strengthen credit management foster growth customer most smes incomplete corporate governance, loose management, lack transparency account information, result difficulty obtain financing. it difficult discover smes various stage differ finance need channels. smes start stage face high uncertainty production operation. they little capacity provide collateral, credit record transparent information. hence, difficult commercial bank accurately judge yield risk potential loans, thus impede lending. a result, smes mainly rely internal financing, limit direct finance private borrow raise funds. some high-tech smes also get money venture capital. smes grow period gradually foster capacity provide collateral accumulate credit record expand business time. their internal information relationship commercial bank become increasingly transparent. usually smes eager expand strongly need credit. however, give incomplete internal management financial operation, remain hard meet credit examination criterion obtain credit. mature smes face decline uncertainty operations. with sufficient credit record relatively transparent information, creditor investor good position grasp internal information smes, smes capacity provide sufficient collateral. in context, enterprise usually quality customer financial institution compete for. their loan would grow rapidly. the successful smes may become large enterprises, thus able access direct financing. these enterprise may raise fund issue bond stock shares, thus face little constraint obtain financing. smes big group customers. to differentiate among smes correspond finance channel could actually enhance allocation social resources. the central bank shall provide credit guidance commercial bank macro perspective. in process, commercial bank shall strengthen loan management, enhance efficiency, discover foster potential customers. with rapid development financial market, direct finance channel large enterprise would explored, share increased. commercial bank face challenge term customer structure. hence, urgent commercial bank discover foster stable customer bunch smes. bi review 87/2005 1 credit market capital market mainly differ fact one-to-one negotiation commercial bank customers. hence, commercial bank good position get management information, make judgment risk price loans. therefore, commercial bank tailor product smes accord finance need various stages. meanwhile, commercial bank shall long vision explore potential customer help smes quickly transit start stage towards mature stage. ii. appropriately price lend risk smes lend rate actually price credit products. the price credit product mainly include cost capital risk premium. the price capacity chinese financial institution generally weak. one reason many administrative restriction many price determine government. financial institution price power experience autonomously determine price. moreover, financial institution incentive make autonomous price duce institutional weaknesses. chronically, perception shall provide preferential interest rate industry area would support. in general, banks’ lend large customer like wholesale business smes retail. loan smes usually feature small amount, many batch sophisticate procedures. accord survey, administrative cost sme loan average 5 time large enterprises. if strict restriction lend rate, bank may little incentive conduct feasibility assessment sme projects. a result smes limit access bank loan thus face severe situation. hence, shall change traditional way think encourage commercial bank price risk associate sme loan explore new source profits. of course, might extent increase interest expense smes. nevertheless, le important compare increase access smes loans. in particular, high-tech high-risk enterprise private enterprise benefit. since people’s bank china remove ceiling lend rate october 28, 2004, observe bank begin utilize new policy foster risk price capacity. of course, government social intermediary help smes reduce risk finance cost risk share compensate measures. on one hand, guarantee institution shall support market operation recapitalization improve risk control mechanism. on hand, local government diversify systemic risk associate guarantee sme loan direct guarantee re-guarantee. with risk sme loan shared, subject le risk premium low lend rate. iii. reform credit system management respect smes credit system management involve banks’ credit management, risk control, asset disposal supervisory mechanism. in recent years, deepen china’s financial reform, bank sector increasingly aware credit risk, lead centralization credit approval power opposition smes. on one hand, local branch commercial bank le power approve credit loan request report branch provincial level even headquarter. a result, take long time sophisticate procedure process loan application, make hard meet finance need local smes. on hand, local branch commercial bank lag area become ‘savings bank’, transfer save develop area need large amount money. the save bank thus could earn spreads, local enterprise could obtain credit. frankly speaking, centralize management pattern line development trend international bank industry. however, need adjust meet need smes. the current credit management two problems. first, large commercial bank single legal entity, make hard provide frequent short-term loan smes swift manner. second, credit rat method smes significantly different large ones. the current credit risk rat system adopt commercial bank accommodate operation account information disclosure pattern smes. give long process procedure large banks, people’s bank china actively promote institutional innovation joint-stock bank establishment community bank build close relationship local smes provide sound financial service 2 bi review 87/2005 simplify process procedures. meanwhile, commercial bank encourage improve credit management develop new product orient towards smes include loan approval, credit rating, collateral, guarantee, price loan management. the china bank regulatory commission promulgate guidance bank loan smes commercial bank make effort probe way. to support smes line need macroeconomic development, also important channel financial sector explore new source profits, adjust credit structure diversify credit risk. in period ahead, use monetary credit policy help develop channel financial service smes enhance efficiency financial institution regard. the development smes long sophisticate process, involve joint effort government agencies, bank enterprise well introduction advance experience abroad. i believe establish broad multi-layer finance system smes give rise rapid development enterprises. thank you. bi review 87/2005 3 jean-claude trichet: interview paris match interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conduct m elisabeth chavelet (paris match) 7

conference, zurich, 15 december 2005. * * * lady gentleman a announce press release, swiss national bank raise target range three-month libor 0.25 percentage point 0.50–1.50%. this change take effect immediately. the snb intend hold rate middle target range time being. economic recovery continue expected. it grow strong broad-based. the snb raise forecast economic growth 2005 expect increase gdp reach 1.5%. for 2006, project growth little 2%. the national bank anticipate average inflation 2005 remain 1.2%. on assumption three-month libor remain unchanged 1.0%, forecast annual inflation 0.8% 2006 1.2% 2007. by raise target range, swiss national bank adjust monetary policy economic developments, proceed expected. the snb thus ensure inflation outlook remain favourable. despite increase interest rate, monetary policy snb remain expansionary support upswing. a economic recovery progresses, snb continue gradually adjust monetary policy. if swiss franc appreciate rapidly, national bank would react appropriately. today’s increase three-month libor generally expected. why financial market anticipate move? the answer simple. the moderate increase interest rate compatible strategy make gradual correction expansionary monetary policy, take account economic recovery. let clarify statement. economic activity at monetary policy assessment mid-september, address factor indicate economic improvement second quarter. we expect trend would strengthen second half year. the movement economic indicator last three month confirm scenario. accord estimate state secretariat economic affair (seco), real gdp third quarter exceed previous quarter annualised figure 4.3%. with respect year-back level, 2.3%. together gdp figure third quarter, seco also present revise figure first two quarters. the new figure substantially high before, even considerable increase figure first quarter present september. most observer surprise size growth estimate third quarter. what more, retrospective revision considerably modify perception economic situation first half year. nevertheless, interpretation quarterly estimate difficult view sizable fluctuation final demand fact main factor impact gdp momentum change inventories. other indicators, consumer confidence index, company expectations, labour demand continue low level inflation expectations, appear indicate modest level economic momentum. despite uncertainty respect gdp estimates, information currently available u indicate economic recovery accelerate past months. fourth-quarter indicator point continuation economic upswing. although export growth slowing, international demand remain robust. this momentum increasingly shift domestic sector, act stimulus. gradually, utilisation industrial production capacity improving. meanwhile, company expect demand pick next months. there sign recovery corporate investment third quarter. over next quarters, high utilisation rate technical capacity industry favourable sale outlook bi review 86/2005 1 likely provide great support investment equipment gradual increase labour demand. a result, disequilibrium labour market likely diminish. in last quarter, private consumption remain strong. since employment expect increase course 2006, consumer confidence strengthen. by contrast, stimulus provide construction investment likely subside next year. in particular, may expect that, three year robust growth, investment residential construction stagnate high level. overall, project gdp growth 1.5% year. previously, expect growth reach 1%. to large extent, correction growth forecast due seco’s revision figure first two quarters. for 2006, forecast economic growth little 2%. this would take gdp growth level potential growth path swiss economy. the output gap – i.e. gap normal actual utilisation resource – diminish. monetary development alongside figure real economy, movement monetary credit aggregate also indicate economic recovery underway. since adopt resolutely expansionary monetary policy three year ago, mortgage lend grow annual rate 5%. we continue monitor development real estate market closely. since september, loan also record positive rate growth respect year-back figures. in past, development kind usually indicate strengthen economic recovery. the economy well supply liquidity result expansionary monetary policy. although growth broadly-defined monetary aggregate, m3, fall 1% october 2004, since climb back 6%. however, excess liquidity gradually reduce result interest rate increase announce today. in way, aim ensure price stability endanger future. the monetary policy decision the economic monetary situation develop way anticipated. the inflation outlook prior today’s decision largely line figure present last monetary policy assessment. for 2006, however, forecast slightly high level inflation present last assessment. this due revision make certain figure point high rate utilisation economy. in view inflation outlook, justification decision increase target range three-month libor 25 basis points? while anticipate fall rate inflation next year, decline relevant term monetary policy. recent inflation level 1% probably largely due rise oil price begin first half 2004. at time, decide take increase inflation account monetary policy decisions, due fact consequence could neutralise monetary policy measures. it seem logical, therefore, take account decline inflation attributable subside oil prices, particularly since drop also result statistical effect. a number inflation component likely persist low level, even 2006. we work assumption price import product continue fall, due especially continue pressure exert international competition. this dampen effect domestic price level. all factor mean gain productivity pass consumer form price reductions. since considerable lag adoption monetary policy measure impact prices, monetary policy affect price development near term. consequently, national bank guide medium-term inflation outlook rather short-term forecast. the inflation forecast publish since 2003 show high rate inflation end forecast horizon. this make clear cannot continue expansionary monetary policy unlimited period time. the three-month libor already lift june september 2004, time 25 basis points. because economy weaken fourth quarter 2004, improvement inflation outlook monetary policy assessment december 2004, march june 2005. consequently, decision undertake increase rate interest appropriate. however, forecast mid-september 2005 indicate would improvement inflation outlook. nevertheless, decide increase interest rate time. we determine take action fact oil price attain 2 bi review 86/2005 record height monetary policy assessment. it possible time fully ass impact economy inflation. if monetary policy remain assessment, medium-term inflation outlook would unchanged. in meantime, however, room manoeuvre available monetary policy declined. our inevitable concern respect high price oil september dissipate favourable development economy. a result, decide increase target range three-month libor 0.25 percentage points. consequently, decision line statement make last monetary policy assessment. inflation forecast graph i turn current inflation forecast, base assumption change three-month libor, 1.0%. the graph depict current previous forecasts. the dash red curve represent new forecast, cover period fourth quarter 2005 third quarter 2008. it summarise inflation outlook, follow today’s increase rate interest. the dash-dotted green curve show inflation forecast time last monetary policy assessment base three-month libor 0.75%. the two forecast similar 2006, show recede rate inflation due fact oil price increase further. a 2007, new inflation forecast lie previous one. this reflect dampen effect today’s interest rate decision future inflation. the forecast show immediate inflation risk. at 0.8% 1.2% come two years, expect rate inflation remain low. however, evident inflation dynamic that, even three-month libor 1.0%, monetary policy expansionary effect. with today’s decision increase three-month libor 25 basis points, adhere previous monetary policy course. we continue support economy, use leeway available us. this guarantee price stability long term. if swiss franc appreciate rapidly, national bank respond appropriately, keep option open eventuality, past. observe inflation december 2005 bi review 86/2005 3 inflation forecast september 2005 libor 0.75% december 2005 libor 1.00% inflation forecast

bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 15 december 2005. * * * development financial market the international financial market dominate recent month four key developments. long-term capital market yield improved; equity market have, whole, exhibit positive developments; u dollar continue uptrend set begin year; gold price climb sharply. the movement past month international capital market largely attributable economic development u monetary policy. long-term dollar interest rate climb significantly second half year thank robust economic climate, positive outlook u continue normalisation monetary policy federal reserve. a rise yield also observe outside us. the spread u european capital market rates, however, remain considerable. this least reflect differ business cycle phase u european economies. despite improve economic outlook high oil prices, inflation expectation have, whole, remain moderate side atlantic. the three major economic area – us, japan europe – exhibit divergent equity market developments. while u equity market largely maintain sideways trend, european index firm substantially. have recover low early 2003, japan’s equity market also make mark recovery. the increase optimism regard economy highly favourable earn situation company major contribute factor rise equity price europe japan. the swiss equity market – measure spi – trade peak level september 2000. look development since 1995, become apparent swiss equity market strengthen far significantly equivalent foreign market (cf. graph 1). in forex market, dollar’s recovery continued, greenback benefit cyclical interest rate lead us, make dollar investment maturity rather attractive. a number market analyst believe homeland investment act, offer tax break u corporation repatriate foreign earn hold abroad end fiscal year, boost dollar. despite fact second half year u current account deficit climb high still – 6% gdp – thus reach all-time high, global imbalance appear destabilise greenback. on whole, however, real exchange rate trend close long-term average (cf. graph 2). against background robust global economy, commodity price rise yet further, oil gold particularly strong demand. however, energy resource gold exclude equation, raw material price dollar term similar level begin 2004. while price oil recede high-water mark wake hurricane katrina back within region usd 60 barrel, gold price trade 24-year high usd 500 ounce. a number factor contribute increase price. the physical demand gold intensify significantly, rise 40% year alone india, large market. increase demand central bank emerge country oil-producing country also reported. moreover, currently low real interest rate push opportunity cost interest-free investments, gold. given, too, gold market largely illiquid, even small shift demand trigger serious price effects. in view fact implicit inflation expectation still firmly anchor – accord inflation-protected bond survey – inflation fear hardly consider main driver behind gold price increase. snb’s performance take consideration development gold price, snb yield average annual return 1% asset 1980 2005 (end september). while interest-bis review 86/2005 1 bear asset post high average yield period, snb settle overall loss gold. the annual yield – include gold price movement – fluctuate strongly minus 25% plus 20%. for assessment future development earnings, figure limit significance, however. the level spread earn determine balance sheet total, structure asset achievable financial market yields. since measure change time, rather difficult estimate long-term earn potential snb. at end 2004, national bank’s asset amount chf 118 billion. after distribution proceed gold sale spring 2005, invest fund contract chf 21 billion. furthermore, high profit distribution swiss confederation canton deplete exist distribution reserve 2012, thus decrease asset chf 10 billion compare end 2004. from today’s perspective, leaf snb asset region chf 85 billion. at present, national bank’s asset comprise 25% swiss franc investments, 45% foreign exchange reserve 30% gold. foreign currency investment generate interest dividend income. give globally low inflation rates, nominal interest income currently substantially low 1980s 1990s. in addition, valuation bond equity portfolios, foreign exchange position gold hold market price result valuation gain losses. meanwhile, interest income swiss franc asset – primarily repos – marginal. in 95% cases, massive fluctuation income attribute fluctuate value gold foreign exchange positions. experience show valuation gain loss financial investment tend level long term. base conditions, thus estimate earn potential asset 2% 3%, translate income chf 1.7 chf 2.5 billion per annum total asset chf 85 billion. give fluctuation exchange rate gold price, however, earn generate deviate greatly amount. for instance, mark increase gold price year result valuation gain roughly chf 8 billion date. should gold price drop back next year end-2003 level, however, would lead valuation loss chf 7 billion. long-term income estimate base unusual gain losses. some income allocate provisions, thereby ensure growth currency reserve necessary monetary policy. this allocation (currently approximately chf 1 billion per annum) make proportion nominal gdp growth. after deduction snb’s operate expense currently chf 250 million, roughly chf 1 billion remain distribution confederation cantons. base assumption regard earn potential assets, expect distributable annual profit somewhere region foreseeable future. once exist distribution reserve depleted, likely reduce profit distribution significantly. cosa initiative the people’s initiative “national bank profit old age survivors' insurance fund (ahv/avs)” – good know cosa initiative – propose allocate snb’s profit remain deduct chf 1 billion canton old age survivors’ insurance fund (ahv/avs). an obligation kind would impact national bank’s independence, put political pressure distribute high profits, turn would possible snb expand money supply, reduce currency reserve take great risks. this would undermine snb’s credibility freedom action well compromise stability swiss franc. the national bank’s important task conduct monetary policy gear towards price stability. in order this, able take monetary policy decision – even difficult situation – without political pressure obligation generate return. 2 bi review 86/2005 bi review 86/2005 3 zeti akhtar aziz: empower consumer progressive sustainable

force globalisation, advance technology, trend towards great market orientation financial innovation. in dynamic environment, maintenance financial stability become increasingly complex challenging. the requirement expectation consumer also change rapidly tandem increase education levels, grow wealth great affluence. follow developments, consumer become discern demand good product choices,

occasion publication december 2005 financial stability review, frankfurt, 8 december 2005. the slide find website european central bank www.ecb.int. * * * lady gentlemen, i. introduction welcome press brief occasion presentation december 2005 edition ecb’s financial stability review, publish semi-annually, june december year. my presentation today three part (see slide 2): i start introductory remarks, outline purpose, scope, method analysis structure review. thereafter, i highlight main source risk vulnerability assess emanate four areas: (i) global macro-financial environment; (ii) financial markets; (iii) balance sheet euro area household corporations; (iv) financial institutions, include bank insurance companies. finally, i provide overall assessment outlook financial stability euro area. by publish financial stability review, ecb pursue three objectives: first, promote awareness issue relevant safeguard stability euro area financial system encourage inform debate these; second, provide overview source risk vulnerability regard financial stability; way, review seek play role prevent crises; and, third, analyse way promote maintain stable financial system. the scope review wide, cover euro area financial system, notably banks, financial institution (e.g. insurance companies), capital money market financial infrastructure (payment settlement systems). a such, report kind euro area. the analysis underpin assessment financial stability outlook comprise three elements: • evaluation robustness financial system; • identification plausible systemically important risk euro area financial stability; • assessment ability financial system cope shock event combination identify risk vulnerability materialise. it stress call attention source risk vulnerability mean seek identify probable outcome. rather, entail highlight potential plausible downside risks, even unlikely materialise. the review prepare close involvement bank supervision committee european system central banks, forum cooperation among national central bank supervisory authority 25 european union member state ecb. the combination micro perspective supervisor macro perspective central banker contribute make assessment wide-ranging possible. the review also serf basis semi-annual financial stability discussion ecb govern council therefore represent common view govern council. the review organise four main chapters: first, overview, set scene self-contained analysis assessment; second, analysis macro-financial environment ass financial balance non-financial sector economy; third, inspection financial system form core review; and, fourth, section six special features, i.e. short article aim provide analytical contextual underpinnings. the first article deal bi review 86/2005 1 measurement challenge relate financial stability analysis. the second analysis financial market contagion. the third ass financial vulnerability mortgage-indebted euro area households. the fourth study look determinant euro area banks’ profitability. the fifth article look effect new account framework banks. the final study look financial stability issue relate central counterparty clear houses. in addition special features, review contain 20 box well statistical annex. ii. main area vulnerability euro area financial system let turn substance review present main find analysis assessment. i start look main development global macro-financial environment (see slide 4). ii.1. global macro finance global imbalance continue widen 2005. the chart leave slide 4 show among main economic areas, unite state remain large borrower country. however, change composition global creditor countries, share japan euro area diminishing, china and, particular, oil produce countries, grow importance finance u deficit 2005. the chart right slide 4 focus evolution u deficit. the total net lend u economy reach new post-bretton-woods record 6.5% gdp first quarter 2005, narrow slightly 6.3% gdp second quarter. for much time since 2000, main domestic source u current account deficit grow fiscal imbalance heavy household sector borrowing. on hand, rather atypically, corporate sector enjoy financial surplus. this may last, however, corporate sector begin leverage again. overall, sustainability current account position seem rather unproblematic short term, expansion imbalance expose global financial system risk sharp correction medium term, particular confidence suddenly deteriorate financial markets. an additional significant risk euro area financial stability current year surge oil prices. slide 5 highlight implication global financial system rise oil price level that, real terms, remain close peak reach late 1970s. while impact elevate oil price financial system thus far le substantial previously feared, risk premia segment global equity market could nevertheless adversely affected. the chart leave plot real oil price u equity market earn yield premium. the relatively close co-movement two variable seem carry recent episode increase oil prices, possibly explain part relatively subdue development u equity market current year. regard corporate credit markets, 2005 problem u automobile airline sector – sensitive level oil price – create period short-lived turbulence credit markets, include market complex structure credit instruments. look ahead, key question credit market likely time turn current benign credit cycle. the chart right slide 5 show decline global corporate default rate stabilise low level first three quarter 2005 mark decline 2002-2004. partially reflect effect high oil prices, moody’s rat agency currently forecast global default rate pick somewhat early 2006, herald le favourable credit condition come. it should, however, note similar forecast make begin 2005 prove inaccurate. ii.2 financial market in global fix income market (see slide 6), flatten yield curve throughout second third quarter 2005 something puzzle. more recently, worry global inflation, mainly drive high oil prices, seem reverse decline long-term bond yields, least temporarily. the low level u ten-year bond yield particular remain conundrum difficult reconcile underlie macroeconomic fundamentals. at time, corollary, concern risk unexpected abrupt upturn yield remained. the chart top leave slide 6 illustrate puzzle plot evolution u 10-year 2 bi review 86/2005 bond yield consensus expectation u nominal gdp growth ten year ahead, proxy level bond yield consistent expect future fundamentals. in “normal” circumstances, two would expect remain rather close other. the chart shows, however, us, since early 2002 bond yield persistently low expect future growth rate nominal gdp. in euro area, show chart bottom leave slide 6, although 10-year bond yield also decline 10-year nominal gdp growth expectations, margin substantially narrower. the low level bond yield partly explain increase demand institutional investors, insurance company pension funds, long-term bonds. age population increase private provision pension many euro area countries, well account change balance sheet repair, force financial institution resort longer-term bond order correct maturity mismatch balance sheets. the chart right slide 6 illustrate net purchase long-term bond relative quote share sharply diverge since 2002. insofar decline bond yield reflect structural factors, potential reversal trend, happen, could take place gradually previously feared. however, note factor also affect pattern global portfolio behaviour, lead unusual increase net demand long-term bond drive risk premia therefore bond yields. ii.3. the balance sheet euro area corporation household let briefly discus development euro area economic environment (see slide 7), focus development corporate household sector particularly relevant point view outlook financial intermediaries’ credit portfolios. start corporate sector, sign early weakness demand external fund non-financial corporate sector come end. this reflect increase lending. at time, reflect good financial condition firms, credit standard bank firm relax somewhat, show chart leave slide 7 (where vertical axis measure changes). encouragingly, development also extend small medium-sized enterprises, many euro area country face difficult circumstance past years. overall, euro area corporate sector balance sheet show sign improvement, several year de-leveraging extensive cost-controlling. turn household sector, important development continue rise house price

reserve bank australia, the 18th australasian finance bank conference 2005, sydney, 14 december 2005. * * * it pleasure open 18th australasian finance bank conference. our national international financial market play increasingly prominent role day-to-day life. they certainly news. not single television radio news bulletin pass without u inform late daily, even intra-daily, movement u stock market, exchange rate, price gold – probably interest average person – price crude oil. i suspect that, small extent, almost obsessive focus short-term price movement reflect need high-capacity medium large amount apparent 'news' convey, even quantity genuine information small. the high-frequency nature financial market trade – new piece 'news' every minute – natural source grist particular mill. how useful actually is, hand, one could debate. likewise, short-term report schedule corporate fund management result perhaps understandable, view perspective accountability era trust management weakened. but, time, probably exacerbate natural human tendency toward myopia impulsive decision-making investors, attendant pressure manager deliver steadily improve result period period hardly seem conducive far-sighted decisions. it remain seen, moreover, effect behaviour change account standard almost certainly increase apparent short-term volatility corporate results. some argued, i think persuasively, undue focus investor manager short term significant impediment long-run performance. this seem issue worthy study. hopefully, might spare time conference. in event, doubt function financial system important. once upon time, ask role financial system, might answered: match resource saver need entrepreneurial types, enable deployment capital prospectively profitable venture. that (rather 19th-century-sounding) definition, emphasis intermediation, still correct far goes. but days, increase proportion society's capital – even infrastructure – hold marketable form, role market price asset key. we would add, well, role financial system price risk, ever finely define bundles, allow people adjust portfolio expose risks, opportunities, desire – less. the system's effort provide set possibility lead plethora sophisticate increasingly complex products. this development, turn, raise question various observer regulator whether end hold certain risk fully aware them. question also ask late back-office infrastructure support complex transactions, degree concentration market could conceivably problematic le benign market conditions. nonetheless, function beyond pure intermediation seem likely grow importance various reasons, least among demographic trends. a people confront longevity risk, addition usual battery market risks, search new instrument practice enable risk price managed. while highly doubtful, view, age address simply financial engineering, financial system role play. it effectiveness efficiency role focus discussion year come. it's appropriate, therefore, part conference program devote topic retirement income area. it also fit conference adopt title 'financial challenge opportunity asia pacific region 21st century'. the asia-pacific been, remains, source economic dynamism – that's 'opportunity' part. but also scene considerable financial turmoil past decade – 'challenge' part. bi review 85/2005 1 you thoughtful presentation morning issues. i could justice brief remarks. allow touch briefly couple themes. the first potential, need, financial development asia. it apparent time east asia's weight global production good service increase (japan aside). non-japan east asia, include china, see share global gdp almost double, 20 per cent, since 1990. it likely rise period ahead. the extent merchandise trade within region also grow rapidly, trade barrier decline cross-border component source increased. so asia is, days, powerful force international trade. yet, accord many east asian people themselves, development asia's financial system keep pace. it much size bank system mind – number cases, actually quite large (though important exception like indonesia, philippines). rather, depth, resilience shock capacity intermediate region's save within region issue. with onset financial crisis 1997–98, apparent asia resilient disturbance international capital markets. foreign capital flow east asia – something make sense then, still make sense now. the exchange rate risk associate flows, however, bear mostly recipient countries: borrow foreign currency unhedged. the result exposure that, exchange rate moved, pain concentrate bank and/or customer asia, something exacerbate crisis put policy-makers impossible position. because heavy reliance bank funding, somewhat under-developed general capital markets, damage number regional economies. post crisis, still keen fair degree exchange rate stability, unsure extent likely support international community event another crisis, country east asia opt great self insurance volatility international capital flows. this take form vastly increase hold official reserve assets, mainly u dollar. while response understandable, even asia question whether make sense asia operate, effect, extension u dollar zone. joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, lament situation follow terms: whether like not, find unenviable position hold substantial part save financial liability economy save, fear diversification small part hold might lead sharp fall value rest, thus shoot foot. we also find somewhat stick recycle large part save develop market back region much volatile form, occasionally create havoc monetary financial systems.1 the challenge asia then, accord financial leaders, develop financial system allocate local save local need directly, resilient risk associate international capital flows, somewhat le dependent bank fund channel. this small task. thus far, apart manage fall-out crisis, effort make strengthen bank systems. a good deal work also occur improve capital markets, particularly bond markets. one key breakthrough asian government corporates borrow need open markets, currency acceptable price, leave currency risk others will bear – like foreign investors. australian borrower happy position long time now, like counterpart advance economies. for emerge market country enjoy opportunity would major improvement past. for occur, need confluence high-quality issuers, inform investors, well-functioning market allow hedge swaps. a asian authority seek facilitate 1 remark make recent global bond summit, hong kong. available http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/speeches/speechs/joseph/20051115e1.htm2 bi review 85/2005 development market remove impediments, occasional modest official transaction, opportunity presumably exist capable market player australasia play role. opportunity might also lie, perhaps long horizon, area household finance, since number middle-income asian household rise quickly, income growth rapid. it could anticipate demand sophisticate asset liability product correspondingly grow. one would think australasian institution would well placed, give skill acquire home markets, take part development. a second, unrelated, theme so-called 'global imbalances' issue. there time rehearse argument here, one simple point made. a size capital flow asia u increase past decade so, price – interest rate – declined. hence, would appear development supply side market important drive phenomenon. that reminder capital flow slowly us, adjustment asian behaviour part process. the increase net supply save asia reflect sharp decline corporate investment asian region (outside china) crisis. at point, asian corporate investment presumably recover. one would also imagine that, cases, need upgrade public infrastructure, case higher-quality private housing. hence, due course, net supply asian save international markets, thing equal, decline. just be, course, change might accompany developments, no-one say. but discussion challenge asia-pacific region would complete without coverage issues. let conclude say fit conference take place sydney, one asia-pacific's major financial centres. a first largish market open world trade day financial centre medium-sized, develop economy, sydney play prominent role region's financial trading, even though market somewhat larger. it lead market world's sixth actively trade currency. australia's share global foreign currency trading, 3½ per cent, high number comparably size economies, three time australia's weight world gdp. market sophisticate liquid, participant innovative. sydney, australia generally, much offer region financial service expertise. that said, participant would aware financial market operation highly competitive local player need remain toes. so good see local market participant think contribute development vibrant market region. these interest issue doubt cover conference, already been. i wish well deliberations. bi review 85/2005 3 ian j macfarlane: some observation recent economic development talk mr ian j macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, australian business economists, annual forecast conference dinner, sydney, 13 december 2005. * * * i see record sixth time i address australian business economists, last time four year ago. at time g7 country recession interest rate still head down. the world look lot good adjust strong growth new set challenges. i confess i difficulty decide topic tonight's talk. there were, view, burn issue i want address, message i want leave listener with. in event, i decide talk three topics: world cop triple oil prices, world emerge period exceptionally low interest rates, and, quite separately, australian model macro-economic policy? oil price i start oil prices. at begin 2002, oil price average $us20 per barrel, observer would apprehensive know follow three year price would treble recent peak $us70 per barrel. i think would assume event would lead significant rise inflation major slowing, contraction, world economy. memory opec i 1973 opec ii 1979 oil price rise factor three four still see guide possible outcomes. certainly, past couple years, medium full story rise oil price dislocation hardship caused. but look back current vantage point, thing stand comfortably world economy handle developments. virtually rise oil price reflect statistic inflation gdp growth, result surprisingly small. global gdp growth 4 per cent per annum high 2003 2004 expect remain 2005 2006. of course, lot growth come outside oecd area, figure oecd area growth 1 per cent low global growth. on inflation, pick-up quite modest, oecd country still record headline inflation 3 per cent per annum 12 month september 2005. interestingly, unite state headline inflation 4.7 per cent, stand upside lift oecd average inflation rate 3.3 per cent. in australia, aware, headline cpi rise 3.0 per cent year september quarter, recent low point 2.0 per cent eighteen month earlier. there number reason favourable outcome around world, include develop world's low oil dependency compare early years, i concentrate i think important. the main reason economic growth little affect rise oil price cause strong world growth, particularly develop country china india. for world whole, rise oil price negative supply shock, seventies, result positive demand shock. of course, global growth could well strong absence oil price rise, even constrain effect, still plenty growth go around current forecast still look good. on rise inflation modest, story interesting. we start review bite history; show even opec i ii come along, oecd area inflation rise year year. immediately opec i, already rise nearly 9 per cent, australia one high 10.1 per cent. inflationary expectation also rise. in business community assumption increase cost could easily pass prices, union assume wage would index rise inflation. the situation different now. after decade low stable inflation, inflationary expectation good anchored. discipline good market domestic foreign competitor mean old 'cost plus' mentality long prevails. while pass-through first round still occurs, rise retail petrol price demonstrates, subsequent price pressure often absorbed. with bi review 85/2005 1 limit manageable increase overall inflation throughout world, monetary tighten specifically direct oil-price-instigated inflation needed. that i wish say oil prices, add caveat i talk increase date. obviously, enter new round similar increases, situation would reassessed. world interest rate it well know world recently go phase exceptionally low interest rates, i sure people appreciate low historical standards. in fact much exaggeration say interest rate mid 2003 low level century. this time official overnight rate – one set central bank – 1 per cent unite states, 2 per cent euro area, zero japan. the qualification i make early generalisation concede rate may slightly low second world war country unite state unite kingdom quantity ration norm, low peace time. we construct indicator world interest rate century use weight average rate unite states, unite kingdom, germany japan. graph 1 show result official overnight interest rate near equivalent since 1860. although graph dominate high interest rate great inflation 1970s, read 2002 2003 low time long span years.1 part explanation inflation low, low compare post-war standard – low compare period cover graph. in fact construct simple measure real interest rate (based realise inflation rates), also low standard early low inflation periods.2 in table 1, real interest rate first five year decade low previous decade apart contain two world war 1970s. graph 1 1 the observation 1923, year weimar inflation germany, delete fit scale. 2 the problem measure real interest rate become negative period unanticipated rise inflation 1970s. for reason, meaningful comparison real interest rate (using realise inflation rates) make period low stable inflation present. 2 bi review 85/2005 we could ask question low interest rate put place decade see necessary early occasions. this big question i propose answer tonight.3 nor i wish maintain different global monetary policy put place. defender monetary policy pursue would argue result continue low inflation reasonable economic growth world economy, apart mild post-war recession 2001. they would say light outcome, would hard argue high level interest rate period. usually interest rate keep low extend period main risk pronounce pick-up inflation. a know, little global scale, indeed individual countries, even though commodity price rise sharply. where risk mainly arise financial sphere, 'search yield' drive many asset prices. so far decade, obvious sign latter phenomenon surge house prices, particularly anglo country competitive financial sector unite states, unite kingdom australia. what i describe far global development, although australia share aspects, others differed. the main aspect differ reduce interest rate anywhere near extent reduce three big monetary area – unite states, japan euro area. the low point short-term interest rate 4¼ per cent decade different low point 1990s 4¾ per cent. we also country significance resist general trend low interest rate 2003. nevertheless, still show many symptom asset market others shown. what see around world gradual return normality interest rates. we australia make claim first process begin mid 2002. over past two year predominant tendency among country raise interest rates. virtually every develop country except japan participated, move ecb early month important step. the point i want make link first two part talk together major reason rise interest rate is, i think, need return normality, specific fear oil prices. of course two relate low level interest rate accommodate growth demand lay behind rise oil prices. but important factor behind recent 3 for partial answer see i.j. macfarlane, “what global imbalances?”, reserve bank bulletin, october 2005. bi review 85/2005 3 move realisation world could safely continue sort interest rate prevail 2002 2003. be australian model? i recently visit chilean minister finance who, like many position latin america, good professional economist. our discussion interesting, one stage answer one question say chile 'was follow australian model'. he mean specific way, worth examine exactly mean term. first, talk macro-economic policy model follow structural features: • float exchange rate currency view commodity currency; • monetary policy regime base central bank independence inflation target; • discipline fiscal policy aim balance surplus medium term. these important, important characteristic wish focus internationalisation currency, i.e. ability australian entity borrow abroad australian dollars, borrow abroad foreign currency hedge back australian dollars. this allow australian corporation bank participate fully international financial market without incur foreign currency risk (or incur 'natural hedge' foreign currency export earn finance foreign acquisition). we, course, aware importance characteristic regard virtual necessity country able run float exchange rate regime successfully. but many, most, country reach stage. it foreign currency exposure lead collapse many asian bank corporation currency fell asian crisis. in latin america, traditionally foreign borrow u dollars, make country extremely vulnerable fall exchange rates. it also give rise know 'fear floating' mean tendency central bank quickly resort raise interest rate whenever exchange rate danger falling. what chilean finance minister call australian model, course, unique australia,4 associate australia latin american asian economic circle australia's success withstand asian crisis. while country chile see sort role model, many asian country choose different path run current account surpluses, build large hold international reserve resist change exchange rates. a know, think major reason grow global payment imbalances, would happy follow model close own. but another story. the interest issue economies, particularly emerge market economies, reach situation borrow abroad currency, or, put differently, investor country willingly hold asset denominate currency. when look back see australia reach position, interest (and reasonably recent) story. the major step occur government decide would borrow honestly citizens. that is, would stop use captive arrangement force financial institution take government paper, stop set interest rate paper. in case occur introduce tender system sell treasury note 1979 bond 1982, soon make clear government would long borrow reserve bank, instead borrow public finance budget deficit dollar dollar. at first accept high interest rates, time demand government paper expanded, importantly overseas investor begin find australian government bond denominate australian dollar attractive investment. it necessary ask invest, 'road shows' wall street entice them. at 4 canada new zealand also characteristic list describe australian model. for discussion difference australia commodity exporters, see: barry eichengreen ricardo hausmann (1999), “exchange rate financial fragility,” federal reserve bank kansa city, new challenge monetary policy, pp329–368; ricardo j. caballero, kevin cowan jonathan kearns (2005), “fear sudden stops: lesson australia chile,” journal policy reform, vol.8

australian government paper, semi local paper, eventually corporate bond asset-backed securities. turnover australian dollar sixth amongst world currency ample liquidity currency asset markets. the relevant derivative contract grown, provide hedge opportunities. a point forthcoming bulletin article, australia whole time long foreign currency position. that is, foreign-currency-denominated asset foreign-currency-denominated liabilities, far cry position early post-float period. i want conclude briefly revisit subject economies, include own, exhibit stability early periods. be policymakers become good forecaster adept timely adjustment lever economic policy? it would tempt answer yes this, i suspect small part answer. a plausible explanation economy become resilient. that is, systematically modify institutional framework flexible able adjust economic shock formerly. what i describe good example process work. bi review 85/2005 5 jaime caruana: the future bank supervision europe address mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, conference “supervision international banks: be bank crisis still possible europe?” – european bank federation (fbe), brussels, 28 october 2005. * * * introduction first all, i would like thank michel pébereau european bank federation invite today participate conference important issue relate future bank supervision europe. usually i speak perspective basel committee bank supervision. today, however, i mainly take viewpoint one central bank eurosystem bank supervisory responsibilities. the subject debate particularly timely, give european commission’s current initiative define financial service policy eu next five years, i understand fbe active contributor. i would like use time morning suggest number principle i believe could help address key challenge european bank supervision structure come years, also reflect concrete step build european framework fit meet challenges. what main issue face? there need explain dichotomy arise have, one hand, industry become increasingly internationalise nature and, other, supervisory framework remain predominantly base national responsibility accountabilities. in context bank group increasingly take decision manage risk global basis, inconsistency difference regulation supervision across country active may create compliance cost inefficiencies. furthermore, adverse development one bank likely financial stability implication several countries. these issue certainly exclusive eu. but existence eu project add extra dimension, bring challenges, responsibility also opportunities. progress make build single market financial services, yet. in segment financial markets, retail banking, long way go achieve fully integrate market. and recent experience relation cross-border acquisition seem hardly compatible spirit single market. we face, therefore, several challenges: safeguard efficiency, effectiveness consistency supervisory action global integrate financial markets; reduce remain obstacle cross-border finance, term cross-border consolidation provision product services. some national difference develop long period time go beyond prudential supervisory sphere. political initiative reduce regulatory inconsistency would substantially support supervisory convergence efforts. at time, political objective enhance dynamism competitiveness eu economy – so-called “lisbon” objective – efficient, integrate financial market important part achieve it. the fact reap full benefit european integration, meet political objective set lisbon, need find way ensure bank industry operate maximum efficiency also supervision unduly burdensome promote level eu play field. but need also ensure depositor adequately protect financial stability preserved. in summary, challenge ensure minimum gap minimum overlap supervision. much progress already make bank context, necessary go further. bi review 84/2005 1 what guide principle european approach deal challenges? there range view eu bank regulation supervisory structure face challenge 21st century. what’s more, opinion static, make complex situation. among ambitious perspective advocate single eu bank financial service supervisory authority. others – include european bank federation – promote idea “lead supervisor” approach, provide bank group single interlocutor power relate group whole. both proposal raise significant political, legal practical issues. yet clear status quo sufficient future. we need move forward. and need arrangement reduce compliance cost bank streamline interaction supervisory authority really make progress integration. i think key success pragmatism, part supervisory authority part industry. let highlight principle i believe guide u find way forward. i begin four principle could classify prudent side debate. firstly, i believe need approach ensure legal clarity concerned. bank need know requirement meet, basis countries; supervisor need know activity responsible accountable to; depositor need know turn basis thing go wrong. informal arrangement supervisory authority extremely useful. but need ground firm clear legal set accountability mechanisms. secondly, must recognise diversity situation within eu. the european bank industry far homogenous. just focus international aspects, let mention two points: first, handful thousand bank institution eu consider truly pan-european, even though institution make significant part bank market. in vein, significant proportion bank number new eu member state foreign-owned. clearly, pan-european institution key eu’s position global system, must everything ensure play role. but also need careful measure take interest promote great efficiency international institution impose undue expense small institutions, must take perspective acceptable home host supervisors. my third point link this, concern need observe principle subsidiarity, key tenet eu say action take eu level national local action cannot desire effect. this principle particularly relevant give continue diversity eu bank industry consumers. supervision best conduct close market institutions. last least, i believe need approach realistic short medium term. it essential industry keep consider issue express ideas, i afraid unrealistic expectation lead u agonise debate could polarise view even hind progress need make crucial urgent work implement basel ii, international account standards. a i mention earlier, prudent principle i want mention. but, 19th century english writer charles caleb colton said, “there nothing imprudent excessive prudence”. therefore, let add four principle go progressive direction. firstly, i think eu need ambitious, set example. i convinced, say many recent interventions, eu go further, deep fast wide international community find great consistency, convergence efficiency bank supervision. we especially take advantage opportunity present basel ii fact already body single market legislation long history supervisory co-operation build. and demonstrate progress possible among 25 country still rather diverse, others confidence push ahead also. secondly, recognise legitimate concern industry. more efficient supervision necessary - although sufficient - condition integrate market. we undoubtedly need 2 bi review 84/2005 great degree co-ordination supervisor hitherto, need great consistency supervisory practices. a i said, need framework rationalise compliance burden streamline interaction supervisory authorities. we need bank manage risks, unnecessary supervisory requirements. thirdly, need approach us full range tool disposal. in words, look legislative solution challenge face us. what need effective timely implementation law regulation exist, convergence application. this come co-operation information-sharing supervisors. and let also mention potential offer supervisory transparency. we hear much market discipline context disclosure requirement apply bank pillar 3 revise basel capital framework. but i think increase disclosure supervisors, especially comparable basis, also important role play, help u monitor consistency approach across countries, also drive great convergence exert kind market discipline supervisors. finally, allow put basel hat moment. i think basel ii certainly offer fair share implementation challenges, also provide u far big opportunity make progress build consistent efficient co-operative approach supervision. i mention four prudent principles, plus another four forward-looking ones. some may emphasise former, others may prefer move faster. my view urgency move forward significantly. build european framework so let u focus concrete step move direction. i would like separate two categories: relate regulatory framework pertain supervisory framework. the regulatory framework let begin reflection regulatory framework. go back principle i highlight earlier, i believe build upon regulatory framework already exist eu. any improvement eu framework financial supervision first seek fully exploit potential exist framework. in respect, concept responsibility home host supervisor framework consolidate supervision well-embedded exist bank directives, make lot sense form basis future approaches. indeed, directive implement basel ii eu – so-called capital requirement directive – contain key provision reinforce role consolidate supervisor relation application use advance approach new capital framework. a i sure aware, provision allow bank group make one application approval relation group whole, require relevant supervisor co-operate try reach common agreement application. should prove possible reach agreement within six months, consolidate supervisor power responsibility take decision. this significant development regulatory framework, give consolidate supervisor possibility take decision impact reach outside national jurisdiction. i aware european bank federation belief full consolidate supervision determine ultimate objective eu regulatory supervisory framework, i believe approach carefully, see new provision work practice restrict area. i also think important recognise respect legitimate concern host supervisors. a i already mentioned, bank system new eu member state predominantly make incoming institutions. we ensure host supervisor able access sufficient information institution operate locally and, necessary, relation bi review 84/2005 3 wide group. the capital requirement directive also include provision respect note need take account significance institution local markets. look wide prudential framework let mention two specific area european commission currently review exist eu regulation. the first area relate deposit guarantee schemes. although deposit guarantee directive 1994 useful set common minimum requirement national schemes, current level harmonisation low, different level protection different structure place across eu. this inefficient may hind integration. a many already aware, european commission currently undertake wide-ranging review deposit insurance arrangements, i would encourage ambitious respect. the second relate work carry commission aim ensure eu financial service legislation supervisory practice pose barrier cross-border merger acquisitions. consolidation process market-driven phenomenon respond market needs, economy scale, it synergies, benefit diversification, access large client base, etc. i think supervisor crucial limit role play fulfil responsibility ensure bank take shareholder suitable prudential grounds. but far go. the supervisory framework let turn supervisory framework. i believe need think term european system bank supervision. i talk single european supervisory authority. i don’t think time come this, either conceptual practical level. but rather, i think need develop exist institutional system european bank supervision order ensure possibility co-operation convergence fully take advantage of. the main policy objective stage enhance cross-border supervisory co-operation order supervisory action perceive unified. this system build four levels. at first level, competent supervisor bank institution (whether home host supervisor context group), fulfil responsibility accountabilities, basis power obligation give national parliament legislators. the second level consist bilateral co-operation supervisor internationally active institutions. this long bedrock effective supervision context increase internationalisation, continue essential future. multilateral co-operation form basis third level. this aspect become progressively significant recent times, grow importance come years. both bilateral multilateral arrangement increasingly necessary context basel ii, where, already discussed, consolidate supervisor responsible coordinate supervisory process relation assess application use advance approaches. so far, i talk i refer “vertical” co-operation, sense address relationship home host supervisor relation specific institution groups. but also horizontal aspect crucial future. this supervisory convergence - fourth level. great consistency supervision essential promote consistent approach across borders, thereby level play field. my view without convergence supervisory practice across eu, consolidate lead supervision model seem likely lead fragmentation, different group supervise potentially inconsistent ways. this work new committee european bank supervisors, cebs, important. this first time eu committee formally charge promote co-operation supervisor convergence supervisory practices. danièle nouy, speak shortly perspective vice-chair cebs, is, course, much good place talk work committee. but i think cebs already make excellent headway, undoubtedly driver progress future. and i’m sure industry keep pressure ensure case. 4 bi review 84/2005 i believe need combine four vertical horizontal aspect – together enhance supervisory transparency level – order effective efficient system. conclusion in conclude intervention today, i would first admit idea i mention today revolutionary, i believe evolutionary balance approach best way forward provide great chance success. the flip-side coin evolutionary approach responsibility deliver greater. but succeed meet objectives, afraid explore other, radical solutions. the cost non integration high. i would also like re-emphasise possibility make rapid real progress promote effective efficient framework european bank supervision. this help u achieve goal within eu, could also promote great convergence beyond eu. allow put basel hat couple final comment relate challenge basel committee. at global level, face consistency issue implementation basel ii, i said, case, europe lead process, europe instrument it, example helpful basel process. this first important challenge basel committee next years. a part process adhere publish schedule fifth quantitative impact study. and i believe already tool disposal deal issue arise qis5 exercise, arise period implementation. to sure, key element add detail basel ii, rather focus achieve quality implementation new framework. therefore, i anticipate significant change framework period banker regulator tackle initial implementation challenges. but main challenge cross border home host cooperation. on point i would underestimate work effort supervisor devote issue. one final relate point. the stagger implementation, specially timetable difference eeuu raise transitional cross-border issue need manage great collaboration eu u supervisors, i assure side even commit before, effort redouble respect. ultimately, i hope commitment effort promote even effective implementation. a second relate challenge enhance cooperation non-g10 supervisors. this one committee’s priority many significant step take take improve ownership standard inclusiveness processes. for example, committee long-standing work group include representative sixteen non-member countries, increase interaction work group. this past july, committee meet joint session work group krakow, poland discuss, among things, basel ii implementation issues. in addition, encourage non-g10 supervisory participation work group address issue relate validation operational risk. i believe dialogue will, time, foster great consistency among committee non-committee members. the committee therefore commit heighten dialogue consider way promote consistency. i notice quote cover page fbe’s response european commission’s green paper financial service policy: “time pass quickly, save buy it, make work fruitful”. in context speech i hope feel past 20 minute pass quickly, work fruitful, i wish successful discussion rest day. thank attention. bi review 84/2005 5 michael c bonello: pursue fast growth stable macroeconomic environment speech mr

gentlemen, i first like thank president council institute financial service invite annual dinner. over past six year i able observe satisfaction institute successfully adapt steady expansion malta’s financial service industry, demand growth generate diversify range professional expertise. one plan innovation i consider appropriate certificate mortgage advice practice partly base maltese law. this annual occasion also afford welcome opportunity share distinguish audience banker corporate guest bank’s think subject topical interest. in today’s complex global environment several issue spontaneously present likely candidate analysis. for u malta, major policy challenge time return economy path high sustain growth. the fact speak themselves. in five year 2004, annual growth rate average 1.2 per cent real terms, well many eu partners; year’s growth rate september, 1.7 per cent, may encouraging, early know whether imply acceleration sustained. and yet need achieve fast pace economic growth probably never urgent present time. growth necessary order satisfy society’s legitimate aspiration high live standards. beyond that, expansion economy’s supply capacity enhance degree international competitiveness essential overcome daunt challenge country currently facing. a threefold challenge: globalization implication the first challenge derive pervasive process globalization, which, power rapid advance technology trade liberalization, give rise unprecedented mobility resource country pursuit best cost-quality combinations. suffice say past two decade export foreign direct investment grow twice three time fast global output, respectively. globalization undoubtedly create numerous profitable business opportunities. at time, however, represent potential threat open economy like malta’s concurrent intensification competition. behind recent trends, fact, lie emergence country like china india, double share global output past twenty year also compete market high technology products. china alone manufacture half world’s camera share world export computer increase tenfold, almost 20 per cent, ten year 2003! we, too, must find way participate actively globalization gain it. ... compound sharply high oil price ... the second challenge derive sharp increase oil prices. there silver line dark cloud sense price rise expect significant effect world output. the imf, example, anticipate global growth average 4.3 per cent 2005 2006. this mainly due expansion demand underpin economic growth, particularly asia. it still case, however, massive redistribution wealth underway country consume oil produce it. malta inevitably lose side process. the estimate increase fuel bill 2006 arise production electricity consumption liquid fuel far expansion nominal gdp forecast 2005. it would seem, therefore, significant growth could bi review 84/2005 1 expect next year underlie pace economic activity accelerate year’s level. the increase malta’s fuel bill also roughly equivalent narrow fiscal deficit achieve past seven years. in circumstances, would foolish allow progress make considerable cost blow away external shock. an attempt cushion increase oil price borrow may economically justifiable term sustain incipient recovery suggest recent gdp data. on hand, borrow would serviced; and, would constitute interference market signals, could also retard process economic adjustment. the long-term remedy counteract effect high fuel price expand productivity output, therefore incomes. indeed, oil price shock another compel reason, one needed, redouble effort energize economy. … high dependency ratio due population ageing. the third challenge demographic shift cause population ageing, ratio work age dependent population expect shrink almost four- two-to-one late 2020s. some effect trend already felt year first cohort baby-boom generation reach retirement age. this produce significant acceleration, lm7 million 10 per cent budget deficit, rate increase pension expenditures. pension reform clearly cannot delay longer. population age also represent broad threat sustainability live standard social cohesion burden support grow number dependent person will, point, become unbearable productive sector economy. this burden consist pension welfare payments, also service provide kind, notably public health system. this another reason reduce government recurrent commitment priority objective. a good understand magnitude challenge obtain synthesise effect term growth rate necessary economy deal effectively. for example, order compensate increase dependency ratio associate population ageing, economy would grow around 1 per cent per annum next twenty years. at rate growth, le malta average past five years, would improvement per caput gdp, live standards. a hope raise activity rate ten percentage point around 70 per cent twenty years, economy would grow average annual rate least 3 per cent. this growth rate, turn, would still sufficient ensure convergence average per caput gdp eu twenty year now. for latter objective achieved, real growth rate 4 per cent would required. the way forward: concert push fast growth these scenario underline urgency achieve rapid, sustainable growth. the long take expand productive base economy, onerous challenge be. the prospect significant recovery short term, moreover, doubtful since oil price expect remain current high level, dynamic benefit fiscal consolidation eu membership unlikely exercise mark impact growth come months. growth forecast 2006 vary 1% 2%. the current economic situation, therefore, require decisive action design produce early results. i, therefore, feel oblige make strong appeal social partner underestimate threat today’s reality represent wellbeing members, cooperate search real, long-term solution national interest. the alternative slow, depress process stagnation. the way forward towards fast growth lie first instance strive maintain competitive advantage traditional sector – typically rely heavily cost advantage market share lose -, promote development new activity exploit potential offer malta’s strategic assets. these include eu membership, modern technological 2 bi review 84/2005 infrastructure skilled flexible labour force. the current, encourage expansion new activity financial services, software development pharmaceutical attest competitive edge economy indeed enjoy areas. this advantage must, however, also support stable operate environment responsive change market conditions. element coherent policy framework such environment require coherent policy framework three levels: first macroeconomic level, sound financial system prudent fiscal monetary policy combine provide favourable condition restructure productive base. at microeconomic level, resource must efficiently allocate manage enterprise obtain maximum possible degree cost-effectiveness market penetration. the third involve may term meso-level policies, involve specific sectors. policy level primarily avoid distort mechanism facilitate economic activity. supportive macroeconomic policy already place … at macroeconomic level, recent track record largely positive. fiscal consolidation progress line projection convergence programme. despite weak growth, fiscal balance improve significantly 2004 year. this escape attention international observers. the recent assessment maltese economy imf, example, commend progress achieve strengthen macroeconomic management, include substantial reduction fiscal deficit. look ahead, i please note budget 2006 bear hallmark continuity. operate within constraint represent natural upward creep spend health, pension welfare programmes, one hand, need avoid increase burden taxation slow move economy, other, government chart course envisage continuation process fiscal consolidation, lead reduction deficit gdp ratio 3 per cent. this ambitious target whose attainment depend crucially rigorous implementation budget measures, together intensification effort aim cut cost collect taxes. on monetary front, financial market far consider level domestic interest rate appropriate inflation remain moderate. monetary stability also promote participation erm ii, proceed smoothly. allow point, mr. president, reiterate reason behind bank’s advice government maintain value maltese lira constant euro within erm ii rate prevail prior entry mechanism. first, generally acknowledge malta’s peg exchange rate regime past serve economy well, keep inflation inflationary expectation bay. a level central parity rate lira erm ii, study conduct central bank malta find evidence significant exchange rate misalignment, conclusion contest competent eu institutions. there compel reason change, therefore, exchange rate level prevail prior enter mechanism retain interest continuity stability. a unilateral commitment maintain currency central parity rate erm ii phase, i would remind proponent flexible exchange rate regime malta’s high dependence foreign trade. for open economy, resultant volatility consequent uncertainty would entail additional cost associate insure exchange risk, thereby inflate retail export prices. change nominal exchange rate, moreover, likely significant impact competitiveness via adjustment real exchange rate. this weaken currency typically follow rapid pass-through shape high price import wages, 1992 experience proved. on hand, due downward rigidities, strengthen maltese lira cannot expect follow commensurate reduction price wage levels. bi review 84/2005 3 finally, advocate flexibility note maltese lira allow fluctuate within erm ii bands, exchange rate would reflect development balance payment whole, include capital account, would not, therefore, necessarily adjust response export trends. indeed, bank opt bands, market force would exert upward pressure exchange rate. this since erm ii entry may steady market demand lira, bank net buyer foreign exchange external reserve increase substantially. it important basic fact well understand public pronouncement make might affect credibility monetary exchange rate policy. you recall negative perception exchange rate take hold towards end 2004, eventually lead bank defend currency raise interest rates. this responsibility bank cannot, not, abdicate. … progressive policy enterprise level … at microeconomic level, measure progress register spite failure adopt social pact. there indication productivity-enhancing measure introduce enterprise level pressure competitive forces. these range flexible work practice wage restraint improve management technique focus market efforts. some areas, however, remain susceptible efficiency gains, particularly service sector. … public sector still lag behind. at meso sectoral level, important measure announce budget 2006, include decision intensify effort improve efficiency public service. hopefully also involve adoption output-, rather input-oriented management practices. the recently-signed collective agreement public service, moreover, example responsible social dialogue aim balance compete interest achieve. there remains, nevertheless, ample room progress. the country need undergo culture change realise fallacy inherent perception unlimited government power levy taxes, lead assumption job life regardless performance need, universal free welfare service irrespective sustainability equity considerations. such think incompatible ethic base efficiency accountability, need reduce burden taxation, foster initiative encourage investment. social dialogue can, play crucial role promote acceptance policy necessary bring change. the attainment great efficiency public sector key objective provide vital support service productive sector economy. it must, therefore, become good gear ensure intention policy-makers implement rapidly effectively. determine effort must make streamline bureaucratic procedures, eliminate outdated regulation generally reduce cost engage economic activity. the good regulation unit office prime minister must meet expectation creation raised. failure risk compromise effort undertake macro microeconomic level create modern, dynamic economy. at national level, moreover, need understand simultaneous pursuit economic growth high degree social protection achieve make product labour market flexible; invest people, refine skill help work, introduce obligation take jobs; give importance develop scientific technological base. we need look far see done. face high labour cost late 1990s, german company start restructure downsizing. the government meanwhile introduce social security reform aim make welfare state le expensive, well labour market reform create incentive jobless work. an awareness develop solution chronic deficit unemployment could long cut public investments. a result, germany’s unit labour cost fall 12 per cent since 1999 france. the 4 bi review 84/2005 payoff significant: volume german export rise 47 per cent period, compare 25 per cent france. the french unaware they, too, competitiveness problem. a commission independent expert lead former manage director imf, michel camdessus, set 2003. report early year, expert conclude without change direction, decline real threat france. they identify two obstacle growth: first, enough people worked, fail work long enough; second, heavy state become costly drag economy. our country face similar predicament. malta’s labour participation rate among low eu 58 per cent; hour worked, 2004 maltese work 72 few hour hard work people eu, estonians, lithuanians, pole slovenes, mainly enjoy 13 public holidays, eu, whereas country mention 8; cost state, public sector malta absorb half gdp, fourth high percentage eu. conclusion mr. president, indeed face unprecedented challenge. the consequence inherent vulnerability external events, large state apparatus subsidize inefficient public corporation offer citizen notionally free service irrespective income level well generous welfare benefit catch u rapidly. in meantime, world change beyond expectation. for u remember day famine inefficient state-controlled economy endemic asia, today’s reality easy comprehend accept. the former eu internal market commissioner, fritz bolkenstein, capture momentous nature change strikingly observe recently “the true heir capitalist revolution live asia.” we malta, too, need change if, like them, want turn globalization threat opportunity. we must shake ambivalent attitude reform: know status quo unsustainable, also comfortable, reluctant bear cost change. hence slow pace reform, characterize commission report follow long drawn-out consultation search consensus, frequently prof elusive. but time run fast many appreciate. for start, let u stop blame others woe and, brutus enjoin do, let u accept “the fault …… lie star ourselves.” we work together build past achievements, negligible, order secure objective great material wellbeing social cohesion which, all, profess share. bi review 84/2005 5 villy bergström: the labour market wage formation speech mr villy bergström, deputy governor sverige riksbank, association swedish engineer industries' hr director conference, rimbo, 22 november 2005. * * * introduction thank invitation come speak here. today, i touch upon current economic policy sweden weaken krona exchange rate. i return issue couple day different speech. the shift economic policy start 1990s entail good condition wage formation sweden. among things, adoption inflation target reduce uncertainty future price developments. wage-earners worry wage increase erode excessively fast price rises, easy employer determine scope wage costs. the low uncertainty inflation reflect fact inflation expectation since mid-1990s firmly anchor around 2 per cent. it important remember current condition wage formation sweden – float exchange rate inflation target – considerably different previous regime fix exchange rate. a fix exchange rate norm sweden 130 years, even though system maintain changed. background current system during post-war era exchange rate norm supervise international agreement sweden’s membership international monetary fund (imf), bretton wood system. that mean devaluation allow event fundamental structural problem imbalances. so bretton wood system limit opportunity individual country devalue way cost crisis. instead, country offer loan imf tough terms. for swedish wage formation, successful period. the swedish trade union confederation employee organisations/trade unions, well swedish parliament government, aware strict regulation permit devaluation, disciplinary effect swedish wage formation. the bretton wood system base arrangement whereby u dollar fix value term gold currency country turn peg gold via fix exchange rate dollar. when u force abandon dollar peg gold early 1970s borrow large amount finance vietnam war, bretton wood system collapsed. thereafter, sweden independently adopt exchange rate regimes, give great freedom bretton wood system. that result le discipline wage formation. what mean fix exchange rate? a fix exchange rate mean central bank, aid currency market intervention policy rate, stabilise exchange rate around target, e.g. price dollar, gold average currencies, whereas float exchange rate regime exchange rate determine supply demand currency market. with fix exchange rate, avoid uncertainty world trade country exchange currency other. there limit much currency’s exchange rate vary, good importer exporter forecast income expenditure. the fix exchange rate also see way achieve price stability. with fix exchange rate, inflation long term cannot high low inflation rate country tie exchange rate. for example, fix exchange rate dollar would ”force” u maintain inflation rate long run u country whose currency peg dollar. be fail, current account balance would deteriorate would devalue. bi review 84/2005 1 sweden devalue five time 1976 1982 fix exchange rate (1976, twice 1977, 1981 1982). that sweden 1970s 1980s high inflation countries. between 1975 1995, swedish inflation average 8 per cent year. real wage rise 0.5 per cent year. swedish companies’ competitiveness deteriorate industrial production dropped. sweden slip 4th place oecd’s standard-of-living league 18th place – average oecd countries. we become relatively poor country europe industrialise world. meanwhile, deregulation credit market 1980s result sharp expansion credit, accumulation debt among general public consequence. demand increase supply weak productivity growth low. the economy overheated, inflation pick competitiveness eroded. in 1990, international economy begin weaken price asset property fell. the economic climate deteriorate dramatically eventually bank crisis hit country, large loan loss result. the riksbank defend fix krona exchange rate last, large currency flow extreme rise interest rate fix exchange rate abandon 19 november 1992. the outcome performance 1970s 1980s slip standard-of-living league, suffer mass unemployment saw drop gdp 4-5 per cent. it juncture explicit inflation target introduced. the depreciation krona 1992-93 almost thirty per cent give manufacture industry powerful boost. since demand component falling, manufacture sector able attract resource expand. we current account deficit since 1993. why 2 per cent inflation float exchange rate? that two per cent optimal inflation target scientific basis. however, level give reasonable trade-off negative consequence high inflation problem entail deflation. furthermore, two per cent common target internationally. it necessary, see, certain margin zero inflation price wage formation work well. separate price wage able grow different rate possible allocate resource labour correct use. since difficult cut nominal wages, inflation create possibility relative change wage without reduce nominal level group. the scope wage increase give inflation target around 4 per cent. (2 per cent + 2 per cent: inflation plus productivity growth, give profit share.)1 this hold we, like national institute economic research, assume average productivity growth around 2 per cent whole economy long term. if one occupational group get 5 per cent order attract labour, another group get le average increase. if inflation target lower, relative increase might necessitate low nominal wage others. so, two per cent inflation serf anchor economy. the inflation target basis wage negotiations, rent agreements, tax increases, etc. thus, necessary target credible, people trust met. before, idea instead fix exchange rate would imply inflation target line inflation rate competitor countries. but approach never work way inflation target. doe monetary policy affect economic growth? it fairly obvious inflation around 10 per cent economy become unhealthy. economic agent seek profit inflation. much depend tax system designed. in sweden, encourage borrow speculation real property shares. investment 1 strictly speak price development output, i.e. gdp deflator, since gdp deflator estimate increase around 2 per cent year consumer price rise line inflation target (2 per cent), approximation works. 2 bi review 84/2005 decision take different focus macroeconomic condition stable. in sweden, saw property boom 1980s overheat economy dampened. monetary policy unable affect economy’s long-term output capacity, judge grow somewhere around 2-2.5 per cent year. but stability government finance credibility inflation target give low interest rate safe investment climate, turn lay foundation good economic performance long term. what monetary policy fact stabilise demand growth short run avoid stop-go situation like 1980s. let describe somewhat simplify terms. one variable riksbank work output gap, difference economy’s actual output potential output. the output gap reflect cyclical variation economy. • a negative output gap mean demand goods, service factor production low plenty spare resource economy. increase price wage small inflation usually target. • a positive gap mean actual output – demand-driven – exceed potential output, resource situation tight, demand labour exceed supply, wage push inflation normally target. so output gap give picture demand pressure economy, demand pressure turn influence inflation. monetary policy essentially choose interest rate level affect demand way size gap become small possible. if actual output equal potential output output gap closed, inflation often line riksbank’s target, provide monetary policy inflation target credible. the riksbank employment that negative long-term relationship inflation unemployment fairly uncontroversial today, least show development since introduction inflation target – unemployment inflation drop parallel 1990s. since 1995, inflation target come effect, cpi inflation average 1.4 per cent, real wage grow around 2.6 per cent. the riksbank’s formulation monetary policy critics, course – example, social democratic party’s late congress inflation target’s superordinate status target call question. attempt get economy grow fast pace sustainable long term expansionary inflation-tolerant monetary policy would, long run, result high inflation without rise output employment. in short term, though, monetary policy can, i mentioned, interest rate change design stimulate cool economic activity, affect output thereby also employment. in highly simplify output-gap world i described, straightforward relationship monetary policy, output gap employment – riksbank hit inflation target employment affected. but reality complicate that. firstly, monetary policy able precisely fine-tune output gap employment. a i say earlier, take time monetary policy impact inflation, riksbank’s monetary policy decision base forecast expect price development future. furthermore, knowledge output gap even exact, even le come years. in reality, shock supply demand occur time, influence actual potential output. a result, output gap almost never zero. in addition, forecast period event political decision difficult, impossible, foresee, good example terrorist attack 11 september 2001. for reason forecast le inaccurate, output gap positive negative long periods. the important thing riksbank, attempt stabilise inflation, strive achieve small short-term deviation inflation target possible. with symmetric inflation target like riksbank’s, incentive effort avoid miss target upside downside equally strong. short-term deviation inflation target thus even time result permanent gain loss term growth jobs. the bi review 84/2005 3 average inflation rate ten year since inflation target introduce indicate systematic deviation. the second factor complicate picture simple relationship monetary policy employment inflation influence output gap also inflation expectations, turn depend credibility monetary policy. if confidence riksbank’s monetary policy often enough make small change interest rate signal riksbank keep close eye inflation tendencies. if inflation expectation instead deviate sharply riksbank’s target, potent measure may required. thirdly, inflation employment always affect factors. many short-term factor strong impact inflation marginal effect output gap employment (e.g. impact mad cow disease meat price rapid rise fall electricity price due weather affect reservoir levels). likewise, certain factor policy decision affect register open unemployment influence output gap (e.g. national labour market board’s decision scale back labour market policy measure 2003). in addition, relationship monetary policy unemployment sometimes deviate fairly sharply previous historical patterns. the recent episode inflation target – end 1990s start decade – characterise unexpectedly high productivity, unexpectedly low import inflation temporary supply shocks. the low inflation actively tighten monetary policy dampen demand. in reality, monetary policy expansionary. with aid repo rate riksbank influence demand. how company meet demand vary number employ depend productivity develops, nothing monetary policy control. nor possibility govern many people enter leave labour market policy measures. be swedish wage formation competitive? when economy balance, wage profit share constant, companies’ real wage cost increase parallel productivity growth. but relationship wage increase competitiveness different fix float exchange rate. with fix exchange rate, competitiveness determine first foremost big wage increment sweden compare countries. if wage cost increase rapidly, cost crisis arise result high unemployment force country devaluation view restore competitiveness, case sweden 1980s. the problem repeat devaluation erode fix exchange rate’s credibility. wage-earners employer expect bail competitiveness weaken excessively fast wage rises. under float exchange rate, however, relatively high increase nominal wage much significance competitiveness, exchange rate adjusts. we high price cost growth trade partner without see competitiveness deteriorate, krona function shock absorber. so, company bear direct burden excessive wage increases, since exchange rate adjust time profit maintain sector expose competition. also, float exchange rate often dampen cyclical fluctuations. in 2001, swedish it sector – include ericsson telia – hit deep decline. but decline partly compensate weak krona exchange rate, profit sustain paper pulp industry, iron steel industry, part manufacture sector. under float exchange rate, inflation target nominal anchor price wage formation, rather rate wage increase abroad. wage-earners employer know riksbank immediately intervene interest rate adjustment inflation deviate clearly target. so, excessively high wage increment lead tight monetary policy. for individual company industry, development wage cost country nonetheless great significance, since exchange rate case take given. a swedish company raise wage sharply risk drive business. a globalisation continues, new market open wage cost differ level sweden. company get increase opportunity outsource activity country low wage costs. the question wage growth sweden competitive relation countries? 4 bi review 84/2005 the large surplus current account, sek 48.1 billion second quarter year, equal around 7.7 per cent gdp see indication swedish wage cost general competitive. otherwise, swedish good service would demand countries. at time, swedish company outsource considerable proportion production sweden reduce costs. the stiff competition low-wage country find mainly manufacture industry. however, pace production outsource decrease rather increase since end 1990s. one possible explanation global economic slowdown start current decade. swedish company give outsource reason low number employee less extent compare year ago.2 that could also interpret mean cost swedish labour fare relatively well increase international competition result globalisation. when new regime float exchange rate inflation target introduce begin 1990s, entail new macroeconomic condition collective bargain agreements. during 1970 1980s, inflation average around 8 per cent real wage growth almost non-existent. the slowdown inflation couple relatively stable rate increase nominal wage mean real wage rise sharply 1995 2004, see table 1.3 not since 1960s long period regular real wage increases. in 2004, around 450 collective bargain agreement conclude 2 million employees, span three years. this year, approximately 70 collective bargain agreement sign 1.3 million employees. municipality county council account 1.1 million these, agreement cover two year already conclude them. recently, agreement sign 75 000 worker construction sector 60 000 employee bank insurance. the latter group receive become norm current agreement period. worth note almost entire economy agreement period run time middle 2007. give agreement cancel prematurely, 2007 busy agreement year, since majority collective bargain agreement conclude business sector central government sector 2004, well municipal sector 2005, due renegotiation.4 the social partner individual company gradually adjust low inflation rate. wage set also become decentralised, entail increase opportunity change relative wage within scope give rate wage increases. but despite this, compress wage structure sweden comparison many countries. wage structure differ blue-collar white-collar workers. blue-collar employees’ wage structure considerably compress constant across age groups.5 the wage spread white-collar worker large increase 45 year age, gradually decreases. it mainly high income group wage difference blue-collar worker white-collar employee large. in lower-income group difference small.6 but average white-collar employee long pull away blue-collar workers, risk build tension labour market ahead future negotiations. wage also vary across different regions. but wage spread especially large sweden either. it mainly stockholm, jämtland gotland clearly different wage situation. stockholm country’s high wage level, jämtland’s gotland’s wage level national average. 2 see wage formation sweden 2005, national institute economic research. 3 for 2004, data table 1 might change since agreement yet concluded. 4 see wage formation sweden 2005, national institute economic research. 5 the quotient the10th 90th percentile considerably high white-collar employees' wages, see "lönespridning näringslivet 2004" (wage spread business sector 2004), confederation swedish enterprise. 6 it primarily quotient 90th percentile median wage blue-collar worker white-collars workers' wage differ, unlike quotient 10th percentile median wage, see "lönespridning näringslivet 2004" (wage spread business sector 2004), confederation swedish enterprise. bi review 84/2005 5 on whole, though, wage spread widen sweden past 25 years, time wage formation decentralised. but despite increase wage spread, still low international standards. it still small 1970 comparison 17 oecd country wage spread sweden lowest. high minimum wage likely mean many job never get created. the service sector also affect this, many low-productive work duty perform since nobody will pay cost, high minimum wages. table 1. nominal real wage growth, 1995-2004 1995199619971998199920002001 2002 2003 2004business sector blue-collar worker 4.7 5.4 4.7 3.4 2.6 3.3 3.8 3.6 3.1 2.6 white-collar worker 3.5 6.4

rate strong public finances. so far, grow economy manage create enough jobs. moreover, current account surplus essentially mean export capital large scale; somewhat extreme terms, could say job create growth largely end outside sweden's borders. so low employment growth appear primarily result weak demand. instead, explanation must seek among longer-term structural factors. this reflect particular fact employment rate, spite historically high economic growth, completely recover since sharp fall connection crisis early 1990s. moreover, fact open unemployment drop economic upswing 1990s suggest labour market function satisfactorily. one example rigidity labour market unemployment remain around 8 per cent construction sector, 6 bi review 84/2005 even though one sector activity rise labour shortage begin appear. another sign unemployment problem structural nature large difference across region occupational categories. in spite single monetary policy whole swedish economy, unemployment figure region twice high others, proportion people receive benefit unemployment fund twice high occupational category others. these difference seem last long periods, indicate problem partly due low mobility labour market. in addition, need labour market mobility grow result structural change. the previously typical cyclical pattern, job shed slump recreate economy turn around, long generally hold true industries. job lose slowdown replaced, especially manufacturing, increase productivity information technology. growth lead new job different place before. that mean people change workplace sector, result need considerable adaptability. more job create in, example, service sector, perhaps completely new companies. the structural change occur farmer forestry worker go manufacture relatively easy. now change often entail manufacture worker go service sector, transition may difficult. to extent weak growth employment due structural change swedish economy, manufacture job services, reason discus function labour market improve drive force new business creation strengthened. several proposal put forward public debate – among things, call tax deduction subsidise certain domestic services, well call reduction compensation level increase people’s willingness take lower-paid jobs. other solution discuss low income tax low-income middle-income employees, reduction employers’ contribution cut payroll taxes. these important political issues, issue riksbank obvious reason take stance on. the way whole economy function necessity change since post-war period unlikely current economic policy regime float exchange rate inflation target deliver 2 per cent inflation unemployment rate equivalent level then. during post-war period unique expansion public sector employment high demand pressures, something sustainable long run possible free movement capital, inflation target independent riksbank. bi review 84/2005 7 zeti akhtar aziz: malaysia’s fast-changing

environment global economy demonstrate robustness environment high oil price rise global interest rates. on domestic front, overall performance reinforce expand domestic demand. late indicator suggest growth momentum remain firmly track, improve growth 5.3% third quarter. the outturn year whole expect range 5 - 6%. there also great optimism prospect growth momentum sustain 2006. of significance continue strength private sector activity. household consumption increase 10.4%, real gross fix capital formation increase 9.6% third quarter. reflect malaysia's structural transformation toward

global electronics cycle, commodity price forecast remain high, support export growth well private consumption. sustain demand new us palm oil, particular bio-diesel production positive development. private investment expect also increase substantially 2006, drive high level capacity utilization strong revenue earn growth. the year 2006 witness release two important policy documents: ninth malaysia plan third industrial masterplan. the plan outline key policy direction next several year enhance malaysia's long-term growth prospects, including: (i) role agriculture nascent biotechnology industry; (ii) move value chain manufacture sector; (iii) increase importance services, especially business share services, include outsourcing; (iv) importance education develop human resource need achieve development objectives. an important strength economy several decade now, flexibility, ability resource shift new area comparative advantage response change condition new opportunity global

value add activities. capital also show great mobility, expand potential economy adjust. malaysia also actively identify develop new source growth, leverage resource advantage new technology move value chain. there also great move toward remove rigidity transition toward great market orientation competition. turn monetary policy, bank negara malaysia's determination interest rate policy base requirement domestic economy. specifically, monetary policy seek balance risk bi review 83/2005 1 economic growth inflation medium-term. a risk slow growth diminished, rate inflation expect remain current level time, prompt monetary policy response. the overnight policy rate increase 30 basis point 3% 30 november. in monetary policy statement, indicate new level, overnight policy rate still

fischer, governor bank israel, annual meet association banks, tel aviv, 24 november 2005. * * * i would like start thank association bank invite here, give opportunity address you. i would also like take opportunity congratulate eitan raf galia maor privatization bank leumi. that certainly important event signify end sad era israel's economic history, era start collapse bank share twenty year ago, 1983, oblige government nationalize almost entire bank system. now, last, revert situation bank system regain natural position far ownership concerned, currently hand business sector. the main thing draw right conclusion whole episode. some lesson learned, viz. reform capital market propose bachar committee. but mean end road, important goal face bank system near future relate it. i revert goal later. the bank system play important role israel's economy-it affect it, affect it. israel's economy stand isolated, however, part world economy. that result globalization process take place since end world war ii particularly since 1980s. state quite simply, israel's economy cannot review isolation global economy. the global economy currently experience growth trend, accord various forecast global growth rate 2006 expect 3.3 percent, accord world bank, 3.6 percent, accord investment houses. europe's economy, merely mark time last years, also expect show growth trend. nevertheless, development without certain risks. these express acceleration world inflation, expect close 3 percent 2006 accord investment houses, bring wake forecast rise central banks' interest rates, u europe too. these risk derive mainly trend rise energy price - specifically, only, oil prices. the problem u balance payment also cast cloud global economy considerable time. have say this, overall global picture relatively optimistic one. the global growth one factor provide boost growth israel's economy currently enjoying, one. israel's growth derive government's macroeconomic policy last years, express fiscal discipline-in accordance fiscal target determined-and series reform (in labor market, capital market, ports, etc.), privatization (of banks, company like bezeq el-al), investment infrastructure (for example railway system). another aspect strategy monetary policy pursue bank israel, focus mainly maintain low inflation line government's target. against background, assume government persist macroeconomic policy, bank israel recently publish forecast 2006, show expect growth rate 4.3 percent gdp, even high rate 5.4 percent business-sector product. investment expect rise 4.5 percent, must understand economic growth last two year lead resurgence investments; growth sustained, day come resurgence investment provide additional momentum. it natural present time, run-up general election, question arise whether forecasts, sources, still valid. we period political uncertainty, go together economic uncertainty, even talk relatively short period months, good period uncertainty relatively short. it therefore well worthwhile dispel uncertainty now, least economic area. it vital new government, however composed, commit macroeconomic strategy structural reform create condition healthy sustain growth. domestic bi review 82/2005 1 foreign investor must sure strategy issue, everyone commit it. and important feel right away. on part, bank israel continue pursue interest-rate policy consistent inflation target 1 percent 3 percent year, intention reach mid-point. the economy problem poverty, should, indeed must, tackle responsibly adopt necessary measures. but must tackle open eyes, reality constantly view, commitment strategy long-term growth. without growth, problem poverty cannot resolved, therefore essential economic policy constantly direct towards achievement maintenance growth. a i state outset, bank system important every economy, course israel exception. the importance, however, clearly lie bank system healthy, stable competitive. i also mention important, even dramatic, development affect financial system whole, particular bank system-and reform propose bachar committee. i please see banks, them, already prepare this, sale provident fund mutual fund already take place, measure success, seem us. when i see i happy pessimistic scenario predict realized. in past, too, scenario precede successful reforms, instance foreign-currency market. it natural concern felt reform changes, must understand israel's financial system need additional reforms. it bank system today, great extent also bank israel, prepare confront new target face proper manner: at top list i would put basel ii. the bank israel place high list priority preparedness bank supervision department adopt rule new basel capital accord (basel ii). this also require bank system organize accordingly, small matter. the second target gear meet internal audit standard set section 404 sarbanes-oxley act 2002 ("sox 404"). this subject also high priority bank supervision department, whole bank system, next two years. i learn experience citigroup sox 404 burden, i also know greatly improve management's internal control. these two important project together constitute overall format management control instill high standard israel's bank system, standard consistent advance world wide. the third target relate implementation bachar reform. this involve sale provident fund mutual fund banks; redefine banks' activity profit center general capital market/their capital-market activity; reorganization field consultancy regard pensions; preparation competition credit market nonbank alternatives, etc. the fourth target bank system face current future change (we hope) capital money markets, example, development interbank market follow abolition transaction "previous day's value date" bank israel; future development sophisticate financial instruments; future development mortgage securitization; introduction real time gross settlement (rtgs) system bank israel deeply involved. obviously whole story. these target result efficient bank system great competition capital money market credit market. competition retail bank side leaf much desired. although step take improve competition area, directive issue supervisor bank make easy customer transfer one bank another, situation still far satisfactory. a long increase number large bank - whether merger small medium bank entry foreign bank field full retail bank israel - continue examine way remove barrier area. it clear goal strengthen competition bank system one prime objective bank israel, and, i would assume, every government israel. 2 bi review 82/2005 john hurley: the central bank eurosystem introductory remark mr john hurley, governor central bank financial service authority ireland, seminar irish media, dublin, 6 december 2005. * * * introduction i would like begin thank make time come morning. this promise busy news week i sure many demand time, i grateful many turn morning. the aim session give overview role central bank member eurosystem. the main focus monetary policy, look strategy, experience date communication. the session also include launch new euro area statistics. experience achievement for almost seven year euro area single currency single monetary policy conduct govern council ecb. the introduction single currency historical landmark. in twelve countries, euro replace national currency rapidly become part everyday life. for business community, intra-euro area exchange rate volatility uncertainty cause trade investment eliminated. in financial area, role euro global market growth use new currency outside euro area also impressive. the euro quickly become important part global financial system evidence past seven year role continue grow. within euro area, key challenge formulate implement single monetary policy. a well aware, plain sailing. since come being, single monetary policy conduct test environment, characterise series shocks. at various times, especially early years, period exceptional economic, financial geopolitical uncertainty. the first 18 month witness strong increase oil prices, peak dotcom boom significant fall value euro. the subsequent correction follow collapse dotcom boom, ally heighten geopolitical tensions, trigger critical sustain period economic financial uncertainty witness decades. this persist early 2003, uncertainty unwind considerably since, sharp rise oil price lead uncertainty return periodically interim. on top this, also see sizeable appreciation euro since 2002, particularly dollar, take back level prevail initial launch. from short outline, clear economic financial environment past seven year provide stiff test single monetary policy. give background, outcome? over past seven years, evidence indicate inflation inflation expectation remain firmly control. since begin 1999, indicator long-term inflation expectation euro area remain close 2 per cent. this suggest single monetary policy successful anchor long-term inflation expectation public market convince determination maintain price stability medium-term. this significant achievement relatively short period time important factor permit euro area interest rate remain accommodative, even last week's interest rate rise. i would like comment briefly last week's move emphasise consistency monetary policy strategy place. the decision increase interest rate take background risk price stability identified. the decision help keep medium long-term inflation anchor level consistent price stability. even increase, interest rate remain low continue lend considerable support growth. a future, i would emphasise govern council take 'ex ante' decision engage series interest rate increases. our mandate maintain price stability continue monitor development closely. we examine data, make assessment act appropriate deliver price stability. bi review 82/2005 1 the institutional framework the eurosystem institutional set-up involve centralise decision-making monetary policy issue decentralise implementation decisions. i assure central bank ireland play important role areas. one feature govern council democratic way go business. in sense one surprise this: statute escb provide member one vote specifically restrict weight vote financial matters. i impress manner principle observe practice. certainly, sense governor operate representative capacity address euro area policies. equally, force argument, rather make it, command respect. i assure comprehensive monetary policy preparation process place central bank, ensure play full part formulation euro area monetary policy. we also play full part monetary policy implementation process. at operational level, central bank staff carry eurosystem's money market management operation dublin base banks. the bank system ireland actually take disproportionately high share fund ecb operations. this reflect importance dublin financial centre, testify still grow number financial institution choose ireland location operations. thus, term interaction market, may surprise nonetheless true membership monetary union actually bring central bank contact wide range domestic counterparties case 1999. the eurosystem also responsible smooth operation payment systems. the main instrument carry task provision payment security settlement facilities. to end, eurosystem create target large-value payment euro. at present, target 'system systems' make interlink national payment systems, central bank play full part. in excess one million transactions, amount almost eur5 trillion, process irish system 2004. this represent 1.5 per cent volume total transaction process target system last year. while i focus central bank's responsibility relation eurosystem monetary policy, i would like emphasise one part do. additional responsibilities, among things, include contribute maintenance financial stability provide banknote coin; full set responsibility set three year strategic plan publish 2004. this give flavour activity i feel i stop hand tom o'connell team tell lot role central bank member eurosystem, particular focus monetary policy. once i would like thank take time come morning. 2 bi review 82/2005 erkki liikanen: a central bank's view technology base efficiency productivity financial market open speech mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, bank finland seminar technology-driven efficiency risk financial institutions, helsinki, 21 november 2005. * * * europe need growth. but aging. so growth cannot come increase labour contribution. we therefore need high labour productivity. we need investment, turn increase productivity. and need good solutions, recipes, bring lot high total factor productivity. this mean fast technological change. we happy u today professor matti pohjola, renowned economist, write extensively ict, productivity growth. we know ict powerful tool productivity growth, concern ict-investment use ict new process way organise company public sector. in europe, use it service sector bring increase productivity see unite states. the reason behind this, however, slightly low investment level ict – i believe – le competitive markets. when le competition, le pressure innovate, le pressure increase efficiency. this need real internal market opener competition. and need abolish remain barrier cross-border business areas. today, common monetary policy common financial market. we make progress financial markets, wholesale business generally integration inter-bank large value payment system security market particular. both proceed well. retail bank security settlement system matter lag most. and co-ordination convergence supervision require work. a europe-wide financial sector bring good cheap service low interest rate customers: consumers, smes large company alike. lend decision also decision innovation sectors. all promote growth. from macroeconomic point view, integration financial sector significant europe, because: - integrate efficient financial market would allow dilution risk spread among country regions, - integrate financial market contribute efficient transmission monetary policy. * * * in 1970s 80s, finland saw substantial investment it financial sector. but financial crisis early 1990's sector force revise operations, ict widely use re-engineering internal process create new distribution channels. in ten year followed, bank cut operate expense 50%. this process initiate public authority set stark quantitative cost save requirement condition receive capital support. on top which, enhance competition, due deregulation, increase need continuous re-engineering. certainly, commonly create

difference efficiency, institution national bank sectors. this question elaborate today's presentation de nederlandsche bank's jacob bikker, author well-known book area. implementation ict cause profound change many business lines, yet potential renew streamline process – carry computerisation old process rather reinvent process use full capacity new technology. efficiency come save personnel

* * from brick mortar click mortar visible phenomenon ict financial institution a new distribution channel, internet, mobile terminals, along sufficient atm- payment card network make possible bring number bank branches, give save operate costs. take, example, one finnish bank manage cut distribution cost 25% unit production cost payment 68% 3 year period. this achieve implement multi-channel applications. customer adopt new way banking, pay bills, check credit card balance trade securities, independent time place, surprisingly fast. come generation probably difficulty understand anyone ever queue bank branch pay bill – say nothing write cheque. today, difficult see bank could enter finnish nordic market without well-functioning comprehensive internet service. new customer generation also will capable extensively manage finance use e-banking services. house loans, example, still largely negotiate branches, already see people request offer various bank via internet enter final discussion one bank. this reinforce customer's negotiate power. and increase competition. development also require sufficient security element create maintain public confidence. and challenge growing. we need european level cooperation network security. here i hope enisa, european network security agency, make contribution. we need efficient cooperation among law enforcement authority fight cyber crime. and need secure electronic identification protection data privacy. identity theft, bad case e-crime, must fight fronts. ict implementation exploitation often require huge investments. in many bank ict replace personnel large single item expenditure. old legacy system aging, accord recent survey, 80% ict expenditure go maintenance systems. new investment required, challenge projects. in europe, seem bank industry prudent front new investments. this may partly reflect caution due investment past, 2 k. but may also mirror risk currently deficient vision future. maybe enough incentive – competition? * * * can regulation use enhance competition? this case internal market programme. twelve fifteen national regulation replace harmonize one. active 2 bi review 82/2005 competition policy
