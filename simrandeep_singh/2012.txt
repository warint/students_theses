BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ewart S Williams: Financial risk management Opening remarks by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the Caribbean Centre for Money and Finance Conference, Port-of-Spain, 26 March 2012. *      *      * Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen Let me add my own words of welcome to all our participants of this very timely seminar on Financial Risk Management. As you know, the seminar forms part of a wider project involving the central banks in the Caribbean/CARICOM region. The project is being funded mainly by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) that has partnered with the University of the West Indies (UWI) and Caribbean Centre for Money and Finance (CCMF) to make this initiative possible.  I would like to say a special word of welcome to former President of the Caribbean Development Bank and now acting Executive Director of the CCMF, Dr. Compton Bourne and Mrs. Michelle Cross-Fenty, Country Representative of the IADB, which is a major sponsor of this Project. Welcome also to all our distinguished participants from our regional Central Banks and regulatory bodies and from the international and regional financial institutions. I also thank the media for their presence.  It is no secret, ladies and gentlemen, that our financial systems have been severely tested in the last few years by the outbreak of the global financial crisis whose powerful shock waves have not only rattled financial markets the world over, but also triggered a deep recession with which many countries are still grappling.  For the most part, regional financial systems displayed remarkable resilience to the global financial crisis, even though our economies were buffeted by the global recession that ensued.  Regional financial systems, however, faced their own challenges arising from the collapse of the Stanford Bank and more notably, from the demise of the largest regional conglomerate, CL Financial. The stresses faced by CL’s financial subsidiaries (Clico Insurance, Clico Investment Bank (CIB), British American and BAICO) tested the foundations of the regional financial system, which even so, proved to be resilient.  Two aspects of what has become to be known as the “Clico crisis” are worth mentioning.  The first is its regional reach: it entrapped in its net, not only Trinidad and Tobago, but also Barbados, Guyana and Suriname (that had Clico subsidiaries) as well as the OECS and the Bahamas, which housed BAICO insurance companies, all CLF subsidiaries.  The second aspect that stands out is its tremendous cost. The bill is still accumulating but for the region as a whole, the cost could be somewhere in the vicinity of 10–15 per cent of regional GDP.  For all its negatives, the Clico crisis served as an important wake-up call to the region. Coming on the heels of the global financial turmoil, it was a clear reminder of the need to strengthen our financial and regulatory systems, so that they could withstand exogenous shocks and it underscored the idea that a co-ordinated regional approach was needed.  It was against this background that the CARICOM Heads’ of Government, at their July 2009 meeting requested regional central banks and other stakeholders to put in place a framework for regional financial stability to increase our resilience both to exogenous shocks and to intra-regional stresses.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches It is worth noting, ladies and gentlemen, that the objective characteristics of our region make a strong case for the regional approach to financial stability. We are small economies, with extensive economic links, with high vulnerability indices, compared with other regional groups (like, for example, the EU). Moreover our islands are dominated by a short list of over-lapping financial institutions.  On the downside, however, we currently have no regional regulatory institutions. Specifically, we have nothing like the European Systemic Risk Board which has some regulatory authority. The closest we come to a regional regulatory authority is the ECCB, which covers only the OECS. What’s more, given the current state of the regional movement, I am not sure of the chances for a pan-caribbean regulatory authority.  Putting aside this issue for the time being, I would like to address the question, “What should be the main elements of a new regional financial stability infra-structure for the Caribbean region?”  And, I would like to propose the following:   First – the region needs strengthened financial sector legislation, in the first round covering the banking system, the insurance and the credit union sectors;   Second – we need to substantially upgrade financial sector supervision;   Third – all countries should have deposit insurance;   Fourth – all countries should have national crisis management plans; and   Fifth – building on these national plans, we need to formulate a regional crisis management plan.  Permit me to say a few words about each of these elements.  In many countries in the region, including my own, financial sector legislation is grossly deficient when compared to what obtains in advanced or emerging market countries. We, in Trinidad and Tobago, recently introduced a modern Financial Institutions Act to cover the banking system and new insurance legislation is currently in Parliament. Some countries in the region have been upgrading their banking legislation but the situation is not as promising with regard to insurance legislation, which remains woefully outdated in the entire region. This must be seen against the background that both the Jamaican financial crisis of the late 1990s and the Clico/BAICO regional crisis originated in the insurance sector.  In principle, strengthened, harmonized legislation would be the ideal to forestall regulatory arbitrage. However, the obstacles faced by the CARICOM Model Financial Institutions Bill clearly demonstrated the potential challenges likely to face any kind of harmonized financial legislation.  Countries in the region also need to upgrade financial sector supervision, including the introduction of consolidated supervision. I am told that a first attempt is currently underway to conduct a supervisory exercise on a systemically important institution, with cross-border operations, involving supervisory teams from different jurisdictions. This is an important initiative and I hope that over time these kinds of exercises could become routine examples of regional regulatory cooperation.  More and more countries are adding stress-testing and the use of financial stability reports to their supervisory tool kit. Properly used, these could provide early warning signals and improve the assessment of threats to the financial system. I know that the preparation of financial stability reports is an important component of the IDB-financed project, and I would like to return to this topic later.  Deposit insurance schemes could contribute significantly to the maintenance of regional financial stability, as they protect lower-income depositors and prevent bank-runs. A harmonized regional deposit insurance scheme would be ideal but the obstacles would be 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 formidable. National schemes should still be regarded as an important part of the regional stability infrastructure.  Because financial instability can sometimes arise without adequate warning, all countries should have a national crisis management plan, to be able to move quickly and to contain the potential cost of a national financial crisis. Such a plan invariably requires close coordination between the various national regulatory bodies, the Government and other stakeholders, and should constitute a kind of road map to the process of crisis-resolution. The element of certainty that such plans bring, bolsters consumer confidence and facilitates quick crisis resolution.  A regional crisis management plan is another indispensable part of a regional financial stability, but it is the element that is likely to present the greatest challenges. The critical pre-requisites to such regional plan are (i) agreement on what constitutes a systemic threat to the regional financial system; (ii) the existence of information sharing protocols among regional jurisdictions; (iii) agreement on the strategies to be considered in the resolution process and on the guiding principles for cost-sharing in the event that public intervention is deemed necessary.  A crisis management plan for our region is likely to face several challenges, among which are differences in legislation or supervisory approaches across the region; competing national priorities or differences in resource availability among the regional governments.  The implementation of a regional crisis management plan requires a high level regional council with the authority to make binding decisions as to the use of resources. This could be another challenge in our current circumstances.  I would like to make a few comments on one of the critical components of the IDB-financed project – the preparation of comparable regional Financial Stability Reports (FSR). We need to remember that these reports are designed to serve as early warning signals by pointing out to policy makers the key risks and vulnerabilities faced by policy makers. Most financial stability reports do this by reporting the latest level of key financial soundness ratios. There is a new body of research that suggests the assessment value of these reports could be enhanced by including at least a qualitative discussion of the near term outlook for these ratios based on various policy assumptions.  I fully recognize, of course, that the preparation of these FSRs is resource intensive and particularly challenging for smaller central banks. Thus, conferences and seminars, like this one, where we bring our ideas and experiences together, are an invaluable learning opportunity. We need to leverage off each other if we are to do this exercise successfully. As all of you know all too well, the range of dis-aggregated commercial bank information that central banks in developed countries take for granted is sometimes difficult to collect in our region where the culture of disclosure is not deeply rooted. This makes our effort to develop FSRs all the more challenging but at the same time all the more necessary.  Let me end by wishing you all two days of very stimulating discussions. I am confident that this conference will further our efforts at strengthening regional financial stability and I thank the CCMF and the IDB for making all this possible. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Charles I Plosser: Economic outlook Speech by Mr Charles I Plosser, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, to the Rotary Club of Wilmington, Wilmington, Delaware, 29 March 2012. *      *      * The views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC. Introduction Thank you for inviting me to speak to the Rotary Club of Wilmington. In planning for today, I learned that Wilmington’s business and community leaders have been gathering under your auspices at this location since 1914, longer than any other Rotary Club in the world. From one organization that is almost a century old to another, that is quite an achievement. Since the Federal Reserve is nearing its centennial in December 2013, I thought I would give you a little background on our nation’s central bank before I talk about my economic outlook. While many Americans hear about the Fed in the news every day, not everyone knows how we work or how we are structured. Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913. To balance political, economic, and geographic interests, the System was designed with 12 independently chartered regional Reserve Banks throughout the country, overseen by a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia serves the Third District, which includes Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey, and the eastern two-thirds of Pennsylvania. The Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a banker’s bank, and generally perform the functions of a central bank, including serving as the federal government’s fiscal agent. A central bank also guides the country’s monetary policy. In the U.S., the body within the Federal Reserve that makes monetary policy decisions is the Federal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. The Committee includes the seven members of the Board of Governors in Washington – there are currently two open posts – and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents: the president of the New York Fed and four other presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. This structure ensures that our national monetary policy has its roots not just in Washington or on Wall Street, but also on Main Street and across our diverse nation. Whether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings, participate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the economy and policy options. Each of us prepares for the meetings by gathering information throughout our Districts, around the nation, and, in some cases, internationally. This occurs through meetings with our boards of directors and advisory councils, conversations with local and international business leaders, as well as briefings on economic conditions by our Research staffs. All this helps contribute to a rich and comprehensive mosaic of the national economy. In this way, we are able to make the best informed decisions possible to achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us in the Federal Reserve Act. Specifically, Congress mandates that the Fed should conduct policy to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates”. Since moderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable, it is often said that Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate. I believe the diversity of opinion around the FOMC table is one of its great strengths and serves to improve the quality of our decision-making. As the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann once said, “Where all men think alike, no one thinks very much”. But that 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches diversity of views also requires me to note that I speak for myself and not the Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Economic outlook Now let me turn to the state of our economy. We have now seen 10 quarters of real GDP growth since mid 2009, when the Great Recession officially ended. However, growth has not been particularly robust or smooth. To many, it occasionally feels like we take two steps forward only to take one step back. We finished 2011 with real GDP at 1.6 percent, compared to 3.1 percent in the prior year. There were some perfectly understandable reasons for the weakness last year, given the unexpected shocks we experienced early in the year. Yet, the economy persevered. We saw growth accelerate across each of the four quarters, from less than half of a percent in the first quarter to 3 percent in the fourth quarter. I anticipate that we will continue to see moderate growth of around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013. That outlook puts me in a slightly more optimistic camp than some forecasters. For instance, the Philadelphia Fed’s first-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters reported average estimates of real GDP growing 2.3 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013. Business spending, especially investment in equipment and software, remained relatively healthy last year, buoyed by solid growth in corporate earnings. Results from the Philadelphia Fed’s monthly Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers, which are widely viewed as a useful barometer of national trends in manufacturing, have continued to improve since last summer’s lull. In March, regional manufacturers reported that their current activity continued to expand at a moderate pace, the sixth consecutive month of positive numbers. The survey’s indicators of general activity, new orders, shipments, and employment all remained positive. The survey’s measures of future activity showed that our respondents expect activity to continue to pick up over the next six months. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation’s GDP, also continues to improve. While personal consumer expenditures were steady through January, retail sales in February grew 1.1 percent. While not exactly robust growth, retail sales are more than 6 percent higher than a year ago. On the housing front, I expect to see stabilization and maybe some slight improvement in 2012. We entered the Great Recession over-invested in residential real estate, and we are not likely to see a strong housing recovery until the surplus inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties declines. Even as the economy rebalances, housing and related sectors are not likely to return to those pre-recession highs, nor should we expect them to do so. Those highs were unsustainable, and the housing crash that ensued destroyed a great deal of wealth for consumers and the economy as a whole. The losses are real and the consequences severe for many individuals and many businesses. Moreover, monetary policy cannot paper over these losses, nor should it try to do so. Nevertheless, households and businesses continue to make progress on restoring the health of their balance sheets by paying down debt and increasing savings. That is a healthy trend, and most economists, including me, believe that this trend will continue into 2012. On the labor front, I continue to be encouraged by recent employment reports, although everyone would agree that there are still too many people unemployed in our region and in the nation. The February employment report showed a net gain of 227,000 jobs, giving us the third month in a row with job growth of more than 200,000. We also continued to see a trend of upward revisions in prior months, adding another 60,000 jobs to payrolls. The unemployment rate was 8.3 percent in February, as it was in January, but the unemployment rate has been moving down steadily for six months, and it is now at its lowest 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 levels in three years. As growth continues and strengthens, I expect further gradual declines in the unemployment rate, with the rate falling below 8 percent by the end of 2012. At the regional level, the latest unemployment rates for January also showed improvement. New Jersey’s rate, at about 9 percent, was still higher than the national average, but Delaware’s rate of 7.0 percent and Pennsylvania’s rate of 7.6 percent were below the national average. Our Research Department is forecasting no change in the unemployment rates for Pennsylvania and New Jersey and a decline in Delaware’s unemployment rate in February. The data are scheduled for release tomorrow. We are also seeing continued improvement in the employment index in our monthly survey of manufacturers, which suggests more employers are adding to payrolls than cutting back. As we continue down the road to recovery, there will undoubtedly be some bumps and setbacks along the way, but I am generally optimistic. Of course, any forecast is subject to some risks. The most significant and identifiable risk on the horizon is the potential effects of the continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In recent months, I have come to believe that the European governments and their economies will work through their challenges. Nonetheless, the economic slowdown in the euro zone will likely exert a small drag on U.S. exports. And while European financial institutions have so far endured through the financial market turmoil in Europe, we must continue to monitor events to ensure that these troubles do not spill over to U.S. financial institutions. Of course, regardless of how the European situation plays out, it has already imposed considerable uncertainty on growth prospects for the global economy. Hopefully, some of that uncertainty is beginning to wane. Moreover, our own nation’s fiscal challenges contribute additional uncertainty to the economic landscape. Until the economic environment becomes clearer, firms and consumers are likely to exercise some restraint in their spending and hiring decisions, thus limiting the pace of recovery, even while economic fundamentals in the U.S. continue to improve. On the inflation front, there are risks and we must monitor the trends with care. The rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.9 percent for the 12 months through February. Another common measure called the personal consumption expenditures price index was 2.4 percent through January. Thus, inflation is higher than the Fed’s long-term target of 2 percent. Some of the increased inflation over the past year was driven by sharp increases in energy prices. During the late summer, oil prices did decline somewhat, slowing price increases, but unfortunately, they have been rising again and crude oil prices are now over $100 a barrel and gasoline prices are rising. Oil prices have added a great deal of volatility to the overall price index. At times, sharp spikes in oil prices raise overall inflation, which is then reversed when those prices increases moderate. Yet, since early 2009, when oil prices fell to about $60 a barrel, the trend has been upward. Moreover, inflation rates that remove the effects of energy and food have been drifting upward as well from their lows of 1 percent or less in late 2010 to about 2 percent or a little higher today, depending on the particular index. Thus, we must monitor these inflation trends with some care and be prepared to take appropriate actions as necessary. The public has the right to expect the central bank to keep inflation near its target of 2 percent over the medium to longer term. Inflation often develops gradually, and if monetary policy waits too long to respond, it can be very costly to correct. Measures of slack such as the unemployment rate are often thought to prevent inflation from rising. But the lessons of the 1970s show that is not the case. As you may recall, we ended up with both high unemployment and high inflation, which became known as the misery index. That is not a place we want to find ourselves again. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Monetary policy Before discussing where monetary policy might go in relation to economic conditions, it might be helpful to review just how much accommodation we currently have in place. As you know, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero for more than three years to support the recovery. We have also conducted two rounds of asset purchases that have more than tripled the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and changed its composition from short-term Treasuries to longer-term Treasuries and housing-related securities, mostly mortgage-backed securities. Many of these actions were taken at the height of the financial crisis and the ensuing deep recession. Yet, since then, as I have indicated, the economy has been healing, if somewhat more slowly than we would like, and the financial crisis has substantially abated. Of course, problems remain, but things are not nearly as bad or as gloomy as they were in 2009 and early 2010. At its latest meeting in March, the Federal Open Market Committee continued to hold to its statement that economic conditions were “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014”. That follows a structure for forward guidance that the Committee first began last August, when it said conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates through mid 2013. Then in January, it pushed back that calendar date another 18 months. The FOMC has also announced that the Fed intends to continue the maturity extension program, or “operation twist”, first launched last September and set to end in June. In this program, the Fed is buying $400 billion of longer-term Treasuries and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasuries, in an effort to reduce long-term yields from already historically low levels. The FOMC is also continuing to reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and MBS into MBS in an effort to help mortgage markets. You may know that I dissented from the FOMC decisions in August and September, because it was not clear to me that further monetary policy accommodation was appropriate then. After all, inflation was higher and unemployment was lower relative to the previous year, as we have been discussing. Monetary policy should be responsive to economic conditions, and since that time, unemployment has decreased, and inflation is above target. I believe monetary accommodation is still called for, but I do not believe it should be as accommodative or aggressive as it was at the height of the crisis, when unemployment was over 10 percent and inflation was just 1 percent. Now that unemployment is at 8.3 percent and falling and inflation is over 2 percent and drifting up, we should not anticipate additional accommodation. Indeed, in the absence of some shock that derails the recovery, we may well need to raise rates before the end of 2014. Nevertheless, monetary policy should be responsive to economic conditions. In my view, current conditions do not warrant further accommodation. Yet, should economic conditions significantly deteriorate or the upside risks to inflation I have stressed fall and significant risk of deflation emerge, we should rethink our policy stance. But neither of these events seems likely to me at this juncture. I believe further accommodation at this stage of the business cycle could lead us down a very treacherous path – one that would be ever more difficult for us to navigate and one that would increase the already substantial risk of higher inflation. Yet, the problem is not just inflation risk down the road. Prolonged efforts to hold interest rates near zero can lead to financial market distortions and the misallocation of resources that could lead to more, not less, economic instability. Conclusion In summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect annual growth of around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Prospects for labor markets will continue to improve, with job growth strengthening and the unemployment rate falling gradually over time. I believe inflation expectations will be relatively stable and inflation will remain at moderate levels in the near term. However, with the very accommodative stance of monetary policy that has now been in place for more than three years, we must guard against the medium- and longer-term risks of inflation and further distortions such accommodation can create. Monetary policy should be determined by economic conditions and not by a calendar date. And we should resist any notion that we can solve all of our economic challenges simply by an ever more accommodative monetary policy.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Paul Fisher: Liquidity support from the Bank of England – the Discount Window Facility Speech by Mr Paul Fisher, Executive Director for Markets of the Bank of England, at the National Asset-Liability Management global conference, London, 29 March 2012. *      *      * Introduction The Bank of England’s market operations are designed to allow the use of its balance sheet to deliver on its two core purposes of monetary and financial stability. Specifically, they allow us to perform three important tasks. First, to implement in the market the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Bank Rate and, since March 2009, on the quantity of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves (better known as Quantitative Easing or QE). Second, they enable us to provide liquidity insurance to the banking system and hence reduce the cost of any unexpected disruptions to the commercial banks’ payment services to the UK economy. Third, they provide the bedrock for the Bank’s market intelligence work, which feeds in to both core purposes. Over the past three years or so, I have used opportunities such as this to set out the policy objectives and rationale underpinning the Bank’s various market operations.1 Today, I want to fill in some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle by discussing in detail two of the new operations which provide liquidity insurance: the Discount Window Facility (DWF) and the recently-announced Extended Collateral Term Repo Facility (ECTR). In order to do that, I first want to summarise the principles governing the Bank’s provision of liquidity insurance, and how those have contributed to a complete overhaul of the Bank’s operations since the start of the financial crisis in 2007. Principles for providing liquidity insurance In order to understand our liquidity insurance facilities, it is helpful first to think about why they are necessary at all – and that relates to what it is that commercial banks do.2 In their simplest form, banks provide customers with a variety of basic financial services: an on-demand source of bank notes; deposit and savings accounts; payment services; and they supply credit, to both businesses and households. These are critical services for the efficient functioning of the UK economy – done well they make us all better off. But providing them generates a necessary degree of risk. The most obvious is credit risk – if you lend someone money, you might not get it back. That risk does not justify support from the central bank – the consequences of bad commercial lending decisions should be borne by banks’ management and the shareholders, and not by the UK taxpayer. Banks also bear liquidity risk, which might crystallise for reasons beyond their control. For example, bank liabilities typically comprise a large amount of on-demand customer deposits, and their assets tend to comprise longer-term loans to households and firms. This maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities is an essential part of the banking business model and large unexpected shocks can leave even well-run banks short of liquidity. And the degree of spill-over to the system as a whole is particularly elevated in the banking system.                                                  1  See Fisher (2010), “Managing Liquidity in the System: The Bank’s Liquidity Insurance Operations”, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2010/speech450.pdf. 2 In this speech, references to commercial banks should be taken to include building societies. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches By way of contrast, if a car manufacturer fails, people will buy other cars. If a bank fails, it can cause a loss of confidence and hence a run on other banks. Commercial banks can self-insure against liquidity risk by holding buffers of liquid assets which they can readily exchange for cash in the money markets. It is obvious in hindsight that the banks’ collective holdings of liquid assets prior to 2007 were insufficient to cope with the ensuing crisis and that they should hold more – although precisely how much more is still being debated in international regulatory circles. Nonetheless, liquid asset buffers can only go so far – one can always conceive some event which renders a bank’s self insurance buffer insufficient. Such scenarios could range from short-term IT malfunctions which prevent payments being received, through to full-blown global financial crises. That is why the central bank needs to stand ready as lender of last resort. As the monopoly supplier of central bank money, which is the most liquid asset of all, the central bank is able to provide liquidity, either bilaterally (in the event of an idiosyncratic shock), or to the banking system as a whole (in the event of a market-wide shock). In doing so, there are some important constraints. Support from the central bank is not available to prop up a failing institution. The Bank of England will only lend to those commercial banks that are, in its judgment, solvent and viable. This is for two related public policy objectives. First, the central bank needs to guard against moral hazard – that is, our policies should not undermine the commercial banks’ responsibilities to manage their own liquidity prudently. If commercial banks know that we will always bail them out, then they may take too much risk: the bank’s shareholders and management might seek to profit from the extra gains arising from risky lending whilst relying on the authorities when the risks crystallise. Second, and in consequence, the central bank needs to protect its own balance sheet (and hence public money) against the risk of loss. As a result, central bank lending should be collateralised, and subject to haircuts which are prudently calibrated to be sufficient if the counterparty was to default. In a crisis, it can be difficult to judge whether a bank really does have just a temporary liquidity problem or an underlying solvency problem. There is no shying away from the fact that difficult judgements have to be made about when and whether the central bank should offer actual liquidity support. Before the recent crisis, there was only limited publication of the terms and conditions of possible liquidity support. An approach of “constructive ambiguity” was adopted by many central banks, to guard against moral hazard. But in the events that occurred, that approach limited the extent to which central banks – and market participants – could act quickly within an appropriate risk management framework. Drawing on the lessons of the crisis, the Bank’s approach to providing liquidity insurance has evolved radically since 2007. During that period, the Bank has reviewed the use of its balance sheet, and implemented a series of public and transparent reforms to its facilities. Many of the proposals were set out in a consultation document published in October 20083 and the resulting work programme has led to an almost complete overhaul of the Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF).4 The new Framework includes arrangements for implementing monetary policy as well as permanent facilities for providing liquidity support to the banking system. The latter arrangements include the Bank’s overnight Operational Standing Facilities (OSFs, which offer overnight liquidity against high quality collateral in the event of frictional payment                                                  3 “The Development of the Bank of England’s Market Operations”, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/ Documents/money/publications/condococt08.pdf. 4  That new system is described in a revised “Red Book” published at the end of 2010, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ markets/Pages/sterlingoperations/redbook.aspx. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 shocks), its regular Indexed Long Term Repo auctions (ILTRs, which offer a pre-determined, fixed quantity of central bank reserves, for a period of 3 or 6 months, against a wide range of eligible collateral),5 the Discount Window Facility (DWF) and most recently the Extended Collateral Term Repo (ECTR) facility. The rest of my talk today is focused on the policies underpinning these latter two facilities. Designing the Discount Window Facility The Bank’s DWF, which was introduced in October 2008, is an on-demand facility, designed to provide bilateral short-term liquidity support in the face of either idiosyncratic or system-wide shocks. Eligible counterparties, who have applied for and been granted access to the DWF, can apply to borrow at any time, obviating the need to wait until the Bank’s next scheduled market-wide operation. The design of the Bank’s DWF was shaped, in part, by lessons learnt from the Special Liquidity Scheme (SLS). The SLS was a temporary scheme, introduced in April 2008 to alleviate the extreme pressure on the UK banking system. It was designed to provide a significant, one-off, long-term liquidity upgrade against legacy assets that had become illiquid. Under the scheme, the Bank lent £185bn of Treasury bills, for up to three years, in exchange for high quality but illiquid assets created before the end of 2007 – mostly securitised mortgages and covered bonds.6 Like the SLS, DWF drawings are typically structured as a liquidity upgrade – exchanging borrowers’ illiquid collateral for UK Government securities (gilts in the case of the DWF). The Bank is willing to accept a very wide range of collateral in the Discount Window – a much wider set than that which is normally eligible in the Bank’s regular open market operations. The Bank’s published documentation sets out four categories of eligible collateral (Level A to Level D). The contents of each are determined by the market liquidity of each eligible asset class. The least liquid collateral set includes own-name securities or pools of loans: that is where a borrowing bank itself has originated, or has some other close financial links to, the assets comprising the collateral. Other features of the DWF are very different from those underpinning the SLS. First, DWF borrowings typically have a term of 30-days.7 The DWF is intended to act as a bridge in the event of a liquidity shock. For a relatively mild shock that might support a counterparty to the next regular ILTR,8 or to planned debt issuance. For greater shocks, the solution might require more fundamental changes in the firm’s balance sheet (e.g. asset disposals). In any case, before it will agree to lend in the Discount Window, the Bank of England will need to be convinced that there is a credible path to a point where access is no longer required. Crucially, the DWF is only intended to provide short-term liquidity support to banks – and is not intended to be used as a replacement for funding, which can only be sourced in a sustained way from private markets. And it is vital to stress that the DWF is not a 100% committed facility. At the point of application, the Bank will make a fresh, independent assessment of whether it deems the counterparty to be solvent and viable. To guard against moral hazard, the DWF charges fees which make it unattractive in normal times, but which would be more attractive under stressed market conditions. Because the                                                  5  For more information, see Fisher (2011), “Recent developments in the sterling monetary framework”, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2011/speech487.pdf. 6  For more information see John, Roberts and Weeken (2012), “The Bank of England’s Special Liquidity Scheme”, in the Bank’s Spring 2012 Quarterly Bulletin. 7  Currently the Bank also offers at its discretion the option of a drawing of up to 364-days, for an additional fee. 8  Although counterparties are not guaranteed an allocation in these auctions, they are able to bid up for liquidity, increasing their chances of being allocated. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches DWF is structured as a liquidity upgrade, the fees charged are linked to the type and liquidity of collateral delivered. The more illiquid the collateral, the greater the value of the upgrade, and hence the higher the fee. In addition, as part of the Bank’s desire to ensure that commercial banks are adequately incentivised to seek their own liquidity insurance, the cost of borrowing increases with the size of the draw. The resulting matrix of fees is summarised in Table 1.

It relates to the challenges associated with providing liquidity support while not compromising the Bank of England’s ability to conduct monetary policy. To implement interest rate decisions, the Bank must, through its market operations, adjust the supply of central bank money in response to changes in the demand for banknotes and reserves, given the MPC’s policy rate (Bank Rate). During periods of stress there may be large shifts in the demand for reserves and so the Bank’s market operations need to be designed to meet both our monetary policy and financial stability objectives without conflict. In normal times, Bank Rate is set within a reserves averaging framework, in which commercial banks choose their own targets for reserves balances held at the Bank but are then required to meet those targets on average over the monthly maintenance period and are remunerated at Bank Rate. The Bank of England supplies just enough cash to the system so that banks can collectively meet their targets, and a combination of the Operational Standing Facilities and the inter-bank market should guide short-term market interest rates towards Bank Rate. This framework relies on the Bank ensuring the amount of sterling cash in the system is in line with that demanded, given Bank Rate. The liquidity swap structure of the DWF does not involve an extra injection of cash and so helps to avoid any direct impact on the setting of Bank Rate. The Bank may, however, decide in exceptional circumstances, to lend cash instead. That might be required if, for example, the gilt repo market was not functioning properly, or the size of the required draw is sufficiently large that the Bank deemed it unlikely that the counterparty will be able to repo the gilts without causing undue volatility in the markets. In such circumstances either the Bank would need to relax the tolerances around banks’ reserves targets to accommodate the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 extra cash in the system, or drain the excess cash, which it can do by one of several means. In either case, the Bank would not compromise its capacity to set Bank Rate or purchase assets. Since the start of the Bank’s asset purchase programme in March 2009, this interaction has not been binding. Because quantitative easing directly injected more cash into the economy, forcing the commercial banks to hold more reserves than they would otherwise have chosen to, the reserves averaging system was suspended and all central bank reserves have since been remunerated at Bank Rate. But when reserves averaging is re-introduced in due course, we will need to be conscious of the potential interaction between liquidity support and monetary policy operations. The framework is designed so that both policy objectives can be achieved at the same time.9 Recent policy initiatives/issues a) Pre-positioning Since the DWF was put on a permanent and transparent footing in late 2008, the Bank has been working on a number of initiatives to develop the facility further. One important expansion has been the Bank of England’s capacity to assess and lend against portfolios of loans (e.g. mortgages) as well as securities.10 There are a number of benefits to having this capacity. Portfolios of loans can be easier for the Bank to assess from a risk perspective, as they do not embed the complex structures sometimes present in securitised assets. And securitising loans into asset backed securities – such as RMBS – is both complex and expensive for the firms, and generally only available to those large enough to have an existing securitisation programme. The ability to accept raw loan collateral means that smaller counterparties, without securitisation platforms, are not disadvantaged when positioning collateral at the DWF. Since financial instability can start with smaller banks just as easily as larger ones, expanding the universe of possible Discount Window counterparties could lead to significant financial stability benefits. Alongside the expansion of eligible collateral to loan portfolios, we have been encouraging banks to “pre-position” their collateral. Pre-positioning involves the commercial banks identifying, and the Bank of England assessing, various types of collateral ex ante, so that it need not be assessed at short notice in the event of a sudden and unexpected need to borrow at the Discount Window. Assessing varied pools of illiquid collateral can be extremely complex and time consuming. The Bank may not be able to lend much, if at all, against collateral where it has not had time to conduct sufficient due diligence. As a result, it is vital that such collateral is pre-positioned well ahead of any need to draw. One of the benefits from having a more public and transparent facility is that such due diligence is much easier to carry out. The pre-positioning drive has gathered pace in the last year or so – there is now over £265bn of collateral pre-positioned for use in the DWF. After applying appropriate haircuts to each piece of collateral pre-positioned, this means the Bank could, subject to solvency and viability assessments and repayment plans, lend around £160bn in the DWF without the complications of further detailed collateral checks.11 Although not a substitute for firms                                                  9  Further details on how central banks can use their money market operations to implement monetary policy and provide liquidity support to banks are set out in Clews, Salmon and Weeken (2010), “The Bank’s money market framework”, available in the Bank’s Winter 2010 Quarterly Bulletin. 10  Further details are available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/marketnotice100719.pdf. 11  That is around 10% of annual nominal UK GDP in 2011 – slightly higher than that in the United States, where the lendable value of collateral pledged by all depository institutions in the Discount Window (around $1.3trn in January 2012) is equivalent to around 8.5% of nominal US GDP in 2011. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches building up their own holdings of high quality liquid assets to a more satisfactory level, that represents a very substantial “war chest” of potential liquidity in the event of significant adverse shocks. There is limited cost to the counterparty of pre-positioning, as collateral can be withdrawn on demand for use in other operations or market transactions. The extent of pre-positioning varies across firms, however, and we hope to continue to both sign up new counterparties and encourage firms to increase further the quantity of pre-positioned collateral over time. b) Addressing perceptions of stigma The latest data, published in the Bank’s Quarterly Bulletin this week, show that there was no borrowing under the DWF between its introduction in late 2008 and 30th September 2011. In part, that is likely to reflect the fact that the UK banking system (in aggregate) has not been short of sterling liquidity over this period – the Bank has injected large amounts of liquidity through a variety of operations including both the SLS and expanded LTR operations. And since early 2009 asset purchases under the MPC’s QE programme have mechanically led to a large increase in the stock of central bank reserves. Of course more reserves in total do not ensure an appropriate distribution of liquidity across individual banks – but it does help. Some people have suggested that lack of use of the DWF may reflect concerns about stigma attached to such support facilities. Stigma might arise from counterparty concerns that their use of the DWF would be detected, coupled with a perception by others that only weak institutions would ever use a bilateral, on-demand facility. In fact, as we have made clear, the DWF is not there to support a failing firm – when borrowing from the DWF, firms must have convinced the Bank of their ability to repay. Addressing the stigma issue is extremely complex and has potentially affected a number of central bank operations internationally. One way of addressing perceptions of stigma is through appropriate policies on disclosure. While headline results of the Bank’s auctions, such as total bids and total amount allotted, are published immediately at their conclusion, we publish only the average daily amount outstanding in the DWF over the quarter, aggregated across firms, and even that with a one-quarter lag. The intention is that DWF drawings will not be disclosed until after they have terminated. Moreover, where structured as a liquidity upgrade, DWF borrowings would not be visible on the Bank’s balance sheet, reducing the risk that any drawing is unintentionally revealed. Another possibility is that counterparties are concerned about being “spotted” using DWF-sourced gilts in the repo markets. For the majority of cases, however, I think there are simple ways to alleviate these concerns – for example by encouraging banks to set up multiple repo counterparty relationships and rotate their regular gilt repo business amongst them. That would deliver wider business and financial stability benefits, even in the absence of the DWF. Indeed, the FSA requires banks to test their repo capacity by lending out gilts from their liquid asset buffers. Ultimately we expect a counterparty would draw on the DWF if it had to, despite any stigma concerns. The risk is that the perception of stigma might delay an application to borrow, making a firm’s liquidity position more perilous. The solution to this problem requires the Bank to work closely with both the supervisors and the commercial banks themselves, to ensure appropriate timing of any use. c) Extended collateral term repo facility (ECTR) The most recent policy development in our liquidity insurance tools has been the addition of the ECTR facility in December 2011. Although it is a contingent facility, the ECTR is a permanent part of the Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework. The design of the ECTR shares elements of both the ILTRs and the DWF. Like the ILTRs, it is a competitive auction, designed to provide reserves to the banking system as a whole. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Participants submit quantities they would like to borrow and a price (expressed as a spread to Bank Rate, subject to a minimum of 125bps) that they would be willing to pay. The disclosure policy (total amount bid for/allocated) is also very similar to the ILTR, which together with the market-wide nature of the operation, should help alleviate any perceived stigma associated with the facility. The ECTR’s collateral arrangements, however, are similar to the DWF – borrowings can be backed by the full range of eligible collateral, so long as it has been pre-positioned in the Discount Window beforehand. The purpose of the ECTR is to make liquidity available against the least liquid collateral, to the market as a whole, and would be offered only if there was likely to be multiple take up. (If only a single firm needed support they could be directed to the DWF.) Consistent with all the Bank’s facilities, only firms judged to be solvent and viable would be eligible to participate. Subject to that, all counterparties that have access to DWF would be eligible to participate in any ECTR operations. Although the facility has been announced, the Bank has not yet offered any operations under the ECTR. That reflects our judgment that market conditions have not yet been consistent with a likely demand for its use. The Bank would revisit this decision in the event of any marked deterioration in market conditions. Conclusion In this speech today, I have set out some of the principles behind the Bank of England’s revised, permanent and public facilities for providing liquidity insurance to the banking system. We expect banks to self-insure for most of their liquidity needs – and while there has been encouraging progress to date, more is needed on that front. But if necessary, the Bank of England stands ready to provide support to solvent and viable institutions, against sufficiently good collateral, for an appropriate fee. It is important that commercial banks pre-position their collateral so that due diligence can be performed and the maximum benefit achieved. The new Sterling Monetary Framework, which has been reformed almost in its entirety since 2007, reflects our experience during the crisis and lessons from some of the temporary measures that had to be put in place. Doubtless the Framework will continue to evolve in future, but the provision of such published facilities should help to make the system more resilient in the years to come. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Masaaki Shirakawa: Central banking – before, during, and after the crisis Remarks by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the International Journal of Central Banking, Washington DC, 24 March 2012. *      *      * Introduction The global financial crisis and the bubbles preceding it pose mounting issues for a central bank. The Bank of Japan was the first central bank among advanced countries to confront those issues in the postwar period. Japan’s experience intellectually stimulated academics and policy makers overseas, which led to the Bank being flooded with policy proposals, including highly experimental ones. With the exception of just a few cases, however, the low growth in Japan following the bursting of a bubble was often simply interpreted as a unique episode caused by a failure to implement bold policy measures in a prompt manner. As many of you may recall, there was an oft-quoted paper coauthored by a number of Federal Reserve economists entitled “Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan’s Experience in the 1990s” that was released in 2002.1 This paper argued as follows (Chart 1). “our sense is that much of the failure of monetary loosening to support asset prices and to boost the economy owed to offsetting shocks rather than to a genuine breakdown of the monetary transmission mechanism. …… there is little evidence that the transmission channels of monetary policy were so diminished as to have obviated the benefits of faster and sharper monetary easing in the 1991–95 period.”  At that time, I found that such a view on the effectiveness of monetary policy was too sanguine. Several years later, the housing and credit bubbles burst, this time in Europe and the United States, triggering a financial crisis. Developments in real GDP for the United States, after U.S. housing prices peaked and again after a large-scale financial crisis occurred in the form of the Lehman shock, reveal surprisingly similar trends shared with Japan (Charts 2 and 3).2 The same can be said of the two countries’ policy responses, including the virtually zero interest rate policy and the expansion of central banks’ balance sheets (Charts 4 and 5). When the Bank of Japan was striving to devise new policy measures, not to mention the zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, a policy commitment regarding the future level of interest rates, and – as referred to today – credit easing, little did I imagine that the Federal Reserve would adopt similar measures within such a short span of years. I have become painfully aware of the need to more closely study each of the countries’ experiences over the past quarter-century, and to draw true lessons that could be applied to future policy conduct. Relevant topics for discussion range widely from monetary policy to regulation and supervision, payment and settlement systems, and so on. In my remarks today, I will raise                                                  1 For more details, see the following.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches several points with particular focus on the role of the central bank in maintaining macroeconomic stability at each of three phases: before, during, and after the financial crisis. I. Before the crisis: financial imbalances and monetary policy I would like to start from issues relevant in the periods preceding financial crises, focusing on the role of monetary policy. Conventional wisdom tells us that price developments serve as a trigger for changes in monetary policy. In fact, without exception, central banks pay attention to output gaps and inflation expectations, which have an impact on future inflation developments. In retrospect, however, when we look back at how bubbles were formed and then developed into financial crises, the most significant imbalance that destabilized the macroeconomy emerged on the financial front instead of the price front. The financial imbalances took the form of a sharp and significant rise in asset prices and credit expansion associated with increased leveraging and maturity mismatches. Financial imbalances ultimately created a tremendous shock to financial institutions and the financial system, and led to a sharp and significant contraction of economic activity. While such acute pains wore off as a result of aggressive policy measures taken by the governments and central banks after the crisis erupted, the chronic affliction of low growth associated with balance-sheet repair remains. This experience has revealed the fact that the economy was not able to avoid a prolonged period of stagnant growth even though aggressive monetary easing was adopted in a prompt manner after the bursting of bubbles. In this sense, policy priority should be placed on ex-ante measures to restrain a buildup of financial imbalances instead of ex-post measures to clean up the mess after a bubble bursts. Regarding ex-ante policy measures to address financial imbalances, some argue that, based on Tinbergen’s rule and Mundell’s assignment principle, the authorities should assign monetary policy to price stability while tasking regulatory and supervisory measures with the challenge of addressing financial imbalances. However, such a policy assignment can be effective only when the two policy objectives of price stability and financial system stability are independent from each other. A series of events in recent years have made it clear that the two policy objectives are not independent. When a macroeconomic environment including prices becomes stable, economic entities become more sanguine about risks and increase their appetite for risk-taking. Furthermore, with the growing expectation that a low interest rate environment will continue under price stability, financial institutions increasingly get involved in “search for yield” activity by increasing leverage and mismatches in their assets and liabilities with respect to maturities and currencies (Chart 6). When such imbalances grow beyond a certain threshold, they threaten the stability of the financial system and consequently that of the real economy and prices. Many central banks, including the Bank of Japan, were aware of the financial imbalances in the periods preceding financial crises. The most troublesome thing for central banks was the fact that inflation rates did not rise, or remained low, during the buildup of imbalances, which was ironic given their traditional emphasis on price stability (Chart 7). At least in the case of Japan, when inflation rates remained low amid high economic growth, those who tried to justify an interest rate hike needed to defeat the strong counterargument that was predicated on what later became known as “the arrival of the new economy.” The continuation of a low interest rate environment is one cause of financial imbalances. In particular, if the central bank commits itself to asymmetric conduct of monetary policy – more specifically, if it does not lean against a bubble so long as prices are stable but instead intervenes aggressively after the bursting of bubbles –, the situation could get worse through the following channels. First, this kind of put option-type monetary policy engenders more risk-taking by financial institutions. Second, if monetary policy focuses narrowly on price stability alone and successfully engenders an extended period of a stable macroeconomic environment, it will further boost various economic entities’ expenditure and risk taking. Even though monetary policy itself leads to a combination of high growth and low inflation, on the surface, it is difficult to distinguish such a case from the arrival of the new economy. If the central bank 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 continues with monetary easing without a proper diagnosis, this boosts the economy and accelerates the accumulation of financial imbalances under seemingly continued price stability, resulting in a correspondingly larger shock after the bubble bursts. This could be referred to as “a paradox of price stability.”  Needless to say, it is inappropriate to blame only monetary policy for an accumulation of financial imbalances that are in fact formed through a much more complicated mechanism. In this regard, nobody disagrees with the claim that regulations and supervision play important roles in addressing financial imbalances, and that macroprudential perspectives are crucial. So, what about the argument that the authorities should assign regulatory and supervisory measures to financial imbalances? My answer is simple: we need to employ appropriate monetary policy in tandem with regulations and supervision. It does not seem promising to address financial imbalances only through macroprudential measures and regulations without monetary policy responses. This is just like endlessly bailing out water that is overflowing from a bucket without turning off the tap. II. During the crisis: the importance of the lender of last resort role Now I would like to move on to the next phase: the midst of the crisis. In this phase, the essential role of the central bank is to act as the “lender of last resort.” The time-honored importance of the lender of last resort function has also been demonstrated by the aggressive measures taken by central banks in the midst of the recent crisis, which proved to be very effective in preventing a sharp drop in economic activity. Taking the examples of quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan, credit easing by the Federal Reserve, and the three-year LTRO by the European Central Bank, the effectiveness of all these measures essentially hinges on these central banks’ role as the lender of last resort. In association with the lender of last resort function, I would like to stress the importance of policies regarding payment and settlement systems (Chart 8). Only the central bank is able to issue currency that private economic agents can accept without conditions. Therefore, in a financial crisis where the credibility of counterparties is undermined, the role of the central bank becomes extremely important. In the midst of the crisis, it is crucial that financial institutions and investors manage the counterparty risk by controlling not only the amount of exposure at the end of the day but also that of intraday credit. In the past twenty years or so, it has been the role of the central bank, as a bank of banks, to make various efforts to improve the safety and efficiency of payment and settlement systems. Such efforts have led to the introduction of real-time gross settlement, delivery versus payment, and simultaneous settlement of foreign exchange (Chart 9). Without such efforts made by central banks, the Lehman shock could have induced a complete termination of financial transactions. If I am asked what the most significant contribution by central banks is in terms of securing economic and financial stability in the past quarter of a century, I could point to their unceasing efforts to improve payment and settlement systems. III. After the crisis: the effects and limits of aggressive monetary policy Lastly I would like to discuss the role of monetary policy in the aftermath of the financial crisis – specifically, when the economy has overcome acute pains but still suffers from chronic affliction of low growth associated with balance-sheet repair (Chart 10). When taking monetary easing steps, it is essential to conduct a careful analysis of their intended benefits as well as unintended costs. While aggressive monetary easing is definitely needed after the bursting of bubbles, its side effects and limits should also be taken into consideration. Although there is no universal conclusion to such cost and benefit analysis for monetary easing, as it depends on countries and phases, I would like to call attention to the following 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches four aspects, which have not been paid sufficient attention in traditional arguments made before the recent crisis.3 The first is the burden of balance-sheet repair. Even with monetary easing, economic entities with excess debt neither increase expenditures nor embrace more risk taking until their debts are reduced to an appropriate level. Monetary easing only mitigates pains associated with balance-sheet repair. Moreover, employing this mitigator for a prolonged time comes with costs, as it reduces incentives to lessen excess debt and causes delays in balance-sheet repair, which ultimately is necessary for economic recovery. Needless to say, the effect of low interest rates is extended to those economic entities that have not suffered any damage to their balance sheets. If they bring forward future demand to the present by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, this leads to an increase in aggregate demand. As balance-sheet adjustment continues for a long period of time, however, the amount of future demand that could be brought forward gradually diminishes even in a low interest rate environment. The above-mentioned cost of reducing incentives to lessen excess debt is not only an issue for private economic entities but also for the government. Once the increased level of government debt is perceived to be unsustainable, this threatens both price stability and financial system stability, as in the case of the European debt problem. The second aspect is the impact of low interest rates on the supply side of the economy. If low interest rates induce investment projects that are only profitable at such interest rate levels, this could have an adverse impact on productivity and growth potential of the economy by making resource allocation inefficient. While central banks have typically conducted monetary policy by treating a potential growth rate as exogenously given, when the economy is under prolonged shocks arising from balance-sheet repair, we may have to take into account the risk that a continuation of low interest rates will affect the productivity of the overall economy and lower the potential growth rate endogenously. The third aspect is the impact on financial intermediaries. The effect of monetary easing usually materializes when firms and households increase their expenditures, induced by low interest rates. Within that process, we should bear in mind that there are financial intermediaries and financial markets that connect monetary policy conducted by the central bank with firms and households. Once such intermediaries stop functioning properly, we can no longer expect to see a successful transmission of monetary easing. Maturity transformation is an important intermediation function of banks, which benefit from the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. Monetary easing widens this spread and increases the interest margins of financial intermediaries. This is one of the monetary transmission mechanisms that enhance the stimulative effect on the economy through the banking sector. Beyond a certain threshold, however, further monetary easing could instead squeeze the margins and discourage financial intermediation, resulting in lower efficiency in resource allocation and lower growth potential in the long run. A similar problem arises for institutional investors in the form of a negative spread – that is, investment returns on assets fall below the promised return on long-term liabilities. The fourth aspect is the international spillovers of monetary easing and the feedback effect on a country’s own economy. When the domestic economy is in the process of balance-sheet repair, the effect of monetary easing tends to materialize in the form of a search for yield activities by global investors and the depreciation of foreign exchange rates, instead of increased expenditures by domestic private economic entities. If emerging economies become the destination of a search for yield activities by global investors, monetary easing in advanced economies, combined with an inflexible foreign exchange rate policy in emerging economies, is likely to lead to expansion in emerging economies and a rise in international                                                  3 As for quantitative analysis of the effect of various policy measures adopted during the period of quantitative easing in Japan, please see Hiroshi Ugai, “Effects of the Quantitative Easing Policy: A Survey of Empirical Analyses,” Monetary and Economic Studies Vol. 25, No.1, March 2007. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 commodity prices.4 Even though such a rise in commodity prices is affected by globally accommodative monetary conditions, individual central banks recognize that the fluctuation in commodity prices is an exogenous supply shock and focus on core inflation rates which exclude the prices of energy-related items and foods. The resulting reluctance of individual central banks to counter rising commodity prices, when aggregated globally, could further boost these prices. From a global perspective, such a situation represents nothing more than a case where a hypothetical “World Central Bank” fails to satisfy the Taylor principle, which ensures the stability of global headline inflation (Chart 11). While it is understandable that central banks would pursue the stability of their own economies in the conduct of monetary policy, it is increasingly important to take into account the international spillovers and feedback effects on their own economies. Concluding remarks: monetary policy challenges for the future So far I have raised points relevant to discussing central banking in terms of three phases – before, during, and after the financial crisis. In closing, I would like to offer a change in perspective by pointing out future challenges for central banks as organizations. The first is the framework of monetary policy. In this regard, a consensus is already emerging. Most central banks of the advanced economies are now conducting policy with the aim of maintaining price stability in the medium to long term, regardless of the difference in the label attached to their monetary policy framework. Furthermore, it has also become apparent that an excessive focus on short-term inflation development may ultimately result in larger swings in the economy through the buildup and inevitable correction of financial imbalances. The Bank of Japan is probably not alone in trying to incorporate its view on financial imbalances – in other words, the macroprudential perspective – into the conduct of monetary policy. The remaining issue here is to weave such a desirable framework into the political foundations of central bank independence, which is the cornerstone of economic stability and prosperity. It is relatively straightforward to hold the central bank to account for hitting or missing a certain inflation number. In that sense, the spotlight accorded to specific levels of inflation has been a quid pro quo for entrusting an important slice of economic policy to a technocratic institution. In contrast to this, macroprudential considerations are much more nebulous – containing more elements of art rather than science – and will inevitably test the limits of democratic deference to the conduct of monetary policy. The second, and related, challenge is to strengthen the decision-making processes and economic analyses at central banks. Good decision making and research supporting a central bank are the real foundation of its independence. The recent crisis has revealed that we miss many important points when we look at the economy only from traditional macroeconomic perspectives. We need to make efforts to avoid falling into this trap and to break free from the habit of groupthink. It is essential to develop an institutional culture in which a variety of information vital to decision making in monetary policy – related to the macroeconomy, financial markets, and financial institutions – is fully utilized in a well-balanced manner.                                                      4 As to the background of international commodity price developments and its policy implications, please see Report of the G20 Study Group on Commodities under the chairmanship of Mr. Hiroshi NAKASO, November 2011.

BIS central bankers’  speeches 1 Elizabeth A Duke: Building sustainable communities Speech by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the 2012 National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference, Seattle, Washington (via videoconference), 27 March 2012. *      *      * Building sustainable communities I am pleased to participate in the ninth biennial National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference. Since its inception in 1996, this conference has fulfilled its mission to train bankers and community development professionals on the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) by providing cutting-edge information about regulations, policies, and best practices in community development. In addition, it has become a source of inspiration for CRA-related community development activities. As this year’s agenda demonstrates, this interagency conference has grown to encompass all aspects of community development, including discussions of community amenities that provide both quality of life and economic resilience for low- and moderate-income residents.  Before I begin, I would like to thank the thousands of community development professionals I have met in the course of my work with the Federal Reserve for helping me to understand the breadth of the work that they do. In fact, many of you are here today. You have shown me your projects, shared your triumphs and frustrations, testified at hearings on the future of CRA, served on our Consumer Advisory Council, and actively participated in Federal Reserve conferences. Your counsel has given me a deeper appreciation of the complexities involved in creating and maintaining strong communities, particularly in times of economic stress. In my remarks today, I would like to share some of these insights.  Background With the enactment of CRA in 1977, Congress directed financial regulators to assess each depository institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including its community’s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In the early years, even though CRA evaluations considered an institution’s provision of all types of credit in lower-income communities, most were primarily focused on mortgage credit. This was in part due to the availability of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data which made robust analysis of mortgage lending possible. In addition, the focus of community development advocates on housing issues, including the redlining practices that prompted CRA’s passage, eclipsed the law’s broad scope in public perception. Only over time have community stakeholders come to appreciate the broader context of CRA.  Today, financial institutions have become partners in community development, bringing with them an important source of capital and financial expertise. By working together, bankers, community development practitioners, state and local governments, and other community stakeholders have learned a great deal, and the community development field has matured significantly.  Places and people At one time, policy discussions revolved around whether community development was about people or places. I would argue that the debate is over and both sides won. Successful community development is based on attention to both the physical infrastructure, whether housing or commercial spaces, and the health and welfare of the residents therein. 
2 BIS central bankers’  speeches CRA supports community development by requiring financial institutions to identify and address the financial needs of the communities they serve.  Safe and affordable housing will always be an important concern for lower-income Americans, but the recent recession and resulting damage to communities across the country make it clear that communities are more than physical structures. Sustainable communities – those that can weather economic downturns – not only provide decent housing, but also have the resources to support individuals and families and to create a dynamic business environment. For this reason, community development today is a multidisciplinary exercise that challenges us to think holistically about how housing relates to jobs, educational opportunities, transportation, healthcare, and other services and amenities.  Neighborhood stabilization Taking a well-rounded approach is essential now, as weak national economic conditions have caused particular hardships in lower-income communities, and have stretched the federal, state, and local resources available to address neighborhood stabilization and revitalization. In some areas, high rates of vacant and abandoned properties resulting from foreclosures have depressed housing values, drained the coffers of local governments, and created breeding grounds for crime and other social ills in what were otherwise stable, albeit low-income, communities. The result has been a shift in focus in community development, from building new housing to preserving or disposing of existing housing.  In recent years, local governments and community-based organizations have struggled to counter the effects of foreclosures on neighborhoods. Some communities have found success by establishing land banks to manage low-value properties that might otherwise sit vacant if left to the private market.1 Land banks are typically public or nonprofit entities, often with a limited lifespan and sunset provisions. The notion of a land bank, as opposed to a land trust, is that properties are brought in and moved out of a land bank’s portfolio rather than permanently preserved. While part of the land bank’s portfolio, foreclosed properties can be physically rehabilitated, rented, sold to new owner-occupants or responsible investors, or, in some cases, demolished. Using this kind of mechanism, a community can gain control of vacant properties and keep them from causing problems for the surrounding neighborhood until market conditions are more conducive to redevelopment or sale.  Land banks are just one example of the new approaches to housing issues that are being pursued across the country, many with the assistance of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The NSP program offers some funding to tackle these issues, but it also provides a structure to bring community stakeholders together to identify the best strategies for addressing foreclosures given the particular circumstances of each community. Whether a community decides to purchase and rehabilitate homes for resale, demolish vacant homes, or create land banks to help control the destiny of these properties, the collaborative problem-solving approach used by NSP is one that can make the most of limited resources.  Neighborhood stabilization is doubtless the precursor to community development in some communities and, in recognition of this, the federal banking agencies amended CRA regulations to specifically recognize neighborhood stabilization activities in designated NSP                                                  1 See Thomas J. Fitzpatrick IV (2010), “How Modern Land Banking Can Be Used to Solve REO Acquisition Problems,” in REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization (PDF), proceedings of the conference, REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization, cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland and the Federal Reserve Board (Washington: Federal Reserve Board of Governors), pp. 145–50. 
BIS central bankers’  speeches 3 areas as appropriate for CRA consideration.2 In addition, the Federal Reserve has identified and shared a number of promising practices for dealing with foreclosed and vacant homes.3 While some cities are pioneering with land banks, others, such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Baltimore, are using data to plan for the future in ways that city governments wouldn’t have imagined just a few years ago. Partnering with local foundations, universities, and community organizations, these cities are collecting extensive property data to identify neighborhood assets and build on those strengths.4 In Phoenix, local officials and non-profits are partnering with local realtors to match families with affordable homes for sale. Unemployment The foreclosure crisis that resulted from unsustainable subprime lending has persisted largely because of high unemployment rates. Thus, in order to be successful, any effort to stabilize and revitalize lower-income neighborhoods will need to consider housing through the lens of access to jobs and educational opportunities. The Federal Reserve System currently has an initiative underway to better understand the relationship between community development activities and successful workforce development strategies. We anticipate that this research will provide valuable information for bankers and their community partners as they address the needs of their communities.  Of course, having a job is one thing. Getting to it is another. With good reason, transportation considerations have become more common in community development plans in recent years. More communities are taking public transportation into account when planning residential projects. Given the high cost of owning and operating a car, transportation options are a significant factor in a neighborhood’s overall affordability. Demographic shifts over the last decade have resulted in the suburbanization of poverty, and now dictate that communities work together to create transportation options, including buses, light rail, and even car-sharing arrangements.  Even so, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has discovered in its work on car ownership for low-income workers, public transportation is not always sufficient to solve the transportation problems of the poor. Some jobs, such as construction work, require that workers report to different locations. Shift workers, whether security guards, airport baggage handlers, or hospital workers, may not have easy access to public transportation at night. Supporting nonprofit organizations, such as Vehicles for Change, which takes donated cars and refurbishes them for sale to low-income workers for a very small fee, may be the most effective means for some communities to overcome the barriers to car ownership.5                                                   2 See, 75 FR 79278 (Dec 15, 2010) amending the CRA regulations by revising the term “community development” to include loans, investments, and services that support, enable, or facilitate projects or activities that meet the “eligible uses” criteria in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and are conducted in designated target areas identified in NSP plans approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 3 See Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (2010), REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization (PDF), proceedings of the conference, REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization (Washington: Federal Reserve Board of Governors).   In addition, the Federal Reserve System created a series of video reports that highlight promising stabilization work being done in Cleveland, Detroit, and Phoenix. These videos and related data tools can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/neighborhoodrevitalization/stablecommunities.htm. 4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), Putting Data to Work: Data-Driven Approaches to Strengthening Neighborhoods (PDF) (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December). 5 More information about Vehicles for Change is available at www.vehiclesforchange.org. 
4 BIS central bankers’  speeches One of the more innovative solutions to this issue that I have seen was developed by an organization in Dallas that aims to move the jobs to the workers, rather than vice versa. Lone Star Investment Advisors LLC is a private equity fund that invests in Texas companies located in, or willing to move to, low-income census tracts. The fund’s managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that can create jobs in the state’s lower-income communities. One of the businesses in the fund’s portfolio, PrimeSource Food Service Equipment, moved from an affluent northern Dallas suburb to South Dallas, where the poverty rate was higher than 40 percent, relocating more than 100 employees and hiring new employees from South Dallas. I raise this example because it demonstrates what a little imagination can do to solve the problem of connecting people with jobs. Moreover, this double bottom-line approach to investments – making a profit while benefitting the community – makes this kind of activity attractive to bankers with CRA obligations and other socially-minded investors.  Community development: an entrepreneurial enterprise This innovative example serves as a reminder that successful community development is an entrepreneurial enterprise. Thinking about community development this way reminds me of a presentation made at a recent Federal Reserve research conference on small business and entrepreneurship.6 Amy Wilkinson, Senior Fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School Center for Business and Government, has conducted research to identify the skill sets of high-impact entrepreneurs and small business leaders. The skills she identified are, not surprisingly, applicable to community development. They include being able to spot opportunities that others don’t see, managing complexity, reiterating ideas and revamping plans repeatedly, experimenting and failing wisely, networking to create solutions, and, as Amy put it, “unleashing generosity” in ways that create reciprocity within the network.  No doubt these sound familiar. Community development is an ongoing process of identifying and understanding the complicated interaction of people and places. Solutions are found through the cycle of experimentation and adjustment. Successes look easy but they mask hard work and, often, failed attempts. Transformational changes in communities rarely happen without the involvement and support of a network that includes residents, business owners, community organizations, financial institutions, and local government. Sustained interaction among these stakeholders is what makes the opportunity known and the solution successful.  The city of Rochester, New York, put these principles to work and managed to weather the bankruptcy of the city’s largest employer. Eastman Kodak once employed some 61,000 Rochester residents and invested significantly in the city’s educational and cultural institutions; three decades later, it employs fewer than 7,000 people and recently filed for bankruptcy protection.7 This is not an uncommon story, except for the fact that Rochester managed to gain a net of 90,000 jobs during the three decades of employment decline at Kodak.  How did Rochester manage this transition so successfully? The city recognized early on the need to diversify its economic base and, some 20 years ago, created a network of private and nonprofit partnerships to leverage the city’s assets, the same universities and cultural institutions Kodak had supported. Together with local government, this network trained entrepreneurs and supported new business ventures, many of which are in optics and                                                  6 Wilkinson, Amy (2011).

BIS central bankers’  speeches 5 photonics. Through foresight and the collaboration of government, private and nonprofit partners, and committed citizens, Rochester was able to build on the Kodak legacy, effectively turning lost jobs at Kodak into new local opportunities.  Healthy communities In addition to housing and employment, residents need communities that support their health and well-being in a variety of ways. Community developers play a critical role in supporting healthy lifestyles by planning for sidewalks, parks, and other open spaces connecting housing and commercial areas in ways that also provide places for people to meet and children to play. Renovation and new construction plans increasingly adhere to standards that incorporate “green” materials and technologies not only because they lower utility costs, which is important, but also because they improve health results, such as asthma rates, among residents.  One of the most obvious ways to support healthy lifestyles in lower-income neighborhoods is by making healthy food accessible. In the face of increasing rates of obesity, low-income neighborhoods are notably underserved by grocery stores. This is beginning to change because of programs like The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative, which is supported by a partnership between The Reinvestment Fund, a nonprofit developer, and two community organizations, The Food Trust and the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition. This partnership stepped in to fill a financing need where infrastructure costs were not met by conventional financial institutions. Their original objective was to make fresh food available in low-income neighborhoods. But they have achieved much more. The grocery stores the partnership helped to establish create an anchor for other retail needs in the area. Moreover, the stores hire local workers and train them in both the required job skills and in the workplace etiquette necessary to succeed in any job. One of the original groceries financed under the program has also added in-store financial services and a health clinic. As this grocery operator discovered, access to healthcare is another critical need in many low-income communities.  In Chicago, residents have taken it upon themselves to fill the need for primary and specialty healthcare by establishing the Lawndale Christian Health Center. Ownership in the Center is retained by residents to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of its neighborhood. In another example of a community facility meeting more than one need, the Center has expanded over time to provide leadership development and organizational capacity building services to its members in addition to health services.  Conclusion I could go on to recite more examples of programs that respond to community needs, but I think you get my point: Taking an entrepreneurial approach to community development results in innovative and effective programs, making communities more desirable places to live and more resilient in hard times. The CRA regulations encourage banks and thrifts to invest in activities that provide affordable housing or financial services for individuals, promote economic development, or revitalize or stabilize low- or moderate-income areas.  At a time when the needs of these communities are so great and the resources available to meet those needs are so scarce, it behooves financial institutions to think broadly about their CRA obligations. By partnering with other community stakeholders, these institutions can help address existing community needs and lay the groundwork for stronger credit demand in the future.  I don’t want to underestimate the difficulty of the task. The recession damaged communities of all types, but particularly lower-income neighborhoods, and economic recovery has been stubbornly slow. Nonetheless, the commitment and innovation demonstrated in communities 
6 BIS central bankers’  speeches all across the country is encouraging. Taking an entrepreneurial approach to community development and thinking about the needs of both people and places will, I believe, make for stronger, more resilient communities in the future.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Christian Noyer: Re-examining central bank orthodoxy for un-orthodox times Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the conference of the Global Interdependence Center/Bank of France, Paris, 26 March 2012. *      *      * The unconventional policies implemented during the crisis have transformed the face of central banking. But will these changes prove permanent and will “the unconventional become the new normal?” There is not yet definitive answer to this question. We may not, as easily as we would like, be able to revert exactly to the status quo ante. However, I strongly believe we must make sure that the gains from the pre-crisis period, in terms of monetary and price stability, are not compromised in the process.  Prior to the crisis, a description of central banks would have centred on four characteristics: They were focused with price stability being their primary or key objective, and no responsibility was sought or given for financial stability;  They were of limited size with very small balance sheets and interest rates as their only policy instrument; They were independent, a condition recognised as necessary to anchor inflation expectations, and embodied in very strong institutional frameworks; And they were successful: the “Great moderation”, a period of exceptional low volatility in output and inflation, was widely seen as a product of efficient and wise monetary policies. There was a happy feeling that, at last, a perennial monetary regime had been found, well-tailored to the characteristics of a modern market economy. Financial markets were efficient and the zero lower bound and liquidity trap appeared to be no more than historical curiosities.  With hindsight, of course, we can see now that this “ideal” economy may never have existed. The Great Moderation was as much a product of “good luck” (brought by disinflationary effects of globalisation) than good policy. Monetary stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of financial stability, because capital markets are not always and necessarily efficient. And downward financial spirals may quickly bring our economies to the point where interest rates can no longer be used as effective tools. Therefore, as the crisis unfolded, central banks responded by taking unprecedented measures and, in the process, underwent three major changes  A diversification of their interventions. In order to both: Unclog financial markets (both private and public). This involved exceptional liquidity provision to banks as well as temporary purchases of assets, both private and public.  Circumvent the zero lower bound and bring down real long-term interest rates through purchases of government bonds, and/ or interest rate guidance. As a consequence, central banks’ balance sheets expanded by a factor of three, dramatically increasing their role in financial intermediation and sometimes raising concerns, at least in some quarters, about the possible inflationary impactTogether, this diversification and the increase in size have created more complex interactions with fiscal policies. Specifically, asset purchases are sometimes seen as “quasi fiscal policies” both on the asset side (due to the potential risks attached) and the liability side (when they contribute significantly to meeting the funding needs of the sovereigns).  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches At the time they were decided, those exceptional interventions were absolutely necessary. Although it had been forgotten, central banks were initially created to protect the economy from excessive financial disturbances. This was, historically, their “raison d’être”. As ultimate and unique providers of liquidity, they cannot escape this responsibility and let the financial system and the economy collapse.  At the same time, by doing so, central banks have exposed themselves to a number of risks First, there are risks linked to balance sheet expansion. They cannot be ignored, although all central banks have been extremely careful in valuing the assets purchased or taken as collateral. Second, they run the risk of blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary responsibilities. A dynamic use of their balance sheets by central banks has effects on the allocation and distribution of resources in the economy. They may favour or penalise some types of collateral or certain borrowers. If central banks take on additional responsibilities in the area of financial stability, they will have to do so in close cooperation with fiscal authorities, thus exposing themselves to possible interferences with monetary policy.  The major risk, however, is the risk of confusion. A multiplicity of interventions could be interpreted as a relative dilution of objectives. There is a tendency by market participants and some policymakers to consider central banks to be “universal problem solvers” whose balance sheets can be used, without cost, for all purposes. There is also a doubt, at least an ambiguity, in the minds of some analysts, about the true purpose of government bond purchases. Central banks’ activism may create doubts as to their ability to stick to their core mandate – price stability – in the face of increasing pressures and constraints. Overall, the euro area is well protected against all of these risks thanks to the robustness of its institutional framework Price stability is unambiguously the priority objective of monetary policy Monetary financing of governments is strictly prohibited The Eurosystem (the ECB and National Central Banks) is extremely well capitalised, which protects its independence.  This has allowed the Eurosystem to implement nonstandard measures on a large scale without endangering its credibility. Of course, we do not control fiscal policy. We will never accept a situation where fiscal imbalances could constrain monetary policy. It is very important, therefore, that credible fiscal consolidation takes place across the euro area. This will make it easier for the Eurosystem to be active in protecting financial stability. On the contrary, doubts over governments’ resolve to ensure the sustainability of public finances would make us powerless to fight instability and expose the euro area to great dangers.  Now for the more normative aspects. We may have to live with nonstandard measures for a long time. Indeed, some central banks have adopted interest rate guidance announcements covering the next two years. It is likely that monetary policy will, for some time, make use of a diversity of instruments. Macro-prudential measures will interact with monetary policies in a complex way.  In that context, it is therefore all the more important to keep clarity of purpose and stick to two crucial features inherited from the pre-crisis consensus: the focus on price stability and, its corollary, central bank independence. There should be no ambiguity about what central banks are trying to achieve. The more non-conventional their actions, the less obscurity there should be as to their ultimate purpose. Non-conventional measures, like any others, can only achieve their objectives if inflation expectations are solidly and clearly anchored. From that point of view, calls by some economists and market participants for a temporary relaxation of price stability objectives 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 are, in my view, totally misguided. I find it significant, on the contrary, that two major central banks have recently decided to quantify their price stability objectives and enhance their communication accordingly. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jörg Asmussen: Exchange of views on the economic and social crisis in Greece Introductory statement by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 27 March 2012. *      *      * Responses to written questions on the economic and social crisis in Greece by several political groups within the European Parliament can be found on the ECB’s website. Dear Chairwomen, Honourable Members of the European Parliament, The organisation of this hearing once again illustrates to what extent the launch of the euro has brought about economic interconnectedness: in view of the strong implications for the stability of the euro area as a whole, putting Greece back on its feet is in the very interest of all of us. Political interconnectedness could also hardly be better demonstrated than today. Domestic policies have become European – which fully justifies to discuss them at European level, both in executive and parliamentary fora. Why the Greek adjustment programme is unavoidable The Greek economic adjustment and its social implications are painful: there is no doubt about this. The question, however, is: how did Greece get in such a situation and does it have any alternative? The major effort of adjustment reflects the severity of the macroeconomic imbalances that have accumulated over years in Greece. Misguided economic and fiscal policies, lack of structural reforms: all these policies undermined the sustainability of public debt and created a very large competitiveness gap. It is not the adjustment programme which is causing the recent decline in GDP. The current economic depression is an unavoidable correction of the substantial positive output gap that has built up until 2009.  Is there any alternative to the current adjustment? We do not help Greece by creating false expectations. Calls for loosening the fiscal stance are illusory. Greece could hardly face larger financial constraints than at the moment: it has lost market access and can only draw on a fixed envelope for official support. There is only one way forward: restoring fiscal sustainability and competitiveness, which will, in turn, bring back sustained growth. This requires perseverance: perseverance in carrying out fiscal consolidation; perseverance in implementing comprehensive structural reforms; and perseverance in addressing the weaknesses of the Greek banking sector.  The efforts undertaken by the Greek government and the sacrifices the Greek public endured so far have been substantial. But there is still a long way to go. It is no secret that the programme is subject to exceptionally high implementation risks. The debt exchange operation has been successful, official financing has been scaled up. This has improved debt sustainability prospects: the estimated debt-to-GDP ratio could be brought to about 116½% in 2020. But this all depends on one key condition, namely that Greece fully implements the programme. Debt dynamics are extremely sensitive to implementation slippages. Delayed fiscal consolidation, lower privatisation proceeds or slower structural reforms: such scenarios would translate into weaker economic growth and worsen again debt sustainability. Without a regime-change in policy implementation and a much broader political consensus in favour of painful, but necessary reforms, there is a high risk that the programme derails. Therefore, political courage is more needed than ever. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Let me now comment in some more detail on three key areas: fiscal adjustment, competitiveness gains and financial sector issues. Fiscal adjustment The Greek authorities and the Greek people deserve recognition for the significant fiscal adjustment they have achieved over the last two years: despite the deep recession, the general government deficit was reduced by around 6½% of GDP since 2009 (from 15¾% to 9¼%). This broadly corresponds to the deficit reduction that was initially envisaged under the programme, i.e. before the 2009 deficit outcome was revised upwards (by 2.2% of GDP). This is a remarkable achievement. Nevertheless, the size of the government is still too large compared to Greece’s capacity to generate and collect fiscal revenues. Moreover, the quality of the fiscal adjustment was mixed. On the one hand, important reforms have started to address Greece’s high level of public wages and employment and the previously unsustainable pension system. On the other hand, fiscal adjustment has so far excessively relied on an increase in tax rates and across-the-board expenditure cuts.  Looking ahead, further progress in fiscal consolidation requires the implementation of difficult structural fiscal reforms. Closing the large fiscal gap for 2013–14 (5½% of GDP) will be a litmus test for the government’s commitment to the programme: without the government’s willingness and ability to design and implement the difficult structural fiscal reforms, such a large adjustment cannot be achieved.  I call on Greece’s political class to push through these difficult reforms by confronting vested interests. Otherwise the critical mass of structural fiscal reforms necessary to close the medium-term fiscal gap may not be reached. Finally, how can we make sure that the economic adjustment burden is being fairly distributed? I know that this is an important concern of the European Parliament. One essential avenue is the tax administration reform. Progress in this regard has been rather disappointing so far: in many cases, wealthy Greeks still contribute less than possible to the overall adjustment effort, partly on account of tax evasion. Strengthening revenue administration and fighting tax evasion are crucial. Not only are they needed to increase revenue; they could also improve the social acceptability of the adjustment programme. Competitiveness There has been some improvement in competitiveness under the first programme, but it fell short of what is needed: Greece still faces a substantial competitiveness gap. This largely reflects delays in the implementation of labour market and other structural reforms. Closing this gap, while remaining in the euro area, will require a more pronounced internal devaluation. How can it be achieved? How can we reverse the dramatic increase in unemployment? Reducing minimum wages in the private sector, removing rigidities in the wage-setting system: these are key elements of the strategy for accelerating the internal devaluation. They may not be popular, but there is no way around it if we want to create the basis for renewed competitiveness and employment growth.  This is not the only area where decisive action is needed. Labour market reforms must be complemented by a liberalisation of product and services markets, for example in closed professions. Political willingness is a key ingredient to overcome the resistance of vested interests in these areas.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Bank recapitalisation Last but not least, Greece needs to address the situation of its banking sector. As a consequence of the debt exchange, most Greek banks are heavily undercapitalised. The programme envisages that banks deemed viable by the Bank of Greece will be recapitalised. Banks that are unable to raise capital in the market will be recapitalised with programme resources through the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF). In contrast, banks that are deemed non-viable will be resolved. It is crucial that the €25 billion earmarked for these purpose as part of the first disbursement be used for the swift injection of capital into Greek banks (the overall envelope for bank recapitalisation and resolution amounts to €50 billion). The recapitalisation strategy was designed to maximise private sector participation, while preserving the State’s interests. The banks’ shares acquired by the State in the recapitalisation process will have limited voting rights, but may still allow for upside returns to be shared between the State and private shareholders. Whenever possible, the private management of banks will be safeguarded. The governance structure of the recapitalisation and resolution processes will be significantly enhanced. This became necessary owing to the very substantial amount of official financing that will be channelled through the existing Greek institutions, in particular the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund. Conclusion Let me conclude with a message of hope. Yes, the medicine is bitter, but the patient can and will recover if he follows the prescription. Looking at successful past experiences of fiscal adjustment in other European countries shows that this is not a lost battle. However, an absolute prerequisite for the adjustment to succeed is strong political ownership. The Greek people are not reforming their economy and their state to please the troika; they are not carrying out sacrifices to please country X or Y in the euro area. They are going through this adjustment process for their own good. Maximum political ownership should therefore be expected and is key.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Edgar Barquín: Recent economic trends and policy issues Presentation by Mr Edgar Barquín, President of the Central Bank of Guatemala, at the JP Morgan Investor Seminar, Central America Panel, on the occasion of the IADB Annual Meetings, Montevideo, Uruguay, 17 March 2012. *      *      * I would like to thank JP Morgan for the opportunity to share my views on this panel.  In addressing the recent economic trends in Guatemala and the main policy issues, I would first like to highlight some specific features of the current international context that directly affect Guatemala’s economy. Then I will give you a quick overview of recent trends and prospects of Guatemala’s main economic variables, and finally I will share with you the main policy challenges we are or will be facing in the near future. Regarding the current international context, I would like to highlight six elements:  First, the deterioration of global economic prospects, which is already being reflected in the weakening of global trade. Lower economic prospects are also on the horizon for most Latin American countries as well as some key emerging economies such as China and India.  Second, high frequency indicators suggest a recovery of economic activity in the United States of America, though the sustainability of this recovery is still uncertain due to high levels of unemployment, problems in some key markets such as the housing market, potential risks due to the problems in the Euro Area and fiscal consolidation issues, among others. Third, uncertainty arising from the Euro Area debt crisis with potential spillover effects to other regions and financial markets. Fourth, declining commodity prices that have contributed to easing of headline inflation in most developing countries. However, prices are still high, particularly oil prices. Fifth, high levels of unemployment remain in most advanced economies including the United States and the Euro Area as a whole. And sixth, insufficient progress in developing medium term fiscal consolidation in advanced economies that could deepen global imbalances. Regarding recent trends and prospects of Guatemala’s main economic variables, first of all I would to highlight that the recovery of economic activity continued in 2011; in that year, GDP increased by 3.8 percent, though still below the pre-crisis levels.  For 2012 we are expecting a growth rate between 2.9 percent and 3.3 percent, mainly due to the impact of the international environment I just mentioned. As regards exports, after experiencing negative growth rates in 2009 due to the crisis, the growth rate in 2011 was the highest of the last 13 years or more, at 23.6 percent. This performance was mainly due both to higher prices and higher export volume of Guatemala’s main traditional products. For 2012, prospects we are expecting slightly lower growth rates, though still positive, due to the deterioration in global economic prospects. In the case of imports, the growth rate was quite significant at 20 percent during 2010 and 2011, reflecting a higher domestic demand of goods and services particularly capital goods, fuel and other inputs for the industry. For 2012, a lower growth rate is expected as we are estimating a lower demand for consumption goods and inputs for the industry.  Remittances inflows are recovering at a slow pace. In 2011 the amount was a little bit higher, 63.3 million dollars, than the one of 2008 previous the hit of the crisis in Guatemala. For 2012, even though we are expecting a recovery in the amount of inflows, the growth rate is 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches not significant, 5.7 percent, as the Hispanic unemployment rate in the United States, from which about 99 percent or remittances come, is still high.  As the Guatemalan economy is more integrated with the global economy and as new investment opportunities arise due to a greater diversification of its production of goods and services, we have experienced an increase of capital flows from Foreign Direct Investment. We expect these flows to keep growing as specific actions are being taken to promote investments in the country on the basis of a public-private strategic alliance which also includes efforts to improve Guatemala’s investment climate. As of today, about 55 percent of Foreign Direct Investment comes from the United States and Mexico. Here it is important to mention that short term capital inflows to the economy have not been significant. Therefore, we have not experienced the problems of other Latin American countries which had to deal with relatively high capital inflows as well as with significant appreciations of their nominal currencies and increases of credit to the private sector that fueled economic activity over its potential levels. International Monetary Reserves have reached highest historical levels, at over  USD 6 bn (and expected to reach close to USD 7 bn in 2012), which represents an important liquidity cushion for the Guatemalan economy as well as a good signal to the international markets and credit rating agencies.  The banking credit to the private sector has increased, mainly the credit in foreign currency due to lower international interest rates as well as the higher Guatemalan industrial activity experienced in 2011. The main funding of the credit in foreign currency has been commercial lines of credit from American banks.  The Economic Activity Confidence Index is improving, particularly in the most recent months. This performance is highly related with positive expectations about the new government that took office in mid January. So far, the government has given clear signals of being a pro-private sector government. In its first month in office the government has launched a competitiveness agenda and an integrated policy for foreign trade, competitiveness and investments. These and other specific actions have contributed positively to expectations about economic growth despite the uncertainty on the global economic prospects.  Declining commodity prices have contributed to easing of headline inflation since mid 2011, reaching 6.20 percent by the end of the year, slightly above the top limit of the Monetary Board’s target of 5.0 percent plus minus 1 percentage point.  For 2012, inflation estimates are within the range target of 4.5 percent plus  minus 1 percentage point, though inflationary expectations are still above this range.  Guatemala’s Central Bank main goal is to pursue price stability which is reflected in an inflation range target set out by the Monetary Board, the one I have mentioned. In this context, if inflationary pressures arise or inflationary expectations continue above the target, specific actions will be taken by the Monetary Board in the near future to achieve the 2012 and the midterm inflation targets.  In the meantime, the central bank is monitoring the performance and prospects of key external and internal economic variables that may impact headline inflation and inflationary expectations. In addition, coordination with fiscal policy continues to be strengthening as well as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Guatemala is known by international organisations and credit rating agencies for its good record of prudent fiscal and monetary management as well as for its low levels of public debt and tax burden.  Fiscal revenues were significantly hit during the crisis 2008/2009 so fiscal deficit almost doubled, reaching 3.3 percent of GDP in 2010. To keep public debt at sustainable levels in 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 the midterm, fiscal deficit should be equal or lower than 2 percent of GDP. In this regard, even though further reductions are needed, we can say that the consolidation is underway as the fiscal deficit reached 2.9 percent of GDP in 2011 and is expected to be at 2.6 percent of GDP in 2012.  It is worth mentioning that during the first month of the new government Congress has passed two legal provisions aim at strengthening fiscal revenues on a sustainable path. The legal provisions included not just modifications to some taxes but also specific provisions to strengthen the Tax Administration powers to fight against tax evasion and smuggling.  Despite the increase in public debt in recent years, total debt to GDP ratio is still below critical values. We expect that the actions that are being taken to strengthen fiscal revenues on a sustainable way will contribute to stabilize this ratio at sustainable levels.  Given the uncertainty that remains about the global economic prospects I would say that there are three main policy challenges we are currently facing as policy makers:  The first one is to anchor inflation expectations to the midterm target. This means that the Central Bank has to stand ready to take any necessary measures to address inflationary pressures, even in a context of potential deterioration of economic growth at the national level. This is important because if the downside risks to growth materialize and inflation expectations are still above the midterm target, the Central Bank has no room to ease monetary policy and support economic growth. The second main policy challenge is to secure fiscal sustainability in the medium term through the strengthening of tax revenues and the implementation of prudent fiscal policies reflected in the stabilization of the rising debt-to-GDP ratio and the reduction of the fiscal deficit to levels below 2 percent of GDP. This is particularly crucial as we need to restore fiscal maneuver in the short term in order to be able to address a more severe global economic downturn or the impact of a natural disaster which in fact is very likely to happen as Guatemala is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to experience natural disasters. Securing fiscal sustainability is not just an issue of reducing public expenditure as besides high fiscal rigidities; Guatemala has important infrastructure and social needs that need to be addressed in order to foster sustainable economic growth.  This drives me to the third main policy challenge which is to foster sustainable economic growth in an uncertain international environment.  To address this challenge commitment is needed not just from the government but mainly from the private sector as well as civil society. As I already mentioned, some work has been done to build these strategic alliances through the competitiveness agenda and the integrated policy agenda for foreign trade, competitiveness and investments as both have been endorsed by the private sector. In addition, efforts initiated by the previous government regarding specific programs to address poverty and creation of opportunities for the most vulnerable groups are being taken by the new administration as well as specific actions to address the high levels of crime and violence that also affect sustainable economic growth.  Some of these actions will render benefits in the medium term, so in the mean time the main contribution of monetary and fiscal policies would be to preserve macroeconomic stability while maintaining the soundness of the financial system as this has been key to address adverse shocks in the past as well as to create a solid basis to achieve a sustainable economic growth. As a conclusion, allow me to summarise with the following points:  As we have and will be discussing these days in different forums, our economies are, again, vulnerable to external shocks arising from other regions.  Even though we have made significant improvements, particularly regarding the strengthening of the economic fundamentals of our economies, which is reflected in a lower volatility of the main macroeconomic prices including lower inflation rates, 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches strengthened financial systems, more sound fiscal balances, improvements in productivity and so on, we are not exempt, now and in the future, from experiencing these kind of shocks that at the end affect not just economic and financial variables but most important the well being of our populations.  As policy makers, we have the responsibility to preserve those economic fundamentals and to come up with policy actions that may reduce their negative impact, or even better that could make our economies less vulnerable to their effects.   In this context, I am glad to be here and looking forward to the discussion of our challenges as we may come up with specific policy actions that may be needed now or in the future to address these challenges. Thank you very much for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ben S Bernanke: Opening remarks Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Conference on “Central Banking: Before, during, and after the crisis”, Washington DC, 23 March 2012. More information about the conference, held at the Madison Hotel, Washington, DC, March 23–24, 2012, is available on the Board’s website. *      *      * Distinguished guests, colleagues, and friends: It is my privilege to welcome you to this conference on “Central Banking: Before, During, and After the Crisis,” which is jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and the International Journal of Central Banking. We hope that the conference will foster discussion among policymakers and researchers about the evolving challenges facing central banks around the world. To help get that discussion started, the conference will feature original research on monetary policy, macroprudential regulation, and the provision of liquidity, topics that are obviously highly relevant to the public policy missions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. The proceedings from this conference will be published in a special issue of the journal and disseminated to researchers in central banks and academic institutions worldwide.  Needless to say, the events of the past few years pose serious challenges to the conventional, pre-crisis views and approaches of central banks and other financial supervisors. The crisis, the recession it sparked, and the subsequent slow recovery, especially in the advanced economies, have demonstrated that we have much to learn about the workings and vulnerabilities of our modern, globalized financial system and its interactions with the broader economy. In responding to these stressful financial and economic developments, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have had to deploy a variety of new tools and approaches to carry out their responsibilities regarding monetary policy and the provision of liquidity, tools about which we still have more to learn. Finally, in the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies have been charged with challenging new responsibilities in the area of macroprudential supervision, with the objective of promoting financial stability and reducing the likelihood and the costs of a future financial crisis. Although much progress has been made, we are still at an early stage in understanding how best to meet these new macroprudential responsibilities.  All of these developments have spurred a great deal of research within central banks, in academia, and elsewhere. This outpouring of research will help shape future central bank doctrine and policy approaches and, most importantly, should help central banks better carry out their mission to promote the public welfare. The papers at this conference make a variety of welcome contributions to this endeavor. Two contributions consider the implications of recent events for the conduct of monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional.1 Another paper addresses the relationship between monetary aggregates and financial stability.2 And several papers investigate issues in the field of regulation and macroprudential supervision, including the design of an integrated framework for regulation, a proposal for                                                  1  See Mark Gertler and Peter Karadi (2012), “QE 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 . . .

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mark Carney: Bank note launch Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the launch of the new 50 dollar bank note, Québec City, Québec, 26 March 2012. *      *      * Hello and welcome. It is a pleasure to be here to announce the launch of the new 50 dollar bank note. This bank note features a symbol of Canadian innovation and scientific excellence: the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker and research vessel, the Amundsen.  Today is also a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Coast Guard. So we find ourselves in an ideal location, in Québec, a city with a rich maritime heritage. Icebreakers are an important part of the Coast Guard’s fleet, and it is entirely fitting to feature one on our currency. These new 50 dollar polymer bank notes, the second of our Frontiers series, will become available in banks throughout the country as of today. This series of bank notes is called “Frontiers” for two reasons. First, each bank note includes images that represent Canada’s exploits and achievements, particularly those in the sciences, technology or exploration. The image on this note is an example of expanding the frontiers of knowledge and understanding of the Arctic. The bank notes themselves have crossed a technological frontier. There is simply no other currency like it. These new notes feature a unique combination of transparent elements, holographic images, and other security features. They are the result of innovative technology and Canadian ingenuity, including research by the Bank of Canada and excellent collaboration among physicists, chemists, engineers and other experts in the bank note industry. Thanks to greatly enhanced security features and efforts undertaken by police forces, especially the Sûreté du Québec and the RCMP, as well as the support of financial institutions and retailers, counterfeiting rates have been reduced by 90 per cent since 2004. Issuing this new series of bank notes enables us to continue to stay ahead of counterfeiters. In addition to impressive security features to combat counterfeiting, these notes will last longer than those made from paper – at least two-and-a-half times longer – and will therefore be more economical and have a smaller environmental footprint. When they are eventually withdrawn from circulation, they will be recycled into other products here in Canada. Safer, cheaper, and greener: indeed, these new bank notes are a 21st century achievement of which all Canadians should be proud and in which they can have full confidence. This last point is very important. According to Bank of Canada research, when Canadians shop, they use cash for more than half of their transactions. They need a currency they can trust and the bank notes of this series are the most secure ever developed in the history of the Bank of Canada. Let us move now to the images that are on these bank notes; the Bank consulted citizens throughout their development. It was Canadians who told us they liked the new polymer material. And these citizens also gave us the ideas for themes. On the 50 dollar note you will see an image of the Amundsen, an icebreaker that keeps our oceans open to navigation. The Amundsen also undertakes search and rescue missions in the far north and serves as a research base where scientists from around the world come to work together. I think that Roald Amundsen, the great Norwegian explorer of both poles, would be very proud of the spirit of adventure, scientific excellence, and collaboration that are so apparent on the ship that bears his name. Thank you everyone for coming today. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Matthew Elderfield: European banking regulation and the Eurozone crisis Address by Mr Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and Alternate Chairman of the European Banking Authority, to the 4th CDU/CSU Congress in the Bundestag, Berlin, 26 March 2012. *      *      * These remarks are the authors personal views and do not necessarily reflect those of the EBA or of the ESRB, of which Mr Elderfield is a member of the General Council. Thank you for the invitation to join you today to discuss European banking regulation. In my brief time for opening remarks I would like to do three things: explain the actions the European Banking Authority (EBA) has taken to address the eurozone financial crisis; discuss the limits of regulatory action due to the feedback loop characteristics of the crisis and suggest two or three areas to explore to improve the current policy response to the crisis. The formation of the EBA at the start of 2011 was a very significant milestone in the development of European regulation and the single market in banking. The EBA is different from its predecessors in three important ways. First, its actions as policy-maker will mean that a single European rule book will become a reality and be directly binding on all EU banks. Second, its remit for supervisory convergence and direct operational  responsibilities – such as its role in colleges of supervisors – will make it increasingly influential in how supervision works on the ground in national authorities. And third, its responsibilities for crisis management mean that it will be at the forefront of the most important regulatory challenges of the day. This has, of course, been the case with the current Eurozone financial crisis, first through a series of stress tests and, more recently, with its recommendation to create a temporary capital buffer to strengthen the European banking system. It is important to remember that the EBA’s actions on capital were taken in response to not only market concerns but also calls for strengthening of capital from leading international and European policy makers. Last autumn both the new Managing Director of the IMF and the European Systemic Risk Board, comprising the EU’s central banks and regulators, made strong calls for increased capital levels at Europe’s banks. EBA’s Chairman, Andrea Enria, showed strong leadership to respond to those concerns by crafting a new initiative on capital which was adopted by the EBA’s members.  Constructing correctly calibrated regulatory measures involving bank capital is extremely challenging in the current financial crisis. This is principally because of the negative feedback loop between the banking sector, sovereign debt and the real economy. There are two dimensions to this feedback loop problem: procyclicality – or the interaction between bank lending and the real economy – and backstop burdens – or the interaction between bank recapitalisation and sovereign debt sustainability. Procyclicality is the phenomenon by which banking capital rules exacerbate the business cycle by encouraging lending at a time of growth or contracting it in a time of recession. Basel 3 aims to build up a countercyclical buffer to lean against the wind in good times and be eased to help growth in bad times. We are evidently in bad times now, so intriguingly this has prompted some to consider whether you should in fact be starting to release the buffer. Indeed, you could probably run the Basel countercyclical buffer methodology with some plausible assumptions and get to the conclusion that for many countries we are well past the point where the buffer would be released. The problem, of course, is that the buffer is not in place to be eased and, indeed, that there is still a further strengthening of capital required under Basel 3. In addition, market expectations are for more capital faster. Where they can, banks are responding by racing to meet the new Basel standard well ahead of the five year 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches transitional period. In this respect, what the regulator has given – a transitional period to ease the impact of the new rules – the market has taken away. A fair minded regulator should acknowledge that was a concern identified by industry some time ago. All these considerations led the EBA to be very careful in design of the buffer in two respects. We made it clear that in calculating the capital buffer the determination of sovereign debt exposure would be fixed at one point in time, so there was no advantage and therefore incentive to dispose of sovereign debt holdings. And we provided tight guidelines limiting the capacity of banks to meet the capital requirement through deleveraging activity – reducing lending – that would hurt the real economy. We have now seen the banks’ plans to meet the EBA’s aggregate €115 billion requirement. The assessment is encouraging, with banks’ providing a margin for error, with very limited deleveraging planned and with overwhelmingly most of the required minimum met by new capital rather than reduced assets. However, EBA will of course monitor developments very closely. Where should we go next in terms of policy responses? The European banking regulators’ room for manoeuvre is in fact very constrained by the two dimensions of the negative feedback loop problem. The central dilemma is that for microprudential regulators more capital is a good thing – but that from a macroprudential perspective there is a concern about how fast to get that and at what cost. Perhaps the safest course of action, then, is for a breathing space in terms of further initiatives on the capital front. The EBA’s decision to postpone its next stress test exercise into 2013 is therefore a sensible development. There is also an argument for breathing space to let the political decisions on the sovereign debt crisis be fully implemented, both with respect to fiscal discipline and to building a firewall with adequate resources and sufficient operational flexibility. Indeed, if this does happen, and has a sustained positive impact, it could eventually give scope to the EBA to revisit the necessity for the full scale of the current capital buffer. I would like to see that we use this breathing space wisely to consider the future design of stress tests and the operational flexibility of firewall structures. It seems that the role of the stress test as a diagnostic tool needs to be reasserted. Recent EU stress tests have evolved into what might be described as a “capital shortfall” calculation: setting a single scenario and a specially created threshold to effectively prescribe additional capital even where not required by EU law or Basel rules. Interestingly, the US stress tests are now focused on dividend and share repurchase approval rather than closing a capital gap in a prescribed timeline. The EU stress test approach therefore is in addition to – and potentially cuts across – the new Basel 3 minimum capital requirements which are coming in anyway. Also, I fear that trying to satisfy insatiable market expectations of conservatism in a stress test risks being very procyclical. Stress tests were originally conceived as diagnostic tools, considering a range of scenarios and providing the basis for management and supervisory judgement, rather than as an automatic capital formula. Given that the introduction of Basel 3 already requires increased capital and in light of the changing balance of risks of procyclical regulatory action, it would be sensible to recalibrate the European approach to stress testing in the next period.  What about the second negative feedback problem that I mentioned, which might be described as “backstop burdens”. The problem here is if countries with sovereign debt concerns need to borrow more to recapitalise their banks, which harms their debt sustainability and therefore exacerbates the euro crisis, impacting the real economy and feeding back to the banks. A former US Treasury Secretary colourfully spoke of the need for a bazooka – a big gun – to sort out the crisis, by which he meant using a vast amount of money to convince markets the problem has been solved. But for countries with debt problems, they need to borrow more to afford the ammunition for the bazooka and their debt sustainability position gets worse. The room for manoeuver for ever tougher capital 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 standards is therefore constrained. In this respect, the feedback loop will only be broken by investment, rather than borrowing, from outside the loop. Thus, while the debate around firewall structures is normally about the sensitive issue of size, I would suggest that having sufficient operational flexibility in any new mechanism is an equally important objective. Finding mechanisms for investment in banking systems without adding to sovereign debt must surely be a desirable policy goal to be considered carefully. This might be done through European firewall mechanisms or other structures. I was interested in the reported comments of Hans-Peter Keitel, president of the Federation of German Industries, about the benefits of investment in (rather than more loans to) debtor countries such as Greece. This seems a sensible initiative to be developed. Investment in stressed banking systems would help break the feedback loop and provide commercial opportunities at the same time. Let me conclude by once again acknowledging the good work done by the European Banking Authority in the current crisis. But let us also recognise the limits of further action on regulatory capital to address the crisis. We should use a breathing space to refine the policy instruments at hand in a way that can help break the feedback loop that is doing so much damage to all the member states of the Eurozone. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Benoît Cœuré: The monetary policy of the European Central Bank Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at Barclays’ European Conference, Tokyo, 26 March 2012. *      *      * Introduction It is my pleasure to be here at Barclays’ European Conference in Tokyo.  Today I would like to provide a simple yet comprehensive description of the ECB’s actions during the crisis. Faced with severe turbulence, all central banks had to take measures in real time and switch from central banking in “standard operating mode” to “risk control and crisis management” mode. We did so by keeping an eye fixed on our objective. This helped us to stay on course and provided continuity. I will start by presenting a simplistic model of monetary policy transmission. This is the sequence of events through which central banks’ decisions transmit to economic magnitudes which have an impact on people’s welfare. I will then review the effectiveness of ECB’s monetary policy prior to the financial crisis, when the transmission mechanism was functioning according to the textbook definitions. This period was tranquil, economically speaking, although macroeconomic imbalances were quietly building up beneath the surface.  I will then portray the crisis as a creating a break in the transmission mechanism. The crisis however was more than that: at some point we all feared that the whole financial system would stop functioning. But I will analyse it from the perspective of its implications for the chain of events on which monetary policy action depends. Here, I will argue that the standard tool of central banks – changes to the short-term interest rate – can lose some of its potency if the sudden unravelling of imbalances threatens financial stability and impairs the transmission mechanism. But I will also claim that new untested instruments were deployed which largely replaced standard monetary policy interventions. This is perhaps the most relevant lesson we can draw from the crisis. Monetary policy transmission  Let me briefly elaborate on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. You can see here on slide 2 why the monetary transmission mechanism is so important for central banks. The ECB has a statutory objective of price stability, which has been defined as a year-on-year positive inflation rate below 2%. Within that range, the Governing Council aims at an inflation rate not too far from 2%. We say: “an inflation rate below, but close to, 2%”. However, in order to exert an influence on agents’ decisions which affect prices and inflation, the ECB has to start from the top of this chart and try to reach out to the bottom. The path that connects the two extremes – starting from the policy interest rate that the ECB controls through its monetary policy operations – is long and convoluted. This is the transmission mechanism: a long and uncertain chain of events during which various asset prices react to actions taken by the ECB – on the top layer of decisions in this chart – to change the overnight rate at which banks lend to each other in the money market.  Long-term interest rates form important links in this chain. Aggregate demand is a function of credit market conditions, and credit market conditions are a function of medium to long-term interest rates: interest rates on mortgages, on non-financial corporations’ loans funding long-term investment projects, and so on. The interest rate channel of monetary policy is the specific transmission path – marked in orange – that starts from the overnight rate that the ECB can manipulate by its policy operations; it works by way of long-term rates.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The first equation on my next slide [3] describes how long-term interest rates and the overnight rate are connected. Long-term rates ( iLt) reflect the average expected overnight rate set by monetary policy (which is indicated by itMP) plus a premium to reward long-term investment and lenders’ exposure to uncertainty ( prt).  To influence long-term interest rates the central bank has two levers. These levers correspond to the two terms on the right-hand side of equation (1). The first term in parentheses denotes the component of the long-term interest rates that is determined by the expectations of the policy rate. Basic arbitrage conditions ensure that the financial reward on a long-dated security today ( iLt) is at least as large as the average of the financial return that investors can expect to reap by holding a short-dated security and rolling it over for as many periods as the maturity of the long-dated security.  The central bank can act on those expectations. It can do so by anchoring the current and future policy rate at levels that – if solidly incorporated in agents’ expectations – can be conducive to price stability. This is the central bank’s first lever on the transmission process. The way the central bank can influence expectations of its policy behaviour in the face of macroeconomic shocks is critical here. It works through the credibility of the central bank’s governance and through the way in which the central bank is seen – month after month – reacting systematically to the changing economy. In this way, agents start internalising this systematic behaviour in their expectations. But this process – easy as it sounds – is in fact very complex and reversible.  No policy rule or macro-model can do justice to the complexity of these interactions. So, it is only for the sake of clarity that I am using the stylised policy rule stated in equation number two on my slide. According to this simplistic representation, the central bank changes the overnight policy interest rate by considering two conditions. First, it considers whether inflation is expected to be in line with levels consistent with its quantitative definition of price stability. Here the term (E tπ t+1 – π*) denotes the difference between expected inflation and its steady state value, in our case below but close to 2%: if inflation expectations exceed the objective, the central bank – all other things being equal – is likely to raise its policy rate. A second factor that influences the policy stance is monetary conditions. If the volume of money and credit that is created by financial intermediaries exceeds a trend that is consistent with price stability in the long run, the central bank is also expected to increase its policy rate, because excess money and credit creation can herald risks to price stability. In this simple policy rule, excess money and credit growth is denoted by mt. The coefficients α and λ capture the strength of the central bank’s reaction. This is of course a simplified model and a full representation of the ECB decision-making should include a broad set of variables which are leading indicators of future inflation. If consistently followed through, a policy behaviour that – as in this rule – resists inflationary pressures and counters exuberance in the monetary sector can anchor expectations of inflation and, through that channel, of the future path of the policy rate. Ultimately, this anchoring contributes to low and steady long-term rates.  I mentioned the risk premium. The second lever that central banks can operate to try to influence the long-term rates is via the risk premium, prt. Now, the risk premium itself can be decomposed into three elements, as stated in the third equation on my slide. Two elements reflect macroeconomic uncertainty – as measured by the variance of inflation and the variance of real economic activity. If the variance of inflation and the variance of real growth are large, the quantum of macroeconomic uncertainty is high, and lenders will charge a higher premium on long-term finance as a remuneration for their risk.  The quantum of macroeconomic uncertainty that the premium compensates for can be influenced by the central bank. By avoiding erratic behaviour – again, by following a steady and predictable pattern of reaction to the evolving state of the economy – the central bank can push volatility out of the system and contribute to a lower premium.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 But the premium includes a third element which is beyond the control of the central bank. I’m calling this component “d”, because it is associated with credit default risk. But I’ll leave the “d” factor aside for now and I will come back to it at the end. Measures of performance  How well has the ECB managed the transmission mechanism and the macroeconomy? Since the inception of the single currency the ECB has fulfilled its price stability mandate. Taking the long-term average as a performance indicator, inflation rates in the euro area have been on average a few basis points above 2%. You can see their exact evolution over time on this slide [4]. The slight overshoot relative to our aim – close to, but below, 2% – is due to the recent renewed pressures on volatile components of the price basket. It certainly remains within the strictest tolerance bands.  Simultaneously, the ECB has managed to compress the volatility of inflation in the euro area. Slide 5 shows a breakdown of the volatility of headline inflation into the volatility of core inflation which central banks can influence over the medium term – the solid yellow bars – and the volatility of food and energy prices – in blue and grey respectively. The left-hand chart indicates the results for the euro area. You see that since the launch of the euro, overall inflation volatility has decreased despite a substantial increase in energy and food price volatility. During the same period of time, inflation volatility in the US has actually increased, as the drop in core inflation volatility was not offset by the surge in the variance introduced by energy inflation.  Did systematic compression of inflation volatility come at the price of more erratic real activity? Let me move on to my next slide [6]. Here, each dot represents a major economy: it gives information on the standard deviation of inflation and the standard deviation of output growth which each economy has experienced since 1999. In this space, you want to be as close as possible to zero. Why? Because the lower-left part of the chart is populated by economies with low macroeconomic instability, i.e. low inflation volatility and low growth volatility. Indeed, you can see that the euro area has been closer to zero than any other economy except one, Switzerland – the dot to its left. The low variance of inflation rates in the euro area did not come at the expense of unsteady economic growth.  Low macroeconomic volatility has meant lower long-term interest rates and lower inflation compensation in financial contracts. My next slide [7] illustrates a standard technique to disentangle long-term euro area bond yields into premia remunerating investors for the risks they bear on long-dated securities.1 Two facts are noteworthy. The first fact is a steep decline – since pre-monetary union times – in the nominal yield paid on average by euro area governments to borrow at a ten-year maturity. This is the blue line in the chart. The second fact is that such a steep fall in ten-year yields has resulted from the three components which determine nominal interest rates: the real rate, the inflation expectation – which compensates investors for the average expected inflation over the life of the security – and the inflation risk premium – which compensates investors for inflation volatility. The real rate is the red line, and the two risk premia are visible as wedges between the nominal and the real rate. Borrowing money in the euro area is cheaper today – in real and nominal terms – than it was a decade and a half ago, and the lower cost of borrowing is largely related to a less uncertain and a more predictable macroeconomy.  The euro area has been a stable economy, not a static one. My next slide [8] shows the real per capita income progression of the euro area and the US since 1999. Contrary to long-standing beliefs, the euro area’s dynamism has not lagged that of the US.                                                  1 See García, J.A. and T. Werner (2010), “Inflation risks and inflation risk premia,” ECB Working Paper No 1162. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches I would conclude that the euro and its guardian, the ECB, have made a solid contribution to low and stable borrowing conditions, and – through that channel – to moderate fluctuations and economic prosperity. The data that I have shown you are in fact even more noteworthy, since they cover the long and difficult upheaval suffered by financial markets after the demise of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008.  I would now like to consider that particular period.  The first phase of the crisis  The financial panic that followed Lehman’s collapse undermined the ability of markets to price financial assets. The resulting turmoil disrupted the mechanism which, in normal times, central banks use to transmit policy signals to the broader economy. The interest rate channel ceased operating (see slide [9]). The impact of our policy rate on the interest paid on securities of different maturities via expectations control was weakened: this is visible in the left-hand chart on this slide [10]. The euro area money market froze – as shown by the surge of the cross-sectional standard deviation of overnight rates across Member States. (See the right-hand chart on slide 10). Banks located in different jurisdictions could no longer obtain liquidity on the unsecured money market at comparable costs. Likewise, parts of the euro area banking system had problems obtaining long-term funding on the financial markets. Slide 11 shows the results of the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey for 2008. Throughout 2008, but increasingly as the year elapsed, banks reported difficulties accessing the wholesale market for virtually all maturities, with the very short-term money market being less affected.  To address downside risks to price stability, the ECB responded to the shock with a forceful application of its standard policy tool, as did many other central banks. We reduced policy rates to an all-time low of 1%. (See slide 12). At the same time, the disappearance of market arbitrage was a challenge that interest rate action could not tackle in full. We therefore started acting as market makers and we played an intermediation role which the market was unwilling or unable to perform. We tried to get round the obstructions facing the standard transmission mechanism by following a new route, the liquidity channel. (See slide 13). It worked by being a confidence-boosting measure: enough central bank liquidity would be forthcoming in case market liquidity dried up. Our system – centred on overnight and term credit to banks, rather than outright purchases of securities – was tailor-made to be used as an instrument to fend off a banking crisis. In the event, it was flexible enough to be activated, with only limited adjustments, in emergency conditions. We had to tackle the collapse of private arbitrage, which meant that the market could not distribute liquidity across institutions and over time. This was the rationale for two main features of our extraordinary credit support. The full, unlimited accommodation of banks’ demands for central bank credit at our policy interest rate stepped into the breach when inter-bank lending collapsed. The extension of central bank credit provision to longer maturities, up to one year in June 2009, replaced market inter-temporal trading, which had largely disappeared. (See slide 14). Important for the design was the structure of euro area, where small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important for growth and job creation and banks provide most of the financing. The importance of banks in the flow of credit to the real economy in the euro area can be seen here (slide 15). Fully accommodating the overall higher liquidity needs of banks and alleviating bank funding stress is, therefore, essential to support the wider economy. Equally important for the design is the institutional set-up of euro area – comprising 17 sovereign states sharing a single currency. Offering unlimited liquidity at the discretion of banks makes it possible to target exactly those parts of the banking system which are subject to particularly high funding stress. This, in turn, contributes to a uniform 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 cross-border transmission so that households and businesses throughout the euro area enjoy credit conditions that are largely homogeneous.  The impact of this action is evident here [slide 16]; it shows the Eurosystem balance sheet as a consequence of the increased lending assistance to our counterparties. As you can see, actual liquidity demand exceeded the levels necessary for minimum reserve requirement purposes: look at the significant volumes of cash deposited overnight with the ECB by counterparties on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.  The measures stabilised the economy. Slide 17 depicts the economy’s plunge after the Lehman shock, with the bell-shaped distributions of market forecasts for the year 2009 GDP growth rates revised downward from one update to the next by a few annual percentage points.2 This was an unprecedented experience for the ECB and for the national central banks. From the second half of 2009, growth prospects resumed and macroeconomic uncertainty – measured by the dispersion of those forecast distributions – declined significantly. The densities become “thinner” as a larger probability mass concentrates around the mean, while the mean growth forecast itself turns positive.  The second phase of the crisis  As I mentioned already, the “d” factor is the loose end in the transmission mechanism. It is an important determinant of long-term interest rates. But it is not controlled by the central bank. (See slide 18).  Between October 2009 and May 2010 the “d” factor – which had remained dormant for a long time after monetary union – became destabilised. Fiscal sustainability concerns exacerbated credit risk perceptions and prompted investors to seek higher credit risk compensation. The debt markets of sovereign issuers in precarious fiscal conditions found themselves under attack. Starting in the summer of 2011, market distress spread more broadly. In the end, a massive credit risk re-appreciation took place which affected bank and non-bank borrowing with pervasive effects on the viability of the transmission mechanism. Banks’ creditworthiness as measured via CDS premia correlated strongly with their lending to countries under stress (See slide 19, left-hand chart). At times, this correlation was reinforced by the perception that governments bore significant contingent liabilities linked to “too-big-to-fail” financial institutions. In response to stressed funding conditions and in anticipation of a worsening macroeconomic outlook, banks tightened credit supply standards sharply.3 (See slide 19, right-hand chart).  Once more, private financial intermediation was threatened. In the money market, confidence was rapidly draining away and trades were becoming rare. The market for government paper was seriously impaired. It was against this background that, in May 2010, the ECB announced its intervention in debt markets. As our focus in that phase was to preserve normal conditions for asset pricing in the markets for securities, we called our policy the “Securities Markets Programme”. Among fixed-income securities, government bonds are very important for three reasons. First, low liquidity and uncertain prices for government bonds have a degrading effect on the value and acceptability of collateral which is used in secured finance. The growing role of secured lending in financial markets means that financial intermediation would suffer enormously from any paralysis in sovereign bond transactions. Second, sharply lower bond prices can cause significant losses in the portfolios of financial and non-financial institutions.                                                  2 Forecasts were based on different vintages of Eurozone barometer forecast results. 3 See ECB Bank Lending Surveys for October 2011 and January 2012, http://www.ecb.int/stats/money/surveys/  lend/html/index.en.html 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches For banks, this would reduce their ability to provide loans to the economy. Third, interest rates on government bonds influence the level of interest rates that firms have to pay when issuing their bonds and that banks use to price their loans. Government bond yields are the basis for the pricing of all assets, from fixed-income instruments to equity.  The decision to intervene was a decision to support the discovery of prices in markets which are key to transmitting our policy intentions and which had become highly dysfunctional.  As tensions grew in the summer and autumn of 2011, we strengthened our response further. (See slide 20). In our first three-year longer-term refinancing operation in December last year we provided around €489 billion of stable funding to 523 banks in the euro area. In the second one – conducted on 29 February this year – we supplied €530 billion to 800 banks. Both long-term credit operations aimed to break a vicious circle in which sovereign funding stress impedes bank access to longer-term financing and ultimately disrupts the flow of credit to households and companies. It’s worth noting that the second operation reached a much wider group of banks – among them many small banks providing funds specifically to small and medium-sized enterprises. Its effect was heightened by an expanded range of collateral, which particularly facilitated the participation of small and medium-sized banks. Importantly, risks related to the expansion of collateral have been mitigated by stringent risk control measures. For instance, the haircuts on additional credit claims are very high so as to make the riskiness of these additional credit claims about the same as that of the rest of the collateral, for which the haircuts are lower. We are confident that wider participation by banks can lead to a broader dissemination of credit to small and medium-sized borrowers.  The right half of this picture shows the impact of the new measures on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet. (See slide 21).  At present, we are seeing some encouraging, albeit early, signs of normalisation across financial market segments. Broad money growth increased in January, as did loan growth to private sectors. We are also seeing lower stock market volatility (slide 22, left-hand chart). Money market credit spreads have edged lower recently (slide 22, right-hand chart). Similarly, corporate bond credit spreads for both financial and non-financial enterprises have decreased (slide 23). These developments remain to be confirmed and we are closely monitoring them. I want to stress one important principle which has guided us consistently, particularly over the second phase of the crisis. We did not try to influence the “d” factor: we could not possibly have done so. The “d” factor originates elsewhere, outside the monetary policy sphere of influence. It is not the role of the ECB to cure the root cause of the malaise: weak fiscal institutions and concerns about fiscal sustainability, reinforced by diverging competitiveness among euro area countries and low growth potential in a wide range of countries due to delayed structural reforms. Monetary policy is not and cannot be a substitute for sustainable fiscal policies, structural reforms and adequate governance. These policies are indeed in the remit of governments.  Governments did not remain inactive – they have contributed to the normalisation. Some of them have taken important steps towards addressing the root cause of market malfunctioning. Collectively, at euro area level, several initiatives are under way or have been implemented. I would like to mention only the most recent ones regarding euro area governance. The so-called “six-pack” introduces a macroeconomic surveillance procedure which will detect and correct divergences at an early stage. Fiscal surveillance has been strengthened and procedures for correction have been made more automatic and dependable. A so-called “fiscal compact” will introduce fiscal rules in binding national legislation. In the pipeline is the so-called “two-pack” that is expected to strengthen surveillance mechanisms in the euro area even further and might become the first step towards a fully-fledged fiscal union. Fiscal federations impose strict controls on regional budgets and on this basis – and only on those conditions – they build mechanisms for cross-regional financial solidarity. This is the route that euro area governments are following now. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Structural reforms promoting growth and job creation will ease pressure on government finance. Similarly – as recommended by the European Banking Authority – the build-up of capital buffers by banks will reassure markets of the resilience of the banking system and create the conditions for a more stable financial industry in Europe. Stronger fiscal institutions combined with reforms boosting the long-term growth and competitiveness of euro area economies and a more resilient banking system are the right way to address the “d” factor.  The overarching principles guiding monetary policy Knowing that monetary policy does not cure structural economic malaise is one of the overarching principles guiding central banks. Equally important are price stability – as a clear overriding objective – as well as central bank independence and credibility. Let me elaborate on these principles and on how they have supported the ECB’s monetary policy in recent times.  Independence is essential for central banks, particularly in periods of sovereign funding stress. Whenever state finances are unsustainable, the likelihood of governments exerting pressure on central banks to monetise their debts increases. In a monetary union founded on monetary independence and a clear mandate for the central bank, this temptation is ruled out. In such a union, shocks to the "d" factor can even have desirable collateral effects. They can provide incentives to sovereigns to pursue sustainable state finances and to undertake the necessary structural reforms. Switching this mechanism off would weaken incentives to conduct the right economic policies.  Monetary policy committed to price stability and conducted independently and credibly will not only deliver low inflation rates but also contribute to financial stability. I deliberately use the word “contribute” as price stability is a necessary but insufficient condition for financial stability. Financial stability is the joint outcome of:   sound prudential regulation, supervision and oversight of financial intermediaries, financial markets and financial market infrastructures, and of  sound macroeconomic policies – comprising monetary policy and fiscal policy.  Nevertheless, its contribution to financial stability can be significant. In particular, a timely exit from non-standard measures and a return to a less accommodative policy stance – once the economic conditions are ripe – are essential for several reasons. First, because monetary policy accommodation for prolonged periods of time might fuel excessive risk-taking, leverage and asset price bubbles. Second, it might discourage banks, companies and governments from strengthening their balance sheets and therefore create a dependence on low rates. Let me develop here how exit can take place. All the ECB’s crisis-response measures involving liquidity provision over long horizons share an important feature: credit is granted at a low but adjustable rate. We have already been explicit about the fact that the exact interest rate on long-term liquidity will be determined ex post, and be equal to the average policy rate prevailing over the life of the respective open market operation. We have also given banks the option of reversing the long-term repurchase operation in advance, after one year, if the conditions that had warranted the long maturity of central bank credit are no longer in place. In any case, we can withdraw the ample liquidity created as a side effect of the long-term operation whenever the Governing Council deems liquidity conditions are excessive in view of the outlook for price stability. All the tools necessary for large-scale liquidity withdrawal are already in place or will be readily available when needed. This is consistent with our monetary policy strategy. It emphasises the monitoring of monetary and credit developments, which are linked to both financial imbalances and threats to price stability over longer horizons. It ensures a more symmetric policy with respect to 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches financial misalignments and some “leaning against the wind” if monetary trends signal inflationary pressures over and beyond what standard conjunctural analysis and macroeconomic projects imply.4  Conclusion In conclusion, I return to where I started: the transmission mechanism and how a stability-oriented strategy can influence its multiple paths (see slide 24). The most important link in the long chain is the monetary policy strategy. Clarity about the objective and about the key indicators can anchor expectations and empower monetary policy decisions. As you know, adjustments to expectations can amplify any action taken by a credible central bank.  Our strategy has supported this mechanism in normal times. In crisis times, as markets ceased to transmit price signals, our tools had to change. The Eurosystem’s response has been timely; all non-standard measures have been temporary and tailored to the special features of the euro area. Our tools have changed but our strategy has not – it is in fact supporting a gradual process of normalisation.  The euro area is an economic and monetary union (EMU). Its monetary pillar has performed well so far and will continue its work in the future. The economic pillar is now being considerably strengthened. The new fiscal framework should now be promptly ratified and forcefully implemented under the leadership of the European Commission; as a complement, growth initiatives will be welcome, insofar as they address the long-term growth potential.                                                    4 See Fahr, S., R.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 William C Dudley: Reforming the OTC derivatives market Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Harvard Law School’s Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century, Armonk, New York, 19 March 2012. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here. Today I will focus on two related aspects of the regulatory reform agenda that are complex and global in nature. First, I will discuss the efforts underway to reform the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. This includes creating strong incentives to standardize trades and clear those trades through central counterparties (CCPs) and improving disclosure and transparency through mandatory reporting of all OTC derivative trades to trade repositories. Second, I will discuss the global program to establish tougher standards for the regulation and oversight of financial market infrastructures (FMI) – focusing particularly on CCPs for over-the-counter derivatives. Over the past two years, two important standard setting bodies – the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have been developing a new package of standards called, Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. The aim is to strengthen the resiliency and robustness of FMIs that are systemically important and are the backbone of the global financial system. I anticipate that the approval process will be completed and the finalized Principles document will be issued and broadly distributed sometime next month. As always, what I have to say here reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. Also, I speak for myself rather than for CPSS and IOSCO. Turning to my first topic, the financial crisis exposed many shortcomings with respect to the OTC derivatives market. For example, the use of OTC derivatives referencing private-label mortgage-backed securities that held poor quality subprime and alt-A mortgages multiplied the amount of gains and losses in the financial system. There were not only the losses on the actual mortgages, but also on the CDS that were linked to these mortgages through the OTC derivatives market. This increased the stress on the system when the referenced subprime and alt-A mortgages began to perform poorly. Moreover, the structural characteristics of the over-the-counter derivatives market itself amplified the shocks created by the housing bust in several ways. First, the collateral calls generated by sharp movements in the mark-to-market value of the OTC derivative trades drained liquidity buffers and provoked the fire sales of assets. These fire sales increased volatility and provoked still greater margin calls. This dynamic was one reason why the market prices of these assets overshot to the downside – that is they fell more than needed simply to reflect the increase in expected credit losses. In other words, the illiquidity risk premiums embedded into the prices of these assets became very large. Second, the bilateral nature of the OTC derivatives market – between the two parties to the contract – be it dealer and customer or dealer and dealer – created its own set of difficulties. When counterparties became concerned about the health of a particular dealer, they often moved their trades – via novation – to other dealers. They did this to protect themselves should the dealer subsequently fail. But this process was difficult to carry out quickly and in size. The cumbersome nature of the process disturbed market liquidity and function. It also tended to drain off the liquidity from the troubled dealers because these dealers often used the counterparty cash collateral to fund their own operations. When customers moved their 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches business, the collateral balances departed with them and this worsened the funding crunch on the troubled dealers. Third, when a large counterparty, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, it could no longer meet its obligations. The claims of Lehman’s customers, including those open OTC derivatives positions in which Lehman owed them money, were frozen. The lack of adequate segregation of the customers’ assets from the Lehman estate and the inability to move the outstanding obligations to other dealers – which we refer to as the lack  of portability – created large problems for Lehman’s counterparties. Often Lehman’s clients were in the position that one side of a trade executed with Lehman was frozen, but the offsetting side remained open and exposed to volatile financial markets. This asymmetry contributed to the sharp increase in market volatility, the dramatic reduction in market liquidity, and the impairment in market function following the Lehman failure. Fear that this could happen again if another firm failed, encouraged flight from other dealers perceived by market participants to be relatively weak that might have large potential exposures. Of course, as if this were not bad enough, the opaqueness of the OTC derivatives market made the situation much worse. No one had a clear insight into the financial health of their counterparties. Although each market participant could calculate its bilateral exposures to a particular dealer and the particular dealer could understand its own exposure to each of its own counterparties, this didn’t answer the broader question: how exposed were the clients and dealers to others in the financial system through their derivatives trades and other open positions? Because there was no easy way to know who was in difficulty or not, the incentives were all on the side of assuming the worse – closing out open trades, hoarding liquidity, and retreating to the sidelines. The crisis had made it crystal clear that the regulatory regime had not kept pace with the rapid growth of the global OTC derivatives market. In assessing the shortcomings of the OTC derivatives market after the crisis, a global consensus has been reached. Although I will be over-simplifying in the interest of time, I view the following aspects of reform as the most important. First, there have to be strong incentives in the system – such as capital requirements on banks and securities dealers – to provide an impetus for dealers to standardize OTC derivatives trades whenever practical. The goal is fewer bespoke trades and more standardized trades. Second, the G20 leaders agreed that all standardized OTC derivative trades should be mandatorily cleared through CCPs by the end of 2012. Third, records for all OTC derivative trades – including bilateral bespoke trades – must be reported to trade repositories. The data as part of this reporting requirement would include key trade attributes and a legal entity identifier so that aggregate exposures could be readily calculated. Fourth, the two standard-setting bodies mentioned earlier – CPSS and IOSCO – would strengthen and broaden the principles for financial market infrastructures. Fifth, these Principles would be adopted globally, strengthening the resilience of the financial system. The logic behind these five elements of reform goes like this: Standardizing trades improves transparency and price discovery. This mitigates the opaqueness that helped to generate the illiquidity and loss of market function evident during the crisis. Requiring that such trades be cleared through CCPs is designed to reduce the aggregate amount of risk in the system. That is because the gross exposures can be netted down when all the dealers clear through one common central clearing party. In a CCP framework, the bilateral exposures of each dealer to one another are replaced by a single set of claims to and from the CCP. The idea is that because some dealers are likely to be long some trades to one dealer and short some trades to other dealers, passing both sets of trades through a single CCP can reduce the aggregate amount of risk in the system. This would occur as the long trades are netted out against the short trades, leaving only the remaining smaller net exposure of the dealer to the CCP. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Inserting a CCP in between two counterparties to a trade can also help reduce the “run risk” faced by a potentially troubled dealer. As we saw during the crisis, market participants often abruptly pull their trades away from a dealer that they perceive to be weak, which in turn can have the self-fulfilling effect of magnifying market or liquidity pressures on the dealer. If, however, trades with the dealer are cleared through a CCP, direct exposures to the dealer are eliminated and replaced by exposures to the CCP itself. This risk shifting can reduce the incentives to suddenly halt trading with a dealer, for example, due to uncertainty about the dealer’s financial condition or future prospects. Mandatory reporting of trades to trade repositories is designed to ensure that the details of each contract are preserved and available to the regulatory authorities. Finally, the fact that CCPs will be central to the system dramatically increases their importance. In essence, global CCPs will be systemically important. Thus, for the system to be safer it is not sufficient to ensure that trades are standardized and that they are mandated to be cleared through CCPs, but also it is necessary that CCPs be “bullet proof.” They have to have the ability to perform and meet their obligations regardless of the degree of stress in the financial system and even if one or more of their participants were to fail in a disorderly manner. Hence, there is a compelling need for tougher principles that are broadly enforced. In addition, to ensure that this all works as well in practice as in theory, the Financial Stability Board, CPSS and IOSCO, and other regulatory authorities have emphasized the importance of four safeguards to ensure that mandatory, standardized clearing through CCPs will make the financial system more robust and resilient. The first safeguard is that the oversight of global CCPs needs to be cooperative – involving the securities regulators and central banks in the country in which the CCP operates (the home country) and the countries for which the CCP may be systemically important. Global CCPs are likely to be established – some are already up and running – that will clear different types of OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, or commodity-based swaps that are traded around the world, both solely within one country or on a cross-border basis. Many regulators have important stakes in ensuring that a global CCP can meet its obligations. In addition to regulators of the country in which the CCP is headquartered, these include foreign regulators. These regulators may be interested parties for many reasons. For example, their currencies may be used in settling the obligations of the CCP, they may have counterparties to the CCP that are headquartered or do significant amounts of business in their country, or they may have FMIs that are linked to the CCP. I want to emphasize that effective cooperative oversight is essential. Otherwise, the risk is that the system will become overly fragmented, with a proliferation of national CCPs. In this case, many of the risk-reducing benefits from CCPs could be lost or severely attenuated. That is because fewer offsetting positions would likely be cleared through any particular CCP and this would reduce the scope for reducing large gross exposures into much smaller net positions. The second safeguard is to ensure fair, open and safe access to global FMIs around the world. It is important, for example, that global CCPs have rules that are not exclusionary or that unnecessarily entrench the position of whatever dealer, firm, or FMI is currently dominant in the market. The third safeguard is to establish rules to ensure that, if a major market participant were to fail, a CCP can liquefy its collateral quickly so that it can meet its obligations in a timely way. But this also needs to be done in a way that would not disrupt financial markets or the CCP’s participants. As I will discuss shortly, although there may be a potential role for central banks here, CCPs, at a minimum, must have their own liquidity resources as the first line of defense. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Fourth, there needs to be a viable resolution regime for CCPs. This is needed to ensure that the CCP either can be recapitalized and recover or, if necessary, wound down in an orderly way without disrupting the provision of essential market services. Also, a resolution regime is necessary to ensure that a central bank that might lend to a CCP in extremis will be repaid. To help ensure that these safeguards are met, a major part of the reform effort is to establish a strong set of principles for financial market infrastructures. These principles must embody the four safeguards and ensure that the infrastructure can withstand any stresses that could plausibly occur. The process of developing such a set of principles began about two years ago and is now nearing completion. So why the new principles and what do they embody? During the crisis, financial market infrastructures performed very well. In fact, FMIs were actually a source of strength. They enabled market participants to settle obligations when they came due in a timely way. Also, their robustness gave confidence to market participants that they could continue to trade, knowing that the transactions would almost certainly be settled and cleared without difficulty. Despite this excellent record of performance during a period of unprecedented stress, there still is room for improvement. First, future stresses could be more severe or might come in different forms. This could expose vulnerabilities in FMIs that have, up to now, not been visible. Also, extraordinary interventions in the crisis to backstop market function or rescue key financial intermediaries may have prevented the stress level from reaching the point where FMIs couldn’t perform their functions. Because there can be no assurance that such interventions will necessarily occur in the future, it is important that the stability of the FMI architecture not depend on timely extraordinary interventions. Second, under the new regime of central clearing for standardized OTC derivatives trades, the role of FMIs will become even more important in the future. Moreover, the new regime will lead to the development of new types of FMIs. CCPs for OTC derivatives will become widespread – and trade repositories will be established. Principles are needed to underpin these new institutional arrangements. Third, for FMIs to be resilient they would undoubtedly need to have some ability to access central bank services, including the lender of last resort function. But, if FMIs had access to such services, this would create moral hazard. The best way to address this conundrum is to hold the FMIs to tougher global standards. Fourth, a stronger and better system of FMI governance and oversight can help to ensure that those systems that support a global market are subject to consistent standards regardless of the jurisdiction where they operate. Relying solely on a patchwork of differing national standards in a global world would not work well. It would encourage business to migrate to the lowest standard. Without establishing a global floor, there would otherwise be a “race for the bottom.” These are the major reasons why CPSS and IOSCO took on the task of strengthening and broadening the standards for FMIs. There are two major goals of this effort. The first goal is to strengthen the current standards by: 1) raising the bar for existing standards such as for governance, credit risk, liquidity risk, collateral and margin requirements; 2) including requirements for new areas such as segregation and portability, general business risk, links, tiering and disclosure; and 3) extending coverage to include trade repositories. As proposed in the consultation document, the Principles will significantly strengthen existing requirements for an FMI’s governance and financial resources. One way the Principles do this is by requiring FMIs to take a more comprehensive and proactive view of the roles they play, the risks they face, and their potential to support the stability of the broader financial system. In particular, as markets become even more interconnected, FMIs must approach 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 their governance and risk management more holistically, in a manner consistent with their growing importance to the global markets and the stakeholders that they serve. Regarding an FMI’s financial standards, it is important that they be prepared to handle even greater potential disruptions and more extreme market conditions. For example, while an FMI must cover its largest current credit exposure to any single participant under pre-crisis standards, the Principles would require an FMI to collateralize its current credit exposures to all of its participants. Furthermore, for CCPs that face potential future credit exposures from the open contracts that they guarantee, the Principles impose rigorous stress testing and strengthened margin and default fund requirements. These requirements are to guard against a wide range of possible stress scenarios in extreme but plausible market conditions. The Principles also raise the bar for an FMI’s management of liquidity risk to ensure that systemically important payment obligations can be settled on time. For instance, when sizing its potential liquidity needs in the event of a participant default, an FMI should have sufficient liquid resources to cover not only the shortfall caused by the default of the individual legal entity that settles directly through the FMI, but also the shortfall that could arise from the failure of all affiliates of the direct participant. In addition, FMIs will need to address how potential uncovered liquidity shortfalls or credit losses would be allocated, and how the FMI would replenish any financial resources it uses in a stress event so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner. The Principles also introduce a number of new requirements. Some of these address shortcomings that were observed during the crisis. For example, the Principles require CCPs to have segregation and portability arrangements that protect customer positions and collateral. An FMI will also be required to manage the risks it bears from and poses to, not only its participants and their customers, but also to other entities with which it does business such as linked FMIs, settlement banks, custody banks, and liquidity providers. Furthermore, the Principles will require FMIs to establish a dedicated financial cushion that could absorb unanticipated general business losses. This is to ensure that an FMI can continue to provide its critical services. The Principles also require that FMIs have plans for their recapitalization or orderly wind down, if that were to prove to be necessary. Finally, the coverage of the international standards has been expanded to trade repositories as a new category of FMI, to further complement the G-20 OTC derivatives initiative for mandatory trade reporting. The Principles that address trade repositories focus on their transparency and the disclosure of market data. This reflects the important and unique role they will play in disseminating information both to regulators and to the market more broadly. The second major goal is to promote consistent global enforcement of the standards. Toward this end, the Principles unify and harmonize three existing sets of standards – Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems; Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems; and Recommendations for Central Counterparties. As part of this effort, the Principles strengthen the “responsibilities of authorities.” This includes a new framework for cooperation among financial authorities. It calls for central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities to cooperate with each other, both domestically and internationally, and to support each other in fulfilling their respective mandates to promote the safety and efficiency of FMIs. This builds upon existing frameworks that have already been used successfully by CPSS and IOSCO for effective cooperation in the oversight of global institutions. Such cooperation can facilitate more comprehensive oversight, improve efficiency and effectiveness, reduce or eliminate any gaps in regulation, supervision, and oversight, and minimize potential duplication of effort and burden on both the FMIs and the cooperating authorities. Toward the goal of consistent global enforcement, the Principles are considered to be minimum requirements. In contrast, the three old sets of guidance were weaker, being recommendations rather than requirements. As recommendations, they could be ignored. In contrast, as the Principles make clear, countries that are members of CPSS and IOSCO are 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches to apply the principles to “the fullest extent possible.” This means that regulation and legal frameworks are to be adjusted as needed in order to accommodate the standards. To ensure that this happens, CPSS and IOSCO are also developing disclosure and assessment regimes. The purpose is to facilitate a consistent set of disclosures by the different FMIs and a consistent set of assessment methodologies that can be used by the relevant international institutions, namely the International Money Fund and the World Bank, and by the relevant national authorities of the FMIs domiciled in their jurisdictions. When the Principles are published next month, CPSS and IOSCO will also issue a disclosure regime proposal and an assessment regime proposal. These will be put forward for a 60-day consultation period to give the market participants, FMIs, and regulators an opportunity to comment. Also, once the Principles are rolled out and countries start to implement the legal and regulatory changes necessary to put the Principles into practice, it is anticipated that CPSS and IOSCO will undertake a monitoring effort to see how it is going. The focus will be on evaluating how quickly and broadly the Principles are being embedded in national legal and regulatory frameworks. The Principles are important in supporting the G20 strategy of mandatory clearing of standardized OTC derivatives trades and in ensuring that the four safeguards discussed earlier for global CCPs and other FMIs are implemented. As I mentioned earlier, the new Principles lay out the responsibilities of authorities for cooperative oversight. Cooperation can take a variety of forms, including formal arrangements that are organized under memoranda of understandings, specific protocols or other documentation for the exchange of critical information, and informal arrangements for regular and ad hoc communications. Much work is currently underway to establish various forms of effective cooperation, particularly for individual CCPs and trade repositories that are becoming globally important. However, as the work toward meeting the G-20 commitments continues, much more work is needed to design and implement such arrangements for the relevant FMIs. In terms of the issue of access, explicit requirements for FMIs are embedded in the Principles. The Principles establish a framework that covers access by direct participants, indirect participants – i.e., those who trade indirectly through a direct participant, and access and links between FMIs. In terms of the lender of last resort issue, the Principles strengthen the requirements for FMIs in terms of such aspects of financial strength such as capital and liquidity, and operational and business risk. This implies that enforcement of the Principles should significantly mitigate any moral hazard issue that could arise if an FMI were able to obtain credit from a central bank. On resolution, the Principles contain explicit requirements to ensure that all systemically important FMIs have viable recovery plans and, if circumstances ever warrant, could be wound down in an orderly fashion without the disruption of the provision of key services. The Principles’ provisions for an FMI’s recovery and orderly wind down will inform upcoming work by CPSS-IOSCO on the potential role and attributes of official regimes for the resolution of FMIs. This work is underway and should be completed later this year. I’m pleased to see what has already been accomplished. But let’s be clear, when the Principles are published that won’t be the end. To quote Winston Churchill, it will only be “the end of the beginning”. Thereafter, the resolution, disclosure and assessment frameworks will need to be finalized later this year. The CPSS and IOSCO members will have to adopt the new Principles into their regulatory and legal frameworks, with a target date of year-end. The new Principles will then be put into effect next year, with FMIs expected to observe the new Principles as shortly thereafter as is feasible. This is obviously an ambitious schedule, but one that is fully consistent with the G20 leaders’ mandate. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Finally, we should recognize that the global financial system is a complex one that is continuously evolving and that we are introducing many significant changes into that system. We have to recognize that there may be trade-offs between some of our objectives, and that the system may evolve in ways that we do not expect. There may be unintended consequences. Maybe the major dealers will not standardize as many trades as is desirable or, perhaps, CCPs will develop in too fragmented a manner so that the netting of risk doesn’t occur to the extent potentially feasible. Or the development of global CCPs could have unanticipated negative consequences for market structure, competition and/or efficiency. We must be open-minded about the potential need for mid-course corrections. We will need to ensure that the incentives are right to get the greatest amount of risk reduced in the most efficient manner. Currently, for example, we are evaluating how the changes in terms of the Basel capital and liquidity standards for banks will interact with the changes in the OTC derivatives regime in terms of influencing the incentives for standardizing OTC trades and mandatory clearing through CCPs. But we shouldn’t kid ourselves – we’ll be off in our forecast. Thus, we must be ready to make adjustments as this process unfolds and we learn more. As long as regulators, FMIs, and market participants make the effort, we should be able to make the financial system much safer, resilient, and transparent. The changes in train, if properly executed, should, over time, significantly reduce the shortcomings in the OTC derivatives market that exacerbated the financial crisis. Properly enacted and implemented, net exposures should be smaller because of the netting that occurs through the CCP process. Transparency into counterparty risk should be greatly improved via disclosure requirements and the ability to aggregate trade information in trade repositories, and end user trading positions should be much better protected by segregation and portability requirements and a more robust financial market infrastructure. Although there is still much to do as part of this process, I’m optimistic that we are on the right road. We just need to continue to push ahead and not forget the lessons learned from the financial crisis. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Narayana Kocherlakota: On the limits to monetary policy Executive summary by Mr Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, of the 2nd Annual Hyman P Minsky Lecture, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, 20 March 2012. *      *      * Slides to the original speech can be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis’s website (http://www.minneapolisfed.org/news_events/pres/kocherlakota_minsky_speech_032012.pdf). Since the start of the Great Recession, employment has fallen considerably, while average inflation has been near the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent. Given the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, an obvious question is “Why does the Federal Reserve appear to be doing so much better on one mandate than the other?” In this speech, I present a simple model that suggests an answer to this question. A key feature of the model is that there are two distinct types of demand shocks: labor demand shocks and product demand shocks. The labor demand shocks reflect factors such as adverse credit conditions and increased uncertainty that lead firms to demand fewer workers at a given real wage. The product demand shocks reflect factors such as a loss of wealth and a higher risk of job loss that lead households to demand fewer goods at a given real interest rate. Each of these shocks leads to a fall in employment, with the decline in employment magnified by slow adjustments in the real wage. When considering these shocks, it is important to distinguish how monetary and non-monetary policies influence the level of output and employment. In the model I employ, the Federal Reserve controls the real interest rate; lowering the real interest rate increases the demand for goods and services, and thereby influences national output and employment. The first implication of the model is that monetary policy can offset the impact of the product demand shocks on employment, but it cannot offset the employment loss due to the fall in labor demand and any associated slow real wage adjustment. As a result, the level of “maximum employment” achievable through monetary policy is less than the “full employment” of labor resources.  A second implication is that non-monetary policies specifically designed to stimulate the demand for workers (such as government subsidies for hiring) can offset some of the employment loss due to the labor demand shocks, but only if accompanied by monetary easing. That is, monetary and non-monetary policy must work in concert to reduce the impact of a decline in labor demand; neither can do it alone.  Returning to the question posed at the beginning, this model suggests that the Federal Reserve is performing about as well as it can on both mandates. The Federal Reserve’s accommodative policy has offset much of the impact of product demand shocks and so has kept inflation near target. However, this policy has been unable to offset the large adverse shocks to labor demand. The model implies that, in terms of employment, there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve on its own.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepak Mohanty: Statistics and the Reserve Bank – some reflections Opening remarks by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Annual Statistics Conference 2012 of the Reserve Bank of India, Chandigarh, 17 March 2012. *      *      * Deputy Governors, Dr. Subir Gokarn and Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty; distinguished statisticians and economists from the academia; Regional Director Chandigarh; heads of select departments; Shri A. B. Chakraborty, Officer-in-Charge Department of Statistics and Information Management (DSIM) and friends. I extend a warm welcome to you all to the Annual Conference 2012 of the Department of Statistics and Information Management (DSIM). For the first time, this conference is organised outside Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which provides an informal atmosphere for bonding and brain storming needed for a research conference like this. This conference provides a platform to the officers of DSIM to present their research work before the experts and receive their feedback in order to make analysis more meaningful for policy and research. I thank the distinguished professors who have consented to discuss various papers presented by my colleagues in DSIM: Prof. Manoj Panda (CESS, Hyderabad), Prof. N. R. Bhanumurthy (NIPFP, New Delhi), Prof. Subrata Sarkar (IGIDR, Mumbai), Prof. Surinder Kumar (CRRID, Chandigarh), Prof. Mahajan (Punjab University, Chandigarh), Prof. Chetan Ghate (ISI Delhi), Prof. Shalabh (IIT Kanpur). You all bring together plenty of expertise and experience in the field of theory and practice of statistical research for economic policy making which is of great value to us.  Statistics as a method of systematic learning from observation and experience has been practiced for centuries. India has a distinction of starting early in compilation of economic statistics for analysis and policy making. Of late, however, there have been some concerns over the quality of economic statistics. This underscores the need for renewed focus and greater organisational efforts for improving the quality of official statistics. Statistics is a public good as it is necessary for empowerment of citizens. Today most of the economic analysis has statistical foundation. Therefore, a solid statistical grounding and soiling the hands with data are basic prerequisites for the making of a good empirical economist. This is evident from the presence of many eminent economists amongst us in this conference. Actually, many renowned economists started their career as statisticians. For example, Professor Milton Friedman, Nobel laureate and perhaps the most celebrated monetarist economist of the past century began his career as a statistician in Washington DC. Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets presented a more scientific approach to macroeconomic analysis by laying the foundations of national accounts statistics. Central banking today is more challenging than ever and availability of reliable and timely information is the key to effective policy making. As a central bank, we are responsible for generating various macro-financial statistics collected both from primary and secondary sources in the process of implementing our policies. As the Reserve Bank boasts of one of the largest body of statisticians in the country, let me start with the role of statisticians in our organisation and highlight the achievements and challenges for DSIM. The statistician in the Reserve Bank performs a multifarious role. DSIM provides statistical service by way of collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of information relating to monetary, banking, corporate and external sectors. Another major area of focus is to provide inputs for policy formulation, conducting surveys and to carry out research activities in conformity with the needs of the Bank. Over the years, it has widened its scope and spectrum of data collection and dissemination. A key achievement in this regard is the improvement of the Bank’s web enabled Data Warehouse, popular among the researchers as Database on Indian Economy (DBIE). Today various flagship data publications of the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Bank like the Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy originate from DBIE. A large amount of downloadable data is made available as a public good on near real time basis on the RBI website. I am happy to note that a more user friendly version of DBIE is being released today. Towards information management and dissemination, the system of data submission under the Online Return Filing System (ORFS) is further strengthened. At present, 40 returns of various departments like DBOD, DBS, FED, FMD, DPSS and MPD are submitted using this platform. At the same time, the Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) project on the standardisation in the reporting of financial data has made considerable progress during the year with 42 returns taken up for implementation.  During the last one year, the Department has made considerable progress in identifying and filling data gaps. This includes implementation of Co-ordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), extension of Master Office File (MOF) with population census and economic census, development of service price and production index for banking service, construction of house price index, collation of time series data on rural wages1, system of Loan Registration Numbers (LRNs) for ECBs under automatic route. The research activities of the Department encompass economic measurement, analysis, modelling and forecasting of economic growth, inflation, corporate performance and other macroeconomic indicators and capturing economic agents’ response to expected macro developments for forward looking monetary policy formulation. Based on various univariate and multivariate models, growth and inflation projected path is presented in the form of fan charts. With inflation running higher than RBI’s comfort level for the last two years, the analysis of growth-inflation trade-off carried out by the Department was particularly useful for calibrating monetary policy actions.  The surveys conducted by the Department particularly on macroeconomic changes continue to provide valuable inputs for forward looking monetary policy formulation. These include Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), Credit Conditions Survey (CrCS), Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (IESH), Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) and Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).Key findings of most of these surveys are now published on the RBI website simultaneously with the Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments every quarter. This has increased visibility of our survey output and has improved considerably the timeliness in dissemination of survey results. I am sure availability of these surveys now in public domain will spur research in these areas. Understanding asset price developments has gained increasing importance, especially after the global financial crisis. In this context, the Department has made considerable progress in compiling House Price Index (HPI) based on registration price. The coverage has increased to nine cities now. Regional offices of DSIM are making important contribution towards this. Further, in order to complement this, the Department has introduced an Asset Price Monitoring System (APMS) based on housing loan account information as available with banks. Financial stability analysis is another important focus area of RBI. I am happy to note that the Department is making important contribution in this area by providing inputs such as financial stress indicators and asset prices. Notwithstanding the achievements, let me share a few challenges for the Department going forward.  First, in the wake of financial crisis, quality and timely availability of statistics has become essential. The information and analytical requirements have become more diversified with added emphasis on financial stability. With structured monetary policy reviews becoming                                                  1 Based on Labour Bureau data. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 more frequent, the need for high quality and frequent forward looking information has increased. At the same time, application of statistics in solving operational issues has gained increasing importance. These developments have contributed to the demand for trained statisticians across the departments of the Bank. The Department, being the second largest pool of statisticians after ISI in the country, must rise to the occasion to serve the organisation better.  Second, as central bank of the country, we have the responsibility of providing a sizable part of macro-financial statistics. Our publications have a standard that provides confidence to data users. Even for secondary data like price statistics, users prefer to consult RBI publications. Therefore, the responsibility of maintaining data quality, timeliness and making data meaningful inevitably falls on DSIM. The Department should make greater use of technology to validate and improve data quality. Third, there are some surveys on macroeconomic changes which have not progressed to our desired level of satisfaction. We have made a beginning on collection of data on trading sector and employment opportunities of fresh graduates. But we need to expedite and bring out these survey results soon. Another important indicator which provides early signs of overall economic activity is retail sales. A quarterly survey on retail sales across cities may be initiated with the help of regional offices. Fourth, the Department is involved in various data gap and statistical measurement issues through its participation in various committees within and outside the RBI. One particular issue, that has received renewed attention across the globe in view of the complexity of inflation dynamics, is measurement of prices – commodity prices, consumer prices and asset prices. In recent years, there is greater institutional effort for improving measurement of prices in India. We have a new CPI (rural, urban and combined) now. The base of WPI was also revised. There is, however, considerable scope for improving the coverage and reporting of prices data besides research on measurement of prices and inflation, in terms of commodities/asset classes, stages of production as well as various sectors and regions. Now that we have a more representative CPI series, institutional efforts need to be directed towards compilation of a Producers Price Index (PPI) as well as a Service Price Index. Fifth, regional market intelligence or statistical intelligence plays a pivotal role in providing important inputs to monetary policy making. For example, the Bank of England (BoE) has established a regional statistical data collection system covering as many as 25 indicators including business conditions, price variation, labour and employment. These are different from the qualitative surveys. Information so collected is analysed and transformed into scores which forms an important input in the deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the BoE. India is a country with significant regional variations. Hence regional inputs are valuable for policy making. With its reorganised structure and envisaged wider presence of regional offices in major centres, the Department may put a similar system of gathering relevant statistics and market intelligence, particularly in the area of prices and agricultural conditions to aid policy formulation at the national level. Sixth, as a part of the on-going work with DCM on forecasting of demand for currency and coins, it is necessary to conduct focused regional surveys relating to (i) availability/shortages of coins/currency notes, (ii) regional practice and usage of currency notes, and (iii) estimation of counterfeit currency notes in the system. In addition, the regional offices of the Department could be directly involved in conducting surveys on financial inclusion, particularly assessment of financial inclusion outcomes in the villages following the outreach programme of the Bank.  Seventh, the Department has noticeable presence in a number of central office departments, like Department of External Investment and Operations (DEIO), Monetary Policy Department (MPD), Internal Debt Management Department (IDMD), Department of Information Technology (DIT), Department of Payment and Settlement Systems (DPSS), Department of Banking Supervision (DBS) and Financial Stability Unit (FSU). It is desirable that our officers 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches in these departments provide analytical inputs for policy and operational issues and come out with research papers. These papers could be presented in conferences and published eventually in the RBI Working Paper Series. This will make research more valuable in furthering our organisational objectives.  Eighth, focused and determined approach to research across various units, including the regional offices, should be pursued so that research agenda being adopted by the Department is accomplished in a timely manner. For data management and dissemination, technology must be harnessed to its fullest extent. There is also a need to strengthen the modelling and forecasting capabilities towards developing a full fledged forecasting suite including DSGE models.  Finally, I congratulate the Department for its many achievements. However, there are challenges ahead, to some of which I have drawn your attention. As noted statistician John Tukey once observed, “An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.” I see the demand for statistical skills and statistics in the Bank growing as we grapple with many questions. I hope the deliberations of this conference will bring academics and policy makers closer and lead to strengthening our statistical analysis and system. I wish the conference all success. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Daniel K Tarullo: Regulatory reform Testimony by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington DC, 22 March 2012. *      *      * Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and its international implications.  Although banking regulation has long included an important international dimension, the recent financial crisis has brought renewed attention, both in the United States and abroad, to the interconnectedness among national financial markets and, consequently, the importance of international cooperation in safeguarding those markets. In recognition of the fact that financial distress can quickly and dramatically cross national borders, we seek to protect our own financial system by promoting the global adoption of strong, common regulatory standards and effective supervisory practices. Such common standards and practices should also help prevent major competitive disadvantages for U.S. firms.  Today I will touch on several aspects of the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act that have significant international implications: regulation of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, and a number of discrete issues that are arising as we work to implement the Dodd-Frank Act.  Regulation of SIFIs The Dodd-Frank Act and post-crisis international regulatory reform efforts both place great emphasis on containing the systemic risk potentially posed by major financial institutions. The most important points of intersection include efforts to strengthen capital requirements, to develop international quantitative liquidity standards, and to put in place mechanisms for the orderly resolution of these firms.  Capital regulation  Strong capital requirements remain the cornerstone of prudential regulation because capital can provide a buffer against losses at financial firms from any source or activity. The best way to safeguard against taxpayer-funded bailouts in the future is for our large financial institutions to have adequate capital buffers, sized to reflect their own risk profiles and the damage that would be done to the financial system were such institutions to fail. Achievement of this aim requires both improvement of the traditional, firm-based approach to capital regulation and creation of a more systemic, or macroprudential, component of capital regulation.  With respect to improving the traditional approach to capital regulation, international work on common, global standards was already quite advanced by the time the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in July 2010. The so-called Basel 2.5 agreement, which strengthened the market risk capital requirements of Basel II, had already been finished. Just a few months after the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, agreement was reached on the Basel III reforms, which require improvement of the quality of regulatory capital, an increase in the quantity of minimum required capital, maintenance of a capital conservation buffer, and – for the first time internationally – compliance with a minimum leverage ratio. In the coming months, the banking agencies will be finalizing regulations to implement Basel 2.5 in the United States and will be proposing regulations to implement Basel III in the United States.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches With respect to macroprudential capital regulation, section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the Board establish enhanced risk-based capital standards for large bank holding companies that would be graduated based on the relative systemic importance of those companies. Consistent with this requirement, we espoused proposals in the Basel Committee for capital surcharges on the world’s largest, most interconnected banking organizations based on their global systemic importance. Last year, agreement was reached on a framework for such surcharges, to be implemented during the same transition period applicable to Basel III. The Board’s aim has been to fashion the enhanced capital requirements of section 165 and the associated international framework in a simultaneous and congruent manner. Both the Dodd-Frank Act provision and the Basel systemic surcharge framework are motivated by the fact that the failure of a systemically important firm would have dramatically greater negative consequences on the financial system and the economy than the failure of other firms. Stricter capital requirements on systemically important firms should also have the benefit of helping offset any funding advantage these firms derive from their perceived status as too-big-to-fail and providing an incentive for such firms to reduce their systemic footprint.  If the benefits of all these improvements to existing capital requirements are to be realized, it is crucial that capital standards be not only agreed upon globally, but also implemented consistently across jurisdictional boundaries. We have strongly supported efforts within the Basel Committee to monitor implementation – not only in the laws and regulations of member countries, but also at the level of individual large banking organizations, including an assessment of the consistency of risk-weighting practices by banks. We look forward to the evolution of the Basel Committee’s new plans for conducting this monitoring exercise, which are considerably more ambitious than any pursued in the past.  Liquidity standards  In recognition of the fact that liquidity squeezes at some financial institutions played a key role in the financial crisis, the Basel III agreements also introduced, for the first time, quantitative liquidity requirements for application to internationally active banks. One standard, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), is designed to ensure a firm’s ability to withstand short-term liquidity shocks through adequate holdings of highly liquid assets. The other standard, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), is intended to avoid significant maturity mismatches over longer-term horizons. Again, there is a parallel to this international initiative in section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which calls for enhanced, graduated liquidity standards for large bank holding companies.  Precisely because this was the first effort on quantitative liquidity regulation by the Basel Committee, there were some questions about potential unintended consequences, as well as a desire to ensure that the new standards reflected actual experience with the stability of various funding sources and the relative liquidity of different financial instruments during the financial crisis. For these reasons, the Federal Reserve, with support from a number of other central banks and supervisors, suggested at the time of adoption of Basel III in 2010 a multiyear study period before the rules take effect. Since then, the U.S. banking agencies and a Basel Committee working group have been collecting data, analyzing the potential effects of the LCR on financial markets and the broader economy, and considering what amendments might be warranted. The Basel Committee will likely suggest a set of changes to the LCR later this year, with a goal of introducing the LCR in 2015. Work on the NSFR is on a considerably slower track; the current plan is for implementation in 2018.  Resolution of SIFIs  A third core regulatory reform goal of both the Dodd-Frank Act and international policymakers is to enhance the ability of regulators to resolve failing SIFIs. The Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) have set forth standards for national 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 resolution regimes that will allow resolution of SIFIs in an orderly fashion, without taxpayer exposure to losses through solvency support. Here in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for an orderly resolution process to be administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and resolution planning by SIFIs to be overseen by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Together these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are fully consistent with the Basel Committee and FSB standards.  In developing the orderly liquidation authority established by Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has recently expressed a preference for resolving a failed SIFI under a single receivership and internal recapitalization model. Under this model, the parent company of the failed SIFI is placed into receivership; all, or substantially all, of the assets of the parent company are transferred to a bridge entity; the parent company and its residual assets are liquidated; and the bridge entity is capitalized, in part, by converting the holders of long-term unsecured debt of the parent company into equity holders in the bridge. Under the single receivership model, the major subsidiaries of the SIFI continue to operate as going concerns. This approach holds great promise, but ensuring its viability as a resolution option requires, among other things, that each SIFI maintain an amount of long-term unsecured debt that is sufficient to absorb very significant losses at the firm.  Some other jurisdictions have, or are planning to, put in place special resolution mechanisms that conform to the emerging international standards. But even continued progress along this path may not solve all the possible problems associated with failure of a SIFI. The coexistence of internationally active firms with nationally based insolvency regimes means that there could be important cross-border legal complications when a home jurisdiction places into receivership a firm with significant assets, subsidiaries, and contractual arrangements in other countries. A comprehensive, treaty-like instrument for a global bank resolution regime to address these issues is surely an unrealistic prospect for the foreseeable future. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC are working together with counterparts from other countries to identify opportunities for more limited cooperation agreements, coordinated supervisory work on resolution plans, and other devices to make the orderly resolution of a large, internationally active firm more feasible.  OTC derivatives regulatory reforms Another key part of the Dodd-Frank Act that involves significant international considerations is OTC derivatives reform. In the United States, administrative agencies are implementing the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act to strengthen the infrastructure and regulation of the OTC derivatives market. This task includes enhancing the role of central counterparties, which can be an important tool for managing counterparty credit risk in the derivatives market; improving regulation and supervision of dealers and key market participants; introducing minimum margin requirements for certain derivatives transactions that are not cleared with a central counterparty; and increasing transparency.  A roughly parallel international initiative got under way in 2009, when the Group of Twenty (G-20) leaders set out commitments related to reform of the OTC derivatives markets. Since work on the G-20 commitments is being pursued in a number of international groups and foreign jurisdictions, continued attention will be required to ensure that the global convergence process continues in a timely fashion. Such attention will be particularly important in areas where international convergence is desirable to avoid a significant fracturing or regionalization of the existing global structure of the swaps market, or to prevent undue constraints on the ability of U.S. firms to compete in foreign markets. A good example of this is the introduction of margin requirements for uncleared derivatives. U.S. and foreign regulators have formed a joint working group of the Basel Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to develop internationally consistent margin standards that appropriately address the risks of uncleared derivatives while ensuring that U.S. and foreign firms compete on a level playing field.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Other key areas of OTC derivatives reform present similar international challenges and will demand similar levels of international collaboration. These areas include the creation and regulation of central counterparties, swap execution facilities, and swap data repositories, including mutual recognition by U.S. and foreign regulators where appropriate. Issues also arise around the treatment of governmental entities in derivatives reforms in the United States and abroad. For example, title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act generally exempts from swaps regulation any transaction to which the Federal Reserve is a party, but does not contain a similar exemption for transactions to which a foreign central bank is party. Foreign central banks have expressed concerns that the application of certain parts of title VII may interfere with the manner in which they conduct their national monetary policies.  In addition to its involvement in specific derivatives reforms related to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve also participates in a variety of international groups that serve as broader forums for coordinating policies related to the participants and the infrastructure of derivatives markets. These forums include the Basel Committee, which has recently enhanced international capital, leverage, and liquidity standards for derivatives, as well as the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, which is working with IOSCO to update international standards for systemically important clearing systems, including central counterparties that clear derivatives instruments, and trade repositories. These collaborative exercises are intended to support the development of a consistent international approach to the regulation and supervision of derivatives products, dealers, and market infrastructures. Here, as in other international contexts, our aims are to promote the financial stability of the United States and fair competitive conditions for U.S. financial institutions.  Other implementation issues As noted in the preceding discussion, even where there is broad international consensus to adopt a particular regulatory approach, there can be discrete issues raised as countries implement that approach in the context of their own legal, financial, and political systems. This circumstance is hardly unique to the area of financial regulation; it is familiar to anyone who has worked on virtually any regulatory issues that affect international trade and investment. There are also some elements of the Dodd-Frank Act that are unlikely to be pursued internationally in any comparable form. These areas of U.S.-only regulatory reform can present particular challenges in implementation, both in terms of the potential impact that they may have on the ability of U.S. financial institutions to compete abroad and the extent to which they may affect the activities of foreign financial institutions in U.S. markets and with U.S. counterparties. In these instances of regulatory reforms being pursued only in the United States, there are not likely to be obvious answers to the resulting international complexities.  For example, there has been considerable recent attention paid to the international aspects of section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, more commonly known as the “Volcker Rule.” Concerns have been expressed about the Volcker Rule’s potential international implications in three principal areas. First, because the Volcker Rule applies to the worldwide operations of U.S. banking entities, but only to the U.S.-connected operations of foreign banks, concerns have been raised regarding the relative competitiveness of U.S. firms that have significant operations in overseas markets. Second, and conversely, because the Volcker Rule also applies to the activities of foreign banks unless such activities are “solely outside the United States,” several foreign banks and their supervisors have expressed concern regarding the potential extraterritorial impact that those restrictions may have on trading or fund activity of foreign banks that has both U.S. and non-U.S. characteristics. Third, because the Volcker Rule includes a statutory exemption for proprietary trading in U.S. government debt securities, but not in foreign sovereign debt securities, several constituencies have raised concerns regarding this asymmetry. In each of these areas, U.S. regulators will need to carefully consider the concerns that have been raised and the broader international implications of the Volcker Rule as we work to finalize our implementing rules.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Similarly, the swaps “push-out” requirement in section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act also appears unlikely to be pursued internationally. Under section 716, U.S. insured depository institutions and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks will be required to “push out” certain types of derivatives dealing activities to affiliated entities. The global effects of the swaps push-out provision are multifaceted. On the one hand, the provision will require U.S. banking firms to restructure their global derivatives dealing activities in ways that will not be required of foreign banks abroad.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Anand Sinha: Changing contours of global crisis – impact on the Indian economy Address by Mr Anand Sinha, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Finance Summit, organised by IIM Kashipur (Indian Institute of Management), Kashipur, 11 February 2012. *      *      * Inputs provided by Mr. Janak Raj, Mr.Sudarsana Sahoo, Ms. Pallavi Chavan and Mr. Jayakumar Yarasi are gratefully acknowledged. Dr. Devi Singh, Director, IIM Lucknow and Mentor Director, IIM Kashipur; Professor Manoj Anand; other members of the faculty; my fellow bankers and the young and “raring to go” students of Indian Institute of Management, Kashipur. A very good evening to you all. I deem it a privilege to address young and bright students like this. I see in them the willingness to listen, courage to question and the enthusiasm to take on challenges that the future holds for them. In short, I see in them, the answers to the challenges we face today. It is always energizing as well as educating to interact with students and that is the precise reason why I had no second thoughts in accepting the invitation to interact with them even at a place far off from my workplace, Mumbai. IIM, Kashipur is the youngest IIM. There is a benefit in being young in the group. You have a pool of experience to choose from and to learn. At the same time, the challenges of being young in the group are also quite daunting. You are expected to reach and maintain the heights reached by your seniors and even surpass them. Looking at the enthusiasm of the students today, I am sure IIM, Kashipur will soon emerge as one of the premier institutions among IIMs.  The topic chosen for today’s address, on the face of it, looks quite jaded. So much has already been said, discussed, analysed, dissected and written about the crisis. The crisis which erupted in 2007 has, in no time, engulfed the consciousness of the public so much, that no finance speech is complete without a reference to it nor is a finance book consummate without a chapter devoted. Going by the number of books published on crisis, one would not be greatly surprised if publishing industry was one of the few industries that stayed afloat, or in fact, thrived during the crisis.  Then, why am I deliberating on a topic which has been discussed so much already? It is because of two reasons. One, this crisis still continues to offer a wealth of information and lessons, which will remain relevant in times to come. Second, the crisis does not remain what it was, when it started. The crisis which started off as a localized sub-prime crisis has morphed into a financial crisis leading to a full blown global economic crisis and has now taken the shape of a sovereign debt crisis. While its current spread is localized in Eurozone, its impact continues to be felt all across the globe. It is in this context that I would place my talk today on the changing contours of crisis and its impact on the Indian economy.  I.  Calm before the storm – a period of great moderation The period preceding the Global Crisis was a phase of Great Moderation representing the decline in macroeconomic volatility (both output as well as inflation). The period was marked by strong worldwide GDP growth coupled with low or stable inflation and very low interest rates which lulled the policy makers and the economists into believing that their search for “holy grail” was over and the magic formula of strong growth with low inflation had been 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches finally discovered. The great moderation was attributed1 to (i) structural changes that may have increased macroeconomic flexibility and stability such as improved management of business inventories made possible by advances in computation and communication, increased depth and sophistication of financial markets, deregulation in many industries, the shift away from manufacturing to services and increased openness to trade and international capital flows etc. (ii) improved performance of macroeconomic policies or (iii) good luck. The role of good luck in maintaining great moderation was extensively discussed and debated and, as anyone would expect, its role was discounted when things were going good. The problem in attributing entire credit to good luck is that it leaves you unprepared and vulnerable to shocks since, by relying solely on luck, you become effectively, a prisoner of circumstances. On the other hand, not giving luck its rightful due encourages you to overrate yourself and leaves you underprepared when a crisis hits.  Whatever was the reason, the good times did not last long and the period of great moderation came to an end by 2007 when the crisis erupted. The impact of the crisis on financial world was immense. The global growth slumped, unemployment burgeoned, interbank markets froze on account of heightened counterparty concerns and risk aversion, banking activity plummeted while the non-performing loans increased and many large and famous institutions were obliterated from the face of financial world. The impact of the crisis on the non-financial front was no less. In fact, the crisis caused deeper impact on the intellectual world, by rubbishing concepts and theories that were held sacrosanct till then. Analysts, researches and policymakers huddled to diagnose the reasons for the crisis and came out with various theories and explanations. The more plausible explanation goes this way. Differences in the consumption and investment patterns among countries (a saving glut in Asia and oil exporting countries and a spending binge in the United States) have resulted in emergence of global imbalances which led to large capital flows from surplus countries into deficit countries which were mostly the advanced countries.   These capital flows have resulted in a surge of liquidity in advanced economies leading to low interest rates. Both the short term as well as the long term real interest rates remained too low for a too long period. Low interest rates forced the investors to hunt for yield which sowed the seeds for asset inflation. Financial engineering assumed the centre stage in a bid to design and offer high yielding products to investors.                                                  1  Bernanke, Ben, (Feb 2004), The Great Moderation. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In addition to the above factors, gaps in the regulatory framework also played their part in accentuating crisis. The following reasons are widely attributed to the outbreak of crisis- inadequate quantity and quality of capital, insufficient liquidity buffers, excessively leveraged financial institutions, inadequate coverage of certain risks, absence of a regulatory framework for addressing systemic risks, proliferation of opaque and poorly understood financial products in search of yields in the backdrop of an era of “great moderation”, perverse incentive structure in securitisation process, lack of transparency in OTC markets particularly the CDS, inadequate regulation and supervision, and a burgeoning under/unregulated shadow banking system. While all these factors were playing in the background creating a perfect recipe for the crisis, the most proximate cause for the Crisis was the developments in the US subprime market. As observed by Raghuram Rajan2, growing income inequality in the United States, stemming from unequal access to quality education, led to political pressure for more housing credit which led to distorted lending in the financial sector. In a classic case of best intentions leading to worst outcomes due to bad implementation, the envisaged policy of financial inclusion by enabling homeless to own homes, led to reckless lending in sub-prime market and, eventually, resulted in a meltdown.                                                    2  Rajan, Raghuram, (2010), “Fault Lines – How hidden fractures still threaten the world economy”. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches The crisis, when erupted in 2007, started off as a mere sub-prime crisis localized in the US. But soon the crisis spread to other markets cutting across geographical boundaries signifying the extent of the global integration. The subprime crisis became a banking crisis due to the exposures banks had to the subprime assets which were fast turning bad. Counterparty concerns exacerbated, leading to freezing of global interbank markets. The crisis had spread to other jurisdictions through various channels of contagion – trade, finance and most importantly, confidence. Foreign investors started withdrawing investments from emerging markets pushing them also into liquidity crisis. By Oct 2008, when Lehman Brothers had collapsed under the weight of sub-prime exposures, the crisis had become truly global, both in spread and impact.  The crisis had a devastating impact on the world economy in terms of output losses and rise in unemployment. It had impacted all the segments of the global financial markets in terms of heightened volatility, tighter credit conditions, low asset prices and increased write downs. The policy makers, regulators and the sovereigns had to immediately step in and initiate measures to mitigate the impact of crisis. There have been many measures, both conventional and unconventional, that were taken which provided relief to the badly battered global economy.  Just when we thought the crisis was behind us, with economies slowly limping back to normalcy, another crisis hit the World. In a classic case of cure being more painful than the disease, various fiscal measures taken to mitigate the impact of 2007 crisis have, along with other factors, led to huge and unsustainable sovereign debts resulting in a sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone. Countries that have run up huge fiscal deficits, either to maintain populist policies or to bail out institutions during the global crisis by guaranteeing failing banks etc., have suddenly found themselves on the verge of bankruptcy unable to honour their obligations and the word “sovereign debt” suddenly ceased to evoke images of a riskless (less risky, at least) asset.  With this background in place, I would now move on to the central theme of the talk today “Changing Contours of global Crisis – Impact on Indian Economy”. I intend to cover the impact of both the crises i.e. Global Crisis 2007 and the current sovereign debt crisis, on Global and Indian economies with specific focus on real sector, financial markets and the banking system.  II.  Global crisis a.  Impact on global economy Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the global inter-bank financial markets froze in view of large losses suffered by the major financial institutions and the extreme uncertainty over the health of the counterparty balance sheets. This had a knock on effect on various segments of financial markets, including inter-bank markets. Fire sales by investors contributed to further downward pressures on asset prices, leading to a vicious cycle of distress sales and declining asset prices. Heightened risk aversion and search for safe havens led to deleveraging by investors and consequent sharp and substantial retrenchment in capital flows to emerging and developing economies. All this turmoil in various segments of the financial markets led to a sharp decline in economic activity in the major advanced economies. Unemployment rates soared and labour markets became weak. Given the high and growing degree of trade and financial integration between the advanced economies and the Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs), activity in the EDEs also decelerated sharply. Real GDP growth in advanced economies turned negative in 2009 (–3.7 per cent) from the strong pace of 2.9 per cent during 2004–07. Growth recovered modestly in 2010, but again turned anaemic in 2011 (1.6 per cent). Growth in advanced economies averaged a mere 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 0.3 per cent during 2008–11 and output still remains well below potential. The IMF expects growth in advanced economies to decelerate further to 1.2 per cent in 2012. Unemployment rate in the US more than doubled from 4.4 per cent in December 2006 to a peak of 10.0 per cent in October 2009; it has since then eased, at a very gradual pace, to 8.5 per cent.  Capital flows (net) to EDEs more than halved from US $ 715 billion in 2007 to US $ 246 billion in 2008 as portfolio and banking flows turned negative. Reflecting the growth shock in the advanced economies as well as the retrenchment in capital flows, real GDP growth in the EDEs decelerated from 8.0 per cent during 2004–7 to 2.8 per cent in 2009. It recovered quickly to 7.3 per cent in 2010. Overall, global GDP growth contracted to 0.6 per cent in 2009 from the robust growth of 5.0 per cent during 2004–07. In the global credit and money markets, the risk spreads had ballooned during the crisis period. The TED spread3 exceeded 300bps on September 17, 2008 breaking the previous record set after the Black Monday crash of 1987 and, thereafter, reached an all time high of 464 bps on Oct 10, 2008. The 3M LIBOR-3M OIS spread4 touched the high of 364 bps on October 10, 2008 as against the normal level of around 10 bps. The huge risk aversion was reflected in sharp decline in the stock indices across the globe and heightened volatility. Global equity markets witnessed major sell-offs in March 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) registered the new twelve-year low of 6,547.05 (on closing basis) on March 9, 2009 and had lost 20% of its value in only six weeks. The VIX index –a widely used measure of market risk and often referred to as the “investor fear gauge” – rose to a record high of 80.86 on November 20, 2008. The yields of the treasury securities plummeted on the back of safe haven demands, with the 10 year US Treasury yield touching a low of 2.05% on Dec 30, 2008. The three month T-Bill yield fell to (–) 4 basis points, the lowest it has been since 1954 reflecting unprecedented flight-to-safety. The CDS spreads widened markedly.                                                  3  TED spread =3M USD LIBOR minus 3M US T-bill yield. It is an indicator of the perceived credit risk in the general economy. The long term average of the TED has been 30 basis points with a maximum of 50 bps. 4  It reflects counterparty credit risk premium and watched as barometer of distress in money markets. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches The major CDS indices5, i.e. CDX Cross Over, CDX Investment Grade, iTraxx Europe crossover and iTraxx Europe, touched the highs of 699 bps, 242 bps, 1150 bps and 206 bps respectively during March 2009. In a parallel development, while other asset classes have fallen in value, commodity prices surged during this period. Financialisation of commodities is believed to have added to the inflationary pressure. Both Gold and Crude oil prices had spiralled during the period.  Global crisis has also severely affected the growth and health of global banking sector. Bank credit growth in major economies such as US, UK, and the Eurozone secularly declined throughout 2009. The asset quality has also been adversely impacted with NPA (as % of total loans) rising to higher levels. The NPAs in the UK and US have risen from 0.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent in 2007 to 4.0 per cent and 4.9 per cent in 2009 respectively. The capital position of the banks, however, remained comfortable with most global banks continuing to step up their capital positions notwithstanding the crisis. By 2010, the Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) was placed above 15 per cent for banks in UK, US, Japan and Germany.                                                   5  CDX indices contain North American and Emerging Market companies and iTraxx indices contain companies from the rest of the world.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  b. Policy responses: global In response to the collapse in economic activity, large losses suffered by major banks and financial institutions and severe disruption in financial markets, there was an unprecedented policy response by both monetary and fiscal authorities. Given the severe impact on economic activity and the vicious circle of expectations, the policy response was globally coordinated. As economic activity slowed down sharply, monetary policy was eased aggressively in both advanced economies and EDEs. In major advanced economies, policy interest rates were cut to almost zero levels by early 2009 which stayed around those levels even three years later (as of early 2012). Given the large unemployment rates and negative output gaps, the US Federal Reserve has indicated that the policy rate – the federal funds rate – will remain near zero till late 2014. The policy rate would thus remain near zero for almost six years, going by the Fed’s current assessment. In view of near zero policy interest rates and limitations imposed by the zero bound on the interest rates, the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks in advanced economies have also resorted to unprecedented quantitative easing – substantial infusion of liquidity – in an attempt to ease credit and financing conditions and drive long-term yields lower.  Turning to fiscal measures, to begin with, governments in major advanced economies provided direct support to the failing financial institutions. Subsequently, in view of the collapse of growth and the constraints posed by the lower zero bound on the interest rates, governments in almost all jurisdictions resorted to stimulus packages to boost activity. Despite the large fiscal and monetary stimuli, economic activity remained sluggish.  C. Impact of crisis on India The global financial crisis impacted India significantly, notwithstanding the sound banking system, negligible exposure of Indian banks to sub-prime assets and relatively well-functioning financial markets. The impact was mainly on account of India’s growing trade and financial integration with the global economy. India’s two way trade (merchandize exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, was 40.7 per cent in 2008–09, the crisis year, up from 19.6 per cent in 1998–99. The ratio of total external transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital account flows) to GDP – an indicator of both trade and financial integration – was 112 per cent in 2008–09 up from 44 per cent in 1998–99.  
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches The immediate impact of the crisis was felt through large capital outflows and consequent fall in the domestic stock markets on account of sell-off by Foreign Institutional Investors and steep depreciation of the Rupee against US Dollar. The BSE Sensex (on closing basis), which had touched a peak of 20873 on January 8, 2008, declined to a low of 8160 on March 9, 2009. While the capital outflows led to decline in the domestic forex liquidity, RBI’s intervention in the forex market resulted in tightening of Rupee liquidity. The inter-bank call money (overnight) rates firmed up during the period from second half of September ’08 to end October ’08 (high of 19.70 per cent on October 10). However, the series of liquidity augmenting measures undertaken by RBI resulted in call rates coming back to the normal levels from first week of November ’08.  Global recession had adversely affected the Indian exports resulting in widening of current account deficit (CAD). Exports which grew at 25 per cent during 2005/08 decelerated to 13.6 per cent in the crisis year (2008–09) and registered a negative growth of 3.5 per cent in 2009–10. Output growth, which averaged little less than 9 per cent in the previous five years and 9.5 per cent during the three year period 2005–08, dropped to 6.8 per cent in the crisis year (2008–09). In the pre-crisis years, capital inflows were far in excess of the current account deficit (CAD) and the Reserve Bank had to absorb these flows in its balance sheet. As global investors tried to rebalance their portfolios during the crisis period, the country witnessed large capital outflows immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers leading to a downward pressure on the rupee. The exchange rate depreciated from Rs. 39.37 per dollar in January 2008 to Rs. 51.23 per dollar in March 2009.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 The credit markets also came under pressure as corporates, finding it difficult to raise resources through external sources of funding, turned to domestic bank and non-bank institutions for funding and also withdrew their investments from the liquid schemes of mutual funds. This, in turn, put redemption pressure on mutual funds (MFs) and, further along the chain, on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) for whom MFs were a significant source of funding.  The Indian banking sector has, however, withstood the spillover effects of the global financial crisis as was evident in the robust CRAR and Tier 1 CRAR which remained far above the stipulated regulatory minimum of 9 per cent. The asset quality was also comfortable despite some slippages. By end March 2010, the Gross NPA ratio stood at 2.50 per cent (net NPA 1.13%) while the CRAR was 13.58 per cent. The spillover effects of the crisis were, however, most visible in the credit growth of banking sector. Since September 2008, the growth rate of advances, as also of assets, started witnessing a declining trend which continued for almost one year up to September 2009. The Y-o-Y growth in advances fell from 28.5 per cent at the end March 2007 to 12.3 per cent by end Sept 2009 while the Y-o-Y growth in assets fell from 22.9 per cent to 15.1 per cent during the same period.   d. Policy response – India Given the deceleration in growth and drying up of capital flows, both the Reserve Bank and the Government undertook a number of measures to minimise the impact of the crisis on India. There was, however, a notable difference between Indian response and those of many EMEs, on the one hand, and the advanced economies, on the other hand. While policy responses in advanced economies had to contend with both the unfolding financial crisis and deepening recession, the Indian response was predominantly driven by the need to arrest moderation in economic growth. The main plank of the government response was fiscal stimulus while the Reserve Bank’s action comprised counter-cyclical regulatory measures and also measures to ensure easy liquidity and monetary conditions. The Reserve Bank’s policy measures were aimed at containing the contagion from the outside – to keep the domestic money and credit markets functioning normally and ensure that the liquidity stress did not trigger solvency cascades. As in the case of other central banks, both conventional and unconventional measures were undertaken. The conventional measures included, first, a sharp reduction in the policy interest rates – the effective policy 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches rate was cut from 9 per cent (repo rate) in September 2008 to 3.25 per cent (reverse repo rate) in April 2009. Second, the cash reserve ratio was reduced from 9.0 per cent in September 2008 to 5 per cent in January 2009 with a view to injecting liquidity into the banking system. Third, liquidity injection in bulk was made through purchase of government securities under open market operation (OMO) and unwinding of the balances under Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) through buy-back, redemptions and de-sequestering. Fourth, refinance facilities for export credit were enhanced. Measures were also taken for enhancing forex liquidity which included an upward adjustment of the interest rate ceiling on the deposits by non-resident Indians under FCNR (B) and NRE deposit accounts and relaxation in norms for external commercial borrowings (ECB). In view of the slowing economy and decelerating credit flow, the counter-cyclical regulatory measures introduced in 2006 were also reversed.  The unconventional measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India included; institution of a rupee-dollar swap facility for Indian banks to give them comfort in managing short-term foreign funding requirements of their overseas branches; special liquidity support to banks for on-lending to mutual funds and non-banking financial companies; liquidity support to non-banking financial companies through a special purpose vehicle created for the purpose and expansion of the lendable resources available to apex finance institutions for refinancing credit extended to small industries, housing and exports. The measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank during September 2008 – July 2009 have resulted in augmentation of actual/potential liquidity of Rs. 5, 61,700 cr.  The fiscal stimulus measures, undertaken in December 2008 and January 2009, included additional public spending as well as cuts in taxes. These stimulus packages came on top of an already announced expanded safety-net for rural poor, a farm loan waiver package and salary increases for government staff, all of which too stimulated demand. Taken together, the fiscal and monetary measures were successful in achieving their objectives. Financial markets and the banking sector began to function normally. Real GDP growth which took a hit in 2008–09 as it reached 6.8 per cent recovered quickly to reach 8.0 per cent in 2009–10 and 8.5 per cent in 2010–11 under the impact of stimulus measures as also the inherent strength of domestic demand. Strong recovery in demand, along with persistent supply pressures, however, led to inflationary pressures during 2010–2011.  e. Why was the impact on India muted? Despite its immediate impact on the financial markets and the trade flows, the crisis did not have very significant impact on the Indian financial system. The reasons for the muted impact is attributable primarily to (i) the macroprudential approach to regulation (ii) multiple indicator based monetary policy, (iii) calibrated capital account management, (iv) management of systemic interconnectedness, (v) robust market infrastructure for OTC transactions and (vi) a conservative approach towards financial innovation.  The monetary policy formulation by the Reserve Bank of India has been guided by multiple objectives and multiple instruments contrary to the approach followed by some countries of single objective and single instruments. Monitoring of multiple macroeconomic indicators has helped the Reserve Bank in interpreting developments in financial system and taking prompt corrective action. Similarly, measures such as putting in place robust systems for reducing counterparty risk in OTC transactions through CCP arrangements and regulation of shadow banking institutions to address the interconnectedness issues have helped in containing the impact of the crisis and helping the economy keep afloat despite the huge global turbulences.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11 III. Metamorphosis of the crisis into sovereign debt crisis: Just when the global economy was reverting to the normalcy, another crisis in the nature of sovereign debt crisis surfaced. The growing debts of many European sovereigns caused sustainability concerns forcing investors to withdraw from these markets which led to significant escalation of their CDS spreads. The crisis which emerged in late 2009 has engulfed the entire Eurozone by end 2011. While only Greek bonds had CDS spreads higher than 200 bps in April 2010, by Jan 2012, bonds of all countries except Germany, Finland and the Netherlands had CDS spreads higher than 200 bps. In fact, bonds of PIIGS countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) had CDS spreads even higher than 400 bps.  The combination of sluggish activity, bailouts and fiscal stimulus measures have led to ballooning of fiscal deficits and public debt/GDP ratios in major advanced economies and have raised concerns over fiscal sustainability. These concerns are most visible in euro area countries, which were plagued by various combinations of problems such as over-large banking sector that had become exposed to a housing boom and bust, an uncompetitive economy signaled by repeated current account deficits, and a bloated state sector with high private-sector unemployment6. For example, fiscal deficit/GDP ratios of advanced economies jumped from a near balance position (deficit of 0.6 per cent) in 2007 to 9.0 per cent in 2009, with that of the US jumping from 2.7 per cent to 13.0 per cent over the same period. Fiscal deficits of emerging economies also rose, albeit relatively modestly, from a surplus of 0.1 per cent in 2007 to a deficit 4.8 per cent in 2009. The public debt/GDP ratio for advanced economies increased from 73.4 per cent in 2007 to 93.7 per cent in 2009 and further to 103.5 per cent in 2011. The ratios for Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) over the same years were almost unchanged at 35.9 per cent, 36.7 per cent and 37.8 per cent.  The sovereign debt crisis, in a way has completed the circle – during the Global crisis 2007 the impact spread from banking system to sovereigns while in the current crisis, the impact is in the reverse direction, from sovereigns to banks. What makes the present crisis more disturbing is, in the Global crisis, when banks were under stress there was a backstop in the nature of sovereigns, but now sovereigns themselves are on the verge of default leaving everyone wonder as to what could be a backstop for a sovereign default.                                                  6  Coggan, Philip (2012) – “Paper Promises – Money, Debt and the New World Order”. 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches Impact of sovereign debt crisis on global economy: The current crisis has jeopardized the recovery plans put in place by regulators, policy makers and the sovereigns post global crisis. Despite the source and the immediate impact being localized in Eurozone, the knock on effects of the crisis are felt all across the globe. Financial conditions have deteriorated, growth prospects dimmed and downside risks have escalated. IMF’s World Economic Outlook has revised the Global output growth downwards to 3.25 per cent with the Euro area economy expected to go into a mild recession in 2012 as result of rise in sovereign yields, the effects of bank leveraging and the impact of additional fiscal consolidation. The EDEs are also expected to post lower growth on account of worsening external environment and a weakening internal demand.  Heightened risk aversion and deleveraging induced by the euro area crisis impacted financial markets across the globe. Despite European Union’s announcement of significant policy actions during December 2011, the financial markets continued to reel under stress in the backdrop of rating downgrade of European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) and nine euro area countries by S&P, of which four were downgraded by two notches. The CDS spreads and yields of sovereign debts in the euro area have increased substantially during the recent period. The inter-bank LIBOR market has been witnessing growing stress in terms of declining volume, rising rates and shortening of tenor of lending. The USD LIBOR-OIS spread and EURIBOR-OIS spread have widened significantly implying increased counterparty credit risk premium. The equity markets across the globe have witnessed sharp fall with increased volatility.  As regards the banking system, in countries directly impacted by the sovereign debt crisis such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, there was a persistent slowdown in bank credit through 2011. In countries peripherally affected by the crisis such as France and Germany, the credit growth which was showing signs of revival in 2010, has dipped again reflecting the impact of the deepening of the sovereign debt crisis. The asset quality, as reflected in NPL ratios, continued to deteriorate in Eurozone countries.  Apart from raising credit risks, the sovereign crisis has also increased funding risks for Euro zone banks. As per an analysis by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), banks in Greece, Ireland and Portugal have increasingly found it difficult to raise wholesale debt and deposits, and have become reliant on central bank liquidity.7 The increase in the cost of wholesale funding has also partially affected banks in other European countries.  According to the BIS, there are, broadly, four channels through which sovereign risk affect banks’ funding costs, given the pervasive role of government debt in the financial system. i. First, losses associated with government debt weaken balance sheets of banks making funding more costly and difficult to obtain.  ii. Second, higher sovereign risks reduce the value of the collateral that banks can use to raise wholesale funding and central bank liquidity.  iii. Third, sovereign rating downgrades generally flow through to lower ratings for domestic banks as banks are more likely than other sectors to be affected by sovereign distress. As the banks’ credit ratings decline, their wholesale funding costs rise.  iv. Fourth, a weakening of the sovereign reduces the funding benefits that banks could derive from implicit and explicit government guarantees.                                                   7  Bank for International Settlements (2011), The Impact of Sovereign Credit Risk on Bank Funding Conditions, July. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13 Impact of sovereign debt crisis on India: With the euro area appearing to head for a recession and the global growth slowing again after a short recovery, growth in India too has moderated more than was expected earlier. Increase in global uncertainty, weak industrial growth, slow down in investment activity and deceleration in the resource flow to commercial sector led to dip in output growth. Inflation risks emanating from suppressed domestic energy prices, incomplete pass-through of rupee depreciation and slippage in fiscal deficit, further fuelled by food and commodity inflation have led to policy tightening. All these factors have resulted in the growth projection for India for 2011–12 being revised downwards from 7.6 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Indian banking system has, however, not been impacted by current crisis as it does not have any significant presence in countries impacted by the current crisis nor Indian banks have any significant exposures to bonds issued by them. While there is no first order impact of the sovereign debt crisis, there could, however, be second-order impact through various channels including trade. There could be funding constraints for Indian bank branches operating overseas if European banks deleverage. The cost of borrowing for banks and corporates may, therefore, go up leading to concerns over refinancing foreign currency liabilities. Due to the slump in the overseas demand and the associated downturn in investment activity, there has already been some sluggishness in the credit as well as asset growth of Indian banking sector during 2011–12.  The crisis also had a measurable impact on the Indian financial markets, with equity prices witnessing sharp decline on account of large net sales by FIIs in the backdrop of worsening macroeconomic environment and bearish outlook on earning growth of Indian corporates. Further, moderation in capital flow coupled with widening trade deficit led to a sharp fall in the INR-USD exchange rate to touch an all time low of 54.30 on December 15, 2011.  Reserve Bank has taken a number of measures to contain the excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market. The prudential measures undertaken with a view to contain speculative activities included disallowing rebooking of cancelled forward transactions (involving the Rupee as one of the currencies which are booked to hedge current account transactions regardless of the tenor and capital account transactions falling due within one year), reduction in Net Overnight Open Position Limits of Authorised Dealer (AD) banks, curtailment in limit for cancellation of forward contracts booked on the basis of past performance route by the importers, prohibiting passing of exchange gains to the customers on cancellation of forward contracts booked under past performance route, disallowing FIIs to rebook cancelled forward contracts, stipulating all cash/tom/spot transactions to be delivery/ remittance based. With a view to encouraging inflows, measures such as raising the limits on FII investments in debt securities, further liberalisation of ECB policy, relaxation of interest rate ceilings on NRE and NRO deposits, have been taken.   
14 BIS central bankers’ speeches IV.  Takeaways from the crisis: Notwithstanding the risk of sounding cliché’ I cannot contain myself to remind you that every cloud has a silver lining and every crisis brings with it, a lesson. The Global crisis 2007 and the current sovereign debt crisis offer, in fact, many lessons and the analysts are busy deciphering one each day. While there are many regulatory and policy lessons that have come to the fore and are under various stages of implementation, I would flag some takeaways which would be most relevant for you as you prepare to enter into the professional world which is currently beset with crises. Takeaway 1: Too much of anything is bad You must have often heard your grandmother saying this and, mind you, this remains relevant even today, in fact more today, post crisis. Too much of leverage, too much of liquidity, too much of complexity and too much of greed – they all have led to the crisis. It is now being argued that too much of finance is also not conducive to growth. Recent studies8 suggest that while at low levels a larger financial system leads to higher productivity, beyond a point, more banking and more credit result in lower growth. Further, it is also argued that fast growing financial sector can be detrimental to the aggregate productivity growth. Moderation in approach, therefore, is an important lesson.  Takeaway 2: Models are not absolute In the run up to the crisis, there was an excessive reliance and almost a blind faith that models convey absolute truths. Entire risk management systems were built around this belief. Post crisis, participants have woken up to the harsh reality that models do not fully reflect the realities of life and excessive reliance on quantitative models is fraught with risk. Exact sciences such as physics are governed by nature’s laws that are immutable and lead to definite and predictable results. Finance on the other hand, is governed by capricious human behavior and biases which cannot be easily modeled. To an argument that models with all their limitations are better than not having any, Nassim Taleb has said “ You are worse of relying on misleading information than on not having any information at all. If you give a pilot an altimeter that is sometimes defective he will crash the plane. Give him nothing and he will look out the window” Knowing the shortcomings of the models is, therefore, extremely important for their judicious usage. Takeaway 3: Finance should serve the real sector and not the converse While it is agreed that financial system furthers the economic development by enabling efficient allocation of capital and risk, the ultimate objective of finance, which is the furthering of economic development should not be lost sight of. In the period prior to crisis, the financial activity grew so much that the umbilical cord between financial and real sectors was severed and the finance started to exist for its own sake. The dangers of such a scenario have been quite emphatically conveyed by the Crisis. With these thoughts, I conclude my address. I thank you all for your patient hearing and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ben S Bernanke: The European economic and financial situation Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Government Oversight and Reform, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 21 March 2012. *      *      * Thank you, Chairman Issa, Ranking Member Cummings, and other members of the Committee for inviting me to testify about the economic and financial situation in Europe and the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in response.  Developments in Europe and their effects on the U.S. Economy For almost two years, developments in Europe have had an important influence on the tenor of global financial markets and on the global economy more generally. The combination of high debts, large deficits, and poor growth prospects in several countries using the euro has raised concerns about fiscal sustainability and, consequently, led to sharply higher sovereign borrowing costs – initially for Greece, but subsequently for other euro-area countries as well. Pessimism about these countries’ fiscal and economic situations, in turn, has undermined confidence in the strength of European financial institutions, increasing the cost and difficulty those institutions have faced in obtaining funding and reducing their willingness to supply credit.  The difficulties in the euro area have affected the U.S. economy. The European Union accounts for roughly one-fifth of U.S. exports of goods and services. Not surprisingly, U.S. exports to Europe over the past two years have underperformed our exports to the rest of the world. In addition, weaker demand from Europe has slowed growth in other economies, which has also lowered foreign demand for our products.  Financial strains in Europe have also shown through to our financial markets. During times when financial conditions in Europe were at their most turbulent, investors around the world retreated from riskier assets. In the United States, these pullbacks decreased stock prices, increased the costs of issuing corporate debt, and reduced consumer and business confidence. In addition, U.S. financial institutions that were thought to have substantial exposures to Europe saw their stock prices fall and their credit spreads widen.  In the past few months, financial stresses in Europe have lessened, which has contributed to an improved tone of financial markets around the world, including in the United States. The improvement reflects, in part, a number of actions taken by European policymakers. First, measures taken by the European Central Bank (ECB), including implementing two longer-term refinancing operations and easing collateral rules and reserve requirements, have allowed European banks to lock in funding for up to three years, thereby alleviating concerns about their near-term prospects. With the benefit of this support, European banks in turn have increased their holdings of sovereign debt, contributing to lower borrowing costs for some countries.  Second, euro-area leaders, the Greek government, and private-sector holders of Greek debt are taking steps to put Greece on a more sustainable fiscal path. Its sovereign debt has been significantly reduced, the Greek authorities are intensifying their efforts to implement fiscal and structural reforms, and the European Union and International Monetary Fund have pledged a considerable amount of new funds as part of a second assistance package. The Greek economy remains in a deep recession, however.  Third and finally, leaders of most of the members of the European Union have approved a new fiscal compact treaty that strengthens fiscal rules and their enforcement. This treaty represents a positive step toward resolving the fundamental tension inherent in having a 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches monetary union without a fiscal union, and thus should help bolster the viability of the euro-area economy in the longer term.  Although progress has been made, more needs to be done. Full resolution of the crisis will require a further strengthening of the European banking system; a significant expansion of financial backstops, or “firewalls,” to guard against contagion in sovereign debt markets; and, critically, continued efforts to increase economic growth and competitiveness and to reduce external imbalances in the troubled countries.  Actions taken by the Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve has followed developments in Europe closely, and we are in frequent contact with key European policymakers. We are particularly focused on protecting U.S. financial institutions, businesses, and consumers from adverse financial and economic developments in Europe.  To help calm dollar funding markets and support the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses, the Federal Reserve acted in concert with major foreign central banks to enhance the U.S. dollar swap facilities that were originally put in place during the global financial crisis and reestablished in May 2010. Use of the reestablished lines was limited until late last year. However, in late November, the Federal Reserve agreed with the ECB and the central banks of Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to extend the swap lines through February 2013 and to reduce their pricing, from a spread of 100 basis points over the overnight index swap rate to 50 basis points.1  The lower cost to the ECB and other foreign central banks enabled them, in turn, to reduce the cost of the short-term dollar loans they provide to financial institutions in their jurisdictions. As a result, usage of the swap line increased considerably, peaking at $109billion in mid-February. The expanded use of the swap lines has helped to ease funding pressures on European and other foreign banks, lower tensions in U.S. money markets (in which foreign banks are major participants), alleviate pressures on foreign banks to reduce their lending in the United States, and boost confidence at a time of considerable strain in international financial markets. In recent weeks, as market conditions have improved, usage of the swap lines has fallen back to about $65 billion.  I would add that the swaps are very safe from the perspective of the Federal Reserve and the U.S. taxpayer. They present no exchange rate or interest rate risk; each drawing has a short maturity and must be approved by the Federal Reserve; they are collateralized by the foreign currencies for which dollars are swapped; and our counterparties are the foreign central banks, not the foreign commercial banks that receive the dollar loans.2  In addition to its actions to reduce pressures in global markets for dollar funding, the Federal Reserve has collaborated with other agencies – both bilaterally and through the Financial Stability Oversight Council – to monitor the potential vulnerabilities of U.S. financial institutions and to work to enhance their resilience in the face of possible shocks to the global economy. Notably, U.S. financial institutions have very limited direct net credit exposures to                                                  1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), “Coordinated Central Bank Action to Address Pressures in Global Money Markets,” press release, November 30. Similar announcements appeared on the websites of the other participating central banks. 2 For the outstanding amount of dollar funding through the swap lines as it appears each week in the Federal Reserve balance sheet, see www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 the most vulnerable euro-area countries, and U.S. money market funds also have almost no exposure to those countries.  U.S. financial institutions do have some gross exposure to potential losses arising from sales of credit default swap (CDS) protection referencing European sovereign debt. However, for the large U.S. dealer banks, these sales have been more than offset by purchases of protection, which would imply that in the event of a sovereign default, U.S. financial institutions would be net recipients of CDS payouts. These positions still carry some risk in that some U.S. banks’ counterparties might conceivably fail to make good on their obligations, but such risk is mitigated by the fact that the counterparties to large U.S. dealer banks for sovereign CDS trades are dispersed, primarily across large financial institutions. And in the vast majority of cases, these institutions post collateral to each other to help minimize possible losses.  Although U.S. banks have limited exposure to peripheral European countries, their exposures to European banks and to the larger, “core” countries of Europe are more material. Moreover, European holdings represented 35 percent of the assets of prime U.S. money market funds in February, and these funds remain structurally vulnerable despite some constructive steps, such as improved liquidity requirements, taken since the recent financial crisis. U.S. financial firms and money market funds have had time to adjust their exposures and hedge their risks to some degree as the European situation has evolved, but the risks of contagion remain a concern for both these institutions and their supervisors and regulators. In particular, were the situation in Europe to take a severe turn for the worse, the U.S. financial sector likely would have to contend not only with problems stemming from its direct European exposures, but also with an array of broader market movements, including declines in global equity prices, increased credit costs, and reduced availability of funding.  To address these broader risks, we have been working closely with large U.S. financial institutions. Most recently, on March 13, we released results from our Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) – a supervisory assessment by the Federal Reserve of the capital planning processes and capital adequacy of large, complex bank holding companies.3 As part of this exercise, bank capital positions were evaluated under a hypothetical stress scenario that involved a deep recession in the United States (with unemployment reaching 13 percent) and a notable decline in activity abroad, combined with sharp decreases in both domestic and global asset prices. This exercise was designed to capture both the direct and indirect exposures and vulnerabilities of U.S. financial institutions to the economic and financial stresses that might arise from a severe crisis in Europe. The results show that a significant majority of the largest U.S. banks would continue to meet supervisory expectations for capital adequacy despite large projected losses in an extremely adverse hypothetical scenario.  Conclusion The recent reduction in financial stresses in Europe is a welcome development for the United States, given the important trade and financial linkages connecting our economies. However, Europe’s financial and economic situation remains difficult, and it is critical that the European leaders follow through on their policy commitments to ensure a lasting stabilization. I believe that our European counterparts understand the challenges and risks they face and are committed to take the necessary steps to address those issues.  For our part, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor the situation closely, work with our financial institutions and foreign counterparts to enhance the resilience of our financial                                                  3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Announces Summary Results of Latest Round of Bank Stress Tests,” press release, March 13.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Malcolm Edey: The current agenda in retail payments regulation Address by Mr Malcolm Edey, Assistant Governor (Financial System) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Cards & Payments Australasia 2012 Conference, Sydney, 20 March 2012. *      *      * Once again I thank the organisers of Cards and Payments Australasia for the invitation to speak here today, my third time at this event. Looking at the conference agenda for these two days, what stands out to me is the intense focus on innovation. This is an industry where there is a great deal of work going on in areas like online payments, mobile payments, new card-payment products, and improvements in security. All of these are signs of a vibrant industry.  My subject for today is the current agenda in retail payments regulation.  The Reserve Bank has had a direct role in payments regulation since 1998. Following the report of the Wallis Committee, the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act in that year established the basic governing structure that we have today. It set up the Payments System Board within the Reserve Bank with a mandate to promote efficiency and stability. And the Act gave the Bank significant powers to that end. They include the power to designate a payment system and to set standards in areas like network pricing and various aspects of a payment system’s internal rules.  One of the first areas of focus for the Board was on credit card schemes. But the remit of the Payments System Board extends much more broadly than just card payments, or even retail payments more generally. The Board also has oversight responsibilities in the high-value system as well as for clearing and settlement facilities in Australia, and it has been increasingly devoting attention to the second of those areas. I expect that trend will continue, given the rapid changes that are taking place internationally.  Today, though, I want to focus on our work on retail payments.  Public consultation is an important part of that work. In some matters we have a formal obligation to consult, but that is not the only reason for doing it. The issues involved in payments regulation are often complex and we see it as very important to engage with industry, and other stakeholders, to make sure we have all the relevant facts when we make our decisions.  Currently there are four areas of retail payments regulation where we are in various stages of public consultation. I want to take the opportunity to review those briefly today.  The first is the surcharging standard for card payments.  The question here is a simple one: should card schemes be allowed to place limits on merchant surcharging for card payments, and if so, in what form? That question was first examined by the Payments System Board during its initial round of credit card reforms, which were announced in 2002. The Board’s decision, as you know, was to require the removal of rules against surcharging. That was part of a wider reform package that also included a standard for interchange fees.  A newcomer to this debate might ask the question, why did we take action against no-surcharge rules when the effect would be to make some cardholders pay more for their transactions?  It’s worth briefly re-capping the answer to that.  One of the distinctive features of card payment systems, historically, has been a lack of alignment between pricing and decision-making power. In a typical credit card transaction, the person who makes the choice of payment instrument is usually the cardholder, but the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches transaction fee is incurred by the merchant. In simple terms, the cardholder makes the decision but the merchant pays the fee.  The interchange arrangements that underpin this fee structure have tended to be configured in a way that rewards issuance and usage of cards while adding to merchant costs. We have observed in this structure that competition tends to push fees up rather than down because, the higher the fee, the greater the capacity to reward cardholders for using a given card. Scheme rules prohibiting surcharging have had the effect of reinforcing that pattern, because they prevent price signals from flowing to the person who chooses the payment instrument. This was the basic logic for the decision to prevent schemes from making rules against surcharging.  A decade later, what can we say about the effects of that decision?  I can best answer that by describing the results of the reform package as a whole, because the different elements of it were closely inter-related. The clearest impact has been a reduction in card payment costs. In the case of the four-party credit card schemes, the average merchant service fee has fallen by about 60 basis points. Although the three-party schemes are not regulated in this way, they have voluntarily accepted the surcharging standard and have been subject to some of the same competitive pressures. As a result, merchant service fees for the three-party schemes have fallen by a similar amount.  Since the adoption of the reforms, the prevalence of surcharging has significantly increased. According to data from East & Partners, around one-third of Australian merchants now impose a surcharge on at least one of the credit cards they accept. The figure is higher for the largest merchants1, where the proportion surcharging is slightly over half. It also seems likely that surcharging will become more widespread in the future – only 12 per cent of merchants say they are not at least considering applying a surcharge.  In the early stage of the reform process the Payments System Board considered, but did not proceed with, an alternative approach that would have allowed schemes to limit surcharging to an amount linked to the cost of acceptance2. The Board’s view, on balance, was that giving merchants the right to surcharge was important in realigning incentives and in giving merchants more bargaining power in the determination of fees. The Board also took the view that market forces could be expected to work as a discipline against excessive surcharging.  The growth of surcharging has, however, brought to light practices that look inconsistent with the efficiency objective. While comprehensive data are not available, there is significant anecdotal evidence of some surcharging that is not reasonably related to the cost of acceptance. One example is the practice of blended surcharging, where a merchant might be recovering costs on an average basis without distinguishing between high- and low-cost card payments. Another would be where a surcharge simply exceeds any reasonable estimate of the cost of acceptance. Although these practices do not appear to be widespread, they are of concern from a payments efficiency point of view because they can distort consumer choices about the payment methods that they use. They go against the principle I stated earlier of allowing the efficient flow of price signals to the economic decision maker. It is for these reasons that the Bank reopened consideration of the surcharging standard last year  A draft revision to the standard was released in December, and is now in the final stage of consultation. If adopted, the revised standard will allow schemes to limit surcharging to a reasonable cost of acceptance, but schemes will not be able to prohibit surcharging altogether or prevent merchants from recovering their costs. For this purpose, the cost of acceptance will be defined as including, but not being necessarily limited to, the merchant service fee.                                                   1 Currently, those with annual turnover greater than $530 million. 2 The existing Standard does allow the merchant and the acquirer to agree to do so. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 I want to stress that we should not view this change as a panacea that will do away with every consumer complaint. It is also important to make clear that the Reserve Bank is not setting itself up as a regulator of merchant behaviour. What the proposed standard does is to empower the schemes to take action where surcharging is clearly excessive. It will be in their own interests to make use of this power. At the same time, the proposal preserves the original goal of giving merchants the right to recover their costs. In that way I think it strikes a reasonable balance and it should strengthen the incentive for schemes to compete in lowering their fees to merchants. The less a scheme costs to merchants, the lower will be the permissible surcharge.  The second policy area I want to talk about is the Reserve Bank’s strategic review of payments innovation.  This was the subject of my talk here a year ago and so I can be much briefer in my remarks today.  When we talk about innovation, we need always to keep in mind the distinction between what is proprietary and what is systemic. The proprietary sphere covers any area where a service provider can act independently and use an innovation to gain a competitive edge. The payments industry is very good at innovating in that way, and we see the evidence of it in many of the things that are being talked about in today’s conference. Systemic innovation is much harder to achieve because it requires co-operation in the collective interest, even when there may be no strong proprietary benefits at the level of the individual service provider  It’s this second area that is the focus of the current review. We are asking the question, are there any gaps in the system that can only be addressed collectively, and if so, how do we make that happen?  Submissions to the review have been helpful in identifying a number of gaps of that nature. Here are the main ones:   Transmission of data with payments. This has been a long-time concern of businesses, who often find the 18 character limit under the Direct Entry system too restrictive. Often this drives businesses to use cheques so that paper-based information, like an invoice, can accompany the payment. Alternatively they might separate the payment and the remittance information, and then rely on a separate process to reconcile them at a later stage. This is likely to be expensive and error prone.   Use of international standards. I won’t dwell on this one, but in some ways it is related to the previous point, because the international framework for messaging standards provides for transmission of a significant amount of additional data. I think there is widespread acknowledgement within the payments industry that international standards should be adopted wherever possible.   Timeliness of Payments. As communications technology advances, there is little doubt that people are expecting greater immediacy in many areas, and payments are no exception. It is currently not possible for me to make a payment to someone who banks with another bank and for them to be able to use those funds within a short space of time. In some circumstances this lack of capacity can be a significant problem – for instance when someone is waiting on an emergency government payment. This seems like an area we could improve on and it is increasingly becoming a focus overseas. Likewise, the fact that payments cannot occur between banks out of normal business hours seems out of line with the ‘always on’ world we now live in.   Addressing Payments. Cheques are always a good reminder of the things that are missing in our electronic payments. I can pay someone with a cheque when all I know about them is their name. But if I want to make an electronic payment, I 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches typically need to know a 6-digit BSB number and a 9-digit account number, things the receiver probably cannot readily provide. People are finding partial workarounds that make use of mobile phone numbers or email addresses, but we are yet to have a truly seamless system.  All of these are areas where any progress will have to be made co-operatively, because they are characteristics of the network, not just of the individual players. But that also means that a decision to move ahead in any of these areas needs to take into account the costs and benefits across the system as a whole, both for service providers and end-users.  That raises the broader question of whether there needs to be a change in governance arrangements in the industry, so as to make them more conducive to innovation in general. There are a number of reasons why co-operative innovation can be hard to achieve. Industry participants have differing commercial interests, and even factors like the timing of their investment cycles can make coordinated actions difficult. A change in messaging standards or timeliness of payments might benefit the public, yet remain hard to achieve because there is no proprietary benefit to the individual service providers. The challenge is to find a way of determining when innovations of that nature are in the public interest and, if so, to ensure they go ahead. Industry-level decision making may be only part of the answer.  Along with these questions of governance, the critical decisions of the review are likely to relate to the architecture of the payments system. By that I mean in particular the question of whether there is a place for additional centralised architecture in the Australian payments system. A possible argument for that proposition is that centralised systems may be better able to innovate than bilateral systems. They may also be structurally more efficient when a network has a large number of participants, and better suited to providing open access to new players. The possible need for a centralised architecture is also relevant to the question of faster (or real-time) payments at the retail level.  The consultation process has brought out a range of views on this subject. Some argued that the existing architecture provided a sufficient level of centralisation, or pointed to the potential cost of moving existing systems onto a hub. Others focused on the potential for some form of hub to provide real-time retail transfers and went as far as proposing a governance framework for such a system. We should be in a position to announce some conclusion on that in the near future, along with the other matters I’ve outlined today.  Let me turn briefly to the third and fourth areas of current policy work.  Issue number three is the regulatory framework for the eftpos system.  One of the very significant developments in recent times has been the establishment of ePAL as a national scheme for eftpos payments. The Reserve Bank has welcomed that development because we see it as strengthening competition among card payment schemes in the domestic market.  As a consequence of the establishment of ePAL, the eftpos system now works largely as a multilateral network. But much of the existing framework – the Access Regime and interchange fee standards – was designed in reference to the earlier bilaterally-based system. As a result, the relevance and applicability of the existing framework will need to be reviewed.  One change that has already been made was the decision in November 2009 to bring multilateral eftpos fees under the same interchange fee standard as applies to scheme debit cards. But further changes to all elements of the regulatory framework for the eftpos system will need to be considered. Some of the reasons for that are purely technical, because the regulations as they stand do not reflect the system’s current structure. But there are also some more substantive questions as to whether we need to maintain the currently existing arrangements and, if so, in what form. We expect to complete the consultation on those questions and reach conclusions later in the year.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 The fourth issue on which we are currently consulting is retail payments system resilience.  Much of the work of the Payments System Board over the years has been in regulation and oversight of what we might call self-contained systems: things like a credit card network, or a clearing and settlement facility. But the Board’s remit extends more broadly to the efficiency and stability of the payments system as a whole. On any common sense reading, the payments system encompasses the capacity of person A to make a payment to person B when they bank with different banks. The ability of the system as a whole to deliver that basic service, dependably and efficiently, clearly comes under the Payments System Board’s overall policy mandate.  That is why it is appropriate for the Board to be conducting the innovation review that I’ve just outlined. It relates to the efficiency of the system as a whole. It is also why it is appropriate for the Board to take an interest in the operational resilience of individual payments service providers.  In recent years there have been a number of high-profile outages affecting the availability of services to significant numbers of customers. Obviously individual banks have a strong incentive to minimise the risk of these sorts of incidents. It affects their own reputation when something goes wrong and it impairs their ability to meet the needs of their customers.  But there is also a system-wide dimension to these problems. All participants in the system, and all users of payments services, have an interest in high standards being maintained across the system as a whole, not just their own component of it. When Bank A’s systems go down, customers of all the other banks are affected, because their capacity to exchange payments with customers of that bank is impaired.  For some time the Reserve Bank has been monitoring significant retail payment outages, and following up with the relevant banks as to diagnosis and appropriate remedial actions. So in a sense, a role for the RBA in this area is not new. What we are now proposing is to formalise that role in two ways. First, we have announced that we will be putting in place a more systematic reporting regime for retail outages. And second, we have begun a consultation process with the banks as to whether further measures are needed to improve operational resilience across the system.  Conclusion Those then are the four areas in retail payments regulation where the Reserve Bank is currently conducting consultations with industry, and with other interested parties. What ties all of these things together is the focus on efficiency and competition. In many ways competition is working well to deliver benefits to end users. But in an industry of complex network interactions like this one, there is an important role for regulation in promoting efficient outcomes.  As I said earlier, in carrying out that role the Payments System Board takes very seriously the need to consult, both with industry and end-users. Many of you here today will have participated in that process, and I take the opportunity to thank you for your co-operation.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Rodrigo Vergara: The global economic scenario and monetary policy management Speech by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the 2012 Latin American Forum of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Montevideo, Uruguay, 17 March 1012. *      *      * I thank Luis Oscar Herrera, Enrique Orellana and Tatiana Vargas for helpful comments. Thank you for inviting me to speak at the 2012 meeting of the IIF Latin American Economic Forum. This is my first time here as governor of the Central Bank of Chile. I have been asked to share with you some thoughts on the impact on our region of the crisis that is affecting the developed world, especially of how we can confront it using policy instruments, and the challenges that lie ahead of us. These last years have been very challenging in terms of the evolution of macroeconomic conditions in our region and worldwide. After the crises in Argentina and Brazil of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for the most part Latin American economies experienced a period of sustained growth, lower unemployment and a drop or relative stability of inflation rates. Nonetheless, towards the end of the past decade this state was abruptly interrupted by the international financial crisis. The worst came with the fall of Lehman Brothers in September of 2008. The abrupt and significant collapse of global demand caused serious problems in all our economies. Terms of trade plummeted and soon we were facing a completely different picture. Economic policy reaction came promptly. In Chile, and other Latin American countries, we implemented a combination of fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy. More important was the fact that probably for the first time, a crisis of the magnitude that affected  – and still affects – developed countries, did not cause Latin American economies to enter into a balance of payments crisis or a profound recession. Suffice it to remember what happened in the early 1980s, when our own weaknesses and the shortcomings of economic policies, coupled with a significant rise in interest rates worldwide, dragged us into a deep recession. This is of utmost importance as it shows that we have matured in economic policy framework and that we face the challenge not only of maintaining but also of improving it. After some quarters, the world economy began to recover gradually. This process took place at two speeds. Emerging economies recovered at a fast pace, while developed countries experienced a slower rebound. The causes and consequences of the Great Recession continue to affect economic performance of the developed world. This is so because the fundamental problem, high indebtedness of households, companies and governments, is still present. The fact that the higher the level of debt the more costly the solutions and greater the side-effects, poses a problem. We have been seeing this clearly during recent quarters. You may recall that just a year ago the main problem faced by emerging economies was how to deal with inflationary pressures, given the narrowing of domestic capacity gaps and the rise in prices of commodities in international markets. This happened at the same time as the two-speed recovery process I just mentioned was accompanied by an interest rate differential that redirected capital flows towards emerging markets, exerting strong pressures to appreciate our currencies. Our concern then was the pace at which we would lower impulse to our economies, taking care that it did not intensify pressures on the exchange rate and cause new imbalances. Only six months later our major concern had changed dramatically. The intensification of financial tensions in the developed economies drastically changed our perception of the future of the global economy. Financial markets drastically picked up this change of mood 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches and very quickly we saw, among other developments, drops in stock prices, hikes in risk premiums, and reductions in the prices of commodities. The tough discussions held in the United States on fiscal issues, together with the weakness of its economic data towards mid-year, fueled these negative perceptions. Overall, emerging economies dramatically changed their perceptions and communication as to the future of monetary policy. Between August and October, probably on the peak moments of the last financial turbulences in the developed world, many central banks stopped the process of interest rate raises, and many also changed the direction of changes in their monetary policies to more expansive ones. In Chile, after raising MPR by 200 basis points during the first half of 2011 and stating that there were still some increases to be made, in August we moved towards a neutral stance. In October, considering the envisaged consequences of the deterioration of the international scenario, we announced that we would increase monetary impulse if we foresaw that this situation could have a negative impact on our economy. Thus, in January of this year we lowered the MPR by 25 basis points. Now we have announced that new monetary policy actions will depend both on our assessment of the effects of the international scenario on the domestic economy as well as on the evolution of the domestic economy itself. Allow me to present you our vision of what is going on in the world and how it will affect us. Particularly, to do so from a monetary policy perspective. The current international scenario The onset of 2012 has surprised us with a considerably calmer state of affairs than we expected a few months ago. The Eurozone situation is far from being solved. There are many challenges ahead, among them increasing productivity in many peripheral economies. Nonetheless, significant progress has been made. The European Central Bank (ECB) has provided long-term liquidity to the financial sector, European leaders have placed conditions on this financing, governments have agreed on adjustment plans that seem to go in the right direction, and it seems as time has been bought to address the more structural problems that are still present in the Eurozone. Financial markets have understood this, and risk indicators and monetary conditions have improved. Consensus forecasts on world growth point to a performance of the global economy below that of 2011. Nonetheless, the degree of downward correction has diminished noticeably in the latest data. Does this mean that circumstances in developed countries have reached a point beyond which we must not expect other significant setbacks? This is not so in my opinion. Allow me to give you some background. As mentioned, the solution to the Eurozone’s problems is still far ahead. Its economy is in recession and the necessary adjustments are expensive and highly unpopular among the population. Some economies have very high unemployment and a very fragile fiscal situation. If anything, measures adopted up to now have put a firewall to isolate systemically relevant economies from greater disaster. Also, financial conditions have improved these last weeks, mainly due to the ECB’s LTRO initiative. With it, the concern over the region’s banking sector financing needs has been dealt with. However, serious fiscal and financial problems and macroeconomic imbalances continue to exist in the Eurozone. In response to high unemployment and low growth, banks’ portfolios deteriorated. On the other hand, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has demanded a capital increase of the system’s major banks. Finally, US dollar financing pressure persists in some major banks. This has resulted in more stringent credit conditions, which may continue and have a profound impact particularly on small and medium-sized businesses and, eventually, on some countries’ foreign trade. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The situation of the Eurozone is complex and we cannot rule out as a possible risk scenario a disorderly default of peripheral economies, due to the challenging debt maturity profile they face. This high risk scenario is, however, less likely that at the end of last year. The US economic data of the last months have been a pleasant surprise. The labor market and households’ expenditure seem to have behaved better than forecast. Although, the difficulties that persist in the labor market and the fiscal adjustments that are needed explain the continuing doubts as to how true and sustainable the recovery we are currently witnessing is. In spite of the more positive indicators, the Fed authorities extended from 2013 to 2014 the period in which it expects to keep interest rate at minimum levels. Certainly, the problem of fiscal indebtedness continues. In emerging countries the data are diverse. Over the course of the second half of 2011 we witnessed a generalized deterioration of consumer and business expectations. Neither case can be compared to what happened between late 2008 and the beginning of 2009. Generally, the data show a deceleration of activity. Nonetheless, it is difficult to identify how much of this decline is due to a lower external stimulus, how much is accounted for by a natural slowdown in each economy, and what part is explained by particular events. All these elements add up to a situation in which, although the external scenario is not worsening, the belief that risks have disappeared is far off. It is possible to think that the likelihood of extreme scenarios is low, but, in my opinion, it is still there. More challenges for monetary policy As already mentioned, the change in how the global panorama was perceived led many emerging economies to change their views on their future economic policies. This made them halt their processes of lowering expansiveness and/or made them resume impulse. However, the new change of mood brought about by the greater calm of the beginning of the year, coupled with geopolitical factors, has again put us in a dilemma. On one hand, probably as a result of the recent memory of the late 2008 and early 2009 global confidence crisis, most economic authorities quickly set up a close monitoring system and prepared a batch of instruments to implement a quick offsetting of the adverse effects of a global crisis. However, time has shown that the effects of the crisis of the Eurozone area have been fairly limited so far. Financial markets have suffered the biggest impacts, but trade, output and employment have not been greatly affected. In Chile, activity and domestic demand, specially consumption, have not worsened significantly. This does not mean that our vision of the effects that the crisis in the developed world will have on our economy or the rest of the world has changed. However, it is a fact that activity at the beginning of the year is at a higher level than we envisaged a few months ago. On the other hand, this has been compounded by an increase in the oil price. Political tensions in the Middle East have again put pressure on this price, thus affecting domestic prices. The effects of a higher oil price can be interpreted at least twofold, with opposing implications for monetary policy. On one hand, in a situation of tight output gaps – as is the case of many emerging economies, Chile among them – an increase in the price of energy may exacerbate domestic inflationary pressure, making the dynamics of inflation more complex and demanding great care when assessing the evolution of the inflation trend. On the other hand, in the face of existing risk scenarios, an increase in the oil price also has a negative effect on world activity. If we take into account the fragile state of households, businesses and governments in the developed world, a higher price of energy may further weaken their position and lead to a more lasting and deeper economic fragility. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches A third factor that has added difficulty to monetary policy management is a renewed concern over capital flows towards the emerging world. The change in investors’ mood has made them look for other markets in which to invest, and has led to a widespread appreciation of emerging countries’ currencies. As usual, this has rekindled a debate that was present in our discussions a year back, as to the convenience of implementing measures to avoid currencies from appreciating. Last year several emerging economies, among them Chile, intervened their exchange markets using different mechanisms. This year some emerging economies have continued to do so. Clearly, the discussion as to the convenience or not of performing such actions remains unresolved. The first thing to bear in mind is that in small open economies, all efforts to persistently keep the exchange rate at levels beyond margins aligned with the fundamentals, particularly at overvalued levels, are not sustainable and may eventually generate higher inflation. We are convinced that a floating exchange rate regime is the most appropriate one for the Chilean economy, as it facilitates macroeconomic and external accounts adjustments. Nonetheless, certain circumstances may lead the Central Bank to intervene in the forex market, either to maintain an adequate international reserve position or to respond to overreactions of the exchange parity beyond its long-term fundamentals. However, there are costs associated to this type of intervention. A first cost is that it may create confusion as to the objective of the monetary authorities: inflation or the exchange rate. In our case, we have dealt with this through transparent mechanisms whereby we anticipate the amounts and terms of interventions, and by maintaining a flexible exchange rate. In addition it has always been clear that the exchange rate is not an objective and the main goal of the Central Bank is price stability. A second cost is of a financial nature. Foreign reserves are invested in highly liquid and secure instruments of developed countries, whose interest rates are lower than those of domestic instruments used to finance their acquisition. Conversely, the benefits of having these reserves are the enhanced security they provide in case of an abrupt cut of external financing. These benefits are hard to measure, but it is reasonable to expect that they will decline as the availability of reserves increases, as has been occurring in Chile since 2008. Allow me to express some final thoughts. Final thoughts News during these last weeks have led us to a scenario in which the effects of the deteriorating external situation that we forecast some time back are not evident and in which inflationary pressures stemming from a higher cost of energy have resurfaced. Hence, if a few months ago it was clear that the most likely scenario for monetary policy in emerging economies was a further loosening, today it is much less clear so. Compounded to it is the renewed influx of capital flows towards emerging economies and the resulting appreciation of our currencies. Against this backdrop, managing monetary policy has become more complex. Today, our assessment continues to be that the crisis in the developed world will sooner or later affect the performance of our economies. It is possible that the impact will be less than what we thought some time ago, but to assume that nothing will happen does not seem sensible. Nonetheless, the difficulties involved in measuring the actual impact makes me very cautious in measuring the impulse required by each economy to offset the effects of the external scenario. Today, prudent monetary policy management has to be prepared for all kinds of scenarios and to adapt the amount of stimulus applied according to needs established on a case by case basis. As I said a moment ago, activity we see today is at a level above what we 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 forecast a few months back. In fact, in our latest Monetary Policy Meeting we decided to maintain the Monetary Policy Rate at 5% for a second month in a row. The current situation in developed economies is very complex, and teaches valuable lessons. On one hand, as to how imbalances that are not addressed on time end up creating enormous costs for the population. For those of us in charge of economic policy in our countries, it is absolutely essential that we strive to address these imbalances if they exist, and at the same time that we do not create them through our decisions. Over-stimulating the economy when output gaps are narrow and inflationary pressures have risen could lead to imbalances. I trust that they are not as sizeable as those of the developed world, but in any case solving them is always costly. On the other hand, it has taught us the relevance of maintaining and improving a good macroeconomic framework. In Chile, this framework rests on four pillars. First, monetary policy management is based on a flexible inflation-targeting regime, conducted by an autonomous central bank and supported by a floating exchange rate system. Second, a fiscal policy that is accountable and predictable thanks to a structural balance rule. The significant amount of savings accumulated during the run-up of copper prices has been a crucial factor in bolstering the resilience of the Chilean economy and in providing a countercyclical fiscal boost. Third, a high degree of commercial and financial integration with the rest of the world. Finally, a sound financial system, with globally integrated, well capitalized, and adequately-regulated banks. Our countries have suffered decades as a result of mistaken economic policies. The Great Recession showed that our current state of preparation to confront and mitigate the impact of an adverse scenario is much better than in the past, and that it is the path that we must continue. Undoubtedly, there are still many things to improve. Attaining a level of development such that prosperity reaches the whole population is still far away, but at least we are on the right track. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Charles I Plosser: Restoring central banks after the crisis Speech by Mr Charles I Plosser, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, at the conference of the Global Interdependence Center / Bank of France, Paris, 26 March 2012. *      *      * The views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC. Introduction I am delighted to be here today in this beautiful city and to have the honor to serve on such a distinguished panel with friends and colleagues. David Kotok has been the guiding force behind the GIC conferences over the past several years. He and his team at the GIC never fail to gather an interesting and knowledgeable group of people to discuss important topics on truly global issues. So, I want to thank him and the GIC for their efforts and contributions. I also want to thank our hosts, Christian Noyer and the Banque de France. I am going to take a little different tack on the subject matter of this gathering. Rather than focus on what new orthodoxy we should take away from the financial crisis, I want to argue that we need to restore some of the old orthodoxy. David did suggest that he wanted to have a conversation on important issues, so I intend to be somewhat provocative in an effort to stimulate such conversation. As usual, I want to stress that my views are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. I will focus my remarks on two related topics that have emerged as a consequence of the crisis. The first is the relation between monetary policy and fiscal policy. The second topic involves the role of a central bank’s balance sheet as a policy tool. These are issues that I believe are of fundamental importance to the role of central banks in our economies. The relationship between monetary and fiscal policies Let me begin by sharing some thoughts on the appropriate relationship between monetary and fiscal policies. In the wake of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession, many countries around the world responded with a significant increase in government spending. Some of this increase came about through what economists call automatic stabilizers. But there has also been a dramatic expansion in budget deficits attributable to deliberate efforts to apply fiscal stimulus to improve economic outcomes. This expansion in government spending has been very significant in the U.S., but it has also occurred in other countries. So what does this have to do with monetary policy? Well, it turns out, a great deal. It is widely understood that governments can finance expenditures through taxation, debt – that is, future taxes – or printing money. In this sense, monetary policy and fiscal policy are intertwined through the government budget constraint. For good reasons, though, societies have converged toward arrangements that provide a fair degree of separation between the functions of central banks and those of their fiscal authorities. For example, in a world of fiat currency, central banks are generally assigned the responsibility for establishing and maintaining the value or purchasing power of the nation’s unit of account. Yet, that task can be undermined, or completely subverted, if fiscal authorities set their budgets in a manner that ultimately requires the central bank to finance 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches government expenditures with significant amounts of seigniorage in lieu of current or future tax revenue.1 The ability of a central bank to maintain price stability can also be undermined when the central bank itself ventures into the realm of fiscal policy. History teaches us that unless governments are constrained institutionally or constitutionally, they often resort to the printing press to try to escape what appear to be intractable budget problems. And the budget problems faced by many governments today are, indeed, challenging. But history also teaches us that resorting to the printing press in lieu of making tough fiscal choices is a recipe for creating substantial inflation and, in some cases, hyperinflation. Awareness of these long-term consequences of excessive money creation is the reason that over the past 60 years, country after country has moved to establish and maintain independent central banks – that is, central banks that have the ability to make monetary policy decisions free from short-run political interference. Without the protections afforded by independence, the temptation of governments to exploit the printing press to avoid fiscal discipline is often just too great. Thus, it is simply good governance and wise economic policy to maintain a healthy separation between those responsible for tax and spending policy and those responsible for money creation. It is equally important for central banks that have been granted independence to be constrained from using their own authority to engage in activities that more appropriately belong to the fiscal authorities or the private sector. In other words, with independence comes responsibility and accountability. Central banks that breach their boundaries risk their legitimacy, credibility, and ultimately, their independence. Given the benefits of central bank independence, that could prove costly to society in the long run. There are a number of approaches to placing limits on independent central banks so that the boundaries between monetary policy and fiscal policy remain clear. First, the central bank can be given a narrow mandate, such as price stability. In fact, this has been a prominent trend during the last 25 years. Many major central banks now have price stability as their sole or primary mandate. Second, the central bank can be restricted as to the type of assets it can hold on its balance sheet. This limits its ability to engage in credit policies or resource allocations that rightfully belong under the purview of the fiscal authorities or the private marketplace. And third, the central bank can conduct monetary policy in a systematic or rule-like manner, which limits the scope of discretionary actions that might cross the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies. Milton Friedman’s famous k-percent money growth rule is one example, as are Taylor-type rules for the setting of the interest rate instrument.  Unfortunately, over the past few years, the combination of a financial crisis and sustained fiscal imbalances has led to a breakdown in the institutional framework and the previously accepted barriers between monetary and fiscal policies. The pressure has come from both sides. Governments are pushing central banks to exceed their monetary boundaries, and central banks are stepping into areas not previously viewed as appropriate for an independent central bank. Let me offer a couple of examples to illustrate these pressures. First, despite the well-known benefits of price stability, there are calls in many countries to abandon this commitment and create higher inflation to devalue outstanding nominal government and private debt. That is, some suggest that we should attempt to use inflation to solve the debt overhang problem.                                                  1 See Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace, “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic”, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review, 5 (Fall 1981), pp 1–17. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Such policies are intended to redistribute losses on nominal debt from the borrowers to the lenders. Using inflation as a backdoor to such fiscal choices is bad policy, in my view. Pressure on central banks is also showing up through other channels. In some circles, it has become fashionable to invoke lender-of-last-resort arguments as a rationale for central banks to lend to “insolvent” organizations, either failing businesses or, in some cases, failing governments. Such arguments go beyond the well-accepted principles established by Walter Bagehot, who wrote in his 1873 classic Lombard Street that central bankers could limit systemic risk in a banking crisis by “lending freely at a penalty rate against good collateral”. Central bankers have abandoned this basic Bagehot principle in the last few years but have not replaced it with a clear alternative. Indeed, actions were often confusing and unpredictable and lacked a coherent framework. I believe that central banks need to think hard about how and when they exercise this important role. We need to have a well-articulated and systematic approach to such actions. Otherwise, our actions will exacerbate moral hazard and encourage excessive risk-taking, thus sowing the seeds for the next crisis. Unfortunately, neither financial reform nor central banks have adequately addressed this dilemma.  Breaching the boundaries is not confined to the fiscal authorities asking central banks to do their heavy lifting. The Fed and other central banks have undertaken other actions that have blurred the distinction between monetary policy and fiscal policy, such as adopting credit policies that favor some industries or asset classes relative to others. Such steps were taken with the sincere belief that they were absolutely necessary to address the challenges posed by the financial crisis. The clearest examples can be seen when the Federal Reserve established credit facilities to support markets for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. Most notable has been the effort by the Fed to support the housing market through its purchases of mortgage-backed securities. These credit allocations have not only breached the traditional boundaries between fiscal and monetary policy, they have generated pointed public criticisms of the Fed. Once a central bank ventures into fiscal policy, it is likely to find itself under increasing pressure from the private sector, financial markets, or the government to use its balance sheet to substitute for other fiscal decisions. Such actions by a central bank can create their own form of moral hazard, as markets and governments come to see central banks as instruments of fiscal policy, thus undermining incentives for fiscal discipline. This pressure can threaten the central bank’s independence in conducting monetary policy and thereby undermine monetary policy’s effectiveness in achieving its mandate. In my view, this blurring of the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies is fraught with risks. As I said, these boundaries arose for good reason, and we ignore their breach at our peril. I believe we must seek ways to restore the boundaries.  The central bank’s balance-sheet policy Another related issue facing central banks arises from the degree to which central banks have expanded their balance sheets. There are two dimensions to this issue. One is the composition of the balance sheet. In the U.S., for example, the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve has changed from one made up almost entirely of short-term U.S. Treasury securities to one that is mostly long-term Treasuries, plus significant quantities of long-term mortgage-backed securities. This concentration of housing-related securities is problematic because it is a form of credit allocation and thus violates the monetary/fiscal policy boundaries I just mentioned.  The second aspect is the overall size of the balance sheet. Many central banks expanded their balance sheets in an effort to ease monetary policy after their usual policy instrument  – an interest rate – had reached the zero lower bound. Do central bankers anticipate that their balance sheets will shrink to more normal levels as they move away from the zero lower 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches bound? Is it desirable to do so? Or should monetary policy now be seen as having another tool, even in normal times? Some have suggested that central banks adopt a regime in which the monetary policy rate is the interest rate on reserves rather than a market interest rate, such as the federal funds rate. This would then permit the central bank to manage its balance sheet separately from its monetary instrument, freeing it to respond to liquidity demands of the financial system without altering the stance of monetary policy. In principle, this would take pressure off central banks to shrink their balance sheets from the current high levels and simply rely on raising the interest rate on reserves to tighten monetary policy.  The alternative is to return to a more traditional operating regime in which the central bank sets a target for a market interest rate, such as the federal funds rate in the U.S., above the interest rate on reserves. Implementing this regime would require a smaller balance sheet.  I am very skeptical of an operating regime that gives central banks a new tool without boundaries or constraints. Without an understanding, or even a theory, as to how the balance sheet should or can be manipulated, we open the door to giving vast new discretionary abilities to our central banks. This violates the principle of drawing clear boundaries between monetary policy and fiscal policy. When markets or governments come to believe that a central bank can freely expand its balance sheet without directly impacting the stance of monetary policy, I believe that various political and private interests will come forward with a long list of good causes, or rescues, for which such funds could or should be used. Economic theory and practice teach us that monetary policy works best when it is clear about its objectives and systematic in its approach to achieving those objectives. Granting vast amounts of discretion to our central banks in the expectation that they can cure our economic ills or substitute for our lack of fiscal discipline is a dangerous road to follow.  In June, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee outlined some principles that would guide its exit from this period of extraordinary monetary accommodation. In my view, those principles represented an important first step in the FOMC’s attempt to restore the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies. In particular, the FOMC clearly stated its desire to return to an operating environment in which the federal funds rate is the primary instrument of monetary policy. To achieve that objective, the Fed will have to shrink its balance sheet to a more normal level. I interpret this as saying that our balance sheet should not be viewed as a new independent instrument of monetary policy in normal times. The exit principles also indicated the Committee’s desire to return the Fed’s balance sheet to an all-Treasuries portfolio. This re-establishes the idea that the Fed should not use its balance sheet to actively engage in credit allocations. In other speeches, I have outlined a framework that I have termed a “new accord” between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. It would enable the central bank to act in emergencies when requested by the Treasury or the fiscal authorities, but it would be clear up front that any non-Treasury assets that accrued on the central bank’s balance sheet would be swapped for government securities within a specified period of time. This would ensure that fiscal policy decisions remain under the purview of the fiscal authorities, not the central bank. Summary To summarize, it is important for governments to maintain independent central banks so that they are better able to achieve their mandates. It is also sound policy to limit the discretionary ability of central banks to engage in policies that fundamentally belong to fiscal authorities or private markets. Establishing and maintaining clear boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies protects the independence of the central bank and its ability to carry out its core mandate – maintaining price stability. Clear boundaries and resisting the use of the balance sheet as a new policy tool would also improve fiscal discipline by making it more difficult for the fiscal authorities to resort to the printing press as a solution to unsustainable budget policies.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 H R Khan: Towards vibrant debt markets – a 7iframework Keynote address by Shri H R Khan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 13th FIMMDA-PDAI Annual Conference on “Asian money, bond & derivatives in the new global economy”, Kuala Lumpur, 27 January 2012. *      *      * The speaker acknowledges the contributions from Shr. N.R.V.V.M.K. Rajendra Kumar, Shri Himanshu Mohanty and Shri Surajit Bose. It is a great pleasure to be here amidst you all for the 9th Annual meeting of the Fixed Income Money Market Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and the Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI) in this enchanting and energetic city of Kuala Lumpur. Relations between our two great nations, India and Malaysia, date back to ancient times. Indeed the name Malaysia is believed to have been derived from the Sanskrit root Malayadvipa which means “peninsula of mountains”. This land had attracted hordes of traders from India in the ancient times and the exchange was not confined not merely to merchandise but also extended to deep socio-cultural ties including customs and cuisine. The tradition continues. I am happy to note that this meeting has attracted a different breed of traders from India and elsewhere, the bond and derivative traders, to introspect on the challenges facing us in these exciting times. Risks from the global macroeconomic environment remain elevated even as growth remains subdued & unemployment high in most of the advanced economies. The Euro-area remains under stress. Neither default by one or more of the peripheral countries nor the severe austerity measures put in place to avoid a default forebode good tidings for the economy or the markets. Though the emerging economies have been less bruised in the process, funding constraints in international financial markets pose a threat to both the availability and cost of capital and in turn on their growth prospects. In these challenging times, the imperative from our perspective is to ensure that the funding needs of expanding economies like India and Malaysia are met so that the growth trajectory upon which realisation of the aspirations of millions of our underprivileged people depends is not derailed. At the same time, the crisis has reinforced global concern for financial stability and it is equally important to ensure that latent fault lines in the financial sector do not herald a crisis with even greater suffering than tardy growth. Speaking here in Kuala Lumpur, one cannot help recollect the crisis of the late 1990’s which besieged the rapidly growing “miracle economies”. Most of these economies faced a substantial GDP contraction during 1998 and moderation in the growth during the following years. The countries dealt with the crisis in their own way but two features common to all of them are accumulation of sizeable foreign currency reserves and development of a robust local currency bond market. The size of the local currency bond market in the East Asian economies excluding Japan has been growing at a rate exceeding 20 percent which is more than twice the growth rate of the global bond market and this is evident in the corporate bond market segment as well. An interesting observation from the data on corporate bond markets in Asia is that the value of outstanding increased during the period of recent global financial crisis. The outstanding increased from US$ 929 million as of end-December 2007 to US$ 1617 million as of end-December 2010 This underlines the continued attraction for investments even during the period of financial turmoil in the global markets. In fact, post global financial crisis, the Asian bond markets are witnessing a gradual shift away from the government bond driven to a corporate bond driven market growth. Indian bond and derivatives markets Over the past two decades since we began the financial sector reforms, Indian bond markets have come a long way. The annual gross market borrowing of the Government of India and 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches the State Governments increased from  122.83 billion in 1991–92 to  5,833.92 billion in 2010–11. The amount of outstanding Government of India securities increased from   780.23 billion in 1991–92 to  21569.14 billion in 2011–12. Government securities market (G-Sec) has become broad-based in terms of participation and the sovereign yield curve now spans up to 30 years. The monthly volume in secondary market on the electronic trading platform – Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM), which accounts for about 90 per cent of the trading, has increased from  314.30 billion in August 2005 to   1480.86 billion in March 2011. The bid-ask spread of on-the-run securities continues to be low at 1–2 basis points (bps) and the impact cost of the on-the-run securities is observed at around 3 bps for a trade size of  500 million. In case of corporate bonds, trading volumes have increased manifold from  1458.28 billion in 2008–09 to  5986.04 billion in 2010–11. Yet we have quite some distance to traverse to catch up with our neighbours in the Far East, let alone the advanced western countries. The 7i framework In this backdrop, I intend to discuss the development of the debt and the derivatives market in India from the perspective of a central bank and a financial sector regulator with a mandate to facilitate development of debt markets of the country. I shall briefly cover some of the important initiatives taken so far and also draw the contours of future development. My discussion will be structured within what I call the 7i framework – the seven I’s standing for Investors, Issuers, Instruments, Infrastructure, Intermediaries, Incentives and Innovation – each an important and critical component of any well-functioning and vibrant financial market. Investors Any discussion of development of a bond market has to begin with the investor. High savings rate, large set of domestic institutional investors and active interest from foreign investors can create a large and heterogeneous group that is necessary for an efficient bond market. The traditional investor base for G-Sec in India comprised banks, provident funds, and insurance companies. With the entry of co-operative banks, regional rural banks, pension funds, mutual funds and non-banking finance companies, the institutional investor base has been reasonably diversified. Notwithstanding the predominantly institutional character of the G-Sec market, Reserve Bank of India has recognised merit in promoting retail participation and has initiated certain policy measures to this end. Some of these include enabling small and medium sized investors to participate in the primary auction of G-Sec through a “Scheme of Non-competitive Bidding”, improving access to the market for mid-segment investors by permitting well-managed and financially sound Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) to become members of NDS-OM and revision of authorization guidelines for the Primary Dealers (PDs) mandating achievement of minimum retailing targets. To ease the process of investment by retail/mid-segment investors, a web-enabled platform which would seamlessly integrate their funds and securities accounts has been planned by the Reserve Bank of India. Some major banks have also initiated measures like on-line trading portal for the retail investors. An important feature of investor profile of the G-sec market is the dominance of domestic investors and limited foreign participation but this is an aspect of a policy framework rather than indicative of lack of interest by overseas investors. Investment limits for the Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have been enhanced in a phased manner to US$ 15 billion in G-sec and US$ 45 billion in the case of corporate bonds (including US$ 25 billion for infrastructure sector bonds/units).Some observers argue that in the absence of significant investments by foreign investors, markets are deprived of not only a large and liquid pool of savings but also active global trading strategies which can contribute to the much needed trading liquidity. The counter argument is that the willingness of foreign investors to take a 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 long-term view and remain engaged is highly sensitive to global economic factors and possible sudden reversals arising from “hot money” strategy of foreign investors has potential to impact the systemic stability. Let me add that the participation of foreign investor in the domestic bond markets also needs to be examined in the light of our policy stance relating to calibrated approach to capital account convertibility and the possibility of interest rate and exchange rate volatility due to large scale reversal of capital flows. A recurrent theme in the government bond market is the lack of liquidity as seen from the low trading volumes. The daily trading volume is less than one percent of the outstanding stock. The banks and insurance companies between themselves hold about 70 per cent of the outstanding stock. The investment strategy of insurance companies and pension funds are usually dictated by Asset Liability Management (ALM)/actuarial considerations. In India because banks are mandated to hold as much as 24 per cent of their liability in the form of government securities, under Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) framework, they have been permitted to classify these holdings as held-to-maturity (HTM) with a view to protecting their balance sheets from volatility arising out of interest rate fluctuations. With a dominant part of the outstanding stock thus residing in HTM portfolio and out of the market the low volume of trading is but natural. The term HTM, however, appears to be an illusion as securities are almost never held till they mature but are sold at an opportune time. Such an investment strategy impacts liquidity of the security, in particular, and the market, in general. While the changes imminent in accounting norms under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) may force transformation of the strategies of banks, there is a need for debate on the issue of reduction in the HTM category dispensation, albeit in a phased manner. In the corporate debt market, investor base is mostly confined to banks, insurance companies, provident funds, Primary Dealers (PDs) and pension funds. Of late, the retail investors have been showing interest in corporate bonds, especially bonds issued by the infrastructure companies that entail tax incentive. While investors are not shy of debts issued by the top rated firms, they are reluctant to subscribe to the lower rated instruments. This is an anomaly because lower rated companies do have access to bank financing. Credit enhancement by banks can perhaps make such instruments attractive to investors. But on the flip side, credit enhancement essentially involves transfer of the credit risk to banks and this will not only hamper the development of corporate bond market by stunting the price discovery process but also increase the risk in the banking system. The focus must be on de-risking banking system, and at the same time, building/encouraging institutions that provide credit enhancement. Investor interest in the interest rate derivatives market ought to be dictated by their exposure to the cash market. While investors’ cash market exposure is substantial and has been increasing over time, the accounting hedge through HTM classification insulates the holders against market risk. Therefore, we observe skewed and limited participation, resulting in shallow markets. Though the Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) was launched in 1999, the only product where the market volumes have grown substantially is the overnight index swap based on the overnight money market index. Here too the participation is not significantly broad-based. Foreign banks (owning only 7 percent of the banking sector assets) are the most dominant players in the IRS market followed by the private sector banks while the participation of the public sector banks who own as much as 74 percent of the banking sector assets remain miniscule. Notwithstanding the large trading volume and value of contracts outstanding, the skewed participation leads to pricing anomalies and also puts a question mark on the economic utility of the product. Issuers Sovereign securities dominate the fixed income markets almost everywhere. In India too, the central and state governments remain the main issuers. Two observations are in order. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Traditionally, marketable securities of the Central and the State Governments constituted only a part of their respective liabilities and, therefore, the size of the government bond market as measured by the outstanding stock was relatively small compared to the debt-to-GDP ratio. Secondly, if one excludes the securities held by the Reserve Bank under the Open Market Operations (OMO) and other buy-and-hold entities, the market size becomes even smaller.  In recent times, market borrowings have emerged as the largest source of financing fiscal deficit. The auction based issuance process is transparent with publication of auction calendars well in advance enabling the market participants to plan their investments. The large supply of securities, due to enhanced borrowings, has enabled creation of benchmark securities with sufficient outstanding stock and issuances across the yield curve. The issuances across the risk-free yield curve in turn have provided benchmarks for valuation of other bonds/financial assets.  Despite economic recovery in 2010–11 and resumption of fiscal consolidation path, the market borrowing of the Government has remained at elevated levels in India. The Union Budget of India 2011–12 estimated gross fiscal deficit (GFD) at  4128.17 billion and budgeted gross market borrowings of  4170.00 billion. The market borrowings, however, through dated securities for the current year has been increased by about  930.00 billion due to shortfall in other financing items, primarily due to moderation in the growth rate of the economy and increased expenditure. Besides inflationary implications, such large overhangs of debt and increasing annual borrowings have impeded the growth of flow of resources to the private sector by way of both loans and bonds. More importantly, lack of fiscal flexibility has not facilitated creation of limited number of benchmarks and active consolidation of illiquid securities. This fragmented G-Sec market has neither been beneficial to the issuer nor the investors. In spite of some passive consolidation of government securities undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India, the market remains fragmented with many stocks with relatively small size. Nearly fifty percent of the outstanding stocks has volume less than  200 billion. There is merit in pursuing active consolidation with focus on buy-backs and switches to build volumes and improve liquidity. Reserve Bank is in consultation with the government to achieve some degree of consolidation in G-Sec in the near future. Reserve Bank has recently constituted a Working Group (Chairman: Shri. R Gandhi, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India) to examine ways to improve liquidity in Government securities and interest rate derivatives market as well as suggest measures for active consolidation of the securities. Corporates in many developed markets – predominantly in the US and increasingly in other jurisdictions – have a marked preference to tap the bond market rather than to seek bank loans for meeting their external finance requirements. In India, however, companies continue to depend on the banking system for funds because of ease of availing bank finance, absence of credit risk mitigation mechanisms and a host of other factors, such as, absence of sound bankruptcy framework and lack of active interest of long-term investors like insurance companies.  An examination of the issuer profile of corporate bonds reveals that issuances are dominated by banks and public sector companies. Private sector, non-financial corporate issuers represent a smaller proportion. As mentioned earlier, issuers with triple-A ratings raise funds with ease from the markets as compared to firms with lower ratings. Private placements mostly dominate the primary segment of the corporate debt market accounting for more than 98 per cent of the total issuance of corporate debt (2010–11) in India. Corporates prefer raising funds through private placements as against public issuances because of operational ease of issuance under private placements with minimum disclosures, low cost of issuance and the speed of raising funds. The issuance process is also impacted by costs, such as, stamp duties, transfer costs, etc. which needs rationalisation. Preference for private 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 placement is also dictated by the profile of investors which is mostly institutional and a narrow base at that.  Instruments For a market to meet the diverse funding and hedging needs of the participants, there is need for a wide array of instruments and products which would also offer benefits of diversification in the portfolio. In the process of development of new instruments, Reserve Bank’s endeavour has been to ensure calibrated and orderly development of the markets with emphasis on prudent risk management and promotion of financial stability.  Over the years, several instruments like zero-coupon bonds, capital-indexed bonds, floating rate bonds, STRIPS and bonds with call and put options have been introduced after wide consultations with market participants and with product features comparable to those of the most popular and liquid instruments elsewhere. In the case of short term instruments Cash Management Bills (CMBs) have emerged as a new class of instrument providing opportunities for secured, shorter term investment in sovereign paper. The size and frequency of issuance of CMBs are likely to increase given the uncertainty in cash inflows and outflows of the Government whose income and expenditure has been growing rapidly. Issues, such as, very short notice for issue of CMBs, more demand for treasury bills, which have structured tenors, may come in the way of large demand for CMBs. There is a plan to launch a new long-term instrument – the Inflation Indexed Bonds (IIBs) wherein both capital and interest would be provided protection against inflation. It is expected that institutional investors, such as, pension funds and insurance companies would exhibit interest in investing in the IIBs. The expectation is based on the fact that the IIBs give investors long-term assets with a fixed long-term real yield, insulating them against inflation as their real yields are indexed to actual inflation. Further, it is also being contemplated to increase the non-competitive portion for IIBs to have significant participation of retail investors in these instruments.  Plain vanilla fixed coupon bonds, however, remain the mainstay of issuances. With the exception of an innovative product like Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligations (CBLO), the market has not displayed any appetite for instruments with varied structure. A similar response pattern has been observed in respect of products such as interest rate futures (IRFs) (based on 10-year bond and 91-day T-Bill), repo in corporate bonds and new issuance of Floating Rate Bond (FRB). One plausible reason for lack of interest is illiquidity in the underlying bond market. The dilemma is that while participants do not want to trade till liquidity improves, liquidity will not improve till the participants trade giving rise to the typical “chicken and egg problem”. The bottomline is that the market participants need to be more active in trading across the yield curve and across products and this requires an urgent and serious introspection by them.  Recently, the guidelines on the interest rate futures of two and five year tenors have been issued. These futures will be cash settled with settlement price computed through a polling process managed by the FIMMDA. As the product design has been finalised after due consultation with the market participants and the issue of illiquidity in underlying cash market has been dealt with by permitting cash settlement, it is expected that the product will attract active interest. Another significant step is the extension of the period of short sale to three months, effective from February 1, 2012. This will enable the participants to express their interest rate views more effectively and is expected to give fillip to term repo market. Similarly, the Credit Default Swap (CDS) on corporate bonds has been introduced to facilitate hedging of credit risk associated with corporate bonds. Introduction of credit enhancement for corporate bonds through CDS may also increase investors’ interest in corporate bonds.  Several episodes in international markets underscored the importance of risk management in the use of financial products. Learning from these episodes, the approach of the Reserve 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Bank of India towards regulation and risk management has been oriented to ensure orderly development of financial markets and products. This objective is achieved by establishing efficient infrastructure, addressing systemic stability issues and also supporting market development. The pre-dominant motivation has been to strike a balance between systemic stability and financial market development. Infrastructure Market infrastructure is a comprehensive term that includes the entire gamut of arrangements for the transactions to be carried out and settled in an efficient and safe manner. Infrastructure plays an important role in development of markets and want of an efficient, transparent and robust infrastructure can keep market participants away on one extreme or cause market crisis on the other. Reserve Bank of India has pursuing a strategy for creation of an efficient market infrastructure to enhance market activity and also to create a supporting institutional framework. In the government bond market, a state of the art primary issuance process with electronic bidding and fast processing capabilities, an efficient, completely dematerialized depository system, Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) mode of settlement, Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), electronic trading platforms (Negotiated Dealing Systems and Negotiated Dealing Systems-Order Matching) and a separate Central Counter Party (CCP) in the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) for guaranteed settlement are among the steps that were taken by the Reserve Bank over the years towards this end. In fact, thanks to these efforts, India can boast of being one of the few emerging countries with such a state of the art financial market infrastructure for the G-Sec market. Creating a robust risk management structure for the CCP to mitigate its increasing concentration risk and enabling an assured liquidity support framework for meeting its emergency liquidity needs are some of the challenges before the Reserve Bank of India. We are closely monitoring how the international consensus is evolving on these areas. To strengthen the market infrastructure for corporate bonds Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has permitted the clearing houses of the exchanges to have a transitory pooling account facility with the Reserve Bank. This will facilitate settlement of OTC corporate bond transactions on a DvP-I basis. The infrastructure has been bolstered by support of the market bodies with FIMMDA establishing and operating reporting platforms for corporate bonds, Commercial Papers (CPs)/Certificates of Deposit (CDs). This collaboration between the regulator and the market participants has laid the foundation for enhanced transparency and vibrancy in the market. The financial crisis in 2008 revealed several deficiencies of the OTC derivatives market. The importance of improving transparency, mitigating systemic risks and protecting against market abuse came to the forefront. In September 2009, the G-20 leaders mandated that OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories; all standardised OTC derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate; and all standardised OTC derivatives contracts should be cleared through the CCPs. In this regard, a considerable amount of work on infrastructure to make OTC derivatives trades transparent has been done in India. As early as in 2007, Reserve Bank had mandated the reporting of all inter-institution OTC interest rate derivatives on a platform developed for the purpose by the CCIL. Introduction of CDS was accompanied by putting in place a reporting arrangement simultaneously. On the basis the recommendation of a working group, a comprehensive and efficient single point reporting arrangement for all interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives is also in the process of implementation.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Intermediaries Intermediaries play an important role in development of the market by facilitating the transactions, providing value-added services and increasing efficacy of the processes. With regard to bond markets in India, I would like to elucidate the role of four major intermediaries viz. PD system, industry associations like FIMMDA/PDAI, Gilt Mutual Funds and the Infrastructure Development Funds (IDFs), which are in the offing. The system of Primary Dealers (PDs) was established to provide support to the market borrowing programmes of the Government and also to impart liquidity in the secondary markets. Subsequent to the withdrawal of the Reserve Bank of India from the primary market, as mandated by Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003, the PD System has been underwriting the entire Government of India market borrowing. PDs have actively supported the bond issuances and their role in successful completion of sizeable issuance programmes over the past three years has been commendable. Recently, Reserve Bank has revised the guidelines on authorisation of PDs with focus on their market experience as well as increase in retail/mid-segment investor participation so as to widen the investor base. The revised guidelines prescribe a seasoning requirement of at least one year prior to submission of application, reasonable experience in G-Sec market with at least 15 per cent of their assets and turnover in G-Sec and a commitment to achieve a minimum turnover of 75 per cent of their minimum NOF in G-Sec on behalf of retail/mid segment clients. We expect the PDs would continue to support the market borrowing programmes, act as market makers by providing fillip to secondary markets and retail investors and proactively deal in the financial products such as CDS, IRF, etc. Reserve Bank is also exploring the possibility of enabling banks/PDs to make markets in corporate bonds through appropriate supportive measures. Changing nature of financial markets necessitate that organisations, such as, FIMMDA and PDAI, play a more proactive role in bringing orderliness in market activities and desired level of discipline amongst market participants. Reserve Bank of India regularly engages with FIMMDA and PDAI on various issues of policy and provides inputs and perspectives of the market participants. FIMMDA has been entrusted with responsibilities, such as, publishing model prices for G-Sec and non-G-Sec to be used in valuations, formulation of model code of conduct for market participants, development and operationalization of critical market infrastructure like reporting platform for corporate bonds, repo in corporate bonds, CPs and CDs, accreditation of brokers in the OTC interest rate derivatives market, development of the daily CDS curve for valuation of open positions, etc. The entrusted responsibilities and activities/functions of FIMMDA in the underlying market clearly indicate its potential for self-regulatory role. There is, however, an urgent need for FIMMDA to further strengthen itself, build competencies, both technical and financial, and broaden its mission to carry out tasks commensurate with the developments in the market and to undertake additional responsibilities as Self Regulatory Organization (SRO). I suggest that FIMMDA may draw up an action plan in this direction with clear goals to be achieved with appropriate time lines. Gilt Mutual Fund industry has grown manifold but the Mutual Funds (MFs) continue to invest predominantly in short-tenor fixed income assets, thereby exhibiting low demand in the G-Sec market. This is a cause of concern and requires an urgent need to examine ways for Huge requirement of investment in infrastructure sector underscores the importance of the IDFs. Reserve Bank of India has, as a special case, has permitted several prudential relaxations for setting up IDFs including enhanced exposure norms, assigning lower risk weights for capital adequacy purposes, etc. Reserve Bank of India has also allowed investment on full repatriation basis by new class of eligible non-resident investors (viz. Sovereign Wealth Funds, multilateral agencies, pension funds, insurance funds, endowment funds) in Rupee and Foreign Currency denominated bonds to be issued by IDF-NBFCs registered by the Reserve Bank of India and Rupee denominated units issued by IDF-MFs set up as SEBI registered Mutual Funds. Given our calibrated approach towards opening up of our debt markets to foreign investors, all such investments (excluding those by NRIs) will, 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches however, be within an overall cap of US$ 10 billion (which would be within the overall cap of US$ 25 billion for FII investment in infrastructure debt). IDFs will, in days to come, act as a major source of channelizing huge quantum of funds from long term domestic and foreign investors to the corporate debt markets in the critical infrastructure sector of the country and will indeed be a gamechanger with a potential of redefining various facets of the markets.  Incentives Incentives, both positive and negative, play a major role in shaping human behaviour and markets are no exception to this rule. For illustrative purposes, I would like to cite a few instances where incentives played important role in shaping the development of the debt markets. Existence of easy access to bank loans incentivised corporates to approach banks rather than rely on corporate bond market. This excessive reliance on bank finance hampered the development of deep and liquid bond markets and was partly responsible for the financial instability during the Asian crisis.  The illiquidity in the Indian corporate bond markets can be attributed to the apparent preference of the corporates to finance their requirements through private placement and rely on external commercial borrowings. The level and complexity of stamp duty on corporate bonds encourages an arbitrage-based approach to corporate finance and decisions are often tax-driven rather than strategy-driven. Differential tax treatment further complicates the matter as it tends to incentivise certain investors, e.g., insurance companies and mutual funds who are exempt from TDS on interest income from corporate bonds.  The regulatory dispensation of HTM classification has protected balance sheets of the banks and encouraged them to invest in G-Sec but promoted illiquidity in government bonds. Different incentive structures in treasuries of public sector banks and private/foreign bank treasuries partly explains the level of participation in derivative markets in spite of existence of similar risks on the balance sheets. While differences in incentives in public and private banks with regard to treasury operations exist, the reasons for lack of interest shown by most of the public sector in spite of the fact that they hold very high interest rate sensitive portfolio and have the balance sheet capability to participate in the market needs to be examined in depth and debated. An understanding of the incentives is essential for both policy makers and market participants so that the market activities can be directed towards attainment of objectives of efficiency and effectiveness. While Reserve Bank tries to align incentives by regulation and supervision, regulation itself could create unintended incentives/disincentives as in the case of requirement regarding “HTM”. For instance, the ability to buy CDS without an underlying has resulted in perverse incentives in the developed markets. Reserve Bank, while framing the CDS policy, has designed regulation to curb such skewed incentives by restricting users to buy CDS only to hedge an underlying exposure. Physical settlement has been mandated after the credit event. A nuanced understanding of the incentives would help in design of regulation that promotes market development without jeopardising financial stability.  Innovation With the world still smarting under the financial crisis believed to have been unleashed by “innovative” products, one has to talk about innovation with some degree of caution. Financial innovation is an essential feature in the history of development of financial markets. Bypassing the tax or the regulatory regime has, of course, been a major motivation for innovation, the social and economic utility of which is often questionable. An example is the Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts in the US that were a result of Regulation Q restrictions on interests on demand deposits. But innovations that are motivated by the need to match the needs of the investor and the issuer or made possible by advancement in technology or knowledge are essential for evolution of financial markets. One can cite many 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 examples – demat accounts, ATMs, credit and debit cards, explosion of options contracts, inflation indexed bonds, Fixed Rate Capital Securities, IRS, CDS and so on. It is true that financial innovation has also resulted in complex products which package and redstribute risks in a way that is scarcely understood. As observed by Lord Turner of the UK Financial Services Authority, financial innovation has produced some products of very dubious social value. It is vital to understand that financial innovation is not an objective in itself but a process and has to cater to the products to the felt need of the market in particular and wider economy in general without compromising on financial stability. The old adage “Innovate or Perish” should read “Innovate with Caution or Perish” in so far as the financial sector is concerned.  Innovation and risk are two aspects of financial markets between which there is a great deal of tension. As such, inadequate risk management framework can make the difference between survival and death for an institution, particularly a financial institution. Several episodes in international markets have repeatedly underscored this – Orange County, LTCM, BCCI, Enron, Barings, Northern Rock – one can go on. We have just seen that innovative products like the CDOs and innovative institutional arrangements like the SPVs without adequate appreciation of embedded risk and an appropriate regulatory framework for risk management could wreck havoc. Nearer home, ill-judged use of some exotic foreign exchange derivative by some corporates led to substantial losses and created fracas between them and the banks that had sold them the products.  The respective Boards of the financial institutions need to ensure appropriate oversight of the functioning of treasuries. The Board must put in place risk policies and also ensure strict adherence of the limits and standards. There should be clear procedures for assessing and monitoring risk, with adequate accountability, clear lines of authority and separation of duties. The approach of Reserve Bank towards regulation and risk management is oriented to ensure development of financial markets and products by establishing supportive infrastructure, address systemic stability issues and also support market development. Maintaining a balance between systemic stability and financial market development remains the main focus of the Reserve Bank of India. Therefore, the emphasis is towards creation of a robust regulatory/supervisory framework to prevent systemic weaknesses.  Often, there is a tendency to look towards more advanced markets and mimic their practices without subjecting such products and practices to customization as would be required in the eco-system of the adopting country. Like the Meiji Restoration scientists, who after having received scientific training in various European countries, returned to Japan and wanted to carry forward their work in the language in which they had received instruction, the financial sector professionals have a tendency to crave for the products that they are familiar with. The success of innovative products/processes such as the CBLO, which is a variant of tri-partite agreement, infrastructure such as electronic trading platforms (NDS, NDS Call or NDS-OM) and transitory pooling of accounts for settlement of corporate bonds in the books of the Reserve Bank of India strengthens the case for looking inwards for inspiration to evolve customized innovations In India, innovation has been rather muted and even the reception for new products has been rather insipid. The regulators are not against innovative products; their concern is that neither should the innovation be oriented towards skirting the regulatory regime nor should they lead to build-up of systemic risk. It is imperative for the market participants and the industry association to ensure that adequate risk management systems and corporate governance structures are in place before embarking on innovations. As you all may have observed, Reserve Bank has followed and will continue to follow a measured approach in the introduction of innovative products through adoption of appropriate risk management framework suitable to our eco-system.  
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches Concluding remarks To summarize, I have briefly described the 7i framework which focusses on the structure and developments of our debt market and the possible future direction to invigorate our debt markets with reference to this framework. We need to realise that development and adoption of new products in emerging market economies is not often easy. It requires considerable amount of patience, hand-holding and fine-tuning depending on the needs of the respective eco-system. It is equally important to remember that market liquidity is a consequence of active participation of market players. New financial products and instruments are designed to cater to funding and hedging needs but the need to be actively used by the market participants without, of course, increasing the risks to the financial stability and jeopardising the interest of the ultimate end-users/customers. The lack of market interest, if any, must be introspected and debated seriously to draw up remedial action plan. At the end, I would like to reiterate that in the context of a developing market like India the Reserve Bank of India, other concerned regulators, Government, FIMMDA, PDAI and all the market participants are all joint stakeholders in the development of the debt markets. All of us have to work towards this common objective and a conclave like this would go a long way in generating useful insights and inputs in this direction. With these thoughts I wish the conference and participants all the very best for productive and useful deliberations mixed with the pleasure of exploring this beautiful country. I thank FIMMDA and PDAI for giving me this opportunity to share some of my thoughts with all of you. I would also like to specially thank Dr.Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor, Bank Negara Malaysia for spending her valuable time in our midst and sharing her insights with us.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 K C Chakrabarty: Mobile banking in India – regulations and rationale Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the International Banking Summit on “Regulation of cross-border mobile payments and regional financial integration”, Mumbai, 29 March 2012. *      *      * Assistance provided by Shri K Sivaraman and Ms Radha Somakumar in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged. Ms Moono Mupotola, Manager, African Development Bank Group, Mr Somak Ghosh, Group President, Development & Sustainable Banking, YES Bank, distinguished guests, participants, members of the print and electronic media, ladies and gentlemen. 1. I am delighted to be present here at the International Banking Summit on “Regulation of Cross-Border Mobile Payments and Regional Financial Integration” and share my thoughts on the subject of mobile phones as a powerful tool for enabling financial services. I thank YES BANK and African Development Bank for extending the invitation to me. 2. Technology has, for better or worse, undeniably brought about a change, hitherto unimagined, in our life styles. The transformation brought about by technology in the area of delivery of financial services has, thankfully, only been for the better. Internet Banking complemented by core banking solutions implemented by banks, mobile banking, card based electronic transactions at any bank ATM and merchants locations (both physical and through e-commerce sites) have offered a variety of channels to bank customers to conduct their payment transactions. Mobile as a medium 3. In this context, the question that often gets debated is: how and why is a mobile device the most appropriate delivery channel of financial services? Besides the technology capability to transmit financial information in an efficient, secure and cost-effective manner enabled by development of mobile based applications for banking, the most significant fact about this idea is the ubiquity of the mobile phones. The number of mobile phones in the country are said to be nearing a billion phones. Hence, banking and financial services, which have already come a long way from the branch level services to the customer’s home desktop and laptop, can now be reached to a much larger section of the society, including the financially excluded, through the medium of the mobile phones. Besides the reach of mobile, there is another reason why mobiles are the most appropriate medium. What is after all a banking transaction? What purpose does the traditional cheque serve? In India, if you forget to carry your cheque book for withdrawal of funds, they provide you with what is call a withdrawal slip. A cheque or a withdrawal slip is a personalized direction to your banker to put through banking transactions on your behalf. The authentication is achieved through your signature. But this traditional method is expensive. A mobile phone achieves the same purpose and enables you to send personalized secure instructions to your banker to undertake transactions on your behalf. If your bank has achieved seamless integration with the CBS, then the transaction gets automatically registered. But these transactions using mobile are far less expensive than its traditional alternatives. More importantly, you hold the key since mobile is in your pocket and you need not depend on bank timings or the rush there to undertake banking transactions. This is perhaps the most important advantage of the mobile over other alternate payment methods. The mobile phone can, therefore, empower the common man to conduct his payment transactions any time and from anywhere. It is, 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches therefore, no wonder that mobile payments and mobile banking are being hotly debated in various forums, in India and abroad. Bank-led technology neutral approach 4. The Reserve Bank recognized the potential of the mobile phone as a channel to conduct financial services quite some time back and the first set of guidelines were taken way back in October, 2008. But the Reserve Bank consciously opted for a bank-led model although our approach remains technology neutral. Mobile phones as a delivery channel have a great potential if the security and cost aspects are addressed for it has to serve a large number of transactions that are small in size. It has to be remembered that use of mobile for banking in financial inclusion cannot become a viable proposition on a standalone basis if the purpose is to achieve meaningful financial inclusion. To make it viable and attract volumes, it has to be provided as a package along with other products and services. This can be achieved only by entities that can provide add-on services like emergency and entrepreneurial credit, saving facilities, other products and services such as insurance, besides remittances. This is where a mainstream regulated entity like a bank fits in. True, some of these alternatives are being provided by a few NBFCs but their scale and reach are not comparable with banks. They can serve niche markets but are not viable in the long run. But, they indeed will facilitate financial inclusion. So, the Indian model will remain a bank-led model with banks partnering MSPs (mobile service providers) and other entities to achieve the national goal of inclusive growth. In our endeavour to enable enhancements in mobile banking both in terms of the nature of services offered and the value of transactions to be permitted under mobile banking, we have been in constant dialogue with the stake holders and intervened to liberalise the mobile banking guidelines in a phased manner. Steps taken by RBI in mobile banking 5. The mobile banking guidelines have been modified in December 2011, to permit banks to facilitate funds transfer both for personal remittances and purchase of goods and services without any ceiling. In other words, banks are now free to decide on the limits, based on their own risk perception. In respect of small value transactions fund transfers up to Rs 5,000/- can be effected through the mobile phone without the need for end-to-end encryption. 6. In order to provide domestic money transfer facility especially to migrant population who do not have access to formal banking channels, domestic money transfer guidelines have been issued in October 2011. Remittance from a bank account for cash pay out to the beneficiary not having a bank account at an ATM/BC outlet has also been facilitated up to Rs 10,000/- per transaction subject to a monthly cap of Rs 25,000/- per beneficiary with the remitting bank obtaining only the full name and address of the beneficiary. Similarly cash pay in facility has been permitted up to Rs 5,000/- per transaction subject to a monthly cap of Rs 25,000/- per remitter for transfer of funds to a bank account. Remitter has to provide only minimum details (name and address). Bank need not take any document or proof of address. 7. The Interbank Mobile Payment Services (IMPS) operated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) with the approval of the Reserve Bank has enhanced the efficiency of mobile banking by enabling real time transfer of funds between bank accounts and providing a centralised inter-operable interbank settlement service for mobile banking transactions with confirmation features. Current status of mobile banking in India 8. Presently, 65 banks have been approved for conduct of mobile banking out of which 47 banks have commenced offering these services. Transactions in mobile banking have 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 been showing an uptrend. During February 2012, more than 2.8 million transactions for close to Rs. 1961.23 million were transacted; a 300 % increase in volume and more than 200% in value terms as compared to 0.7 million transactions for close to Rs 616.19 million during February 2011. A little over 12.23 million bank customers have so far registered for mobile banking services. These numbers are not really heartening if we consider the following facts: i. At the end of January 2012, the total wireless subscriber base was 936 million, which included 313 million subscriptions in the rural areas. ii. Only 55% of the people of India have deposit accounts. It is evident that mobile phones have reached more households than basic banking services. Banks have not really made a significant penetration even among their existing customers to extend mobile banking services. However, for me, the most important concern is that there is a significant percentage of financially excluded population and the potential of the mobile phone to extend them financial services is still to be tapped. 9. Reserve Bank has always been conscious of the need to bring every citizen of the country within the ambit of the banking system. Appreciating the difficulties of banks to viably operate bank branches in every village, we had permitted them to appoint Business Correspondents (BCs) to address this. On demand from the industry, we have also permitted “for profit” companies to be appointed as Business Correspondents, which would enable a healthy fusion of the expertise of banks and the communications and agency network of non-banks, specially the MSPs. Though partnerships between banks and MSPs are happening, the pace is far too slow and the process needs to be expedited. Some generic issues 10. While on the subject, let me discuss some generic issues relating to e-money on which we are often quizzed. i. Is e-money in India overregulated when elsewhere there is higher level of tolerance towards anonymity of e-money transactions? Non-banks in India can issue only semi-closed prepaid instruments, which do not provide for cash withdrawals. Is KYC requirement justified in such cases, when any usage of the card will only result in credits to the bank accounts of the merchants? ii. Today, an overseas credit/debit card could be used to withdraw cash from any ATM and can be a potential source for money laundering and the international laws come in the way of sharing complete information about the source of the funds? In the light of such threat, is the RBI and the Government too obsessed with KYC and AML issues?  11.  As you know, e-money or the prepaid payment instruments, whether in the e-wallets, m-wallets, prepaid cards or paper coupons, have been brought under regulation for the first time with the enactment of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The Act itself came into force from August 2008 and as mentioned earlier, the first guidelines on e-money were introduced in April 2009, and since then they have been liberalized in a significant way. We have allowed issue of prepaid instruments up to Rs.10,000 for exclusive use for purchase of travel tickets without the need for KYC. It must, however, be remembered that there are certain statutory requirements under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act which need to be met. However, within the existing statute, the Bank is constantly reviewing the position to identify the areas which impair the growth of e-money to initiate remedial measures. We have been on record that e-money is a more secure way of payments and needs to be promoted to ensure that our objectives of moving towards a less cash society. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Should MSPs be allowed on a standalone basis? 12. On the question of MSPs being allowed to do money transfer service on a standalone basis, perhaps such a measure would help in providing an alternative mode to the existing Money Order / Instant Money Order being offered by the services, though it would be difficult for me to say which one would be a cheaper option. The Department of Posts also has over 1.5 lakh post offices for delivery of services, though the IMO is extended to just a little over 3000 post offices. The MSPs have the technology and an impressive agent network to deliver the service with efficiency. It was against this backdrop, that the non-bank entities have been permitted to enable prepaid card to card transfers. The model would, therefore, benefit the financially excluded population both in urban and rural areas to send or receive money in a convenient way. 13. It is still not clear to me as to why the demand for standalone MSP model is persisting when we have allowed a far superior model where collaboration rather than competition is expected to result in a win win situation for all? Why should the stake holders insist on an inferior alternative? Are there any insurmountable problems in the collaborative model? If yes, what are they? 14. I am aware that some of the issues that come up in this regard relate to (i) who owns the customer? (ii) who controls the transactions? Has there been any worthwhile attempt to resolve them in a mature way? I would urge upon the banks and MSPs to get their acts together very quickly. On behalf of RBI let me assure you that we stand committed to the success of this collaboration and would remove all genuine obstacles! Enabling cross border payments through the medium of mobile phones 15. Should mobile initiated cross border transactions be enabled? To my mind there cannot be a uniform standard for this. The issue is country specific and each country has to take its decision based on need, issues and threat perception. As far as India is concerned, even during the worst Forex crisis, the country was careful about the quality of inflows. Secondly, we have had rules that required all forex flows to be routed only through banking institutions or others specifically authorized to undertake forex transactions. Given this background, even if we had to agree mobile phones can only be used to trigger the transfer of funds from overseas by a non-resident to the beneficiary’s bank account in India. The banks will have to be responsible for ensuring quality of funds, KYC, etc. We have in fact permitted banks to enable cross border bank account to bank account remittance through the medium of mobile subject to clearance from the local regulator. At the beneficiary end, we have enabled loading of funds received from overseas under the Money Transfer Service Scheme (MTSS) scheme on to a prepaid payment instrument issued by a bank, which could include a mobile wallet, to the recipient of the funds. Conclusion 16. Before I conclude, let me reiterate that the mobile phone is a potent tool to facilitate financial services and thus financial inclusion. It has the potential but the security and cost aspects have to be addressed. The medium of mobile has to sub-serve smaller transactions and must become cheaper. The Reserve Bank has for well considered reasons opted for a bank-led model as it is a complete model for delivery of a wide range of services. Just as you cannot have tele-medicine without a doctor, you cannot have mobile banking without a bank! The BC model would help to complement mobile banking, as customers need to approach BCs/ATMs only for hard currency requirements and conduct other banking transactions from anywhere from their mobile phones, provided of course, there are no tele-connectivity issues! As mentioned earlier, it is the social responsibility of everyone, who has the resources and the power, to contribute to the success of financial inclusion. While we have the guidelines to M-power financial services, it is necessary for us, the RBI, banks and the MSPs in particular, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 to take this forward in the 4th gear by convincing the common man not only on the power of the mobile phone for doing financial transactions but also the safety and security aspects of mobile banking, to provide a level of comfort. I believe there are success stories of mobile banking in states like Bihar, thanks to the initiatives of the certain NGOs and banks, which has enabled not only financial inclusion but made less literate people mobile banking-savvy. This needs to be emulated through adequate publicity and education to achieve M-powerment in a significant way. I thank you all for giving me this opportunity to address this august gathering. I hope some of the issues that I have raised will be discussed in this Summit and some solutions found. I wish you all the best. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jens Weidmann: Rebalancing Europe Speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at Chatham House, London, 28 March 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Thank you, Mr Popham, for the words of welcome. This is a very special event for me. Chatham House has been held in great respect for almost a hundred years – not only in the UK but also in Germany and across the globe. The privilege I feel is underscored by the distinguished audience that has gathered here today. I feel truly honoured to speak to you in such a famous venue. About six weeks ago, I came across an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading German daily. The author of the article, an economist at the London School of Economics, had chosen the title: “The fanatic central bank – where there is a will, there is always just one way”. Well, I did come here wearing the hat – or rather the suit – of a central banker, and of a “Bundesbanker” at that. The ideas that I am going to present might therefore be seen as fairly conservative and principled. But, as I hope to convince you, they are still well short of being fanatic. I did not come here to deliver a lecture. I am, in fact, deeply convinced that sharing and discussing ideas will lead to better solutions. During the next quarter of an hour, I will try merely to outline my line of reasoning in order to leave enough scope for discussion. But first, a brief look at where we currently stand in these challenging times. 2. Europe off balance We face a crisis that is no longer confined to individual countries. Throughout Europe, it weighs heavily on people’s minds and challenges the viability of monetary union in its current form. It is obvious to all of us that the crisis has to be resolved and future crises must be prevented. The first step must be to contain the crisis, to prevent it from spreading. To this end, policymakers have surrounded the crisis with a “Wall of Money”, which has meanwhile reached a height of €500 billion. Ring-fencing is certainly a sensible approach, but just like the “Tower of Babel” the “Wall of Money” will never reach heaven. If we continue to make it higher and higher, we will, in fact, run into more worldly constraints – both financial and political ones. And, whether we like it or not, we are also changing the rules of the game in monetary union and might set incentives that lead to new problems in the future. In any case, we must realise that all the money we put on the table will not buy us a lasting solution to the crisis. As Mervyn King frequently and rightly states: “all we can buy is time” – time that must be used to address the root causes of the crisis. I think we all agree that the crisis has two major causes: first, the macroeconomic imbalances that have built up in recent years and, second, public and private debt that has ballooned in some member states. Both problems must eventually be addressed. Europe has to be rebalanced. But views on how to achieve this goal differ. Given the unprecedented character of the crisis and its complexity, this seems only natural to me. Still, I hope that the fault lines will converge at some point in the future and that a consistent approach will emerge. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Now, what are the specific questions we have to address? 3. Rebalancing Europe Frankly, there are about a million questions to be answered. But to simplify matters a bit and to keep my outline reasonably short, I will ignore some of them. Altogether, I will address just two questions today. The first one relates to the macroeconomic imbalances. Their most prominent symptom are diverging current accounts – countries such as Greece run persistent current account deficits, while countries such as Germany run persistent surpluses. The question is: which countries have to adjust? Those with a current account deficit? Those with a surplus? Both? The second question looks at the additional problem of public debt. It is obvious that public deficits have to be brought down significantly. But is it sensible to consolidate while simultaneously correcting macroeconomic imbalances by deleveraging and by rebalancing the current account? 3.1 Rebalancing current accounts Let us begin by looking at the first question. Normally, exchange rate movements are an important channel through which unsustainable current account positions are corrected – eventually, deficit countries devalue, while surplus countries revalue their currencies. The reaction this triggers in imports and exports then helps to bring the current account closer to balance. In a monetary union, however, this is obviously no longer an option. Spain no longer has a peseta to devalue; Germany no longer has a deutsche mark to revalue. Other things must therefore give instead: prices, wages, employment and output. Which brings me back to my original question: which countries have to adjust? The typical German position could be described as follows: the deficit countries must adjust. They must address their structural problems. They must reduce domestic demand. They must become more competitive and they must increase their exports. But this position has not gone uncontested. Indeed, a number of renowned economists take a different view. They fear that it would be too much of a burden for the deficit countries alone to adjust. They consequently suggest that surplus countries should shoulder at least part of the burden. To avoid confusion, it is important to make a distinction at this point. A distinction between the adjustment as such and the burden it entails. Only the burden can be shared. I think most people would agree that the adjustment itself has to take place in the deficit countries. It is true that surplus countries have benefited through higher exports. But ultimately, it was the deficit countries that operated an unsustainable model defined by a credit-fuelled boom in domestic demand, and this model has to be reformed. Not every deficit country needs the same reforms, of course, but all require some sort of adjustment. By contrast, it is sometimes suggested that rebalancing should be undertaken by “meeting in the middle”, that is by making surplus countries such as Germany less competitive. This suggestion implies that the adjustment as such would be shared between deficit and surplus countries. But the question we have to ask ourselves is: “where would that take us?” The competitive edge some economies enjoy did not come for free. It is the result of often painful adjustments among workers and within firms. Giving part of it up to ease the pressure on deficit countries might make these countries better off in relative terms. But would it not make everyone poorer in absolute terms? 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 We have to acknowledge that Europe is not an island but part of a globalised world. And at the global level, we are competing with economies such as the United States or China. I ask you: how can we, how can Europe succeed in this world if we willingly give up our hard-won competitiveness? To succeed, Europe as a whole has to become more dynamic, more inventive and more productive. To make a more popular comparison: imagine that in the Champions League Barcelona were denied Lionel Messi just so that the other teams, including Bayern Munich, had a better chance of winning. Would that be a sensible way to rebalance the competitiveness of Europe’s top teams? In my view, we will gain nothing if we try to rebalance by actively shifting weights at both ends of the scale. A second point is this: a large proportion of the current account deficits and surpluses result from trade with countries outside the euro area. Even if surplus countries expanded their imports, this would help their fellow euro-area countries to increase their exports only marginally. The latter must first offer something other euro-area countries would want to buy from them rather than from someone else. To achieve this, the deficit countries must take measures that unlock their potential to increase productivity and improve competitiveness. This would considerably reduce the cost of adjustment and the time it takes. The OECD and other organisations have for years been promoting a long list of reforms. These aim at making labour markets more flexible, opening up product markets and making the public sector more efficient. A number of reforms have already been announced and, in some instances, implemented in countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy. And we are already seeing some promising results, especially in Ireland. But despite these first steps, there is still a long way to go. Such an adjustment will initially place a huge burden on the people in deficit countries, even taking into account the extraordinary boom in the years prior to the crisis. But will the burden be too heavy to bear? A central fear is that of deflation. Unless productivity growth increases miraculously, it is certainly true that prices and wages will have to fall in many cases. But we must not confuse such a one-time adjustment with full-fledged deflation. And we must acknowledge that surplus countries are already helping to ease the burden of adjustment. What are the rescue packages other than publicly guaranteed interim loans to facilitate the adjustment? Another thing we should not forget is this: of course, surplus countries will eventually be affected as deficit countries adjust. Not every country on earth can run a current account surplus – unless we trade with “space aliens” as Paul Krugman recently suggested. As the deficit countries import less and become more competitive exporters, surplus countries will run lower surpluses. The key issue is whether this happens as a result of market processes or as a result of efforts to fine-tune aggregate demand in the euro area. I would welcome the former, but I object to the latter. 3.2 Consolidating public budgets Reforms aimed at promoting growth are an important part of the adjustment process – I think everybody agrees on that. But what about consolidation? A frequently cited argument is that it would be too much of a burden for countries to correct macroeconomic imbalances and consolidate public debt at the same time. The result, it is said, would be a vicious cycle of falling demand and slowing economic growth. It is true that consolidation might, under normal circumstances, dampen economic growth. But structural reforms and consolidation are often hard to disentangle. For example, a 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches bloated public sector or very generous pension system are both a drag on growth and a burden on the budget. And another question is: are these normal times? It is quite obvious that everybody views public debt as a major threat. The markets do, politicians do and people on the street do. A wide-spread lack of trust in public finances weighs heavily on growth: there is uncertainty regarding potential future tax increases, while funding costs rise for private and public creditors alike. In such a situation, consolidation might inspire confidence and actually help the economy to grow. In my view, the risks of consolidation are consequently being exaggerated. In any case, there is little alternative. The Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne recently said: “You can’t borrow your way out of debt”. In my opinion, he is absolutely right; the only promising approach is to “cut” your way out.  3.3 A bigger role for the Eurosystem? “Stop”, some might say at this point, “it is true that member states will eventually have to reform, and governments will have to tighten their belts. But that still leaves the ECB. Shouldn’t the ECB temporarily ease the pressure even more?” Usually, the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy is clear-cut for good reason. Once a central bank becomes involved in fiscal policy, it eventually loses its independence and its credibility as an inflation-fighter. This is the story told not only by economic theory but also by historical experience. Just think about the unholy “marriage” between Banca d’Italia and the Italian treasury in 1975. Banca d’Italia promise of marriage was to act as buyer of last resort for government bonds. Until the “divorce” in 1981, Italian government debt more than tripled, while average inflation stood at 17%. After Banca d’Italia was granted greater independence, inflation rates began to fall significantly. Or think of the UK: after the new monetary framework was established in 1993 and the Bank of England was granted greater independence, inflation rates also came down. However, during a crisis the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy can become blurred. To contain the crisis, central banks have to act more flexibly and accept more risks on their balance sheets. I think this is unavoidable, and the Eurosystem has already undertaken tremendous efforts in this direction. But although there are times when things are not black and white, I do not think clear distinctions are completely irrelevant. This is particularly pertinent in a monetary union where member states retain their autonomy in fiscal and economic policy. In such a setting, governments have an incentive to accumulate debt; this is known as a deficit bias. To counter that incentive, the EU Treaty explicitly prohibits monetising public debt. If central banks went down this route, they would be redistributing fiscal risks and costs among the taxpayers of the euro area. However, this is the prerogative of national parliaments. If central banks’ balance sheets are used to bring about redistribution and if the implied costs become apparent, this could have a highly corrosive effect on the credibility of central banks and on their independence. Credibility and independence are, however, indispensable to maintain price stability and to ensure the acceptance of monetary union as a whole. This would be too high a price to pay, and again we would merely be buying time. 4. Conclusion This brings me back to the beginning of my speech: we must not just contain the crisis, we must resolve it. To achieve this goal, we must address two central issues: the problem of excessive public debt and the problem of macroeconomic imbalances. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Countries with current account deficits and excessive public debt must act. They must implement structural reforms and they must consolidate their budgets to get back onto a stable growth path. Of course, adjustment is a huge challenge for the people in these countries but the status quo is clearly unsustainable, and doing nothing will lead to even sharper corrections. By contrast, taking up the challenge will open the doors to a more stable and more prosperous future. In my speech, I have focused on the member states. This is not to deny that an overhaul of the institutional framework of monetary union is equally pressing. Member states have made it clear that they want to retain their autonomy in fiscal policy. But in that case we need stricter rules to counter the deficit bias that I mentioned before. Some progress has been made on this issue. Now, it is decisive that the rules are applied rigorously. In addition, placing monetary union on a sounder footing is closely linked to regulatory reforms in the financial system. But I will leave these important issues for the discussion, rather than going into them right now. Admittedly, the crisis has opened our eyes to structural flaws at many levels. But this sobering experience has also provided the impetus to correct these shortcomings. The time has come to move from containing the crisis to resolving it. If we have the will to make the right choices, we will be able to rebalance Europe and lay the foundation for a stronger, more stable monetary union. As Winston Churchill said: “Difficulties mastered are opportunities won”. Ladies and gentlemen, I have presented my ideas to you and I now look forward to discussing them with you. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mario Bergara: Financial stability nets – complementing and reinforcing micro and macro perspectives Speech by Mr Mario Bergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Uruguay, at the opening of the 9th meeting of the IADI Latin America Regional Committee (LARC), Punta del Este, 21 March 2012. *      *      * The speech is based on an article prepared by Messrs Mario Bergara, Gerardo Licandro and Jorge Ponce for the Conference “Macroprudential policies to achieve financial stability”, hosted by the Central Bank of Uruguay and the International Monetary Fund, Punta del Este, 29 February – 2 March 2012. The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the view of the Banco Central del Uruguay. 1. Lessons from the crisis: What is new? The aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis witnessed a surge on the discussion of financial stability issues. In some countries the focus of the debate is on the role of the shadow financial system, its relationship with banks, and the regulatory and supervisory failure to address the problem of regulatory arbitrage. In Europe, the main concerns lies on the lack of a European safety net, mainly due to the absence of a European lender of last resort. In emerging countries, however, the discussion is centered around the impact of the crisis on the volatility of capital flows and the architecture of the international financial system. Though some of the phenomena underlying the origins and depth of the financial crisis were either new or located in new instruments and markets, most of the issues that were raised during this episode can be traced back to the first financial crisis of the world. In the following lines, we develop the argument that even though financial stability concerns are as old as financial systems, and despite some of the main lessons of the recent crisis look pretty much alike the lessons of several financial episodes of the past (to which many jurisdictions have already reacted), there are good reasons to heighten our concern with financial stability. Financial stability arises as a main concern, despite the fact that the concept is neither new, nor the main explanation for the collapse the world experienced in 2008. The crisis revealed the existence of regulatory failures at different levels, as well as problems in the design of the financial safety nets both at the national and international level. In what appears to be nearly a paradox, regulatory failure has remained in the background overshadowed by the concentration of policy making bodies in financial stability. Financial stability concerns have had an impact on the management of both macro and micro policies regarding financial stability for a long time now. Uruguay can give examples of that matter. To quote one, in 1998 when facing a bullish international environment, Uruguay increased capital requirements on banks to tame the seemingly bubbling behaviour of domestic credit. For years now, Uruguay has worked on increasing the maturity of domestic public debt to avoid liquidity pressures on fiscal accounts that might in the end affect the health of the banking sector. Another example is our country’s concern with real exchange appreciations. In the graph below it is possible to see that every financial crisis we had in the last 50 year was preceded by a deep and gradual appreciation of the real exchange rate followed by a sudden and sharp depreciation. That lesson has carved deep into the skins of the Uruguayan people, who see the appreciation of the currency as a sign of trouble to come. As a reflection of that concern, macroeconomic policy has always been keen to keep an eye on the exchange rate market, trying to prevent the misalignment of the real exchange rate with respect to fundamentals. Financial stability is then a long term concern in both macro en micro economic policy design. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Despite their long standing tradition on caring about financial stability, emerging countries like Uruguay are paying a renewed and closer attention to the matter because the international environment has changed. The G20 solution to the financial crisis has set clearly the boundaries of the international financial safety net, which were previously unknown, and has left a legacy of medium term excess liquidity that has to be dealt with in emerging economies. The sum of those two elements implies much more volatile international capital flows, in an international financial architecture in which each country is basically on its own. As a result, even though financial stability is nothing new to us, we are paying a much closer look at the ways to complementing and reinforcing efforts to enhance the stability of our financial system and its contribution to the whole economy. In the next lines we would go over the way we envisage financial stability in the new international context. 2. Why is public intervention in financial markets necessary? Public intervention in an industry is commonly justified by the existence of market failures and externalities. Market failures and externalities are particularly pregnant in financial markets. Financial markets operate in an environment of asymmetric information where adverse selection, moral hazard and costly state verification problems play a very important role. Moreover, the activities of the financial market players pose important spill-overs and externalities over other players in the industry, other industries, the domestic economy and even spread over other economies. Many examples of contagion, externalities and other market failures may be identified on the recent global financial crisis. Some aspects that are specific to the financial industry provide a rationale for public intervention in financial markets: Representing and protecting small claimholders. Financial institutions (e.g. banks) finance risky investments (e.g. loans) through retail deposits and other liabilities. Retail depositors, as well as other claimholders, are relatively small (and maybe nonsophisticated) agents. They do not have either the technical capabilities or the incentive to monitor financial institutions. Hence, public intervention is justified in order to cope with the potential moral hazard problem. In particular, a public entity assumes the representation of small claimholders of financial institutions in order to protect them (see Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994). Controlling systemic risk, financial and macroeconomic stability. One of the main functions of financial institutions is to manage risks. For this reason, financial institutions are inherently fragile, to the point that some authors refer to them as “risk machines” (see Bessis, 2010). Moreover, troubles in one institution may rapidly amplify and spread to others through balance sheet interlinks and financial contagion, and affect the payment systems and the real economy (see, for instance, Allen and Gale 2000, Diamond and Dybvig 1983, Freixas et al. 2000. Ponce and Tubio 2010 offer a review of the literature). In addition to these externalities, amplification and spill-over effects, a situation of financial instability may be the result of the materialization of a macroeconomic risk which is common to all financial institutions (see Rochet, 2004). Yet, financial institutions may face difficulties to coordinate actions in order to resolve potentially damaging imbalances. Rochet and Vives (2004) demonstrate in a formal model that such coordination failure may determine that solvent financial institutions face severe liquidity shortfalls. Hence, these market failures and the need to preserve public goods (e.g. the payment system and the financial and macroeconomic stability) provide another rationale for public intervention. Protecting taxpayer’s money. Financial crises have demonstrated to impose large cleaning burdens to fiscal authorities. Hence, the protection of fiscal revenues is another rationale for prompt public intervention in order to reduce the frequency and the impact of crises, and to quickly and efficiently resolve them once they have materialized. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Public intervention in financial markets commonly implies a series of functions that can be classified into the categories of prevention and resolution. Among the category of prevention one can mention the activities of monitoring and assessing risks (two crucial functions of financial supervision), and the application of a regulatory policy. A regulatory policy implies the use of rules (i.e. regulations) but also of preventive action (e.g. to enforce rules), and corrective action (e.g. to lean against imbalances). The resolution policy involves the use of rules, which are important to guarantee prompt and efficient resolution processes, the resolution and cleaning of institutions in trouble, and the correction of imbalances. Many tools are used to fulfil the objectives of public intervention in financial markets: prudential regulation, control and supervision (i.e. preventive tools), and resolution mechanisms and emergency liquidity assistance (i.e. resolution tools). The set of all these functions and tools provides a financial safety net to the financial system. In general, the functions and tools of the financial safety net are allocated to different agencies. For example, it is generally the central bank which is responsible for the provision of emergency liquidity assistance. Other responsibilities like prudential regulation, supervision, and deposit insurance are allocated inside the central bank in some jurisdictions and outside in others. In order to determine the most efficient governance structure for the financial safety net policymakers should consider the agencies explicit conflict of objectives, the potential conflict of opinions about key issues (e.g. the intervention or the liquidation of a financial institution, the provision of short term emergency assistance, the authorization of mergers and acquisitions), and the need for coordination. In addition to this, policymakers should consider the pros and cons of the unification versus the separation of financial safety net agencies on the grounds of their relative expertise, capabilities, reputation, credibility and institutional strength. Moreover, the financial safety net affects and is affected by other functions like the conduction of monetary policy and fiscal policy. These effects should also be considered when designing financial stability institutions. We come back to this point in Section 5. 3. Micro- and macro-prudential perspectives Sound risk management are needed not only at individual institutions but also at the financial system as a whole. The severity of the recent global financial crisis can only be explained by the systemic risk factors that propagated the problems in individual institutions and markets to the entire global financial system. The close relationship between individual and systemic risks provides a rationale for complementing the traditional micro-prudential perspective (focusing on individual risks) with a macroprudential perspective (assessing systemic risks). Most of the financial regulatory and supervisory apparatus focalizes on the microprudential perspective. Some exceptions are the cases of Spain and Uruguay which have been implementing mechanisms to control both the static and the dynamic dimensions of systemic risk (e.g. dynamic provisioning and limit to currency mismatches) during the last decade. The recent Basel III capital and liquidity accord makes advances in the consideration of systemic risk. However, most of the current financial regulation focuses on the stability of each financial institution and market considered in isolation. Hence, it largely ignores the externalities that one institution poses on the others, the systemic importance of individual institutions, and the risks that are generated endogenously to the financial system. Moreover, the regulation focusing on individual institutions may open possibilities for regulatory arbitrage, i.e. the possibility that financial institutions avoid regulations of certain activities by conducting them through other entities (or lines of business) which are subject to less severe regulations. The final objective of the macro-prudential perspective is to avoid the materialization of large social and economic costs due to financial instabilities. Hence, this perspective to financial stability considers the entire financial system and intends to protect their infrastructures (e.g. the payment system, the interbank and the money markets). The macro-prudential 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches perspective oversights the aggregate risk of the entire financial system by explicitly considering the exposition of individual institutions and market to common sources of risk, and the dynamic of risks that are generated endogenously. The micro- and the macro-prudential perspectives should be jointly considered in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage and to ensure financial stability. Both perspectives should complement and reinforce each other in order to protect small customers and the stability of the entire financial system. Hence, their contribution should be transversal to the financial safety net agencies rather than the responsibility of a specific, macroprudential authority. The following sections analyse the implications of jointly considering the micro- and the macro-prudential perspectives on rules, institutions, governance and the design of macroeconomic policy. 4. Micro- and macro prudential policies: A two-way road The following lines we argue that the function of financial stability implies a more articulated cooperation between institutions concerned with macro and microeconomic policy making and regulation. 4.1 Implications of systemic risk on traditionally micro-prudential rules and institutions The consideration of systemic risks (e.g. exposure to common and correlated risks, interconnectedness, financial and real sector conglomerates, cross border issues, regulatory arbitrage, new kinds of risks and developments) have implications on traditionally micro-prudential rules and institutions. Risk-based regulation. Risk-based regulation implies that similar risks face similar regulations regardless the financial institution and activity that generate them. This kind of regulation is a direct way to provide safety and protection to claimholders of financial institutions and other participants to the financial system. Other kind of regulation (e.g. activity-based and institution-based) may imply that important sources of risk remain unregulated and foster regulatory arbitrage. Moreover, they may ignore the important synergies, interlinks and externalities among different activities and financial institutions (which are particularly relevant under financial conglomerates) that contribute to systemic risk. To anticipate and control excessive risk taking is a direct mechanism to mitigate the negative effects that the materialization of risks impose to the stability of the financial system. A risk-based regulation acts directly over the incentives to take risks, and reduces the possibility of regulatory gaps whereby important activities that should be regulated escape regulation. Dynamic regulatory perimeter. Financial institutions are special not only because they are specialized on risk management but also because they have shown to be creative and efficient on the development of new products. Financial innovation may contribute to social welfare but it also may serve as a device to arbitrate regulation and thereby to increase individual and aggregate risk. The capacity to innovate of financial institutions, the potential for regulatory arbitrage, and their potentially dangerous effects to the whole financial system provide a rationale for allowing the agencies on the financial safety net to expand and contract the regulatory perimeter (i.e. to select what institutions and activities should be regulated) in order to promptly react to new kinds of risks as market develop. The possibility to dynamically adjust the regulatory perimeter is also justified by the trend of financial institutions to form groups and conglomerates where a stockholding company (even a non-financial one) owns financial institutions. Moreover, state-owned and privately-owned financial institutions managing similar risks should be in the same side of the regulatory perimeter and then subject to the same kind of regulations and controls. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Uruguay represents a particular case in Latin America where the Law gives powers to the financial sector regulator and supervisor to adjust the regulatory perimeter in order to fulfil its mandate of preserving the stability of the financial system.  Centralized regulation. The regulation of financial institutions should be centralized in a unique regulator. The existence of many agencies regulating the same financial institution (e.g. in an activity-based regulatory framework) may imply important overlaps in regulatory requirements or important gaps where important activities that should be regulated escape regulation. Moreover, financial markets are naturally dynamic and financial institutions and markets (e.g. banks and other intermediaries, pension funds, insurance and capital markets) show important interlinks which justify the need for a large level of consistency thought different regulations. More centralization of financial regulation may imply lower bureaucratic costs, economies of scale and scope, the use of a conglomerates logic and lower regulatory arbitrage. These advantages from concentrating financial regulation may be traded off the potential advantages from a less concentrated financial regulation (e.g. efficiency gains due to specialization). The rules and tools used by the centralized regulator should consider micro- and macroprudential risks. Otherwise stated, the financial regulator should take both prudential perspectives into consideration when writing rules and using regulatory tools and instruments. Hence, the financial regulator should receive as a clear and explicit mandate not only to ensure the stability of individual institutions and markets, but also to guarantee the stability of the whole financial system. Other aspects that are related to the governance of the financial regulator and its relationship with other agencies are analysed in Section 5. 4.2 Implications of micro-prudential concerns on macroeconomic polices Micro prudential policy has a direct impact on macroeconomic policy, but experience shows that the reciprocal is also true. Changes in regulation and supervision affect the power, reach and timing of macro policies. Leaving aside the obvious effects in crisis times, it is well known the impact of regulation and supervision on the development of financial markets and credit. Changes on the development of financial markets have a direct effect on the power of monetary policy. Changes in credit affect might affect consumption and therefore fiscal revenues. The recent crisis has highlighted the potential effect of failure in regulation and supervision on the creation of asset price bubbles. If we add those “normal time” effects to the ones generated during times of stress, we have a clear case why both monetary and fiscal policy should be concerned with financial stability.  Nevertheless, since many financial crisis can be traced back to problems in policy at the macro level, there is a clear case of a reciprocal concern on macro policy design coming from the authorities of the financial safety net. Particularly in the case of emerging economies, threats to financial stability come from the macro environment, and depend largely on the way macroeconomic policy is conducted. Reinhardt and Rogoff illustrate that financial crisis tend to cluster in history, and are related to the volatility of capital inflows and commodity prices. The literature on early warning systems suggest that the most basic features that currency and banking crisis seem to share are unsustainable appreciations of the domestic currency and fiscal problems. In the case of Uruguay, the three cases depicted in the figure portrayed in section I can be explained by (or cannot be understood without) problems on the design of macroeconomic policy. Since most financial crisis events have macroeconomic factors that either caused or amplified them, financial stability concerns should affect the design of macroeconomic policies. The impact of macroeconomic policies on financial stability justifies the presence of macro policy makers in the discussion of financial stability issues not only as the ones that pay the 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches bill once the crisis has started, but also as key actors in the prevention of episodes of financial instability. A direct result of the line of reasoning that this paper develops is that financial stability is a two way road, in which all the actors involved have some milage to cover in order to ensure financial stability. 5. Financial stability committees: from safety to stability nets The final outcome in terms of financial stability depends on the policies conducted by several of the agencies that are involved on macroeconomic policy design and the financial safety net: prudential regulation and supervision, emergency liquidity assistance, deposit insurance, etc. All the agencies that may contribute to the stability of a financial system “own” policy instruments and tools, and are responsible for their use. The challenges are that all these agencies should internalize the effects of their policies on financial stability; that all these agencies should complement each other on the identification and the assessment of risks and vulnerabilities; and that policy instruments and tools should be used and calibrated by considering both the micro- and the macro-prudential perspectives to financial stability. Operationally independent agencies should receive clear mandates and remain accountable for the outcome of their policies. Hence, safety net agencies should receive the mandate of contributing to the stability of the whole financial system in addition to their specific mandates. Yet, agencies may have conflicting opinions on crucial decisions which may end in situations of financial instability. Financial stability committees appear as a response to align incentives, coordinate efforts, and contribute for all agencies to comply with their respective mandates. Financial stability committees also add to the financial safety net by helping the micro- and the macroprudential perspectives to complement and to reinforce each other. Financial stability committees are a step toward financial stability nets. Uruguay, like other Latin American countries, has recently created a committee with the objectives of sharing information and coordinating actions among the financial safety net agencies. Financial stability committees serve as a framework to share information and to coordinate actions. They also help to improve the identification and the assessment of risks, and the accountability of the stability net agencies. Hence, they help safety net agencies to comply with their mandates. The specific mandates of safety net agencies and the operational constraints that they face imply that each of them specializes on the oversight of specific dimensions of financial risks. To share, combine and analyse the different pieces of information under the leadership of a financial stability committee improves the efficiency of risk assessment not only by profiting from the specialization of safety nets agencies on assessing specific risks, but also by having a more comprehensive approach to risks, by considering the interlinks between them, and by anticipating new risks. To get information from different safety net agencies also has the benefit for the financial stability committee (and the social welfare) of reducing the potential that the industry “captures” safety net agencies (see Boyer and Ponce, 2011). Moreover, the sharing of information, the insights provided by different safety net agencies, and the explicit consideration of different point of view on crucial decisions imply the generation of observable (and verifiable) information which may improve the accountability of the agencies.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Patrick Honohan: Ireland – institutional indebtedness and the banking crisis Opening statement by Mr Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Dublin, 27 March 2012. *      *      * Although I will need to take great care in my statement to protect the financial interest of the State in view of current discussions, recognising the interest and concern of the Committee to understand the various issues surrounding the Promissory Notes, a scheduled amortisation payment of which falls due next week, I will be glad to provide as clear an account of the matter as I can. The Promissory Notes owned by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) are part of the legacy of the banking crisis. They represent just one aspect of a large and complex structure of institutional indebtedness involving the Government, the banks and the central banking system, which has resulted from that crisis.  Although some commentators have tended to exaggerate the extent to which the tax increases and spending cutbacks which have to date been put in place in Ireland can be attributed to the banking debt, this debt does hang over the economic and financial recovery of Ireland and – as is generally agreed – needs to be set on a more secure basis.  The Promissory Notes were provided by the Minister for Finance, using powers granted to him by the Oireachtas under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, as a way of ensuring the compliance of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society – the precursor institutions of IBRC – with the Capital Requirements Directives. This became necessary as a result of the losses entailed in the prices announced in March 2010 and the following months for the various tranches of NAMA purchases.  The pace of the annual cash payment stream provided for in the Notes was, from the outset, structured – perhaps somewhat arbitrarily – as one-tenth of the value of the Note to be paid on March 31 each year, with the total duration of the payment stream being set to ensure the capital requirement. The Notes were reset on several occasions during 2010 to reflect the progressive crystallisation of losses. Interest on the value of the Notes was included at the yield required by the market on Irish Government Securities of comparable maturity at the time of each issue of the Notes. It is relevant to note that the spread on ten year Irish Government Securities above Bunds immediately after the end-March 2010 PCAR announcement, that made it clear (to any that still doubted it) that extremely large banking losses would be incurred by the banks in the NAMA purchases, was only about 125 basis points. Clearly, the cost of refinancing the amortisation payments at such a yield would have been much lower than it is today. The first annual amortisation payment was made in March 2011. (I abstract here from the question of the interest holiday for the first two years). Meanwhile, it should be recalled that, when, despite the Government guarantees that covered many but not all of them, deposit outflows and bond repayments exceeded Anglo’s capacity, the Central Bank, consistent with the euro-area view that no senior bank creditors should suffer losses in the crisis, extended emergency liquidity assistance to Anglo Irish Bank. To cut a long story short, much of this is still outstanding to IBRC, and much of it is secured by the Promissory Notes. Funding such flows is not something that a central bank will normally do for any longer than is necessary.  With the Troika and the other Irish authorities, the Central Bank has been actively studying ways of enhancing the security of the arrangements surrounding the provision of liquidity to IBRC and ensuring that avoidable deleveraging costs to the system as a whole are not incurred in the disposal of non-core assets. This is a large ambition, and the design of a full 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches solution that would achieve the objectives and respect the constraints of all the parties has not yet been finalised. Given the deepening of the crisis since April 2010 and in particular the loss of market access by the Government and the need to have recourse to the EU-IMF Programme to ensure continued financing of the Government’s budget, the sequence of annual cash payment by the Government of €3.06 billion envisaged for the coming years in the Promissory Notes has become a source of risk to financial stability. A way of funding this cash payment over a much longer period would clearly help reduce this risk. Ahead of the scheduled March 2012 payment, the Central Bank has been working vigorously with the ECB and other parties on a mechanism for ensuring such a result in a manner that is at an acceptable cost to Ireland and whose design is beyond criticism from the perspective of Articles 123 and 124 of the Treaty. While some technicalities still need to be resolved, it now seems likely that this effort will be successful. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 William C Dudley: The economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe Testimony by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, before the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology, Committee on Financial Services, United States House of Representatives, Washington DC, 27 March 2012. *      *      * Introduction Chairman Paul, Ranking Member Clay, and members of the Subcommittee, my name is Bill Dudley, and I am President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It is an honor to testify today about the economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe, and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to support financial stability in the United States. Financial stability enables U.S. businesses and households to maintain their access to credit and ensures sustained economic growth. This is why promoting financial stability is an important objective of the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world. Let me preface these remarks by stating that the views expressed in my written and oral testimony are solely my own and do not represent official views of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or any other part of the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, because I am precluded by law from discussing confidential supervisory information, I will not be able to speak about the financial condition or regulatory treatment or rating of any individual financial institution. The U.S. economy is currently expanding at a moderate pace, and strains in global financial markets, although having eased recently, continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. Because developments in Europe will have an important bearing on the prospects for growth and jobs here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve is monitoring the situation there closely. This is also why we have taken special steps in recent months, together with other central banks, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Europe The economic situation in Europe has been unsettled for the better part of two years, with pressure on sovereign debt markets and local banking systems. High debts, large deficits and slow growth in several European countries have called into question the sustainability of the entire euro area. The resulting strains in European markets have affected the U.S. economy. The euro area has the capacity, including the fiscal capacity, to overcome its challenges. However, the politics are very difficult, both because the problem has many dimensions, and because many different countries and institutions in the euro area have to coordinate their actions in order to achieve a coherent and effective policy response. Europe’s leadership has affirmed its commitment to the European Union and its single currency union on numerous occasions. And the leadership is working harder than ever to achieve greater coordination in areas such as fiscal policy. A more robust and resilient European Union would be a welcome development for the United States. Three recent developments are especially encouraging in that regard. First, liquidity concerns have eased significantly following the European Central Bank’s (ECB) long-term refinancing operations in December and February. Through this program, the ECB provides three-year loans to European banks at low rates, accepting a wide array of collateral in return. Hundreds of banks accessed the program in each operation, and the ECB lent nearly €1 trillion in total. As a result, the cost of funding throughout Europe has 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches declined since the program began, the euro has stabilized, and the sovereign bond market has improved. Changes in the ECB’s collateral rules and reserve requirements have also had a positive impact. Second, earlier this month, the Greek government worked with European leaders and its largest creditors to restructure the bulk of its €206 billion of outstanding privately-held bonds. This not only reduced Greece’s total indebtedness, it helped calm persistent worries that a disorderly Greek default could become the trigger for a global economic crisis. Shortly after the debt restructuring, the EU approved a €130 billion aid package for Greece. Together, these measures will provide key support to Greek leaders as they pursue the difficult fiscal reforms that are essential over the long term. Third, leaders in most euro area countries have approved a new treaty designed to increase fiscal coordination. The new rules already appear to be making a difference. Both Spain and Italy recently completed 2012 budgets that move their deficits closer to EU targets. Further, Spain and Italy took their fiscal actions in close consultation with finance ministers from other countries in the euro area, demonstrating a healthy ability to work together. While difficult work still lies ahead, countries in the euro area have made meaningful progress toward achieving long-term fiscal sustainability. Looking to the future, the difficult work that remains also presents special risks – both for Europe and the United States. If Europe fails to chart an effective course forward, this could have a number of negative implications here. In particular, there are three areas of potential risk that I would like to highlight for the Subcommittee today. First, if economic conditions in Europe were to weaken significantly, demand for U.S. exports would decrease. This would hurt domestic growth and have a negative impact on U.S. jobs. It is important to recognize that the euro area is the world’s second largest economy after the U.S. and an important trading partner for us. Also, Europe is a significant investor in the U.S. economy, and vice versa. Thus, what happens in Europe has significant implications for our economy. Second, deterioration in the European economy could put pressure on the U.S. banking system. As the recent round of stress tests revealed, U.S. banks are much more robust and resilient than they were a few years ago. They have bolstered their capital significantly, built up their loan loss reserves and have significantly larger liquidity buffers. The direct net exposures of U.S. banks to the so-called “peripheral” European countries are actually quite modest. The good news in the United States means that we are better able to handle bad news from Europe. With that said, the exposures of U.S. banks climb sharply when one also considers their exposures to the core European countries and to the overall European banking system. U.S. money market mutual funds, in particular, have significant European holdings. This means that if the crisis were to broaden further and intensify, it would put pressure on the capital and liquidity buffers of U.S. banks and other financial institutions. Third, severe stresses in European financial markets would disrupt financial markets here, which could harm the real economy. Stress in the financial markets causes banks to more carefully husband their balance sheets. When that phenomenon occurs, the availability of credit to U.S. households and businesses becomes constrained. Such conditions could also cause equity prices to fall, impairing the value of Americans’ pension and 401(k) holdings. This would damage the U.S. recovery and result in slower output growth and less job creation. At a time when U.S. unemployment is very high, this is a particularly unacceptable outcome. In the extreme, U.S. financial markets could become so impaired that the flow of credit to households and businesses would dry up. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 U.S. dollar swaps In today’s globally integrated economy, banks headquartered abroad play an important role in providing credit and other financial services in the United States. About $1 trillion in worldwide dollar financing comes from foreign banks, $700 billion in the form of loans within the U.S. For these banks to provide U.S. dollar loans, they have to maintain access to U.S. dollar funding. At a time when it is already hard enough for American families and firms to get the credit they need, we have a strong interest in making sure that these banks can continue to be active in the U.S. dollar markets. Banks headquartered outside the U.S. make extensive use of dollars in their financing activities. In part, this results from the fact that the U.S. dollar is the world’s number one currency – a status that brings with it many benefits for our country. It is in our national interest to make sure that non-U.S. banks remain able to access the U.S. dollar funding they need to continue financing their U.S. dollar assets. If access to dollar funding were to become severely impaired, this could necessitate the abrupt, forced sales of dollar assets by these banks, which could seriously disrupt U.S. markets and adversely affect American businesses, consumers and jobs. One way we can help to support the availability of dollar funding, and ensure that credit continues to flow to American households and businesses, is by engaging in currency swaps with other central banks. Such swaps are a policy tool the Federal Reserve has used to support dollar liquidity for nearly fifty years. Most recently, the Federal Reserve established dollar swap lines with major central banks during the global financial crisis of 2008, and reactivated them in May 2010. Last November, the FOMC, cooperating with five other central banks, reduced the rate being charged on these swaps to increase usage. The swaps are intended to create a credible backstop to support – but not supplant – private markets. Banks with surplus dollars are more likely to lend to banks in need of dollars if they know that the borrowing bank will be able to obtain the dollars it needs to repay the loan, if necessary, from its central bank. Ultimately, these dollar swaps are designed to support financial stability, and avoid an unnecessary tightening in financial conditions, so that economic activity and job creation in the United States can continue to recover. Our principal aim is to protect U.S. banks, businesses and consumers from adverse economic trends abroad. I am pleased that the swaps seem to be working. In conjunction with the ECB’s long-term refinancing operations, the swaps have helped European banks avoid the significant liquidity pressures we feared a few months ago and have reduced the risk that they would need to sell off their U.S. dollar assets abruptly. Conclusion In sum, I am hopeful that Europe can effectively address its current fiscal challenges. The Federal Reserve is actively and carefully assessing this situation and the potential impact on the U.S. economy. At this time, although I do not anticipate further efforts by the Federal Reserve to address the potential spillover effects of Europe on the United States, we will continue to monitor the situation closely. Thank you for your invitation to testify today, and I look forward to answering your questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mario Draghi: Remarks at the Annual Reception of the Association of German Banks Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the Annual Reception of the Association of German Banks, Berlin, 26 March 2012. *      *      * Sehr geehrter Herr Schmitz, vielen Dank für Ihre freundliche Einführung und vielen Dank für Ihre Einladung nach Berlin. Ich freue mich, heute hier zu sein.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with my assessment of the current situation in the euro area and shed light on recent signs of improvements in the overall outlook. I would particularly like to draw your attention to the effectiveness of the policy measures implemented by the Eurosystem, the EU institutions and national authorities. And to remind you of the measures that we all must continue to pursue over the coming months and years with great diligence in order to continue on this path of stabilisation.  The current economic situation As this audience knows very well, in November last year, the prospects for the euro area financial sector were very bleak.  Banks were experiencing a period of heightened stress. The inter-bank market was closed except to the strongest institutions in the safest countries, and funding markets were impaired. Unable to raise funds beyond short maturities, many banks were reducing medium-term lending to the real economy. At the same time came the requirement to increase capital ratios to 9%. This increased the risks of substantial deleveraging, including the risk of banks cutting back on loans, notably those to small and medium-sized enterprises.  We could see the intensity of the deleveraging pressures in bank lending surveys and other data. In the fourth quarter of 2011, there was a significant tightening of credit standards on loans to both companies and households. There was no doubt that the euro area was on the brink of a major credit crunch, with potentially adverse consequences for the economy and employment.  At that time, many observers had little confidence in the capacity of the euro area to reverse the situation.  Yet today, only four months on, the picture looks different. There are signs of stabilisation in both financial markets and overall economic activity – albeit still at low levels.  Conditions in bank funding markets have improved. For example, euro area banks have already issued about 70 billion euro in senior unsecured debt so far this year, which is well above the amount they issued in the whole second half of 2011.  Banks are meeting their new capital requirements. The capital plans submitted to the European Banking Authority (EBA) indicate an intention to exceed the benchmarks by more than 20%. EBA has also confirmed that there will be no stress test this year. Bank lending is also stabilising. Banks are starting to assess their financial situation more positively and in many cases their willingness to make loans is increasing. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches How has the picture changed so clearly in only four months? There are two parts to the answer. First, the doomsday predictions were always exaggerated. Not because the situation last November was not very serious. But because the willingness of euro area authorities to take the measures necessary to restore stability was greater than many commentators realised.  Second, euro area authorities have proved their commitment to safeguarding financial stability through a number of important policy measures. The Eurosystem, the EU institutions and national authorities have all played a role in constructing a comprehensive and coherent response to the economic, financial and fiscal challenges that we face. Let me now explain the key elements of this response in more detail. The policy response of the Eurosystem  The primary explanation for the improvement in sentiment over the last few months has been the measures taken by the Eurosystem – that is, we at the European Central Bank (ECB) and our colleagues at the national central banks of the 17 countries that share the euro.  As you know, since December last year the Eurosystem has launched two long-term refinancing operations – LTROs – with a maturity of three years. While the total liquidity requested by banks in these operations amounted to around 1 trillion euro, the net liquidity injection by the Eurosystem has been around half a trillion euro because the other half has been shifted over from other operations.  Let me be clear about why we implemented the three-year LTROs. It was not to support sovereign debt markets. It was also not to bolster bank profits. The LTROs were specifically designed to prevent a credit crunch that could compromise the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. With funding markets closed, banks needed liquidity assurance over the medium term to avoid pre-emptive deleveraging and to continue lending. To understand why these operations were necessary requires a euro area wide perspective. It would be misleading to judge the urgency for action – or the necessary responses – based on the situation in any one country or groups of countries. The Eurosystem acts in the interests of the euro area as a whole with 330 million citizens. This is the perspective that always informs our decisions. Some observers have raised questions about these operations. The questions tend to fall into three categories and since they touch on fundamental issues, I would like to spend a moment responding to them. First, some wonder whether there is really any transmission from the LTROs to the real economy. The argument goes that banks are simply taking cheap liquidity and setting up carry trades or putting the liquidity back into our deposit facility. The facts show that this is an incomplete view. Over 800 banks participated in the February LTRO, compared with around 500 in December. This number included 460 banks from Germany, most of them – literally hundreds – being smaller banks.  I cannot tell you names of the towns and villages in which these banks are located because often they are the only bank in town and could be easily identified. But I can tell you this: that the money is now closer to small and medium-sized enterprises than it was before.  We cannot say that this money will necessarily go to these smaller enterprises but it is certainly very close to them. We have this in mind because nearly three quarters of corporate employment in the euro area is in the small and medium-sized business sector. The banks I am talking about are ones whose main business is lending to the Mittelstand and thereby supporting the real economy. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 It is also not accurate to claim that banks are returning the liquidity straight back to the Eurosystem. We know that banks using the deposit facility are not identical to those borrowing from the Eurosystem. This implies that even though the bulk of the liquidity is returned eventually, it is being directed within the banking system as intended. The second category of question involves concerns that some have expressed that the Eurosystem is exposing itself to excessive risks. Critics point in particular to the differentiated collateral framework adopted by some national central banks to allow banks to participate in the three-year LTROs. Let me underscore that high haircuts are applied to the additional credit claims so as to ensure risk equivalence between this collateral and the regular framework. Moreover, the main elements of the risk management framework applied are common: the eligibility criteria and risk control measures were approved by the Governing Council, and the Council will monitor the effectiveness of the risk control framework on an ongoing basis. Hence, there is only limited national discretion. I should also emphasise that the Eurosystem has a long experience in the acceptance of credit claims in its collateral framework.  Moreover, the Eurosystem is being very careful to manage any risks that may ensue from our current operations. We employ a conservative risk management framework. On the additional collateral presented so far, the average haircut is 53%. This means that on a nominal value of 100 euro we provide 47 euro of liquidity. This shows you how prudently such collateral is accepted.  If over time the market value or quality of the collateral posted were to decline, counterparties would have to provide additional collateral or return part of the liquidity. This too serves to protect the financial soundness of the Eurosystem as a whole. The third kind of question comes from some observers who worry that the liquidity created by the LTRO will lead to inflation or asset price distortions.  Here it is important to distinguish between different concepts of liquidity. We would expect an impact on inflation and asset prices only following a sustained and strong increase in money and credit – not following an increase in central bank liquidity per se. The tentative signs we are seeing of a stabilisation in money and credit growth do not signal increasing inflationary pressures over the medium term. For example, growth in monetary aggregates remains at low levels, with M3 increasing by 2.5% in January 2012, well below the average growth rate of M3 in monetary union so far, which was 5.9%. The same is true of the counterparts of M3 – loans to the euro area private sector increased by only 1.5% in January, compared with an average of 6.8% since the start of the euro. Market indicators of inflation expectations overall show no signs of inflation above our medium-term objective. Investors overall assume a break-even inflation rate in five years of around 1.7%. Looking further out at the inflation expectations between five years and ten years also shows that, adjusted for the usual risk premia, market expectations of long-term inflation are fully consistent with our definition of medium-term price stability.  Moreover, the Eurosystem has a range of tools at its disposal to absorb excess liquidity if that is deemed necessary in the future. Available tools include increases in reserve requirements and the conduct of liquidity absorbing operations including not only short-term but also longer-term deposits. Hence, there are tools and the Governing Council can use them as needed. Moreover, our balance sheet has grown and shrunk in the past without creating inflation – for example, this was evident over the course of both 2009 and 2010. In other words, we are constantly alert to threats to medium-term price stability. Euro area citizens can be certain that our objective is delivering price stability over the medium term – and that we have all the necessary tools to achieve it. The consistent strong anchoring of inflation expectations confirms that our commitment is credible.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Let me address one final issue, and this concerns the debate in this country about Target2 balances. It is important that this debate is framed correctly – in particular, by distinguishing between symptoms and causes. Target2 is a payment system that reflects the flow of funds within the euro area. Imbalances within Target2 are a symptom of real and financial imbalances between euro area countries. Restoring normality within Target2 requires not that we address the symptom – the payment system – but that we address the cause: the underlying imbalances. This is not the task of monetary policy. It is the task of the national authorities and EU institutions that are responsible for fiscal, economic and financial policies. Important progress has been made in recent months to strengthen the credibility of these policies – and this has been recognised by financial markets. This is the second explanation for the overall stabilisation we have witnessed since November – and it is something to which I will now turn briefly. Policy responses at the national and EU level The signature at the last European Council of the International Treaty, including the fiscal compact, is an important signal of commitment to reducing deficit and debt levels. Enshrining balanced budget rules in national legislation creates a new “first line of defence” against fiscal imbalances. Like the Schuldenbremse in this country, this legislation shifts the onus for enforcement away from Brussels and onto national institutions. Prevention is better than cure – and that is the spirit of the compact.  Member States have also taken important steps to strengthen euro area and global firewalls. The entry into force of the European Stability Mechanism has been advanced and the paying-in of capital will be accelerated to reach full lending capacity sooner than originally planned. On top of this, euro area countries have committed to providing an additional 150 billion euro to the IMF.  Seen together, these measures represent a coherent strategy to strengthen euro area economic governance. The focus is not, as some commentators claim, skewed towards fiscal consolidation. Stronger fiscal rules are one – albeit essential – element in a larger package that addresses real and financial imbalances and provides a safety net for countries in financial difficulties.  But stronger governance cannot be effective without individual Member States also fulfilling their responsibilities. Here too we have witnessed a number of positive developments in recent months.  The new governments in Spain and Italy have shown determination to address their twin challenges of fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances. The government of Spain remains committed to bringing its deficit below 3% by 2013 and taking the necessary measures to ensure a rapid and secure transition to this target from the high deficit in 2011. The latest review missions confirm that the Irish and Portuguese programmes are on track – with authorities in both countries strongly committed to meeting their targets and with a solid track record.  It is important that observers recognise that these reforms at the national level will take time. They are addressing deep-rooted obstacles to competitiveness and growth, and the positive effects may not be visible immediately. But once realised, they will put employment and growth on a new and more sustainable track. The example of Germany shows the need for patience. The structural reforms passed many years ago did not immediately feed through into higher growth and employment. But now they have, and Germany is reaping the benefits and leading the way in Europe. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 With a new governance framework in place and strong commitments from national governments, there are solid grounds for trusting that reforms will be implemented across the euro area as a whole. Conclusion Let me conclude. The turnaround we have witnessed since November is the result of every institution of the euro area fulfilling its responsibilities. No single institution can carry the burden of addressing a set of challenges that are simultaneously economic, financial and fiscal. Everyone has played their part. But let me emphasise that the current stabilisation should not make us pause in our responses to these challenges. Indeed, this is a time for continued action.  The present situation provides a window of opportunity for governments to accelerate efforts to consolidate budgets, to boost employment and to enhance competitiveness – and to do so with confidence. It also creates a benign environment for banks to strengthen their resilience further – including by retaining earnings and cutting dividends and bonuses. Decisive policy measures brought about the stabilisation since last November. Now, further decisive policy measures are required to strengthen fiscal positions and competitiveness. These measures will lay the foundations for future sustainable and balanced growth in the euro area. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 K C Chakrabarty: Uses and misuses of statistics Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the DST Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Banaras Hindu University, as part of the 150th Birth Anniversary Celebrations of Mahanama Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, Varanasi, 20 March 2012. *      *      * Assistance provided by Shri Abhiman Das in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged. 1. Prof. Umesh Singh, Coordinator, DST Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences, Prof Sengupta, Dean Faculty of Science, Prof Joshi, other distinguished members of faculty of the University, and above all, dear students. I thank you all for inviting me to be in your midst during the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya. It is a great honour and privilege for me. Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya 2. You have provided an opportunity to me to pay my tribute to the “Mahamana” by delivering a lecture as part of the celebrations of his 150th birth anniversary. He was one of the greatest personalities that this nation has ever produced. In many senses, he was what most of the top class institutions today vie to produce. He was, at the same time a great patriot, an eminent educationist, a teacher of teachers, a silver-tongued transcendental orator, an ancient as well as a modern leader, a reluctant but an eminent lawyer, a social reformer, a great human being, a torch-bearer of the downtrodden, and above all, a great nation builder. He lived his life for us and for the future generations. Each and every alumnus of BHU will remain ever grateful to him for having created this university, a capital of all discipline. My association with BHU 3. Of course, some of you know of my association with this esteemed University and the city of Varanasi. I stayed in this city from my early childhood, did my schooling here and then joined the BHU for my graduation and post graduation. Then, I became a lecturer here while I pursued my Ph.D. I taught here for about 5 years and regard that time as one of the best periods of my life. Though my career progression in the banking system including joining the RBI was not as a statistician, I must confess that the analytical ability and articulation skill based on sound knowledge of statistics, which I developed during my academic career both as a student and teacher of Statistics at BHU, greatly contributed to my progress and success in banking career. I am grateful and thankful to all my teachers and colleagues in the department for what I am today. 4. Today, I have chosen to speak on a theme which is directly relevant to all of you and that is “Uses and Misuses of Statistics”. Let me begin with a quote: The safety of science depends on the existence of men who care more for the justice of their methods than for the value of any results obtained by using them.1  5. Statistics is a method of learning from experience and decision making under uncertainty. That is why it is often called the study of the laws of chance. Chance is inherent in all natural phenomena, and the only way of understanding nature and making predictions                                                  1  Cohen, Morris R., on “Scientific Method,” in The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches is to study the laws of chance and formulate appropriate rules of action. Chance may appear as an obstructor and an irritant in our daily life but chance can also create. Through statistics, we have now learnt to put chance to work for the benefit of mankind. C. R. Rao, in the preface of his famous book “Statistics and Truth” thus said “all knowledge is, in the final analysis, history. All sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics and all methods of acquiring knowledge are essentially statistics.”  6. The importance of studying the nature of uncertainty was realised centuries ago. In particular, the introduction of statistical ideas in physics began with the need to deal with errors in astronomical measurements. It was Galileo (1564–1642) who first realized that repeated measurements under identical conditions do vary. Indeed he emphasized that “measure again and again to find out the difference and difference of the difference”. About 200 years later, Gauss (1777–1855) studied the probability laws of errors in measurements, which was finally formulated in what we today call the normal distribution. 7. The centrality of uncertainties in pursuit of knowledge did not find enough support from the then scientific community. It is said that even Einstein was initially of the view that theories whose objects are connected by laws should be based on facts, not probabilities. He once famously said, “……God does not play dice with the universe…..” But surprisingly, he accepted the chance behaviour of molecules suggested by S. N. Bose, which resulted in the Bose-Einstein theory. The inherent nature of uncertainties was initially less understood. Although there are uncertainties at the individual level, very few realised a certain amount of stability in the average of a mass of individuals. This is what we call as “order in disorder”, or more technically “statistical regularity”, which paved the way for formulation of law of large numbers in statistics. Discipline of statistics: ancient roots 8. Statistics as subject of collection and use of various kinds of statistics can be traced much earlier in India. Kautilya’s Arthasastra (321–296B.C.), one of the greatest treatise of economics, indicates a system of census and data collection relating to agriculture, population and other economic activities, covering villages and towns. In addition, the concept of cross-checking and validation by independent agents was very much part of the data collection system. Evidences in the writings of Huen Tsang of seventh to early eighth century and Ain-i-Akbari by Abul Fazal show enough empirical basis for handling administration and politics. Essentially, the basic statistical system remains with the government. Modern statistical information system was developed by the British with the objective of collecting taxes and does not meet with the developmental and administrative needs of the society to a large extent. The commercial and business information system were developed primarily for accountants and does not serve the purpose of management. Hence, the statistical system has to reorient to meet the developmental, administrative and management needs of the society. Practitioners of statistics have to play an important role in achieving this objective. Statistics pervades our daily lives 9. We all live with statistics. Starting from the morning newspapers to the evening TV reports, we are surrounded by various statistical figures. We often come across data about out economy: India’s population rose to 1.21 billion people over the last 10 years, an increase by 181 million, according to the Census 2011; India’s GDP increased by 8.5% in 2010–11; Inflation was about 7% in February this year. Deposits of scheduled commercial banks was up by 14.6% in February, 2012 over a year ago. How are these numbers generated? All these figures are themselves part of statistical measurement. There are elaborate statistical systems to collect detailed data and compile them to generate the aggregate numbers. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 10. Statistics provides a better understanding and exact description of a phenomenon of nature. Through an appropriate framework of data collection and well-organised planning of a scientific inquiry in any field of life, it helps in presenting complex information in a suitable tabular, diagrammatic and graphic form for an easy and clear comprehension, and helps in drawing valid inference about the population parameters from the sample data. If a problem can be properly formulated and measurement data can be generated, whether it arises in physical, biological, social sciences or any other discipline, statistical tools can be designed to provide a scientific solution. Thus, it is widely recognized that the proper use of statistics is a key element of scientific enquiry. At this stage let me emphasize that quality and integrity of data is the most important element in the success and utility of statistics. Uses of statistics 11. Let me give some examples of its uses. It plays a critical role in agriculture in deciding the plant varieties, combination of fertilizer, pesticides, densities, soil qualities, and growth of output. India’s statistics exploration started with anthropological experiment. Without the use of statistics, business and economics cannot make proper planning and policy. Performance measurement in education, including IQ, is a statistical construct. Use of statistics in psychological behaviour is known as psychometry. Examination of climate change and environmental studies are effectively statistical data analysis of weather and environment. One of the simple applications of statistics is to estimate the number of fish in a pond, using random sampling and suitable statistical (hypergeometric) distribution. Does the data support genetic theories of inherited characteristics? What is the pattern of rainfall? What are the important risk factors for heart disease? Any marketing strategy is based on some statistical sample study. Is education attainment related to income and health? The Duckworth-Lewis method implemented in limited over cricket is a statistical method. I can keep on giving examples. Misuses of statistics 12. But since its beginning, statistics has also been misused and there has been considerable debate about how to understand or respond to the misuse of statistics. After all, who hasn’t heard of the famous phrase: “There are three kinds of Lies: Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics”, which is variously attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, Alfred Marshall, Mark Twain and many others. To understand what is meant by “misusing statistics,” it is important to describe the role of statistics in the scientific method and relate the concept of “misuse” to other ethical concepts, such as “misconduct” or “incompetence” or “negligence.” Some misuses of statistics can be considered misconduct, although most misuses should be viewed as negligence or deficits of competence. While on the ethical dimension, I shall elaborate further, I shall deal with the other dimensions of “negligence” and “incompetence” as part of information illiteracy slightly later. 13. How statistics has been used and what could be its consequence of misuse is well summarised in the Preamble to the Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice2. It says the professional performance of statistical analyses is essential to many aspects of society. The use of statistics in medical diagnoses and biomedical research may affect whether individuals live or die, whether their health is protected or jeopardized, and whether medical science advances or gets sidetracked. Life, death, and health, as well as efficiency, may be at stake in statistical analyses of occupational, environmental, or transportation safety. Early detection and control of new or recurrent infectious diseases depend on sound                                                  2  American Statistical Association. Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice. Alexandria, VA: American Statistical Association, 1999. Available at http:// amstat.org/profession/ ethicalstatistics.html. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches epidemiological statistics. Mental and social health may be at stake in psychological and sociological applications of statistical analysis. Effective functioning of the economy depends on the availability of reliable, timely, and properly interpreted economic data. The profitability of individual firms depends in part on their quality control and their market research, both of which should rely on statistical methods. Agricultural productivity benefits greatly from statistically sound applications to research and output reporting. Governmental policy decisions regarding public health, criminal justice, social equity, education, the environment, and other matters depend in part on sound statistics. Scientific and engineering research in all disciplines requires the careful design and analysis of experiments and observations. To the extent that uncertainty and measurement error are involved – as they are in most research – research design, data quality management, analysis, and interpretation are all crucially dependent on statistical concepts and methods. Even in theory, much of science and engineering involves natural variability. Variability, whether great or small, must be carefully examined both for random error and for possible researcher bias or wishful thinking. . . . Because society depends on sound statistical practice, all practitioners of statistics, whatever their training and occupation, have social obligations to perform their work in a professional, competent, and ethical manner. 14. The results of statistical investigations are usually stated in numerical form and are, therefore, in the public mind, assigned a degree of definiteness usually associated with mathematical technique. The careful investigator, however, is constantly aware of the fact that the preciseness of his numerical result varies directly with the degree of care used in selecting, from the larger universe, the sample upon which his study is based. The numerical conclusions derived from a study of the sample are held to be characteristic and representative of the universe. A very common error in statistical investigation is the selection of a sample which is not an accurate cross-section of the larger universe but merely a particular, unique segment. Conclusions drawn from the biased sample will not, of course, accurately reflect the larger universe. The misuse occurs when such conclusions are held to be representative of the universe by those who either deliberately or un-consciously overlook the sampling bias. 15. An article about cats appeared in The New York Times’ on August 22, 1989. It stated, “The experts have also developed startling evidence of the cat’s renowned ability to survive, this time in the particular setting of New York City, where cats are prone at this time of year to fall from open windows in tall buildings. Researchers call the phenomenon feline high-rise syndrome.” Statistics were like this: from June 4 through November 4, 1984, 132 such victims were admitted to the Animal Medical Centre and most of the cats landed on concrete and most survived. From the data on the distance of the fall for 129 of the 132 cats, it was observed that the falls ranged from 2 to 32 stories. Only one of 22 cats that plunged from above 7 stories died, and there was only one fracture among the 13 that fell more than 9 stories. But how a cat will survive of a fall from a great height defying gravitation? Such description generally does not push one to scrutinize the statements till it was understood that majority of the cat owners do not report these incidents to any medical centre and believe that other people probably don’t report their cats’ deaths, either. Therefore, the error seemed so obvious that sample was not representative and there was data reporting problems. 16. Let me cite another example on the wrong notion of conditional probabilities, which appear in Statistical Science 2005, a type of intentional and unintentional misinterpretation of statistical information. It says when discussing fatalities on highways on page 78: “Four times more fatalities occur on the highways at 7 p.m. than at 7 a.m.” This of course does not imply, as some newspaper had suggested, that it is more dangerous to drive in the evening than in the morning. Recast in the language of conditional probabilities, that P(accident | 7 p.m.) should not be confused with P(7 p.m. | accident). Unfortunately, it was. One more example, a study of the deaths arising out of road accidents revealed that 98 percent deaths occurs while driving on the left side of the road, whereas, only 2 percent death occurs in case of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 people travelling in the middle of the road. Hence, it was wrongly inferred that it was safer to travel in the middle than on the side of the road. 17. Another area of concern has been the misuse of statistics coming from spurious correlation and attributing such relation to type of cause and effect phenomenon. In most cases a common variable, most importantly “time” works as a link. Let us take another example. Number of people watching TV serials and number of buffaloes will register a high correlation. If one tries to link them and finds a causal relationship is simply absurd. It is easy to get carried way. One of the prime misuses of statistics is finding a strong relationship between two variables when actually such correlation is spurious. However, exploration of such behaviour has also led to path breaking developments in econometrics. For example, most of the macroeconomic series have strong time trend and thus have strong correlation. Prima facie one may suspect the existence of spurious correlation. However, further exploration in such relationships led the foundation of the concept of cointegration. If two variables have a common trend, then there could be a possibility of a long-run equilibrium relationship between them. This statistical finding opened up a new dimension of modern economics and CWJ Granger was awarded Nobel prize in economics for this in 2003. 18. Let me now give you an example from the banking world. The concept of inflation is often misunderstood by people. You would often hear this refrain from many persons that despite RBI claiming that inflation has come down in the recent past, the prices have not come down. So, what is the truth? Well, the truth is simply that inflation is indicated as a percent change, so even when this percent is declining, all it means is that the prices are rising at a slower rate, but they are still rising! The prices would come down only when the inflation becomes negative. 19. In conclusion, we must ask ourselves as to why a quotation like “Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics” as mentioned by me earlier is made about the subject of statistics. In my opinion, it is because the society is illiterate, i.e. it is information illiterate. Information literacy, which most people misunderstand, is the third generation of literacy. The first generation of literacy is when you know how to read and write. The second generation of literacy is when you are computer literate, but it is not enough to be just first or second generation literate. When transiting to a knowledge society, it is critical for all of us to be information literate or be third generation literate. And, one of the purposes of statistics is to bring about information literacy in the society. If that does not happen then statistics can be used to prove or disprove anything and it is the subject of statistics which would bear the burden of ridicule. So, it is up to all of us, faculty, students and practitioners alike, to redirect our efforts towards spreading information literacy in the society. Institutions associated with teaching and training of statistics have a more important role to play in that direction, and I am confident that students, teachers and practitioners of statistics associated with Department of Mathematical Sciences at BHU will take greater responsibility in spreading information literacy in the society. And this will be your greatest service to the memory of “Mahamana” and to the discipline of Statistics. I wish you good luck in this effort. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ben S Bernanke: Recent developments in the labor market Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the National Association for Business Economics Annual Conference, Washington DC, 26 March 2012. *      *      * My remarks today will focus on recent and prospective developments in the labor market. We have seen some positive signs on the jobs front recently, including a pickup in monthly payroll gains and a notable decline in the unemployment rate. That is good news. At the same time, some key questions are unresolved. For example, the better jobs numbers seem somewhat out of sync with the overall pace of economic expansion. What explains this apparent discrepancy and what implications does it have for the future course of the labor market and the economy?  Importantly, despite the recent improvement, the job market remains far from normal; for example, the number of people working and total hours worked are still significantly below pre-crisis peaks, while the unemployment rate remains well above what most economists judge to be its long-run sustainable level. Of particular concern is the large number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months. Long-term unemployment is particularly costly to those directly affected, of course. But in addition, because of its negative effects on workers’ skills and attachment to the labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our economy. The debate about how best to address long-term unemployment raises another important question: Is the current high level of long-term unemployment primarily the result of cyclical factors, such as insufficient aggregate demand, or of structural changes, such as a worsening mismatch between workers’ skills and employers’ requirements? If cyclical factors predominate, then policies that support a broader economic recovery should be effective in addressing long-term unemployment as well; if the causes are structural, then other policy tools will be needed. I will argue today that, while both cyclical and structural forces have doubtless contributed to the increase in long-term unemployment, the continued weakness in aggregate demand is likely the predominant factor. Consequently, the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policies, by providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help, over time, to reduce long-term unemployment as well.  Recent labor market developments As background for my discussion, let me provide a brief review of recent job market indicators. As this audience is well aware, job creation has picked up recently. Private payroll employment (figure 1) increased by nearly 250,000 jobs per month, on average, in the three months ending in February, and by about 190,000 jobs per month, on average, over the past 12 months. At the same time, layoffs in the public sector appear to be moderating. Together with a lengthening of the average workweek, these employment gains have contributed to a significant increase in aggregate hours worked (figure 2). The increase in hours worked is encouraging, because the decline in hours during the recent recession was extraordinary. From the peak of this series in December 2007 to its trough in February 2010, aggregate hours on the job by production workers fell by a remarkable  9–1/2 percent; by comparison, production-worker hours declined by “only” 5–3/4 percent during the severe 1981–82 recession. Currently, hours worked are still about 4 percent below the pre-recession peak – a clear improvement from where we were two years ago, but still far from where we would like to be.  The government estimates payroll employment – the number of jobs – from a survey of businesses – the establishment survey. A monthly survey of about 60,000 households, which 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches provides the data needed to construct the national unemployment rate, offers an alternative estimate of the number of jobs. Employment as estimated from the household survey, adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the concept of employment measured in the establishment survey (figure 3), also shows an improvement in the labor market – indeed, by somewhat more than in the establishment survey. I should note, however, that month-to-month changes in this measure are much more volatile than the employment measure from the establishment survey, which is why the Federal Reserve puts more weight on the establishment survey for the purposes of short-term forecasting.  The positive signs from the labor market have shown through to measures of labor utilization: After hovering around 9 percent for much of last year, the unemployment rate (figure 4) has moved down since September to 8.3 percent in February, and the share of employment represented by people working part time for economic reasons, an indicator of underutilization, has declined modestly.  Surveys of households and firms about their attitudes and expectations offer yet another window on job market developments. Since the summer, household expectations for labor market conditions over the next year have gotten brighter (figure 5), unwinding a deterioration registered earlier last year. Business hiring plans have also shown modest gains (figure 6). Other indicators, such as new claims for unemployment insurance and measures of the breadth of hiring across industries, also point to better labor market conditions.  Notwithstanding these welcome recent signs, the job market remains quite weak relative to historical norms, as I’ve already noted. After nearly two years of job gains, private payroll employment remains more than 5 million jobs below its previous peak; the jobs shortfall is even larger, of course, when increases in the size of the labor force are taken into account. And the unemployment rate in February was still roughly 3 percentage points above its average over the 20 years preceding the recession. Moreover, a significant portion of the improvement in the labor market has reflected a decline in layoffs rather than an increase in hiring.  This last observation is illustrated by the data on gross job flows (figure 7). The monthly increase in payroll employment, which commands so much public attention, is a net change. It equals the number of hires during the month less the number of separations (including layoffs, quits, and other separations). In any given month, a large number of workers are being hired or are leaving their current jobs, illustrating the dynamism of the U.S. labor market. For example, between 2001 and 2007, private employers hired nearly 5 million people, on average, each month. Total separations, on average, were only slightly smaller. Taking the difference between gross hires and separations, the net monthly change in payrolls during this period was, on average, less than 100,000 jobs per month – a small figure compared to the gross flows.  The recent history of these flows suggests that further improvement in the labor market will likely need to come from a shift to a more robust pace of hiring. As figure 7 shows, the declines in aggregate payrolls during the recession stemmed from both a reduction in hiring and a large increase in layoffs. In contrast, the increase in employment since the end of 2009 has been due to a significant decline in layoffs but only a moderate improvement in hiring. To achieve a more rapid recovery in the job market, hiring rates will need to return to more normal levels.  The change in unemployment and economic growth: a puzzle? What will lead to more hiring and, consequently, further declines in unemployment? The short answer is more-rapid economic growth. Indeed, the improvement in the labor market over the past year – especially the decline in the unemployment rate – has been faster than might have been expected, given that the economy during that time appears to have grown 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 at a relatively modest pace. About 50 years ago, the economist and presidential adviser Arthur Okun identified a rule of thumb that has come to be known as Okun’s law. That rule of thumb describes the observed relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP). Okun noted that, because of ongoing increases in the size of the labor force and in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rate of growth of its potential is normally required just to hold the unemployment rate steady. To reduce the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must grow at a pace above its potential. More specifically, according to currently accepted versions of Okun’s law, to achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in the course of a year, real GDP must grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than the rate of growth of potential GDP over that period. So, for illustration, if the potential rate of GDP growth is 2 percent, Okun’s law says that GDP must grow at about a 4 percent rate for one year to achieve a 1 percentage point reduction in the rate of unemployment.  In light of this historical regularity, the combination of relatively modest GDP growth with the more substantial improvement in the labor market over the past year is something of a puzzle. Resolving this puzzle could give us important insight into how the economy is likely to evolve. To illustrate the tension, consider the relationship between the recent changes in the unemployment rate and in real GDP relative to the predictions of Okun’s law (figure 8). As illustrated by the position of the square labeled “2011” relative to the Okun’s law relationship, represented by the line, the decline in the unemployment rate over the course of 2011 was greater than would seem consistent with GDP growth over that period. Indeed, with last year’s real GDP growth below 2 percent, less than what most economists would estimate to be the U.S. economy’s potential rate of growth, one might have expected little change in the unemployment rate last year or even a slight increase. What is this confluence of the significant decline in the unemployment rate and the modest recent increase in real GDP telling us about the state of the economy, and how will the Okun’s law puzzle be resolved?  The apparent failure of Okun’s law could reflect, in part, statistical noise. For example, it may be that future data revisions will show that real GDP grew more quickly over the past year than currently estimated. However, although it is certainly possible that revised data will ultimately explain part of the puzzle, at this point we have no specific evidence suggesting that such a revision might be in the offing. For example, gross domestic income, an alternative measure of economic activity constructed using source data that are mostly different from the data used in estimating GDP, provides some check on the information provided by the better-known GDP measure. However, gross domestic income is currently estimated to have increased less quickly than GDP in 2011 and so does not point to an explanation of the drop in the unemployment rate.  Another logical possibility is that the decline in the unemployment rate could be overstating the improvement in the job market. For example, potential workers could be giving up on looking for work to an unusual extent. Because a person has to be either working or looking for work to be counted as part of the labor force, an increase in the number of people too discouraged to continue their search for work would reduce the unemployment rate, all else being equal – but not for a positive reason. A story centered on potential workers dropping out of the labor force might seem in line with the low level of the labor force participation rate (figure 9). But other data cast doubt on that idea. For example, a broad measure of labor underutilization that includes people only marginally attached to the labor force has declined about in line with the unemployment rate since late 2010 (figure 10).1 On balance, an assessment of a broad range of indicators suggests that a substantial portion of the decline in the unemployment rate does reflect genuine improvement in labor market conditions.                                                   1 The broader measure of labor underutilization referenced here is the U-5 measure of unemployment, constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Yet another interpretation of the recent improvement is that it represents a catch-up from outsized job losses during and just after the recession. In 2008 and 2009, the decline in payrolls and the associated jump in unemployment were extraordinary. In particular, using the Okun’s law metric, the run-up in the unemployment rate in 2009 appears “too large” relative even to the substantial decline in real GDP that occurred. This point can be seen by returning to figure 8, which shows the Okun’s law relationship. The open triangle labeled “2009” in the upper left of the figure shows an increase in the unemployment rate in that year well above the one implied by the contraction in real GDP and Okun’s law. In other words, employers reduced their workforces at an unusually rapid rate near the business cycle trough – perhaps because they feared an even more severe contraction to come or, with credit availability sharply curtailed, they were trying to conserve available cash.  The diagram suggests that what we may be seeing now is the flip side of the fear-driven layoffs that occurred during the worst part of the recession, as firms have become sufficiently confident to move their workforces into closer alignment with the expected demand for their products. Such a dynamic would explain the position of the square labeled “2011” in that figure being far below the line representing Okun’s law. Of course, Okun’s law is a noisy relationship, and we don’t really know if the better-than-expected labor market performance of 2011 has largely offset the worse-than-expected performance in 2009. However, to the extent that the decline in the unemployment rate since last summer has brought unemployment back more into line with the level of aggregate demand, then further significant improvements in unemployment will likely require faster economic growth than we experienced during the past year. It will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess whether the recovery is picking up as improvements in the labor market feed through to consumer and business confidence; or, conversely, whether the headwinds that have impeded the recovery to date continue to restrain the pace at which the labor market and economic activity normalize.  The challenge of long-term unemployment Discussions of the labor market at this juncture necessarily have a “glass half-empty or half-full” tone. Recent improvements are encouraging, but, as I have noted, in an absolute sense, the job market is still far from normal by many measures, and millions of families continue to suffer the day-to-day hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment. Although most spells of unemployment are disruptive or costly, the persistently high rate of long-term unemployment we have seen over the past three years or so is especially concerning. In this episode, both the median and average durations of unemployment have reached levels far outside the range of experience since World War II (figure 11). And the share of unemployment that represents spells lasting more than six months has been higher than 40 percent since December 2009 (figure 12). By way of comparison, the share of unemployment that was long term in nature never exceeded 25 percent or so in the severe 1981–82 recession.  Those who have experienced unemployment know the burdens that it creates, and a growing academic literature documents some dimensions of those burdens. For example, research has shown that workers who lose previously stable jobs experience sharp declines in earnings that may last for many years, even after they find new work.2 Surveys indicate that more than one-half of the households experiencing long unemployment spells since the onset of the recent recession withdrew money from savings and retirement accounts to cover expenses, one-half borrowed money from family and friends, and one-third struggled to meet                                                  2 For example, see Till von Wachter, Jae Song, and Joyce Manchester (2009), “Long-Term Earnings Losses Due to Mass Layoffs during the 1982 Recession: An Analysis Using U.S. Administrative Data from 1974 to 2004,” unpublished paper, Columbia University, April. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 housing expenses.3 Unemployment also takes a toll on people’s health and may have long-term consequences for the families of the unemployed as well. For example, studies suggest that unemployed people suffer from a higher incidence of stress-related health problems such as depression, stroke, and heart disease, and they may have a lower life expectancy.4 The children of the unemployed achieve less in school and appear to have reduced long-term earnings prospects.5  In addition, unemployment – especially long-term unemployment – imposes important economic costs on everyone, not just the unemployed themselves. Elevated unemployment strains public finances because of both lost tax revenue and the payment of increased unemployment benefits and other income support to affected families. People unemployed for a long time have historically found jobs less easily than those experiencing shorter spells of unemployment, perhaps because their skills erode, they lose relationships within the workforce, or they acquire a stigma that deters firms from hiring them. Loss of skills and lower rates of employment reduce the economy’s overall productive capacity over the longer term. In the shorter term, because the process of matching the long-term unemployed to jobs typically takes more time, the currently high level of long-term unemployment might in itself be a reason that further progress in reducing the unemployment rate, and thus in achieving a more complete recovery, could be slow.6  A pessimistic view is that a large share of the unemployment we are seeing, particularly the longer-term unemployment, is structural in nature, reflecting factors such as inadequate skills or mismatches between the types of skills that workers have and the skills that employers demand. If this view is correct, then high levels of long-term unemployment could persist for quite a while, even after the economy has more fully recovered. And it appears true that over the past two decades or so, structural factors have been responsible for some increase in long-term unemployment. For example, because an older worker who loses a job typically takes longer to find a new job than does a younger worker in the same situation, the aging of the baby boom generation has probably contributed to a gradual rise in long-term unemployment. Factors such as globalization, technological change, and the loss of lower-skill manufacturing jobs have likely reduced the employability and earnings potential of some groups of workers. To the extent that higher rates of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, result from structural factors, the scope for countercyclical policies to reduce unemployment would be impaired, and the benefits of a more complete economic recovery for many workers who are unemployed or discouraged would be more limited.                                                   3 See Paul Taylor, Rich Morin, Rakesh Kochhar, Kim Parker, Wendy Wang, Daniel Dockterman, Rebecca Hinze-Pifer, and Soledad Espinoza (2010), “The Impact of Long-Term Unemployment: Lost Income, Lost Friends – and Loss of Self-Respect" (Washington: Pew Research Center, July 22). 4 For example, see Frances McKee-Ryan, Zhaoli Song, Connie R.

6 BIS central bankers’ speeches However, although structural shifts are no doubt important in the longer term, my reading of the research is that, at most, a modest portion of the recent sharp increase in long-term unemployment is due to persistent structural factors.7 Consider, for example, rates of job finding by those unemployed for varying amounts of time (figure 13). Unsurprisingly, the rate at which the long-term unemployed find work is lower than that of those who have been unemployed for only a short time; on average over the period from 1994 to 2007, a bit more than one-third of those already unemployed for one to four weeks found employment within the next month. In contrast, over that same period, only about one-sixth of those already unemployed for more than 27 weeks managed to find a job within a month.  If the recent increase in long-term unemployment were being driven by structural factors rather than, say, the severity of the recession, then the job-finding rates of the long-term unemployed should have fallen sharply relative to those out of work for only a few weeks. But that’s not what we’re seeing. Rather, as figure 13 shows, the job finding rates of the more recently unemployed and the long-term unemployed all fell over the recession in roughly the same proportion, and they remain low.8 This pattern is consistent with cyclical factors accounting for the bulk of the recent increase in long-term unemployment. Similarly, the fact that labor demand appears weak in most industries and locations is suggestive of a general shortfall of aggregate demand rather a worsening mismatch of skills and jobs. Counterexamples like the energy boom in the upper Midwest, where there may be some mismatch in the geographic location of suitably skilled workers or an overall shortage of potential workers with relevant skills, might best be interpreted as the exceptions that prove the rule; a mismatch story would suggest that strong labor demand would be appearing in more sectors or geographical areas by now.  An empirical relationship that economists have long used to interpret developments in the labor market is known as the Beveridge curve (figure 14). That curve – named after the British economist William Beveridge – compares unemployment (the number of workers looking for employers) to job vacancies (the number of workers that employers are seeking). In good times, when the unemployment rate is low, businesses are growing and workers are harder to find, so job vacancies tend to be high. Similarly, in bad times, unemployment is high and few jobs are available (vacancies are low). Thus, the Beveridge curve, the relationship between unemployment and vacancies, is downward sloping.  On the usual interpretation, a recession is a period in which the economy is moving down along the Beveridge curve; as output and the demand for labor fall, job vacancies decline and unemployment rises. In contrast, changes in the structural determinants of unemployment are thought to be reflected in shifts of the Beveridge curve to the left or right. For example, suppose that, because of changes in technology or in the mix of industries and jobs, the mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and the needs of employers worsens. Then, for a given number of job openings, the number of the unemployed who are qualified for those jobs is smaller and the unemployment rate is higher than it would have been before the mismatch problem worsened. Graphically, an increase in a skills mismatch would be reflected in a shift of the Beveridge curve up and to the right.  From figure 14, we can see some outward shift in the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment, consistent with some increase in structural unemployment since the onset of the recession. However, a more in-depth analysis of the evidence suggests that the apparent shift in the relationship between vacancies and unemployment is neither unusual                                                  7 For some discussion of this effect, see Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2011), OECD Employment Outlook 2011; and Aaronson and others, “What Is behind the Rise in Long-Term Unemployment?” (see note 6). 8 For an earlier analysis along these lines, see Michael W. L. Elsby, Bart Hobijn, and Aysegül Sahin (2010), “The Labor Market in the Great Recession,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Spring), pp. 1–69. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 for a recession nor likely to be persistent. Research has found that during and immediately after the serious recessions of 1973 to 1975 and 1981 to 1982, the Beveridge curve also shifted outward, but in both cases it shifted back inward during the recovery. This temporary outward shift during a deep recession may be the result of a particularly sharp increase in layoffs, which raises unemployment quickly, even as vacancies adjust more slowly. Another possible explanation for a temporary shift in the Beveridge curve is extended and emergency unemployment insurance, which induces unemployed workers who might otherwise consider leaving the labor force to continue searching for work. Or employers may be more selective in hiring when their need for workers is not pressing and take more time to fill vacancies in an effort to find especially qualified hires. In any case, the data appear consistent with the shift in the vacancy-unemployment relationship in recent years having been relatively modest and likely to reverse, at least in part, as the economy recovers further. When historical experience is taken into account, these patterns do not support the view that structural factors are a major cause of the increase in unemployment during the most recent recession.9  Conclusion To sum up: A wide range of indicators suggests that the job market has been improving, which is a welcome development indeed. Still, conditions remain far from normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long-term unemployment and the fact that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre-crisis peaks, even without adjusting for growth in the labor force. Moreover, we cannot yet be sure that the recent pace of improvement in the labor market will be sustained. Notably, an examination of recent deviations from Okun’s law suggests that the recent decline in the unemployment rate may reflect, at least in part, a reversal of the unusually large layoffs that occurred during late 2008 and over 2009. To the extent that this reversal has been completed, further significant improvements in the unemployment rate will likely require a more-rapid expansion of production and demand from consumers and businesses, a process that can be supported by continued accommodative policies.  I also discussed long-term unemployment today, arguing that cyclical rather than structural factors are likely the primary source of its substantial increase during the recession. If this assessment is correct, then accommodative policies to support the economic recovery will help address this problem as well. We must watch long-term unemployment especially carefully, however. Even if the primary cause of high long-term unemployment is insufficient aggregate demand, if progress in reducing unemployment is too slow, the long-term unemployed will see their skills and labor force attachment atrophy further, possibly converting a cyclical problem into a structural one.                                                   9 For a discussion of shifts in the Beveridge curve during previous recessions, see John Lindner and Murat Tasci (2010), “Has the Beveridge Curve Shifted?” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Economic Trends, August; and Robert Valletta and Katherine Kuang (2010), “Is Structural Unemployment on the Rise?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter, 2010-34, November 8.

8 BIS central bankers’ speeches If this hypothesis is wrong and structural factors are in fact explaining much of the increase in long-term unemployment, then the scope for countercyclical policies to address this problem will be more limited. Even if that proves to be the case, however, we should not conclude that nothing can be done. If structural factors are the predominant explanation for the increase in long-term unemployment, it will become even more important to take the steps needed to ensure that workers are able to obtain the skills needed to meet the demands of our rapidly changing economy.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ravi Menon: Financial advisory services – putting the customer first Keynote address by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the Life Insurance Association 50th Anniversary Gala Dinner, Singapore, 26 March 2012. *      *      * LIA President, Mr Tan Hak Leh Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Role of life insurance and financial advisory services Saving for the future, investing for returns, and protecting against risk – these are the fundamentals of managing our finances. Yet so few of us do it well. We are far better at earning an income than investing it and protecting against risk.  To make matters worse, many life insurance and investment products are often not easy to understand. Many people are not financially savvy. And many of those who are, do not have the time to review the range of insurance and investment products available, and understand what is best suited for their needs. This is where financial advisory service comes in. Financial advisers can help people identify their insurance and financial planning needs and recommend suitable products. The roles of insurers and financial advisers are intimately intertwined. It must be so. Insurance protects dependants. Investments grow savings and wealth. How can we buy insurance without regard to our broader investment portfolio? Likewise, how can we invest without considering how well we are protected against death or disease? Life insurance and financial advisory services go hand in hand. This was why MAS introduced the Financial Advisers Act, or FAA, ten years ago. The FAA was a landmark regulatory reform, providing for consistency in the regulation of persons engaged in advisory activities:  across sectors: in insurance companies, banks, stockbrokers, and financial advisory firms; and  across products: life insurance, securities, futures, and unit trusts. Two years before the FA Act, an industry-led committee, the Committee for the Efficient Distribution of Life Insurance, or CEDLI, made far-reaching recommendations on minimum standards for the advisory process, and the competency of insurance agents. The FAA and CEDLI together helped transform the landscape for financial advisory services in Singapore. They have contributed to greater consistency and better quality in the advisory services provided on both life insurance and investment products. Disclosure practices have also improved. Life insurance coverage and financial investments among Singaporeans have grown over the last decade.  Life insurance as a percentage of the total assets of Singaporeans has nearly doubled from about 4% in 2000 to 7% in 2011.  Financial investments as a percentage of the total assets of Singaporeans has increased from about 14% in 2000 to 17% in 2011. But there are important gaps to fill. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches We need to do better We have a large protection gap. The average Singaporean is still grossly underinsured.  A 2009 study by the Nanyang Technological University found that the existing life cover of the average Singaporean is only about a third of what his dependants will need in the event of his early death. The insurance industry should reflect on these findings and take up the challenge to narrow the shortfall in protection coverage. Likewise, there is room to do more within the financial advisory industry.  According to a study by the Nielsen Company, which issued the Global Ageing Report in February 2011, only 14% of Singapore consumers surveyed felt that they were financially ready for retirement. This is lower than the Asia Pacific and global averages of 22% and 18% respectively. Financial planning has to go beyond advising on investment products to evaluating the life cycle needs of an individual, including for retirement. Putting the customer first We must build the customer’s trust and confidence in life insurance and financial advisory services. MAS has been working closely with the industry to help bring this about. The key thrusts of our approach are as follows:  Raise the competence of financial advisory representatives  Raise the quality of financial advisory firms  Make financial advice a dedicated service  Lower distribution costs of insurance products  Promote a culture of fair dealing Let me share with you the actions we have taken to-date in each of these areas. I will also announce the steps MAS intends to take, as part of a comprehensive review of the financial advisory industry that we are launching. We call this new effort, “FAIR”, or the Financial Advisory Industry Review. FAIR will essentially build on the foundations laid by CEDLI and the FA Act ten years ago. It has two main objectives:  first, to enhance the professional standing and competence of financial advisers; and  second, to create a more competitive and efficient system for the distribution of life insurance and investment products. The overriding aim of FAIR is to protect and benefit the consumer. Putting the customer first – that must be at the heart of all our efforts. Raising the competence of FA representatives Let me begin with the competence of financial advisory representatives. MAS has been working with the FA industry to raise the skills, knowledge and expertise of representatives to serve customers better. The two aspects of this effort are:  improving the product knowledge of FA representatives; and  raising the entry requirements for FA representatives 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Product knowledge of FA representatives We have introduced new examination modules to ensure that FA representatives have sufficient knowledge of the wide and complex range of investment and insurance products currently available in the market. Most firms and FA representatives understand and support the need to raise knowledge and skill levels through a set of common examinations. Some representatives have questioned why they need to pass these new exams when all they sell are simple products. MAS takes the view that a good financial adviser should be able to explain the advantages and disadvantages and the risks of competing  products – both simple and complex.  The reality is that consumers today are faced with a wide range of choices. For example, a consumer wishing to invest and buy insurance protection has a few options. He may consider a participating policy or a regular premium investment-linked policy or simply purchase an insurance term policy and invest separately. He could build a portfolio of just plain vanilla stocks and bonds or include ETFs and futures or simply buy unit trusts. Each option has its own set of risk-return and cost considerations. The increasingly educated consumer will expect his representative to help him make sense of the complexity of the products and their suitability, even if he eventually settles on simple life insurance and investment products. Some other FA representatives feel that their academic qualifications are sufficient and should allow them an exemption from the exams. But consumers should have some assurance that the qualifications of the FA representatives meet a common standard. The examinations are industry-certified, and set a common standard and benchmark for FA representatives.  It is important that all representatives, even those who have been in the industry for many years, stay abreast of latest market developments and products. Only then can they provide holistic advice and comprehensive recommendations on what to buy, and – more importantly – what not to buy.  But we understand the concerns that some representatives have raised. MAS is prepared to adjust its requirements subject to the companies putting in place proper controls to ensure that only simple products are sold by the selected FA representatives who do not take the new examinations. Entry requirements for FA representatives Next, as part of FAIR, MAS will review the minimum level of qualifications that we expect of our FA representatives, to ensure they stay relevant to the needs and expectations of consumers. The current entry requirement for FA representatives is four GCE “O” level passes. It is clearly not in keeping with Singapore’s rising educational levels, the increasing complexity of products, and higher expectations from a more literate and sophisticated public.  One out of two Singaporeans has above GCE “O” level qualifications, compared to one out of three, ten years ago.  One out of four Singaporeans has a degree; this is double the proportion ten years ago. Our current requirements do not stack up well against major jurisdictions. They have been raising the quality and professionalism of their financial advisers.   In the UK, the minimum requirement for representatives serving retail customers will be raised by end 2012 to tertiary level qualification, defined as at least a Diploma.  In Australia, the current educational entry level is a Diploma-equivalent. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Let us not short-change the consumers of life insurance and investment products in Singapore. I am heartened to note that some insurers are already consciously recruiting better qualified individuals who can provide value-added advice to their customers. These agents are better able to explain the intricacies of financial planning, and recommend solutions to meet the financial needs of busy professionals or less savvy customers. But we must level the playing field and make this the industry norm. Raising the quality of financial advisory firms Management expertise and financial resources of financial advisory firms The second thrust of our approach is to raise the quality of financial advisory firms. While banks and insurers are generally well resourced, financial advisory firms vary in size. Some firms are so small that shareholders or directors double up as representatives, CEO, CFO, and compliance personnel. Under FAIR, we will review the management expertise and financial resources of financial advisory firms, to ensure they are well managed and financially sound. We will take this review into consideration when admitting new financial advisory firms. Making financial advice a dedicated service Besides raising the quality of FA representatives and financial advisory firms, we must make financial advice a dedicated and professional vocation. Customers looking for financial advice deserve to be served by representatives whose primary focus is to provide quality advice on regulated financial products. Unregulated activities of FA representatives We want an industry where providing financial advisory services is the primary focus of FA representatives. But of late, we have noticed a worrying trend of FA representatives conducting or wanting to conduct other activities alongside providing financial advice. Let me give a few examples.  We have received queries from insurance agents who also want to be real estate agents. They want to be allowed to market and earn commissions from property transactions, often to the same customers they provide financial advice to.  Some FA representatives have even applied to the Casino Regulatory Authority for a junket promoter license!  MAS has received complaints against FA representatives who used their regulatory status to market questionable schemes in gold bullion. Some of these activities are clearly in conflict with FA activities. They risk undermining the interests of consumers. We will review the activities that FA representatives can conduct outside their advisory role, to ensure that representatives continue to put their customers first. Specifically, we will work with the industry on a list of activities that FA representatives should not engage in. To my mind, the activities with clear conflicts include:  money lending;  promoting junkets for casinos;  selling real estate; and  marketing investment products which do not accord safeguards to customers under the Financial Advisers Act. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 We will also review other activities that FA representatives engage in that are not in conflict but which may distract representatives from their professional focus. Several insurers and FA firms recognise the risks of associating with representatives who may be distracted by other commitments and remuneration opportunities outside the realm of financial advisory services. These companies accept only representatives who are fully dedicated and committed to providing quality financial advice to their customers. This is how it should be. But practices vary across financial institutions, and it may not be practical to ban representatives from undertaking other activities that earn an income. MAS will work with the industry to push for a consistent industry-wide approach to representatives who engage in multiple activities. Role of introducers FAIR will also review the current practice of FA firms and their representatives making use of “introducers” to reach out to customers. An introducer may be another representative, but may also be any man-on-the-street. Introducers are typically paid a fee to refer customers to financial advisers, or they get a cut of the commissions generated from sales to the customers. The use of introducers means customers risk dealing with individuals whose credentials have not been vouched for by any financial institution. It also means that customers may not receive proper advice when introducers go beyond introducing and pressure customers to buy products. Financial advisory activities in insurance broking firms Making sure that the financial advisory role is the primary focus of FA representatives is only one side of the coin. The other aspect to ensure, is that firms whose primary activity is not financial advisory services, are fully capable of managing this part of their business. In this regard, FAIR will review the scope of financial advisory activities currently carried out in insurance brokers. Some insurance brokers advise on group term life insurance to complement the suite of general insurance products offered to their corporate customers. However, over the years, we have noticed that for some insurance brokers, FA activities and revenue from the advisory business have eclipsed that of their core insurance broking business. MAS is concerned that insurance brokers may not have sufficient management expertise and compliance capability to oversee and manage the FA portion of their business. Lowering distribution costs Our fourth key thrust is to lower the cost of distribution, so that we can keep the overall cost of life insurance products affordable for Singaporeans. Direct sales of simple products The online channel is one of the ways in which we can lower distribution costs. We have seen the use of direct sales via the internet for the distribution of general insurance products such as travel insurance and motor insurance. Why not life insurance? The industry could explore the use of the internet as an alternative distribution channel to offer life insurance to consumers at competitive prices.  Online distribution will also mean that products will have to be simplified. Simple term life insurance via the internet could be a good way to help lower cost and make affordable insurance protection more readily available to a wider population. And simple term life insurance is sometimes all that a person needs to protect against risk. MAS would like to see the sale of simple term life insurance products through the internet. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Commission-based remuneration and distribution structure But customised financial advice is still required for the more complicated insurance plans, tailored to suit individual and family needs and circumstances, and for those who want to supplement their term life insurance. To lower costs for such products, we must address some of the underlying inefficiencies in our remuneration and distribution structure. FAIR will fundamentally review the commission-based remuneration and distribution structure. In Singapore, insurance products are distributed through insurance agencies, banks, and financial advisory firms. The premiums for these insurance products include charges that cover mortality risk, as well as various expenses incurred by the insurer, such as distribution and management expenses. A substantial proportion of the premium in the earlier years goes to paying for distribution expenses. Over the life of a policy, this cost can account for as much as 8% of the total premiums paid. A key driver of this cost is the multi-tier distribution structure that is common in Singapore’s insurance companies and large FA firms. The commission-based, multi-tier distribution structure involves representatives in the upper tiers having a share of the commissions earned by lower-tier representatives who provide insurance and financial advice to the consumer.  Take for example a whole life insurance policy. An FA representative could earn a basic commission of 50% of the policy’s annual premium in the first year, and another 40% of the annual premium during the following five years.  His supervisor would in turn earn overriding commissions throughout the first six years. There is typically a third tier comprising the agency managers who also get overrides.  Total overrides during the first six years can amount to 70% of the policy’s annual premium.   Together, the total commissions and overrides earned by the representative and his supervisors would be equivalent to about 160% of the policy’s annual premium. FAIR will examine whether this commission structure aligns the interest of representatives with the long term interest of consumers, whether these representatives have the adverse incentive to sell products that pay them higher commissions, and whether the tier structure provides value for the customer or merely adds cost. Most major jurisdictions have long moved away from the tiered structure. The United Kingdom and Australia are moving towards a fee-based model. They have, in fact, banned commission payments from product manufacturers to financial institutions except in the case of pure-protection products. Enhance transparency of distribution and other costs A third way in which we can lower distribution and related costs is to enhance the transparency of these costs. Presently, benefit illustrations show the total distribution costs but hide the direct payout to a representative. Customers should know what they are paying for. With greater transparency, a customer can decide if he is getting his money’s worth for the service and advice provided by his FA representative. Benefit illustrations also do not include a detailed breakdown of the split between the protection and investment components in an investment-linked insurance product. Customers often assume that the insurance policy they bought covers only insurance to their dependants, when in fact the product may contain a substantial savings element. Insurers should strive to provide greater disclosure on how the premium is split between protection and investment on bundled insurance products to enable customers to better understand what they are buying. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Promoting a culture of fair dealing The fifth thrust in our approach to instilling customer trust in life insurance and financial advisory services is through promoting a culture of fair dealing by financial institutions. Dealing fairly with customers goes beyond mere compliance with regulatory requirements. It is an attitude that springs from the ethos and values of the institution. It is about a culture that places the consumer first, that is focused on doing what is right for the consumer, and that places a premium on integrity.  It is the responsibility of the Board and Senior Management to forge this culture of fair dealing throughout the organisation. The Board and Senior Management must set a clear strategy to achieve the fair dealing outcomes, monitor its implementation, and train their staff and representatives to treat customers fairly. Most of all, they must – by word and  deed – make clear to their staff that meeting revenue targets must never be at the expense of treating their customers with fairness and honesty. Enhance transparency of products A key aspect of fair dealing is to make insurance and investment products more transparent. MAS has enhanced safeguards for consumers who buy investment and insurance products that are complex. For example, for consumers investing into unit trusts via their investment-linked life insurance policies, we now require insurers to provide a Product Highlights Sheet or “PHS” on the underlying funds. The PHS should be written in plain language, in a “Question & Answer” format prescribed by the MAS. It describes the profile of customers the fund is suitable for, what the fund invests in, and what the risk areas are that could cause a customer to incur a loss. We also require FA representatives to conduct a Customer Knowledge Assessment to assess whether a customer has the relevant knowledge or experience to understand the risks of products which are more complex or have innovative features which customers might not understand. FAIR – the next steps MAS recognises that FAIR will have a significant impact on the industry and on the public. We will take a consultative approach and engage all stakeholders. A review panel will be formed, with representation from industry associations, the investment community, academia, media and consumer bodies, to review and propose recommendations on the five areas I have outlined. MAS will shortly announce the members of the panel. We will solicit feedback from the public before the panel begins its deliberations and after it has made its recommendations.  I appreciate that some of the proposals will impact businesses and representatives. I urge the industry to take a long term view from the customer’s perspective. The aim of FAIR is to bring about a higher quality of financial advisory services and better outcomes for customers, and by enhancing customer trust, promote sustained growth of the financial advisory industry. MAS will work to ease the transition for those most affected by the changes. Conclusion Since its inception in 1962, LIA’s key objectives have always been to promote high standards and best practices in the life insurance industry, ensuring quality financial advisory services and raising public awareness and understanding of life insurance. We see LIA as a key partner in facilitating the FAIR process and developing the insurance industry. I congratulate LIA on your golden anniversary and wish you many more fruitful years ahead. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Gill Marcus: Perspectives on the global and domestic economic environment Address by Ms Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, to the Volkswagen South Africa Strategic Conversation Dinner, Sandton, 15 March 2012. *      *      * Thank you for the opportunity to lead in the strategic conversation this evening. We have come through a difficult few years, and the road ahead is likely to be just as challenging.  Right now there seems to be a small breathing space that might allow a better assessment of where the world is today. We have seen three elements of the global crisis come together, namely sovereign debt, a banking crisis, and the crisis of weak growth and rising unemployment, particularly among the young. There is also the increasing recognition that what is occurring is not simply a very deep economic crisis, but a fundamental shift in the balance of forces in the world. This is likely to take time to unfold, but significant changes are taking place, with the growing voice and economic power of emerging markets being heard more loudly. The global financial crisis is still with us, although it does appear that some of the worst case global scenarios may have been avoided or perhaps merely delayed. But even the optimistic scenarios for Europe are not good news as fiscal adjustments, bank deleveraging and the weight of the cumulative impact of the crisis thus far take hold. For this reason the outlook for the South African economy is not as bright as it could be, unless a concerted effort is made to do something different. Currently the domestic economy is characterised by rising inflation and slowing growth, which is a difficult combination for policy-makers to deal with.  This evening I will give a perspective on aspects of the global and domestic economic backdrop. I will spend some time on the European situation, as the context within which we operate, formulate policy, adopt strategies is critical to enable all of us to ensure that South Africa is able to take advantage of what opportunities exist, and take appropriate measures to try to protect us from the ravages of the global crisis. From a South African perspective, what happens in Europe is important, given the trade links that we have with the region. Although the percentage of South African manufacturing exports to Europe have declined over the past few years, at around 30 per cent it is still an extremely important trading partner. In recent months there have been progressive downward revisions by analysts of the global growth outlook. The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook, also downgraded its forecast for world growth to average 3,3 per cent in 2012, and 3,9 per cent in 2013. There are still significant risks to the global environment, but the intensity and immediacy of these risks may have been reduced somewhat with the recent agreement on the Greek bail-out which has helped to prevent a disorderly default. This agreement is expected to allow for Greece to roll-over its debt that is maturing this month. It would be premature to think that the European crisis has been resolved as there are a number of interrelated and mutually reinforcing dimensions which mean that uncertainty remains. Although the risks from the sovereign debt crisis appear to have been reduced for the meantime, questions about the sustainability of the solution persist, particularly in the light of the fact that the European authorities have emphasised that the Greek bail-out model is not a precedent. The Portuguese economy is also under stress, and we could still see a repetition of the Greek crisis being played out there in the coming months. In the absence of a clear commitment to deal with a possible Portuguese crisis, the risk of contagion to other more systemically important economies, such as Italy and Spain, will increase. Although some of the peripheral European countries are relatively small, they have a combined 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches sovereign debt of around US$1 trillion, with a significant proportion being held by European banks. The actions to resolve the Greek debt problem have involved significant losses to private sector bond-holders, many of which are European banks. In terms of the agreement, bond holders will accept losses in excess of 70 per cent of the value of the debt. Partly as a consequence of these developments, European banks are now undercapitalised, with estimates ranging between US$300 billion and US$400 billion. This has resulted in significant deleveraging by European banks, with indications of them selling assets in order to achieve their required ratios. This credit crunch in Europe is being exacerbated by the need to meet new capital requirements of raising the Tier 1 capital asset ratio to 9 per cent by June 2012. There are concerns that European bank lending could decline by around US$3 trillion over the next 18 months. The interbank market is also dysfunctional in Europe, reflecting the lack of trust between banks. The ECB has attempted to alleviate the situation with the establishment of the Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) facility, which has to date granted an estimated US$1,35 trillion in loans to banks at low interest rates. There is some evidence that a significant proportion of this money has gone in to purchasing sovereign debt, but it is still too early to say how much will go to lending to households and businesses. The credit crunch is likely to reinforce the negative growth outlook for the region, and will in turn have its own negative feedback loop. The Euro area is expected to contract by around 0,5 per cent this year, and the European Commission expects negative growth in 8 of the 17 Eurozone countries this year. These countries include Belgium, Greece, Spain, Italy, Holland, Austria and Portugal. Widespread fiscal consolidation, even in countries with relatively strong fiscal positions such as Germany, has contributed to the negative growth outlook. A number of countries, such as Spain, Portugal and Ireland are attempting to reduce their deficit to GDP ratios by around 3 per cent per year for the next two years, and Italy by about 2 per cent per year. The negative growth outlook raises doubts about the ability of the Greek economy to adjust to the fiscal austerity that is being imposed on it. The economy has contracted by about 15 per cent in the past two years, and is expected to contract by a further 4,4 per cent this year, while unemployment has increased from 7,7 per cent in 2008 to almost 20 per cent.  At the root of these problems is a balance of payments crisis within the euro area between northern and southern Europe. The loss of competitiveness experienced by the southern European countries and their consequent balance of payments deficits has in effect been financed by borrowing from the Northern Europeans. This is not sustainable indefinitely. Under normal circumstances the adjustment would be facilitated through exchange rate depreciation, but with this option ruled out, a more difficult path of “internal devaluation”, involving absolute reductions in wages and expenditure, has to be followed. The more reluctant the surplus countries are to increase their consumption of Southern European goods, the more difficult the adjustment becomes and the more politically unpopular these measures become in the deficit countries. Apart from the European situation, prospects for other parts of the global economy appear to be more promising, but risks remain. The US economic growth has surprised on the upside in recent months, but fears remain that this nascent recovery could be short-lived. In particular, there are risks that political conflicts over fiscal policy ahead of the November elections could result in premature fiscal cutbacks, which, according to some estimates could have the potential to reduce US growth by up to two percentage points.  There are also indications that the Chinese economy may be slowing, but the Chinese authorities have the ability and resolve to intervene strongly to prevent a so-called hard landing. One region with a more favourable outlook is sub-Saharan Africa, which is expected to grow by around 5,5 per cent this year. South Africa’s financial and trade links with Africa have been increasing in recent years, and the continent is fast becoming the major 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 destination for our manufactured exports. During the financial crisis, Africa was relatively protected from the fall-out, given the predominance of intra-regional trade, and South Africa would do well to encourage further two-way trade and investment with the region. One of the consequences of the global crisis has been the severe social dislocation that has accompanied it, and it is questionable how long such pain can be endured. The recent protests on the streets of Athens and general popular opposition raises questions as to whether or not the latest initiatives are politically sustainable. History is replete with examples of how circumstances similar to those described lead to political polarisation and the rise of nationalism and/or populism. This is happening in the context of a divided Europe, with no consensus on the appropriate solutions to the problems, and irresolute leadership reflected in weak and tenuous coalition governments.  The social problems are reflected in the spiraling of unemployment in some of the advanced economies. This is particularly the case when it comes to youth unemployment. In this respect South Africa is no longer unique, with its estimated unemployment rate of 23,9 per cent, and youth unemployment at around 50 per cent. The negative trends in Europe in particular are quite dramatic. In the beginning of 2008 the unemployment rate in the European Union was 6,9 per cent and the unemployment rate amongst the youth (i.e. persons below 25 years of age) was 15,9 per cent. In January 2012 the unemployment rate in the EU was 10,7 per cent, while youth unemployment measured 22,4 per cent. The number of unemployed youth totaled 5,5 million.  There are some stark divergences within the region, with overall unemployment ranging from 4,0 per cent in Austria, to 23,3 per cent in Spain, and youth unemployment ranging from 7,8 per cent in Germany to 48,1 per cent in Greece and 49,9 per cent in Spain. As a rule of thumb, the youth unemployment rate is between 2 and 3 times are high as the total unemployment rate. Of the 27 EU countries, 20 of them have youth unemployment rates of 20 per cent or more, and 7 of these are in excess of 30 per cent. This phenomenon is of particular concern, as the longer people remain out of work, the less likely they are to ever work, or work again. The unemployment get deskilled, demotivated and disaffected, leading to the attendant social hardships and drain on society. It is also not just Europe where unemployment has become a problem. US unemployment measured 5 per cent before the crisis, and peaked at around 10 per cent before declining to current levels of around 8,5 per cent. Youth unemployment is currently 16,0 per cent. In the UK, youth unemployment – at 22,2 per cent – is close to the 1 million mark. The problem of youth unemployment in the advanced economies is exacerbated by an ageing population which is putting strain on fiscal positions. The current low interest rate environment in these economies will make it even more difficult for private pension funds to generate adequate returns for this ageing population, with potential financial demands on governments. This factor has resulted in an extension of the working age in a number of countries, which makes it even more difficult to solve the youth unemployment problem, with the associated fiscal demands at a time when such programmes are being scaled back. The potential adverse social consequences of these developments are profound. The underlying lesson for South Africa from all of this is the importance of generating sustained and employment-generating growth that is needed to attend to the growing inequalities. It is also clearly preferable, particularly in the short run, to improve a debt to GDP ratio by increasing GDP growth, as opposed to cutting down on the absolute level of debt. Fiscal consolidation that is done too quickly could cause growth to decline, and this will cause the debt metrics to deteriorate and result in a negative debt spiral. When fiscal sustainability is called into question, the challenge is to find a balance between such fiscal consolidation and the need for growth.  As I have indicated, South Africa’s growth outlook in the short to medium term will be impacted to a significant degree by global developments. Domestic economic growth in 2011 measured 3,1 per cent following growth of 3,2 per cent in the final quarter of the year. The 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches growth forecasts for 2012 range between 2,5 per cent and 3,0 per cent, with the latest forecast of the Bank being 2,8 per cent. This followed successive downward revisions during 2011 as the European crisis intensified.  Since the 2009 recession, growth has been driven primarily by household consumption expenditure, which is clearly an undesirable and unsustainable growth path. Emphasis must be given to ensure that growth is driven by investment. There are, however, signs that investment expenditure growth is gathering pace, and this will be reinforced if the proposals around increased infrastructure expenditure are followed through on. According to the latest budget, public sector projects totaling R845 billion have been approved for the MTEF period. This emphasis on infrastructure investment is appropriate as it is likely to contribute to improved economic efficiencies and helps with the alleviation of existing bottlenecks in the economy. But the focus on infrastructure is not new, and the plans have often not met expectations, particularly since the 2010 World Cup. For example in 2009/10, only 83 per cent of the amounts budgeted for infrastructure was spent. In 2010/11, this had declined further to 68 per cent. Importantly, it is not only the government and state-owned enterprises that need to invest. Michael Spence, the respected growth theorist, in his book “The Next Convergence”, has shown that countries which have sustained growth rates of around 7 per cent or more for 25 years generally have government and public sector investment ratios of between 5 and 7 per cent of GDP, and total investment rates of at least 25 per cent of GDP. Why emphasise a target of 7 per cent growth per annum? Because a consistent growth rate of 7 per cent will allow for a doubling of income every 10 years, whereas a growth rate of 3 per cent will take 24 years to double incomes. South Africa’s gross fixed capital formation as a percentage GDP averaged around 15,5 per cent in the decade from 1994 and then accelerated to peak at around 23 per cent in 2008. This positive trend coincided with economic growth rates in excess of 5 per cent and a decline in the unemployment rate to 21,9 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2008 . Since the crisis, this investment to GDP ratio has declined and in 2011 averaged around 19 per cent. Between 1994 and 2007, government and public sector investment averaged 4,4 per cent of GDP, but since 2008 it has averaged 8 per cent. We can conclude from this that the lack of investment is not simply a problem of government failure to invest. Private sector investment has also been lacking. But government does have an important role to play in providing the environment conducive to private sector investment. For example, a notable area where private sector investment has been severely lacking is in the mining sector. This may be due in part to uncertainties created by the regulatory environment, and lack of investment in rail infrastructure which has impeded the ability of the mines to get the ores to the ports. This also illustrates how government investment does not necessarily crowd out private sector investment. To the contrary it can also crowd in investment, as in this example. Michael Spence sums it up appropriately as follows: “Put bluntly, growth requires investment, and that means present sacrifice for future gain. The job of leaders is in part to get everyone on board, to build a consensus behind a forward-looking vision, underpinned by a growth and development strategy that is credible. Multiple classes of participants and organized stakeholders need to be willing participants. These include labour, unions, businesses and entrepreneurs, civil society organizations, and households at various levels in the income distribution.”  It is not only investment in fixed capital that is essential. Human capital is as important, if not more so. It is generally recognised that South Africa’s schooling situation is seriously lacking in various respects, but of equal concern is the lack of training for technical skills. It is an indictment, for example, that South Africa needs to import skilled artisans such as welders. Germany has a very well established system of apprenticeships, but South Africa has gone backwards in this respect. Not only does an undertrained and undereducated workforce constrain economic growth, it reinforces the cycle of unemployment and widening 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 inequalities. As Michael Spence has noted, in a world in which knowledge and connectivity are increasingly the basis for value creation, failures in the educational system are the surest form of exclusion there is. It would be inappropriate for me to conclude without saying something about monetary policy and inflation, and the contribution monetary policy can make to the growth and employment trajectory. We know that unemployment has serious socioeconomic consequences, but so does high inflation. It is difficult to find examples in history where sustained economic growth and high inflation went hand in hand. But it is easy to find glaring examples of high inflation contributing to socioeconomic dislocation. The inter-war years in Germany, Latin America in the 1980s, and closer to home in Zimbabwe in the previous decade are good examples. Zimbabwe got no advantages out of the hyperinflation, but it created severe hardships, and the Zimbabwe dollar has now disappeared. The burden of inflation gets borne by those who lose their jobs through this, and by those who are unable to hedge themselves against the ravages of accelerating price increases. These are generally the poor and often even the middle classes, whose savings and pension funds would have been rendered worthless.  It is not only hyperinflation that is the problem. Even moderate inflation is bad for the poor and for workers. An annual inflation rate of 10 per cent for example, which is regarded by some as acceptable, means that a worker receiving R1000 per month will need to be earning R2590 in 10 years time simply to be no worse off. With a 20 per cent inflation, this amount would need to be R6,190 per month, and with a 25 per cent inflation, the required break-even income would be R10,000. The higher the inflation rate, the more purchasing power would be lost between bargaining rounds. In the latter case, workers will have lost a quarter of their purchasing power by the time of the next wage adjustment. If left unchecked, high inflation tends to breed higher inflation. Apart from its redistributive effects, high and variable inflation also tends to undermine long-term investment, so it is important that inflation is kept under control, and monetary policy is best placed to do this. But in trying to stem high inflation, monetary policy may have negative short run effects on economic growth. Conversely, monetary stimulus will only impact on cyclical growth. Therefore there has to be sensitivity on the part of policy makers to the state of the business cycle. This is what the essence of flexible inflation targeting is: that if inflation is outside the target, there is some flexibility with respect to the time horizon within which inflation is brought back to within the target, in order to smooth the cyclical adjustment. Monetary policy can help growth by providing a stable and low inflation environment conducive to investment, and by providing short-term stimulus, but it does not determine the underlying growth potential of the country. This is the domain of other policies and where the focus on infrastructure and other structural reforms is critical. Monetary policy is currently facing the challenge of a rising trend in inflation and a slowing domestic economy. According to the macroeconomic forecast of the Bank, inflation is expected to peak at around 6,6 per cent in the second quarter of this year and then to decline moderately before returning to within the target range by the end of the year. But there are a lot of uncertainties related to this outcome. Upside risks are seen to be coming from international oil prices, particularly in the context of elevated tensions in the Middle-East relating to the Iranian nuclear programme and associated sanctions. Administered prices also remain a concern, with the tendency for prices in many instances to be set without regard to the inflation target. However recent developments, including the below-inflation tariff increase granted to the ports, the reduction in the proposed e-toll tariffs and the reduction in the electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom are encouraging.  The rand exchange rate could pose and upside or downside risk, depending on global developments. The rand tends to depreciate when there are heightened risk perceptions in Europe, as investors tend to seek so-called safe havens. But these flows tend to reverse as risk perceptions improve. Currently the markets appear to be taking a more positive view of 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches global developments and this has been reflected in the recent appreciation of the currency. However, as I indicated earlier, this can change very quickly. Until recently, core inflation – that is inflation excluding petrol, electricity and food – was relatively subdued, reflecting the absence of significant demand pressures in the economy. In general, monetary policy can do little to combat the impact or first round effects of inflation that is driven by exogenous shocks. However the most recent data seem to suggest that inflation is becoming more generalised, and may reflect the emergence of demand pressures. This is something that the Bank will monitor very carefully.  At this stage, monetary policy remains relatively accommodative, given the challenging growth environment, with real policy interest rates slightly below zero. As I have outlined earlier, raising the growth potential requires a concerted and sustained investment boost in the economy. An accommodative monetary policy environment is only part of this story, and as responsible monetary policy makers, we recognise that keeping inflation under control must be done with due regard to the possible impact on employment and growth. At the same time, maintaining price stability remains central to our mandate, and price stability should be part of the societal consensus that is essential for the successful implementation of a forward-looking sustainable growth strategy.  Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jean-Pierre Danthine: A world of low interest rates Speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Money Market Event, Zurich, 22 March 2012. *      *      * I would like to extend my thanks to Anna Faber, Adriel Jost and Pierre Monnin for their support in writing this speech. I also thank Carmen Kissling for providing research assistance and Marco Huwiler, Rita Kobel, Sébastien Kraenzlin, Peter Kuster, Thomas Maag and Barbara Sutter for their insightful comments, which improved the quality of the final version. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) eleventh Geldmarkt-Apéro. For the third consecutive year I have the privilege of discussing Swiss monetary policy with you, together with significant aspects of the context in which it is conducted. Today, my deputy and fellow board member, Dewet Moser will provide an overview of the SNB’s implementation of monetary policy in the last year. In particular, Dewet will highlight the measures we have taken to address the strong Swiss franc. Meanwhile, I will concentrate on the very low interest rate environment, which has played an important part in guiding economic participants’ choices for some time now. Beforehand, however, allow me to make a few comments on our recent monetary policy decision.  As emphasised on 15 March, the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro remains front and centre of the SNB’s monetary policy agenda. The SNB will continue to enforce the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro with the utmost determination. It is prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities for this purpose. The target range for the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 0.00–0.25% and the SNB will continue to maintain liquidity on the money market at an exceptionally high level.  The SNB has taken these decisions in a context of mixed developments in the global economy. While growth in the United States was surprisingly positive in the fourth quarter, GDP fell in the euro area and in Japan. In Switzerland, growth has slowed significantly in the past year. Added value declined in the fourth quarter in those sectors most affected by exchange rate movements. While the high value of the Swiss franc continues to present enormous challenges to the economy, the minimum exchange rate is having an impact. It has reduced exchange rate volatility and given business leaders a better basis for planning. There are growing indications that the Swiss economy is stabilising. For 2012, the SNB is now forecasting moderate growth, at close to 1%.  The situation on the financial markets has also eased a little of late. It remains very uncertain, however, whether the advances made in solving the European sovereign debt crisis will succeed in defusing the situation permanently. Moreover, there is a risk that geopolitical tensions will lead to a further rise in the price of oil.  The SNB’s latest analysis has led us to adjust our conditional inflation forecast downwards once again. As my first slide highlights, the most recent forecasts for 2012 show an inflation rate of –0.6%, as compared to a rate of 0.3% in 2013 and 0.6% in 2014. Price stability is therefore assured. That said, if developments in the international economy prove to be worse than foreseen, or if the Swiss franc does not weaken further, as it is expected to, downside risks for price stability could re-emerge. Whatever the case may be, the SNB stands ready to take further measures at any time, if the economic outlook and the risk of deflation so require. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Explanations for low interest rates Today’s low interest rates are a defining feature of the current economic environment far beyond the Swiss borders and this has been the case for some time. I will hence paint a picture of the global situation with broad brushstrokes, before outlining the specifics of the Swiss case. The current low interest rate levels can be viewed as the endpoint of a downward trend that has marked the last twenty years and which has been accentuated by the necessary policy responses to the current economic crisis. As my second slide shows, one can observe a significant and continued decrease in long-term nominal rates of various maturities since the early 1980’s. Several factors are responsible for this evolution. Let me first discuss the roots of some of the longer-term trends, before focusing on post-2007 developments. Long-term trends Central banks’ credible commitment to price stability could well explain the downward trend in nominal interest rates experienced by most mature economies in this period. As we see in slide 3, inflation in G7 countries declined from particularly high levels in the mid-1970’s, and again in the early 1980’s, to relatively low and stable levels since the mid-1990’s. Given the decreasing levels of inflation and inflationary expectations, the inflation premium included in nominal interest rates should have been reduced accordingly. Nevertheless, slide 4 shows that this explanation does not suffice. Real interest rates1 also show a declining trend, as represented here in the average real return on the 10 year bonds of G7 countries. What is behind this evolution? Some attribute the low interest rate environment to a so-called savings glut. The crux of this argument is that there has been an excessive accumulation of global savings relative to the demand for fixed capital formation since the mid-1990’s. To quote Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke “…the very substantial shift in the current accounts of developing and emerging-market nations … transformed these countries from net borrowers on international capital markets to large net lenders.”2 Indeed, it is interesting to observe that, in the late 1990’s, in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, several Asian central banks started accumulating significant foreign exchange reserves in efforts to stabilize their capital flows and their exchange rates, or to be in position to do so, should that prove necessary in the future. Meanwhile, some conjectured that mature economies with ageing populations would experience a peak in their savings rates.  The “savings glut” hypothesis is contested, however. A first point of contention is that the impact of demographic change on savings and investments may be limited, compared to that of other factors.3 Indeed, the savings rates of industrialised countries did not appear to increase in this period (slide 5). In some cases, they even decreased. A second discrepancy, asserted by John B. Taylor and others, resides in the observation that the US savings gap, and the surge in savings in the rest of the world effectively cancelled one another out.4 Finally, despite the significant increase in savings rates in China and other emerging countries, there was no clear upward trend in global national savings.  The stable output growth and historically low levels of inflation between the mid-1980’s and the onset of the financial crisis, a period often referred to as the “Great Moderation”, provides an alternative or complementary explanation for the downward trend in real rates. Here, the                                                  1 Real interest rates were calculated using the observed market nominal rate minus CPI inflation. 2 Bernanke (2005). 3 Cf. IMF (2005). 4 Taylor (2009). Cf. also Borio and Disyatat (2011). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 basic argument is that, as macroeconomic volatility decreased, investors became increasingly willing to accept lower term and inflation risk premia on their investments, which could translate into a decrease in observed interest rates. Whatever the precise explanation may be, the downward progression of long-term nominal and real interest rates over the last twenty years has been conspicuous. Let us now focus on more recent developments. Recent developments The financial crisis and the global economic decline we have observed subsequently have both added cyclical pressure to this long-run trend. Low or negative output growth and dampened expectations of future growth naturally have a negative impact on long-term rates. In addition, the central banks of most mature economies have, of course, responded to the deteriorating economic situation, first by pushing short-term rates towards appropriately low levels and subsequently by exerting pressure on longer-term rates. As slide 6 illustrates, the first “conventional” monetary policy response was to bring short-term target interest rates to levels as close to zero as possible. However, confronted with the zero lower bound – that is, the impossibility of using conventional monetary policy to do more – many central banks have supplemented their traditional policies with “unconventional” measures, often in order to impact long-term rates. Central banks do so by altering the composition of their balance sheets (credit easing), or by expanding the balance sheet, i.e. by increasing liquidity via one form or another of asset purchasing (quantitative easing, QE) (slide 7).  There is evidence to suggest that these measures are having an impact on private sector borrowing costs. Often as intended, its effect has varied from one asset to the next. In the case of the Bank of England, the vast majority of assets purchased were gilts, and, analysis so far indicates that, gilt yields were some 100 basis points lower than they would have been without QE purchases (slide 8).5 Several US-centred studies6 also estimate that QE measures had a similar effect there. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates, for example, that the measures reduced the ten-year term premium on US Treasuries by “somewhere between 30 and 100 basis points.” The findings also indicate that the effect of the asset purchasing on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities was even more significant.7 In addition, a recent internal SNB study revealed that the doubling of SNB liquidity in August-September 2011 had a significant impact on the yield on 10-year confederation bonds.8  With this in mind, I would now like to discuss the specifics of the Swiss case in more detail.  The Swiss case  Historically, Switzerland’s long-term interest rates have usually been lower than those of most other mature economies. Recently the 10-year Swiss government bond yields even fell below those of their Japanese equivalent and reached an all-time low (slide 9). Current low interest rates in Switzerland can largely be explained by negative developments in the global economy, which have progressively increased the demand for “risk-free” investments, while decreasing their supply. On the demand side, increased financial sector risk and an uncertain economic outlook have led many market participants to seek the                                                  5 Joyce, Lasaosa, Stevens and Tong (2010). 6 For example, Krogstrup, Reynard and Sutter (2012, forthcoming). 7 Gagnon, Raskin, Remache and Sack (2010). 8 Krogstrup (2012). 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches protection of safe havens. On the supply side, the European sovereign debt crisis has also had a simultaneous, and not unrelated, impact. Investors have increasingly questioned the relative security of assets that were previously considered safe. This is reflected in the main credit rating agencies’ recent downgradings of several sovereign bonds that were formerly triple A-rated. This increased demand for, and decreased supply of, risk-free assets has directly affected Switzerland. The reasons for this are well known. The country has managed to maintain a longstanding reputation for stability. In relative terms, the Swiss economy has also withstood the 2007 financial crisis rather well (slide 10), its economic figures are healthy and, at less than 40% (slide 11), its GDP-to-debt ratio is relatively low (slide 12). All of this has prompted a surge in the demand for Swiss franc-denominated assets and put downward pressure on Swiss interest rates. At the policy level, the SNB used a range of instruments to increase the supply of liquidity on the Swiss money market and exert vigorous downward pressure on interest rates, particularly after the Swiss franc reached an all-time high in early August. In line with the goals stated in the SNB’s announcement of 3 August, the three-month Libor fell from 17.5 basis points on 2 August to a low of 0.3 basis points on 5 September. Other money market rates then fell to historical lows. At that time, futures contracts on the three-month Libor even implied negative future rates. These negative levels were the inevitable result of the exceptional liquidity measures I mentioned earlier. Though the current liquidity levels in the Swiss franc money market are still extremely high, and interest rates are fluctuating around zero, conditions on the money markets have slowly started to normalize and extremely negative rates have disappeared. This is reflected in the recent increase of the three-month Libor, which can be ascribed to a normalisation of the rate’s risk premium and should therefore not be seen as a change in monetary policy. Though few loans are currently being concluded on the interbank market, the Libor remains an important benchmark for many credit transactions in the economy. Concluding remarks The period of low interest rates in which we live is the outcome of cyclical and secular circumstances which are unlikely to last forever. Even if we accept the “savings glut” hypothesis, the demographical and regional factors to which it refers could soon lose relevance. While the call for deleveraging should prompt increased savings in advanced economies, the demographic forces in the west are likely to have an opposite effect on the supply of savings. Similarly, the maturing of emerging markets in the east should lead to smaller current account surpluses and to a gradual reduction in the build-up of precautionary reserves by public authorities. It is also clear that the increased risk appetite associated with the “Great Moderation” was, at least to some extent, based on over-optimistic assumptions. These conditions are unlikely to recur in the future, therefore implying that we will probably not observe again the very low risk and term premia that characterized the end of the 1990’s and the beginning of the 21st century. At the cyclical level, the present low interest rates are the appropriate “full throttle” response to a very severe global economic crisis, which occurred on the back of the most acute financial crisis since the “Great Depression” of the 1920’s and 1930’s. However, even if there are implicit or explicit calls for interest rates to remain “low for long” everywhere – including Switzerland – the corresponding monetary policy remains a cyclical response to a cyclical phenomenon, which, from a historical perspective, should be relatively short-lived.  Thus, as most mature economies gradually return to their normal growth path – and I do not dispute the diagnosis that this demands more time after a severe financial and banking crisis than it would in more normal business cycle circumstances – one can reasonably expect real rates to return to higher levels than those observed recently. This is good news for savers 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 and pension funds alike. It should also be taken into account by borrowers, especially long-term borrowers, such as those active in the mortgage market. From their perspective, it is inappropriate to consider the current low rates as representative of a so-called new normal. The intended economic stimulus provided by low interest rates will only last for a few years, not decades. It is crucial for long-term financial stability that those who make long-run debt commitments are fully aware of this reality and that they plan accordingly.  What about inflation risk? Personally, I do not share the view that the current period of central bank activism will be followed by a resurgence of inflation. First, contrary to common assertions, persistent - as opposed to unanticipated - inflation is limited in its capacity to reduce sovereign debt burdens. Second, the low levels of inflation we are currently experiencing are the result of improved monetary policy, combined with a general acknowledgement that inflation does not buy durable economic performance. Neither of these factors are affected by recent events. We can therefore anticipate that, with current or enhanced levels of understanding of monetary mechanisms, and central bankers’ continued preference for price stability, future inflation levels will resemble those of the last 20 years.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mario Draghi: Interview with Bild Zeitung Interview with Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, in BILD Zeitung, conducted by Messrs Kai Diekmann, Editor in Chief, Nikolaus Blome, Deputy Editor in Chief, on 19 March 2012 and published on 23 March 2012. *      *      * Part I BILD: President Draghi, when it was clear that you were to become head of the European Central Bank, BILD made a photomontage of you wearing a Prussian spiked helmet and called you a “true German”. What did you think of that? Mario Draghi: I really liked it. The Prussian element is a good symbol of the ECB’s key task: to maintain price stability and to protect European savers. BILD: For Germans, a central bank chief must take a strict line on inflation, be politically independent and favour a strong euro. In that light, how German are you? Draghi: These are indeed German virtues. But every central banker in the euro area should have them. BILD: The French President said that Europe should learn from the German model… Draghi: …he’s right. Long before him I said that Germany is a model. The old European welfare state model is in fact dead, because it had to make debts far too often. The Germans have re-invented it – with no excessive debts. BILD: Do you have a message for the people of Germany? Draghi: Keep it up! BILD: The ever-present fear of devaluation, of inflation, is typically German. Can you understand that? Draghi: In the twentieth century the people of this country suffered terribly because of inflation. It destroys wealth and makes planning impossible. What’s more, it can really destroy the fabric of a society. BILD: Why then, as ECB President, are you allowing euro area inflation to currently stand at 2.7%, significantly more than the ECB’s objective? Draghi: Hold on. If you exclude the price of oil and recent tax increases by many governments, the inflation rate has been stable for months at 1.5%. Should the inflation outlook get worse, we will immediately take preventive steps. And look at the facts, they speak for themselves. Since the founding of the ECB the yearly average inflation rate has been better than in any comparable period prior to the euro.  BILD: In two moves, the ECB has put almost €1 trillion into circulation. That’s inflationary, surely?  Draghi: The banks to which the ECB has lent the money have, by and large, not fed this into the economic cycle but have used it to meet old liabilities. So the money in terms of inflation has, so to speak, been neutralised. This action is not inflationary. And we will watch very carefully if and how the money is fed into the economic cycle.  BILD: But the head of Germany’s Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, has issued a sharp warning about this flood of money. Draghi: I get on very well with Jens Weidmann both professionally and personally. Our difference of opinion has been blown up.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches BILD: Was he exaggerating?  Draghi: He is a typical central banker, like all of us. We like to worry about things that nobody else worries about. And of course there are risks and side effects if you use such a strong drug, such as the almost €1 trillion of central bank money. It was right of Jens Weidmann to point that out and I agree with him. BILD: Is there a rift between north and south in the Governing Council? Draghi: No, there is no divide between north and south. All members of the Governing Council have taken to heart Germany’s stability culture. The time of conflicts is over. But let me also say that the situation in the autumn was really critical. It could have led to a dangerous credit crunch at the banks and thus to bankruptcies; companies would have suddenly been left sitting high and dry financially. We had to prevent that. BILD: And the banks are doing nicely out of it, right? Draghi: The ECB’s money has got to the right places. In Germany alone, 460 banks participated in the action, many more than usual. So it wasn’t just the acutely suffering banks, but also many others, many of them small. That particularly helps the small and medium-sized companies that account for 70% of all jobs in Europe. BILD: This all sounds very optimistic. Is the euro then a safe currency? Draghi: Yes, it is. BILD: Is the crisis over? Draghi: The worst is over, but there are also still risks. The situation is stabilising. The key data for the euro area, such as inflation, the balances of payments and in particular budget deficits, are better than in the United States, for example. Investors are regaining their trust and the ECB has not had to provide support by buying government bonds for several weeks now. It is now up to the governments. They must make the euro area crisis-proof in a sustainable manner BILD: If it were your birthday today, what would you want from the German government and the Chancellor? Draghi: Trust the ECB. Trust Europe.  Part II BILD: There is no end to the crisis in Greece. Yet again, more than €100 billion of credit is to be given to them. But isn’t the country a bottomless pit? Draghi: The Greeks have passed very many important reforms in parliament. If they also implement these, the country has a chance to get itself out of the current downward spiral. BILD: But the parties that reject the reforms will be the ones that win in the upcoming elections. Draghi: To overcome the crisis, Greece needs a stable political situation.  BILD: Why should taxpayers in Germany and other euro area countries be liable if it goes wrong? Draghi: The fact is that European taxpayers have taken on a lot for Greece. Their money must be protected. This is also why the ECB did not take part in the debt relief – because the cost would have been borne by taxpayers. BILD: How much time does Greece have left? 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Draghi: Some reforms can take effect very quickly. For example, a tax reform and better tax collection would spread the tax burden more fairly. That is a strong incentive to work more – and this will get the economy quickly back on its feet. BILD: Many experts now think that the only way for Greece to become competitive again is if it leaves the euro area. Draghi: As a matter of principle, the ECB does not give any thought to a country leaving the euro area. BILD: Nevertheless… Draghi: Leaving the euro area and having the possibility to devalue their own currency would not improve anything. It would not remove the need for reform. In fact, the consequences of leaving the euro area would be high inflation and instability – and, for the foreseeable future, nobody would lend Greece the money it needed. BILD: Will the Greeks in any case have to give up their prosperity? Draghi: Yes, they are renouncing exactly that as a result of wage cuts across all sectors. But this is still easier to do inside the euro area rather than outside it. BILD: Is there a limit to the support? Or will it just continue like this? Draghi: I can’t answer that. We will have to see how things develop in the country. Generally speaking, the fact remains that if we want to protect taxpayers’ money, the euro area cannot be turned into a transfer union, where one or two countries provide the money, the rest spend, and the whole thing is financed by joint Eurobonds. That cannot happen. BILD: Many parties, also in Germany, are calling for that. Draghi: A community must be founded on trust – trust that shared rules will be adhered to, for example, with regard to budgetary discipline. That is why the new fiscal pact among euro area states is the right thing and why Eurobonds would be premature. BILD: Is the German Chancellor’s stance winning through? Draghi: Let me put it this way: without pressure from the markets and from the Germans, much of the progress we have made in the various euro area countries would not have been possible. BILD: How often do you speak on the telephone with the Chancellor? Draghi: Not very often. The ECB is very mindful of its independence. And the Chancellor fully respects this. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Guy Debelle: Bank funding Address by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian DCM Summit 2012, Sydney, 22 March 2012. *      *      * I thank Chris Stewart and Cameron Deans for their help.  As you may be aware, last week the Reserve Bank published a Bulletin article that documented recent developments in the structure and costs of the funding of the Australian banking system.1 The Bank has published an article on this topic annually for a few years now, and also reports regularly on developments in the various components of bank funding in its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy.  Today, I am going to talk to that article and highlight some of its main findings.  The discussion around bank funding costs can get confused at times. It is often unclear whether a participant in the debate is referring to movements in levels or in spreads, and if the latter, what exactly the spread is relative to. The article and my speech today provide some facts that can serve as a common foundation for discussion.  The main points I want to highlight are:   The level of the cash rate set by the Reserve Bank is a primary determinant of the level of intermediaries’ funding costs (and hence the level of lending rates). However, there are other significant influences on intermediaries’ funding costs, such as risk premia and competitive pressures, which are not directly affected by the cash rate.   Over the past year, funding costs have fallen in absolute terms but have risen relative to the cash rate.   Deposit pricing, particularly for term deposits, has been the major driver of recent changes in funding costs, reflecting the strong competition for deposits. This has obviously been welcomed by the savers in the population.   There has been a rise in the spreads on wholesale debt issued by banks reflecting investors’ concerns about the global banking industry. While spreads have narrowed recently, they are still higher than they have been over the past couple of years.  Let me start with the first point. The cash rate set by the Reserve Bank Board is the short-term interest rate benchmark that anchors the broader interest rate structure for the domestic financial system. It is the front end of the risk-free yield curve off which other financial assets are generally priced. When the cash rate is adjusted up or down, the whole structure of interest rates in the economy moves up and down, with the effect most direct at shorter maturities.  But the cash rate is clearly not the only determinant of the rate structure in the economy. To use three examples:   As one moves out along the term structure of the risk-free curve, term premia play an increasing role.   Risk premia are an important component of borrowing costs for private sector entities, including the banks.                                                   1 Deans C and Stewart C (2012), “Banks’ Funding Costs and Lending Rates”, RBA Bulletin, March pp 37−43. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Competitive pressures play an important role in deposit pricing.  These sorts of determinants of the rate structure are not directly affected by movements in the cash rate.  As I will discuss shortly, over the past few years, competitive pressures in the deposit market and risk premia for the banking sector globally have risen substantially. These have had a material impact on the cost to banks of funding their lending books. While these developments are not the result of movements in the cash rate, the Reserve Bank Board takes these developments into account in its setting of the cash rate to ensure that the structure of interest rates in the economy is consistent with the desired stance of monetary policy. Moreover, the link between movements in the cash rate and lending rates in Australia is much tighter than in many other countries. In the US, for example, movements in the Fed funds rate have a much less direct influence on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.  Composition of banks’ funding The funding structure of the Australian banking system has changed markedly over the past few years (Graph 1). Deposits have become a much larger share of overall funding, rising from a little under 40 per cent in 2007 to 52 per cent currently. The rise in the share of deposit funding has come at the expense of a decline in the share of short-term wholesale funding from around 30 per cent to 20 per cent currently.  Graph 1   The structure of funding shown in Graph 1 is for the banking system as a whole, not that of any particular financial institution. Similarly, the analysis presented is for the cost of funding this aggregate structure and will certainly differ institution by institution. For example, the regional banks generally fund a larger share of their books via deposits, and have significantly decreased their use of securitisation. Credit union and building societies continue to raise the vast majority of their funds via deposits.  The major change in the funding structure of the larger banks has been the switch from short-term wholesale funding to deposits, although they have also recently increased their 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 use of long-term secured issuance, particularly in the form of covered bonds. While the covered bond issuance has had little effect on the composition of banks’ funding at this stage, given the large stock of existing funding, it has allowed the major banks to achieve funding at longer tenors than has been the case previously. Covered bonds have generally been issued for terms of 5 to 10 years, whereas unsecured bank bonds are generally issued with maturities of up to 5 years.  Within banks’ deposit funding, there has been a marked shift towards term deposits, which pay higher interest rates than other forms of deposits. Indeed, term deposits have accounted for most of the growth in bank deposits since the onset of the financial crisis. They now account for about 44 per cent of the major banks’ deposits, up from 30 per cent in the middle of 2007 (Graph 2).  Graph 2   The increase in the share of deposits, particularly term deposits, reflects a number of interrelated factors:   First, banks have offered relatively attractive rates to depositors.   Second, strong business profits have resulted in larger corporate cash holdings, which have been increasingly invested in deposits rather than other financial instruments, particularly short-term bank paper.   Third, households have significantly increased their term deposits placed directly with banks, instead of investing in other financial assets. There has also been a rise in deposits placed via superannuation and managed funds.  Some part of the second and third of these factors reflects as much a change in name as a fundamental shift in funding structure. Instead of holding an exposure to the banking system that is called short-term wholesale debt, some corporates and superannuation funds hold the very same exposure in the form of a term deposit (of comparable maturity). This reflects 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches pressures from regulators, ratings agencies and the market for financial institutions to be more deposit funded, because deposits are assessed to be more stable, even though, in this instance, the behavioural response of the investor is probably not materially different.  For banks, term deposits have the advantage of generally being a relatively stable funding source. The average contractual maturity of term deposits is fairly short, at somewhere between four and seven months. But these term deposits are typically rolled over a number of times so that the effective maturity is more around a few years.  From the banks’ point of view, the rates on new term deposits can also be adjusted quickly to influence the growth in this source of funding. However, because term deposits have a relatively short contractual maturity, changes in the pricing flows through the whole term deposit book quickly. Hence movements in these rates can be one of the biggest short-run influences on changes in overall funding structure.  While most of the competition among banks has been for term deposits, banks have also offered more attractive transaction and savings accounts. They are paying higher interest rates on these accounts and are offering greater functionality. The increase in the value of funds invested in these deposits has largely been placed in online saver accounts and accounts with introductory bonuses and/or bonuses for regular deposits. Banks have reported little growth in the value of low-interest transaction-style deposit accounts.  At-call online saver accounts are generally assessed to have more rapid run-off rates under the Basel III liquidity standards, so they will not be particularly attractive from the banks’ point of view once those liquidity standards take effect from the beginning of 2015. That does not seem to have affected the pricing of these products yet, but it will be interesting to see how that evolves both in terms of pricing and product design as we approach that date.  Cost of funding Having discussed the structure of funding, I will now turn to the cost of that funding.  The Reserve Bank uses a wide range of sources to derive our estimates of banks’ funding costs. We use data reported by financial institutions to APRA and banks’ regular profit statements to the market to track the composition of funding. We monitor the prices offered on various forms of deposit accounts, and maintain a comprehensive database of wholesale funding, which is updated issue by issue. We supplement all of this with extensive consultations with financial institutions, big and small.  The analysis presented contains our best estimates. But there remains a degree of imprecision around them. Moreover, as I mentioned earlier, our estimates are for the system as a whole, not for any particular financial institution.  That said, in summary, our estimate is that the absolute level of banks’ funding costs fell from mid 2011 to February 2012, but by less than the reduction in the cash rate. There were particularly pronounced increases in the cost of term deposits and long-term wholesale debt relative to the cash rate as financial market conditions deteriorated in late 2011.  Deposits Competition for deposits, which had moderated somewhat in early 2011, intensified again in late 2011. Consequently, our estimate is that while the cash rate has fallen by 50 basis points since mid 2011, the major banks’ average cost of deposits has declined by about 25 basis points. In other words, while the average interest rate on deposits has indeed fallen, it has risen relative to the cash rate.  The average spread above market rates on the major banks’ advertised term deposit “specials” has increased by about 35 basis points over the past year (Graph 3). Furthermore, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 an increase in the share of deposits written at rates higher than the rates advertised by banks has meant that the average rate on outstanding term deposits has not fallen as quickly as benchmark rates, as term deposits have been rolled over. That is, banks have been increasingly paying customers more than the rate advertised in the window if the customer asks for it, reflecting competitive pressures. Moreover, there has been some shortening in the average maturity of term deposits recently given the inverted yield curve, which has meant that changes in pricing have passed through more quickly.  Graph 3   The average advertised rate on at-call savings deposits rose by around 20 basis points relative to the cash rate over 2011. Again, in absolute terms, the interest rate declined. Taking into account an increase in the proportion of savings deposits earning bonus rates, the average rate on these deposits is estimated to have increased by between 35 and 50 basis points relative to the cash rate.  Interest rates on transaction accounts have not fallen in line with the cash rate as many only pay very low nominal interest rates. Hence, as the cash rate falls, there is no scope to lower the interest rates on these accounts.  Wholesale debt The absolute cost of issuing new unsecured wholesale debt fell during 2011 (Graph 4). Relative to risk-free benchmarks, however, the cost of issuing wholesale debt has increased since mid 2011. The increase in spreads on banks’ wholesale funding reflects global investors demanding more compensation for taking on bank credit risk, although the rise for Australian banks has been less marked than it has been for other banks globally. This widening in spreads was at its peak at the beginning of the year but over recent weeks these spreads have narrowed noticeably.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Graph 4   There has also been an increase in the costs associated with hedging the foreign exchange risk on new foreign-currency denominated bonds. This rise in the basis swap reflected the dearth of Kangaroo issuance earlier in the year at a time when the banks were raising foreign-currency debt. The pick-up in Kangaroo issuance in recent weeks has alleviated some of that pressure.  Spreads on banks’ new wholesale debt have come down somewhat following the ECB’s 3-year longer-term refinancing operations. However, they still remain higher than in mid 2011 (Graph 5).  Graph 5   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 While the relative cost of new long-term wholesale funds is currently higher than that of maturing funds, this has had only a moderate effect on the major banks’ average bond funding costs relative to the cash rate to date. This reflects the fact that it takes at least 3 to 4 years for the major banks’ existing stock of bond funding to be rolled over. Since spreads began to rise sharply in August 2011, the major banks’ issuance of new bonds amounts to about an eighth of their outstanding bonds. As a result, the cost of the major banks’ outstanding long-term wholesale debt is likely to have risen by about 25 basis points relative to the cash rate over the past year.  The increase is smaller if fixed-rate wholesale debt is assumed to be swapped back into variable-rate obligations. The extent of the rise in relative costs for individual banks varies according to each bank’s use of interest rate derivatives.  Short-term wholesale debt is mainly priced off 1- and 3-month bank bill rates. While these rates generally fell (in terms of level) over the latter half of 2011 due to the sharp fall in the expected cash rate over this period, there was an increase in the cost of short-term debt relative to the expected cash rate as measured by the bank bill to OIS spread over the same period (Graph 6).  Graph 6   The increase in this spread also contributed to a higher average cost of long-term wholesale debt, relative to the cash rate, given that most of this debt is benchmarked to short-term bank bill swap rates. These pricing conventions ensure that changes in the cash rate, and expectations about its future level, have a direct effect on both short- and long-term wholesale funding costs. Since the start of the year, the spread between bank bills and OIS has narrowed noticeably. The reduction in the spread reflects, in part, the reduction in short-term issuance because of a higher level of term wholesale issuance.  Short-term issuance is somewhat of a buffer for the major banks. When global markets are dislocated, they tend to issue more onshore short-term debt. This tends to drive up the cost, which may also be rising at the same time because of the tensions which are causing the dislocation globally. Conversely, when conditions improve and term wholesale issuance picks up, short-term issuance declines, reducing the spread with further downward pressure from the improved market sentiment.  
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches If the lower spread between bank bills and OIS is maintained, this should alleviate some of the upwards pressure, relative to the cash rate, on the cost of funding banks’ aggregate loan books.  Overall cost of funding Taking the costs of individual funding sources noted above, and weighting them by their share of total bank funding, provides an estimate of the overall change in the cost of funding banks’ aggregate loan books.  Compared to mid 2007, the average cost of the major banks’ funding is estimated to be about 120–130 basis points higher relative to the cash rate (Graph 7). Most of the increase occurred during 2008 and early 2009 when the financial crisis was at its most intense. Since the middle of 2011, however, there has been a further increase in banks’ funding costs relative to the cash rate of the order of 20–25 basis points. The graph shows that a fairly large part of this increase comes from the pricing of deposits.  Graph 7   The increase in funding costs, relative to the cash rate, differs across institutions given differences in their funding compositions and the pricing of different liabilities. The available evidence suggests, for example, that the overall increase in the regional banks’ funding costs since the onset of the financial crisis has been larger than that experienced, on average, by the major banks. This mainly reflects the larger increase in the cost of the regional banks’ deposits and a more significant shift in their funding mix.  Banks’ lending rates  I have primarily focused on funding costs today, but in closing I will briefly touch on developments in lending rates. The Bulletin article goes into this in more detail.  The cost of funding is the most important factor that influences the lending rates banks set. But there are a number of other factors that affect pricing including: the credit risk associated 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 with the various types of loans, the liquidity risk involved in funding long-term assets with short-term liabilities, and choices about growth strategies in different markets.  For close to a decade prior to the global financial crisis, banks’ overall cost of funds followed the cash rate closely, as risk premia in markets were low and stable. Accordingly, interest rates on business and housing variable-rate loans tended to adjust in line with the cash rate.  Nevertheless, over this period there was a gradual decline in the spread between average interest rates paid on loans and the cash rate. For example, the spread between the average mortgage rate paid and the cash rate declined from 275 basis points in 1996 to around 125 basis points in 2007 (Graph 8).  Graph 8   Since the onset of the financial crisis, banks have increased the spread between lending rates and the cash rate for all loan types. The increases have varied across the different types of loans, partly reflecting differences in the reassessment of the riskiness of those loans and expectations regarding loss rates.  But the primary factor driving the increase in the spread between lending rates and the cash rate has been the increase in the relative cost of funding that I have described above. Financial institutions have increased their lending rates in the face of the increase in costs to maintain their net interest margins within the range observed in recent years.2 In turn, this has been with the aim of maintaining profitability.  Without seeking to answer the question as to whether or not these movements in lending rates have been “appropriate”, the aim of my speech today, and the Bank’s recently published analysis, has been to provide some facts to help in that discussion.                                                   2 As noted in Deans and Stewart (2012), there are a number of other factors which affect the reported net interest margin in addition to movements in lending rates and funding costs. And similarly, there are additional factors which affect the translation of net interest margins to profitability. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jens Weidmann: Lessons from the crisis for monetary policy and financial market regulation Keynote speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Frankfurt Finance Summit, Frankfurt am Main, 20 March 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Dear Professor Franke, Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak here today. Through numerous collaborations, the Bundesbank has developed a close relationship with the House of Finance. The exchange between the two institutions has always proved rewarding; and it is a pleasure for me to follow up on this tradition today at the Frankfurt Finance Summit. Almost five years have passed since the eruption of the global financial crisis. Global efforts to resolve the crisis and to draw the right consequences have been exceptional in historical comparison, and our perception of the financial sector has changed profoundly. But many of the questions the crisis has raised have not been fully resolved. Among others, those questions refer to financial developments leading up to the crisis, chains of contagion throughout the crisis, as well as consequences of policy interventions taken. All of them have in common that they aim at a better understanding of the financial sector and are therefore closely related to its ever-changing economic role as an intermediary. There is no question that the role of the financial sector has undergone profound changes in the last decades. This is illustrated by the increase in value added by the financial sector as a percentage of GDP around the globe. In the US, this figure grew by 70% over the last 30 years. In Europe, the development is more heterogeneous: Spain witnessed a 32% growth in value added by the financial sector as a percentage of GDP from 1995–2007, the UK a 46% growth. In contrast to that, Germany registered a drop by 9%. But altogether, the figures point to a general increase of the financial sector’s relative weight. In addition, more and more financial interaction is taking place within the financial sector itself: Financial assets held by the financial sector have increased by more than 100%. In comparison, the growth in total financial assets held by households and non-financial-corporations is significantly lower at around 50% and 70%, respectively. Two starkly different explanations for this phenomenon are currently being debated. According to the first paradigm, the role of the financial sector as financial intermediary has changed, resulting in additional functions being performed by the financial system for the real economy. The second – and quite popular – explanation argues that the increase in financial activity has merely been an exaggeration, as a consequence of which the financial system has, to a certain degree, uncoupled itself from the real economy and turned to unproductive activities. Each line of argument obviously has important policy implications – for the scope and intensity of regulation and supervision, but also for other policy areas, including central banks. Drawing the right lessons from the crisis requires first of all a clear understanding of the role the financial system plays for the real economy. In my short remarks I will therefore take a 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches somewhat more general approach that goes beyond monetary policy issues. I will argue that, firstly, a highly developed and innovative financial system is indispensable for economic growth, but that there is also an inherent risk of exaggerations. Secondly, regulatory efforts therefore have to strike a delicate balance between constraining such exaggerations without stifling innovation and thereby hampering economic growth. And finally, given that the crisis has laid bare serious gaps in our understanding of the financial system, I will conclude by outlining some fields of research that, at least from a central bank’s viewpoint, are of particular interest. 2. The role of the financial system The fundamental role of the financial system is to act as intermediary between borrowers and lenders. Services such as the transformation of maturity, denomination and liquidity allow for efficient capital allocation, thereby promoting innovation and growth. Furthermore, the financial system solves adverse selection and moral hazard problems between lenders and borrowers. This is of crucial importance for financing innovations and therefore for TFP-intensive growth which we depend on in aging highly developed economies. Throughout history, this role of the financial system has never been static, but has become more and more complex in step with economic progress. In the process, the contemporary structure of the financial system has gradually evolved over the centuries. Banks perform the tasks associated with money and credit, the bond market provides financing for governments and large corporations, the stock market provides equity financing of joint stock companies, venture capital the funding of nascent businesses – and a myriad of financial instruments allow us to trade and redistribute all kinds of risks. And it is a well-known fact that this process has, through history, been accompanied by the build-up and bursting of bubbles – usually at large, sometimes very large costs. Prominent examples include the Tulip Mania, the South Sea Bubble, the Roaring Twenties Bubble and the Dot-Com Bubble. Hence there has always been a trade-off. On the one hand, financial innovation was a precondition for rising prosperity and economic development. On the other hand, the fluidity and dynamism of financial transactions make the financial system prone to exaggeration and the emergence of speculative bubbles. The financial crisis is another illustration of this pattern, but a particularly severe one that has galvanised policy-makers into reforming financial regulation. But what are the lessons we should draw? 3. Lessons for financial regulation Regulatory reforms aim to improve the resilience of the financial system as a whole against shocks in the form of a default or the burst of a bubble. To achieve this, financial regulation has to prevent market forces from getting out of control. But it must not suppress financial innovation; otherwise we would eliminate its indispensable contribution to economic growth and development.  The European sovereign debt crisis has raised awareness of the importance of financial markets and their disciplining effect. True, bond markets took note of differences in sovereign risks much too late. But did not economic policy perform even weaker in preventing excessive deficits and the emergence of severe macroeconomic divergences? For this reason, I am sceptical about correcting undesirable results in the financial markets by direct prohibition or by suppressing market activities. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Instead, regulatory reform should reinvigorate the principle that risks and returns have to be closely aligned: Market participants must be held responsible for their actions, the possibility of losses or even default is a constitutive element of any functioning market, and the financial markets are no exception. The reforms initiated by the G20 reflect this approach. Measures like Basel III and the new macro-prudential framework explicitly take a systemic view of the financial system. The resolution regimes for SIFIs, the measures adopted to increase transparency and to create a global level playing field strive for a closer alignment of risks and returns. The agenda has picked up on important past trends, such as the increasing role of non-bank-sector and the growing interconnectedness of financial markets. When looking at the experience of the financial crisis and the channels through which the financial system affects economic growth, the case can be made that the two objectives of an efficient and stable financial system are, to a significant degree, complementary. Well designed regulatory reform can make the financial system more stable without cutting into sustainable growth. But the constant evolution of the financial system and the emergence of new instruments and players also imply that the regulatory framework will never be finalised once and for all. 4. Unresolved questions Prudent regulation and supervision crucially depend on a sound understanding of the financial system. Research efforts of institutions around the globe, including central banks which also have a keen interest in these issues, have been remarkable. However, a deeper understanding is still required of those trends in financial markets that led to financial instability – and monetary policy measures that sometimes took central banks to the limits of their mandate. I do not want to offer a research agenda, but let me pick out some areas that are particularly interesting for central banks: Securitisation, for example, is not a new technique, but it has experienced an enormous upswing in recent decades. It is intended to disperse credit risk to those who are better able to assume such risks and absorb the corresponding losses, and as such it increases welfare. We know by now that securitisation can also increase risk-taking and thus the fragility of the financial system as a whole. Some elements of regulatory reform already address this problem. But the question remains whether we have done enough to reduce the drawbacks without sacrificing the benefits. Another important reason for financial instability with potentially serious macroeconomic costs continues to be overextension in balance sheets in boom periods, which is often an indication of excessive risk-taking. We have learned that this can be masked by a vigorous economy. It is therefore vital that we extend our knowledge of how to make disguised risks more transparent. Turning from the prevention of exaggerations to more direct countermeasures, we still do not know enough about the desirability of different forms of policy interventions. The search for the optimal mix of measures of ex-post and ex-ante interventions is still ongoing. Further work needs to be done in order to establish whether macro-prudential regulation can solve the time consistency problems associated with ex-post interventions. This is a particularly relevant issue for central banks. Since the crisis began, functions have been added, especially in the field of macro-prudential policy. As you are well aware, the Bundesbank, too, stands ready and looks forward to assuming more responsibilities in this field. The challenge will then be to integrate these new tasks seamlessly with the functions central banks already perform. I think it is right to have central banks closely involved, given their expertise and the close linkages to other central bank functions; but there can be no doubt that the independence of central banks and our prime objective of maintaining price stability must not be compromised. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Additional issues have been raised by the European debt crisis. As regards macro-prudential policy, the distribution of competencies between the European and the national level and the various bodies is currently the subject of heated debate. Contagion effects of financial crises are particularly severe in a monetary union, suggesting a more centralised approach. But national financial systems still differ significantly within the euro area, and member states retain a large degree of autonomy in fiscal and economic policy, which favours the existing decentralised setup. An important channel of contagion has been the heavy concentration of sovereign debt at the respective national banks. When risk perceptions started to change, banks holding large amounts of distressed sovereign debt became a severe burden on financial stability. We need to know more about how to best address this sovereign bank nexus. 5. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen,  let me conclude. The financial system plays an indispensable role in fostering innovation and growth. This role has never been static: it is evolving constantly. And throughout history, this process has been accompanied by exaggerations.  The continuing, never-ending challenge of financial market regulation is to limit the latter without stifling the undeniably beneficial forces at work in the financial system – we have to tame market forces and self-interest, but should not exorcise them. To do so, we have to expand our understanding of financial markets, which is still limited and lacking in a number of policy-relevant fields. The Bundesbank is closely involved in this endeavour, and fora such as the Frankfurt Finance Summit are an important part of the process. Thank you for your attention, and I wish you a lively, interesting discussion. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ewart S Williams: Economic leadership within the Caribbean with particular reference to Trinidad and Tobago Feature address by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the Employers’ Consultative Association of Trinidad and Tobago Fifty Second Annual General Meeting, Port-of-Spain, 16 March 2012. *      *      * Thanks to the Employers Consultative Association for inviting me to address you as part of your lecture series. I also take the opportunity to congratulate you on the occasion of your 52nd Annual General Meeting.  Your anniversary is taking place against the background of an uncertain economic environment and in a complicated industrial relations climate.  Yet all birthdays are a time for celebration and you have much to be proud of, surviving 52 years of ups and downs and through it all, making a sterling contribution to the economic development of Trinidad and Tobago.  You have asked me to speak on economic leadership within the Caribbean region, with particular reference to Trinidad and Tobago. It is a rather broad topic but I would try to give you my perspective, hoping that it touches on the issues that concern you.  Without getting in too much detail, I will first try to indicate how our economic performance compares with that of our regional counterparts, suggesting that we have much to be thankful for. I will go on to make the point that the medium term economic prospects for the region are, to put it mildly, very uncertain. While we in Trinidad and Tobago have many more options than our CARICOM neighbours, given the uncertainties surrounding our natural resource endowments and the more difficult global economic environment, we need to undergo considerable structural transformation, if we are to maintain or increase the relatively high living standards which we now enjoy. My over-riding thesis is that you, as the private sector, would have a critical role to play in this process of economic transformation. However, success would ultimately depend on the extent to which we could set up a meaningful partnership with the other developmental partners, most notably the state, the trade unions, tertiary educational institutions and the NGOs community.  First the history…  There is no doubt that the Trinidad and Tobago economy has made remarkable strides over the past two decades, and in so doing, we have assumed the economic leadership of the Caribbean region.  For example, in the period immediately before the global recession, say 2000 through 2008, real GDP growth in Trinidad and Tobago averaged 7.6 per cent per year compared with the CARICOM average of 2.9 per cent. By 2008, Trinidad and Tobago accounted for 38 per cent of regional GDP and our per capita income is about US$19,000 compared with an average of US$8,900 for the other CARICOM territories. The Bahamas and Barbados have higher per capita incomes.  As we all know, the entire region was affected by global recession, some countries more than others. In 2009–2010, economic activity in the OECS declined by a cumulative 9 per cent. In Barbados and Jamaica, the cumulative decline was about one-half this amount – about 5 per cent. In these countries, the main contributing factors were the sharp fall in tourist arrivals and workers’ remittances. The OECS were further affected by the impact of the CLF/Clico crisis (in fact, it was BAICO) and the devastation caused by Hurricane Tomas, particularly in St Lucia and St Vincent and the Grenadines.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches (The region remained in crisis in 2011. While there has been some improvement in tourist arrivals, the OECS saw another year of economic decline, albeit at a reduced rate. Jamaica and Barbados both reported the start of a very weak recovery).  In Trinidad and Tobago real GDP is estimated to have declined by 3 per cent in 2009 remained flat in 2010 and declined again in 2011 (by just over 1 per cent).  I should note that Guyana and Suriname were the only two countries in the region that emerged unscathed, largely because of their gold resources which benefited from rising international prices.  Trinidad and Tobago’s more resilient economic performance, relative to its neighbours, owes much to our energy resources and to the entrepreneurial dynamism of our private sector. These endowments are reflected, inter alia, in our stronger government finances, lower public debt, more robust foreign reserve positions, and in our dominance in regional trade.  The following summary statistics paint the picture.   Regional governments have run fiscal deficits each year since 2000, while Trinidad and Tobago has run fiscal surpluses for all but two years, over the same period.   The CARICOM region boasts of having among the most highly-indebted countries in the world, with public debt averaging around 70 per cent of GDP (Jamaica, Grenada and St Kitts and Nevis have debt ratios of over 100 per cent of GDP). In contrast, Trinidad and Tobago has a public debt ratio of 38 per cent of GDP.   The relative fiscal and public debt performance are part of the story that explains the differential credit ratings. Trinidad and Tobago is the only Caribbean country rated “A” by Standards and Poor’s. The Bahamas and Barbados also have investment grade ratings – BBB and BBB minus, respectively.   Trinidad and Tobago dominates regional trade. For the period 2000 to 2007, Trinidad and Tobago had a positive trade balance of over US$1.5 billion vis-a-vis our CARICOM partners; this increased to US$2.2 billion in 2008–2010. Much of our positive trade balance was due to our energy exports. Excluding energy trade, there is still an annual positive trade balance of around US$400–$500 million. This latter statistic underscores the importance of the regional market for our manufacturing exports and for employment in the domestic manufacturing sector. It raises the interesting question whether our enlightened self-interest does not justify some level of financial assistance to the region.  And the facts are that Trinidad and Tobago has provided considerable financial assistance to the region over the past decade in a variety of ways. Since 2000, private sector firms and CARICOM Governments have raised approximately US$2.2 billion on the local capital market mainly through bond issuance. In addition, official support provided by the Trinidad and Tobago Government includes US$260 million through the Petroleum Stabilisation Fund, and about US$50 million by way of its contribution to the CARICOM Development Fund.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) considers that the medium growth outlook for many countries in the CARICOM region will be subdued. Excluding Trinidad and Tobago for the moment, the IMF envisages only: i) a slow recovery in tourism demand because of weaker growth in the advanced economies; ii) increased competition for scarce foreign direct investment; and iii) external shocks, including natural disasters, which could undermine economic stability due to limited fiscal space and high debt levels.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The medium term economic outlook for Trinidad and Tobago may be slightly better but several uncertainties and challenges lie ahead. It is to these uncertainties and challenges that I now turn.  In a speech I made to a Conference you hosted two years ago, I made the point that “while oil and gas have brought us to where we are, we are not sure how much further it would carry us”. If that was so in 2010, it is much more so now in 2012.  (I don’t know about you but) I must confess to be very uncomfortable about the prospects for our energy sector.  The Scott Ryder Report tells me that, as at the end of 2010, proven gas reserves were equivalent to 9 years of production and proven oil reserves, the equivalent of 14 years (production). The data show that oil production has been on a secular decline for several years and anecdotal information suggest that petro-chemical industries are currently facing serious gas shortages. This portrait underscores the urgent need for investment in exploration in order to tap into our probable and possible oil and gas reserves. However, the results from two bid rounds conducted so far, have not been as good as envisaged.  In addition to the production uncertainties, there are serious risks to gas prices over the medium to long term. These arise from the great proliferation of shale gas technology which is likely to lead to a major increase in gas output and depress LNG prices worldwide.  The uncertain prospects for the energy sector and the central role that this sector will continue to play in the economy over the next few years, may be contributing to the crisis of confidence in the non-energy sector. Perhaps a national dialogue on the subject would serve to give investors a better understanding of the real picture in the energy sector and facilitate more meaningful planning of the much-needed diversification effort.  If current trends in the energy sector persist, the transformation of the non-energy sector will become all the more urgent, if sustainable growth is to be achieved. This transformation would need to be based on the establishment of a range of competitive industries producing for new export markets.  You, the private sector are being called upon to play the major role in this transformation effort. I submit, as I have done before, that the market mechanism will not provide the necessary incentives for meaningful diversification. State leadership and vision will be required and I would add the active participation of other stakeholders such as the trade unions and the tertiary educational institutions.  Among the Government’s roles is the provision of public goods and services that are essential to the growth process. Thus, the focus should be on the improvement of our economic infrastructure – specifically roads, water, electricity, ports and so on. Government has already announced sizable investment programmes in these areas. Government has also been placing great emphasis on education and training. Hopefully this emphasis would serve to create a culture that institutionalises continuous learning and a “can do” attitude, which is critical for an environment conducive to innovation.  The Government also has responsibility for maintaining an enabling environment. While there are several elements under this heading, “business facilitation” is one that requires particular attention.  In the latest Doing Business Report by the World Bank, Trinidad and Tobago ranks 68 out of 183 countries. In that Report, two of the areas cited as needing significant improvement are: i) dealing with construction permits – it takes around 297 days to get a building permit; and ii) registering property, where it takes on average 162 days to complete the process.  Discussions with local traders also suggest that there are often significant delays and charges at our ports, even relative to the rest of the Caribbean countries. I understand that some important work has been going on to progressively reduce administrative procedures by way of a Single Electronic Window which would help to further automate transactions.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches The private sector also has its challenge. Entrepreneurs need to move out of their existing comfort zones and to invest in new industries for export to some of the more promising and dynamic markets. It is worth remembering that following the economic crisis of the 1980s, local private sector firms took up the challenge, identified new exports niches and established a formidable presence in the CARICOM region. In some cases the amount of capital needed may require partnering with foreign investors. In other circumstances, public/private sector partnerships may be the appropriate modality.  The trade unions clearly have an important role in the transformation effort. Relations between companies and unions need to shift from being adversarial to one of cooperation. It is critical for both parties to jointly address competitive pressures and work to harness the skills and commitment of the workforce.  Productivity and/or profitability are the source of an employers’ capacity to pay, if business competitiveness is to be achieved and maintained.  Some of the more dynamic export-oriented economies (in Asia) have experimented with compensation systems which provide flexibility through variable pay arrangements which can respond to changes in market cycles or to poor enterprise performance. I am not sure whether it would work here but perhaps, it is worth some consideration.  Let me end by returning to the main theme … While we are undoubtedly the economic leaders of the CARICOM region, our energy advantage is on the wane.  In these circumstances, in order to ensure medium-term sustainability and increasing living standards, we need to become more competitive, and to put the diversification thrust on the front burner. Time may not be on our side. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ipumbu Shiimi: Financial capability and the role of the financial services industry – achievements, challenges and opportunities Statement by Mr Ipumbu Shiimi, Governor of the Bank of Namibia, at the launch of the Financial Literacy Initiative, Windhoek, 15 March 2012. *      *      * Director of Ceremonies, Honourable Samuel Nuyoma; Governor of Khomas Region Honourable Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila; Minister of Finance Honourable Members of Parliament, Dr. Romeo Bertolini, Counsellor for Development Cooperation; Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany Your Worship Elaine Trepper; Mayor of the City of Windhoek Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Industry Captains Members of the Media, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen Good Morning  It is my pleasure to join you this morning and to be associated with the official launch of the national Financial Literacy Initiative (F.L.I). This event is a remarkable milestone in the annals of our financial landscape. The launch and roll-out of the financial literacy program here today will serve as a catalyst for financial inclusion for all. I, therefore, wish to congratulate you Honourable Minister and all fellow F.L.I partner institutions for the conceiving of, and embarking on this program.  The Bank of Namibia has had the privilege to play a key role in the formulation of the Financial Sector Strategy, whose overarching objective is to elevate the role of the financial sector in the economy. Financial education is an important part of the financial sector development Strategy and the Financial Sector Charter adopted by the industry way back in 2009. Indeed, the financial literacy initiative constitutes a transmission channel for the expanded participation in the mainstream financial system. I am therefore gratified that this initiative has kicked-off at the time when we are preparing for the launch of the Financial Sector Strategy.  Honourable Minister,  Ladies and gentlemen,  The objectives of this initiative and the tasks ahead should be understood in the wider context of the potential role of the financial services sector in the economy. Finance is a key catalyst for economic development and wealth creation. Financial products and services such as secure savings and insurance play an important role to absorb changes in income during difficult economic times as well as reducing poverty and vulnerability. In fact, secure savings is a source of financial security for households and individuals.  Director of Ceremonies A week ago, I have had the honour to officiate at the launch of the findings of the 2011 FinScope Survey. This Survey follows on the similar survey undertaken in 2007 and it is the third such survey conducted in independent Namibia. The survey assesses the level of 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches access to, and use of financial services by the adult population as well as the underlying reasons. For the first time in Namibia, 2011 FinScope also assessed the level of financial literacy in the country, which is a critical benchmark for planning purposes and, indeed, for the execution of the financial literacy initiative.  The findings of 2011 FinScope Survey reveal an array of progress in expanding the frontiers of financial inclusion. Of particular significance is the level of financial inclusion, which is now assessed to have increased from 48 percent in 2007 to 69 percent by 2011. Put differently, financial exclusion, which stood at an estimated 51.7 percent in 2007, has significantly fallen to 31 percent by 2011. This quantum of progress in a space of four years is a result of the effectiveness of policy and concerted efforts by the financial services industry to bring services to the doorsteps of the previously unserved and underserved. I therefore wish to seize this opportunity to commend the financial services industry for moving in the right direction.  Honourable Minister,  Ladies and gentlemen,  The survey findings also unravel the challenges and opportunities for targeted interventions going forward. Access per se may have improved, but the picture is not entirely rosy to warrant us to be smiling all the way to our workplaces.  Relatively high bank fees hit hard low-income earners and discourage formal banking as a safe haven for saving and other financial transactions. Unbanked persons are especially exposed to the vulnerabilities and risks associated with the cash economy and high service fees of alternative financial services. Still, about two-thirds of the population, that is 64 percent, do not have access to insurance. Therefore, we still have a long way to go.  To address some of these challenges, the Bank is working closely with the commercial banks for the establishment of the basic bank account for low-income earners and SMEs. Among its features, the basic bank account will attract low transactional fees and provide for a bundle of free transactional services per month. When finalized, this product innovation is expected to improve access to banking for the unbanked as well as cost-effective services for low-income clients. We will not stop here, Director of Ceremonies, but will continue to look at other bank fees and charges that warrant further attention in line with the Payment System Vision 2015, launched some time ago.  In conclusion, I wish to congratulate you, honourable Minister, for steering this program from infancy to fruition. Investment in financial education is an investment in financial stability. It is an investment in financial security, quality of life and poverty reduction for the broad majority of Namibians.  I thank you for your kind attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Ipumbu Shiimi: Enhancing financial inclusion in Namibia Welcome remarks by Mr Ipumbu Shiimi, Governor of the Bank of Namibia, at the launch of the Namibia FinScope 2011, Windhoek, 8 March 2012. *      *      * Director of Ceremony  Heads of Syndicate Member Institutions  Ms Maya Makanjee, CEO of FinMark Trust  Distinguished invited Guests  Members of the Media  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Good morning!  I would like to welcome you all to this very important workshop, held at this very important time in the development journey of our country. These are important times because we are redefining and transforming our economy for the better, especially for those who had not been able to participate meaningfully in the economy, so far.  A special welcome goes to our important partners, the FinMark Trust Team. We appreciate your contribution with a view to enhancing financial inclusion in our country. Many of us here should by now be familiar with the name FinMark Trust as you have been in Namibia many times. Four (4) years ago, FinMark Trust came to share the results of FinScope 2007 with us, and they have also presented on several other issues in between.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I have come to learn and agree with the proponents of the saying: “if you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it”. This cannot be more relevant to us, given our current efforts of wanting to address the socio-economic challenges facing our country. As a country, Namibia is being haunted by challenges of unemployment, poverty, financial exclusion amongst others. To be able to address these challenges better, we need to be able to measure the depth of those challenges. Fortunately for us, FinScope is one of the instruments that we are able to make use of for that purpose, in addition to other surveys undertaken nationally. The usefulness of FinScope has been demonstrated during the preparation of the draft Financial Sector Strategy 2011– 2021, especially the chapter on financial inclusion. Information from the FinScope 2007 served as a basis from which new targets had to be set. One would probably argue that out-dated information was used, but at least planning was based on something. A scenario of no basis for planning would have been unacceptable.  As you might know, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Financial Sector Strategy advocates for the need to enhance access to financial products and services for the low income and less privileged segments of our population. We have therefore keenly awaited the results of the FinScope 2011 survey, as we expect them to help us to measure progress towards to financial inclusion in Namibia. This is because we will now know where we are and how far we are from our final destination. This should then enable us to plan and act better in implementing our financial sector development and inclusion agenda. In fact, this will put us on the right path to reach our intended objectives.  What is particularly pleasing to know is the fact that FinScope 2011 has attempted to collect information on financial literacy. It is our hope that this would provide a view and give us a baseline with which we can work, going forward. Financial literacy is an important aspect in the process of ensuring financial inclusion. This is because consumers will only be able to effectively make use of available products and services if they are aware and are well 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches informed; not only of the availability of products and services but also of how they can make use of such and on what terms. Director of Ceremonies, the purpose of this gathering is for FinMark Trust to share with us the outcome of the Namibia FinScope 2011 Survey. Let me therefore end here and allow them enough time to do just that.  I thank you! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Sanusi Lamido Sanusi: Banking reform and its impact on the Nigerian economy Lecture by Mr Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the University of Warwick’s Economic Summit, Warwick, 17 February 2012. *      *      * Protocol It is a great honor to be invited to address the Warwick Economic Summit, which has become one of the largest academic conferences in Europe. I wish to commend the entire students and staff of the University of Warwick for inviting me to share my experiences at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I am highly delighted to be part of this summit where top policymakers, professionals and technocrats around the world meet to debate and exchange views on contemporary economic issues. The outcomes of the Summit had continued to inspire policymakers in designing proactive micro and macroeconomic management policies for solving emerging economic problems in both developed and developing countries. It is against this backdrop that I urge you to sustain the Annual Summit. My address today will focus on “Banking Reforms in Nigeria and Its Impact on the Economy”. As you may all be aware, the banking sector in Nigeria has recently witnessed significant reforms and hard choices have had to be made to tackle the lingering effects of the global financial crisis, which culminated in the contraction of some banks’ balance sheets with the attendant economic losses. I am pleased to note that these problems have been surmounted through series of reforms undertaken by the Central Bank of Nigeria.  Introduction  Generally, the financial system is more than just institutions that facilitate payments and extend credit. It encompasses all functions that direct real resources to their ultimate user. It is the central nervous system of a market economy and contains a number of separate, yet co-dependent, components all of which are essential to its effective and efficient functioning. These components include financial intermediaries such as banks and insurance companies which act as principal agents for assuming liabilities and acquiring claims. The second component is the markets in which financial assets are exchanged, while the third is the infrastructural component, which is necessary for the effective interaction of intermediaries and markets.  The three components are inextricably intertwined. Banks need payments system infrastructure to exchange claims securely and markets in which to hedge the risks arising from their intermediation activities. The banking system therefore functions more efficiently and effectively when there is a robust and efficient payments systems infrastructure. Moreover the concern to ensure a sound banking system by the Central Bank is underscored by the critical role of banks in national economic development. Banks for instance, mobilizes savings for investment purposes which further generates growth and employment. The real sector, which is the productive sector of the economy, relies heavily on the banking sector for credit. Government also raises funds through the banking system to finance its developmental programmes and strategic objectives. It is in view of these strategic roles of the banking system to national economic development that the issue of a sound banking system, through proactive reforms becomes imperative.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Rationale for banking reforms in Nigeria  Conceptually, economic reforms are undertaken to ensure that every part of the economy functions efficiently in order to ensure the achievement of macroeconomic goals of price stability, full employment, high economic growth and internal and external balances. Thus, banking reform in Nigeria is an integral part of the country-wide reform program undertaken to reposition the Nigerian economy to achieve the objective of becoming one of the 20 largest economies by the year 2020. As part of the vision, the banking sector is expected to effectively play its actual role in intermediation and for the banks to be among global players in the international financial markets.  As I will explore later, the various reforms we undertook in Nigeria were targeted at making the system more effective and strengthening its growth potentials. In view of the fact that banks take deposits from the public, there is a need for periodic reforms in order to foster financial stability and confidence in the system.  The recent experience from the global financial crisis has further underscored the imperatives of countries to embark on banking reforms on a regular basis. As you are all aware, the world economy was hit by an unprecedented financial and economic crisis in 2007–2009 that resulted in a global recession. This crisis led to the collapse of many world-renowned financial institutions and even caused an entire nation to be rendered bankrupt.  In Nigeria, the economy faltered and was hit by the second round effect of the crisis as the stock market collapsed by 70 per cent in 2008–2009 and many Nigerian banks sustained huge losses, particularly as a result of their exposure to the capital market and downstream oil and gas sector. Therefore, the CBN had to rescue 8 of the banks through capital and liquidity injections, as well as removal of their top executives and consequent prosecution of those who committed some infractions. These actions became necessary to restore confidence and sanity in the banking system. A holistic investigation into what went wrong in Nigeria leading up to the banking crisis in 2008 found eight interrelated factors responsible. These were macroeconomic instability caused by large and sudden capital inflows, major failures in corporate governance at banks, lack of investor and consumer sophistication, inadequate disclosure and transparency about the financial position of banks, critical gaps in the regulatory framework and regulations, uneven supervision and enforcement, unstructured governance & management processes at the CBN/ and weaknesses in the business environment. Each of these factors is serious in its own right. Acted together they brought the entire Nigerian financial system to the brink of collapse.  We all know that a well-functioning financial system matters to everyone and to the economy at large. The Nigerian economy has huge potential for growth. To realize this potential, it is imperative that we learn lessons from the crisis and take steps to not only fix the problems, but to also introduce measures to establish financial stability, a healthy evolution of the financial sector and ensure the banking sector contributes to the development of the real economy.  As a result, the Nigerian banking system has steadily evolved, following wide and far-reaching reforms embarked upon by the regulatory authorities. Following the banking crisis of 2008, the Central Bank of Nigeria articulated a blue print known as “The Project Alpha Initiative” for reforming the Nigerian financial system in general and the banking sector in particular. The reforms aimed at removing the inherent weaknesses and fragmentation of the financial system, integrating the various ad-hoc and piecemeal reforms and unleashing of the huge potential of the economy.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Critical elements of banking reform in Nigeria  The current reforms which began in 2004 with the consolidation programme were necessitated by the need to strengthen the banks. The policy thrust at inception, was to grow the banks and position them to play pivotal roles in driving development across the sectors of the economy. As a result, banks were consolidated through mergers and acquisitions, raising the capital base from N2 billion to a minimum of N25 billion, which reduced the number of banks from 89 to 25 in 2005, and later to 24.  Beyond the need to recapitalize the banks, the regulatory reforms also focused on the following:   Risk-focused and rule-based regulatory framework;   Zero tolerance in regulatory framework in data/information rendition/reporting and infractions;   Strict enforcement of corporate governance principles in banking;   Expeditious process for rendition of returns by banks and other financial institutions through e-FASS;   Revision and updating of relevant laws for effective corporate governance and ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the implementation of banking laws and regulations, as well as;   The introduction of a flexible interest rate based framework that made the monetary policy rate the operating target. The new framework has enabled the bank to be proactive in countering inflationary pressures. The corridor regime has helped to check wide fluctuations in the interbank rates and also engendered orderly development of the money market segment and payments system reforms, among others.  The Bank has over the years identified key priority sectors and developed tailored interventions to support and promote their growth. Some of the key interventions in the real sector include:   N200 Billion Refinancing/Restructuring of SME/Manufacturing Fund   N300 billion for long term funding of Power and Aviation   Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS)   The Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS)   In addition the Nigerian Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) was established. The programme is a demand-driven credit facility that would build the capacity of banks to engage and deliver loans to agriculture by providing technical assistance and reducing counterparty risks facing banks. It also seeks to pool the current resources under the CBN agricultural financing schemes into different components of the programme.  Furthermore, the Bank has been collaborating with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), to reduce the cost of transactions, particularly bond issues, so as to diversify funding sources away from banks as well as attract more foreign portfolio investors into the sector.  In 2010, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) was established following the promulgation of its enabling Act by the National Assembly. It is a special purpose vehicle aimed at addressing the problem of non-performing loans in the Nigerian banking industry, among others. In line with its mandate, AMCON recently acquired the non-performing risk assets of some banks worth over N1.7 trillion, which is expected to boost their 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches liquidity as well as enhance their safety and soundness. With the intervention of AMCON, the banking industry ratio of non-performing loans to total credit has significantly reduced from 34.4 per cent in November 2010 to 4.95 per cent as at December 2011.  In order to ensure that AMCON achieves its mandate, the CBN and all the deposit money banks have signed an MOU on the financing of AMCON. The CBN shall contribute N50 billion annually to AMCON, while each of the participating banks shall contribute an amount equivalent to 0.3 per cent of its total assets annually into a sinking fund as at the date of their audited financial statement for the immediate preceding financial year. Therefore, the cost of the resolution to the Nigerian taxpayer is significantly minimized.  To further engender public confidence in the banking system and enhance customer protection, the CBN established the Consumer and Financial Protection Division to provide a platform through which consumers can seek redress. In the first three months of its operation, the Division received over 600 consumer complaints, which was a manifestation of the absence of an effective consumer complaints resolution mechanism in the banks. The CBN has also issued a directive to banks to establish Customer Help Desks at their head offices and branches.  In addition, the CBN has commenced a comprehensive review of the Guide to Bank Charges with a view to making the charges realistic and consumer friendly.  The CBN has taken steps to integrate the banking system into global best practice in financial reporting and disclosure through the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the Nigerian banking sector by end-2010. This should help to enhance market discipline, and reduce uncertainties, which limit the risk of unwarranted contagion.  The Universal Banking (UB) model adopted in 2001, allowed banks to diversify into non-bank financial businesses. Following the consolidation programme, banks became awash with capital. Some operators abused the laudable objectives of the UB Model with banks operating as private equity and venture capital funds to the detriment of core banking practices. To address the observed challenges, the CBN reviewed the UB Model with a view to directing banks to focus on their core banking business only. Under the new model, licensed banks will be authorized to carry the following types of business:   Commercial banking (with either regional, national and international authorization);   Merchant (investment) banking;   Specialized banking (microfinance, mortgage, non-interest banking (regional and national); and   Development finance institutions.  The introduction of the non-interest banking in Nigeria is expected to herald the entry of new markets and institutional players thus deepening the nation’s financial markets and further the quest for financial inclusion. In fact, the first fully licensed non-interest bank in the country (Jaiz Bank Plc.) started business on Friday, January 6, 2012.  Similarly, the importance of Microfinance in a growing economy cannot be over-emphasized, given its potential in addressing the challenges of excluding a large population from full participation in economic activities. As at December 2011 there were 24 deposit money banks with 5,789 branches and 816 microfinance banks bringing the total bank branches to 6,605. The ratio of bank branch to total population is 24,224 persons, indicating a high level of financial exclusion. This is further substantiated by the 2010 Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) survey, which observed that 46.3 per cent of Nigeria’s population is still financially excluded compared to South Africa, Kenya, Botswana with 26.0 per cent, 32.7 per cent and 33.0 per cent, respectively. Thus, in 2012 the Bank is looking to establish a Microfinance Development Fund (MDF) aimed at improving access to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 affordable and sustainable sources of finance by Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and Microfinance Banks (MFBs). It would have both commercial and social components. This would enhance their operations and outreach and support the capacity building activities of the MFBs/MFIs.  The Bankers’ Committee has declared 2012 the year of “Women Empowerment” in the banking industry. A sub-committee on Women Empowerment has been formed, with the CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria as Chairperson. The CBN is working on establishing a special fund by the end of the year that would provide credit facilities to women at a single digit interest rate. The CBN is also working with banks to ensure that a certain percentage of senior management and board seats are reserved for women.  The Bank recently introduced a new policy “Cash less Policy” as part of ongoing reforms to address currency management challenges in Nigeria, as well as enhance the national payments system. As may be aware the Nigerian economy is heavily cash-oriented in the transaction of goods and services. This huge cash transaction increases the operational costs of the banking sector, which is passed on to the customers in the form of higher service charges and high lending rates. These operational costs are significant due to the high cost incurred in cash management, currency sorting, cash movements and frequent printing of currency notes.  The direct cost of cash management to the banking industry is estimated to be about N192 billion by 2012. Research has shown that about 90 per cent of withdrawals by bank customers’ are typically below N150,000 whereas, only 10 per cent of bank customers who withdraw over N150,000 were responsible for the rise in cost of cash management being incurred by the generality of bank customers. There are also risks involved in keeping or moving large amounts of cash, namely the high incidence of robberies, encouraging corrupt practices and the public’s propensity to abuse and mishandle currency notes.  The CBN, in collaboration with the Bankers’ Committee, aims to achieve an environment where a higher and increasing proportion of transactions are carried out through cheques and electronic payments in line with global trends. The enforcement of the T+2 cheque clearing cycle is being stepped up and efforts are on-going to reduce the cycle to T+1. Anybody can now make payments of up to N10 million through the clearing system with a cheque.  The CBN recognizes the need to balance the objectives of meeting genuine currency transaction demand and combating speculative market behavior that may negatively affect economic growth and stabilization measures. The new cash withdrawal policy will ensure that a larger proportion of currency in circulation is captured within the banking system, thereby enhancing the efficacy of monetary policy operations and economic stabilization measures.  The policy does NOT in any way stop account holders from withdrawing any amount of money they desire from their accounts. The policy simply recognizes that banking is a business and, as with any business, there are costs that are sometimes shared between the business and the customers. The policy stipulates that to withdraw more than N150,000 (for individual account holders) and more than N1,000,000 (for corporate account holders), there will be a transaction cost.  The various measures notwithstanding, there was need for some intervened banks to merge in order to strengthen their capital base and to remain competitive in the market. Accordingly, five Transactions Implementation Agreements (TIAs) were signed among the banks, and the CBN issued a letter of no objection to the banks being acquired to proceed with the merger of the entities. The signing of legally binding TIAs for the five (5) banks and the full capitalization of the 3 new banks by AMCON had resolved the issue of the combined negative asset value of the eight CBN intervened banks. Similarly, the recapitalization of all the five banks that signed TIAs was completed in 2011.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Impact of the reform  The current banking reforms have yielded the following results among others:  i.  The reforms have brought about a new mindset to the industry as banks are putting in place best practices in the areas of corporate governance and risk management. Transparency and public disclosure of transactions have remarkably improved.  ii.  A number of banks have returned to the profit-making path and improved their balance sheets, as the recent results of their financial statements have shown.  iii.  Banks are gradually resuming lending to the private sector with the additional liquidity of more than N1.7 trillion injected into the banking system through the issuance of AMCON bonds, and significant progress in re-directing credit to the power sector and SMEs at single digit interest rates. These initiatives have saved and helped create thousands of jobs in the economy.  iv.  A new code of corporate governance has been issued by the Bank. The CEO of banks shall serve a maximum tenure of 10 years. Furthermore, all CEOs who would have served for 10 years by July 31, 2010 ceased to function in that capacity and have handed over to their successors.  v.  Nigerian Banks are now key players in the global financial market with many of them falling within the Top 20 banks in Africa and among Top 1000 banks in the world.  vi.  The reform has culminated in moderating the spread between the lending and deposit rates to 9.7 per cent as at end-December 2011, from 12.2 per cent in 2010. This has contributed to the existing macroeconomic stability in the economy with inflation moderating to 10.3 per cent as at end-December 2011.  vii.  The hitherto volatility in the exchange rate witnessed in the foreign exchange market has been brought under control. The premium is within the international standard of 5.0 per cent.   viii.  There is greater cooperation between the monetary authority and the banks through regular meetings and collaboration on policy issues.  ix.  The reforms have brought about greater confidence in the banking system with the removal of distress banks and the adoption of a strict code of corporate governance.  x.  Increased widespread use of e-payment services among Nigerians.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Challenges to the banking reforms  The Nigerian banking reform, despite its laudable achievements is confronted with certain challenges. First and foremost is the wrong perception of the intent of the reform. The introduction of the new banking model, especially specialized banking (non-interest banking), is intended to broaden the scope of financial services offered by banks in Nigeria. However, this has been given a religious connotation. The wrong perception and stiff resistance to the policy could potentially deter prospective investors in the banking industry.  Second, the reluctance of Nigerians to accept positive changes in global dynamics is another challenge. There is incontrovertible evidence that the excessive liquidity in the system measured by broad money (M2), narrow money (M1) and currency in circulation is partly attributable to the high cash transactions for economic activities, which has continued to undermine the efforts to achieve price stability. Yet the cashless policy has faced significant resistance, despite its prospect for economic growth and development and the global trend in the intensity of usage of e-payments.  Third, the cost of doing business in Nigeria is still high when compared with developed economies or some emerging and developing countries owing to the poor state of infrastructure.  Another challenge is that the high growth rates recorded in the last five years have not been inclusive, implying that this has not transcended into sustainable development. This situation is responsible for the high unemployment and poverty levels, which inevitably affect the low banking habit in the country.  Another key challenge is the quality of manpower: real strategic change can only take place with competent and committed workforce that is constantly exposed to training and development. The competitive financial sector environment requires a highly skilled workforce that would effectively contribute to value creation within financial institutions. Hitherto, employee recruitment was merely to comply with regulatory requirements, while training was viewed as a non-revenue function that was costly and unnecessary.  Conclusion  The banking sector occupies a vital position in the economy and must be subject to continuous reforms for it to function efficiently. The modest achievements recorded so far have been largely due to greater collaboration and commitment of purpose among key stakeholders. Thus, the CBN in its efforts to develop a sound and vibrant banking system will strive to ensure that democratization of policy is sustained. It will also continue to ensure that the banks abide strictly with the code of corporate governance for efficient functioning of the banking industry.  Thank you for listening.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: The euro area sovereign debt market: lessons from the crisis Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 12th IMF Annual Forum on Managing Sovereign Risk and Public Debt: “Managing Sovereign Debt: A Seismic Shift in demand and Supply Dynamics?”, Rio de Janeiro,  28–29 June 2012. *      *      * I wish to thank Maximilian Freier and Wolfgang Lemke for their contribution to this speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. Mr Deputy Managing Director, Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is a great pleasure to speak to you here today at the 12th IMF Forum on Managing Sovereign Risk and Public Debt. Clearly, this topic has never been more relevant than today.  In my remarks today, I will focus on the experience in the euro area and consider the following three questions: First, what has characterised the pricing of sovereign credit risk over the last two decades? Second, what is the relevance of the sovereign debt market tensions for monetary policy? And third, what lessons have we learnt? What has characterised the pricing of sovereign credit risk over the last two decades? Let me start with the first question, the pricing of sovereign risk. Looking at the sovereign debt markets of the euro area over the past two decades, it is possible to clearly distinguish three main periods. They all display distinct patterns of government bond pricing.1 First, there was the run-up to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), that is especially the period of about five years before 1999, when the euro was introduced. During this time, sovereign bond yields quickly converged towards those of German Bunds. Much of this convergence is explained by the elimination of exchange rate and inflation risks. In addition, European governments made great efforts to reduce their deficit and debt levels in order to fulfil the Maastricht criteria and join the common currency. In the second period, ranging from the introduction of the euro in 1999 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, government bond yields remained at moderate levels and did not differ much from country to country. The yield spreads of ten-year government bond yields vis-à-vis German Bunds reached a maximum of about 70 basis points, and recorded about 15 basis points on average.2 These observations raise some questions: why did this period see such an undifferentiated pricing of government debt securities? And were the “macroeconomic fundamentals” characterising the different sovereign issuers similar? In fact, no: the state of public finances was distinctly and persistently different across countries. So why was the different degree of fiscal solidity (or rather the lack thereof) not “priced in” in government bond prices? There are several reasons. Market participants may have been insufficiently forward-looking and too complacent. They may have extrapolated from their experience of a long period of                                                 1 See, e.g., European Central Bank, “Financial integration in Europe”, May 2011, Chapter I.2 for a characterization of different phases of bond market developments since the run-up to EMU and a more detailed overview of the bond market situation during the first stages of the sovereign debt crisis. 2 This is based on ten-year government bond spreads of the initial twelve euro area Member States vis-à-vis Germany between January 1999 and August 2008, where Greek spreads are included as of 2001, when Greece joined EMU. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  low macroeconomic volatility – the so-called “great moderation” – and may have felt insulated from any extreme macroeconomic event. In particular, it may have appeared inconceivable that any euro area sovereign issuer could actually reach its “fiscal limit” – that is, a situation where it could not re-finance its debt. Moreover, the “great moderation” experience led to low levels of investors’ risk aversion and low price of risk across asset classes. The depth of euro-denominated government bond markets, together with the expansion and diversification of global foreign exchange reserves, may also have created the false perception that the demand for sovereign bonds was infinitely elastic. Finally, the no-bail-out clause of the Maastricht Treaty may simply not have been fully credible for investors. In the third phase, since autumn 2008, a sudden and disruptive re-pricing of sovereign credit risk has taken place. Government bond yields started to diverge, sometimes reaching levels that matched and exceeded those of the early 1990s. There were fundamental reasons for such a re-pricing of risk. Fiscal expansion due to the need to fight the crisis came on top of already high levels of public debt. Governments’ commitment to support systemically important financial institutions added to their contingent liabilities. Lower potential growth rates raised concerns for public finance sustainability. In addition to these fundamental causes, sovereign bond markets in some jurisdictions have been characterised by poor liquidity and high volatility. In this context, investors’ worries regarding a loss of market access for some Member States may have become entrenched, and their expectations self-fulfilling. Moreover, for some countries, government debt market liquidity has been threatened to completely dry up in some periods. Overall, there has been a combination of fundamental causes and market distortions.  It soon became clear that the dramatic movements in government bond yields were not merely a barometer of investors’ valuation of liquidity and credit risk. Rather, the extreme levels of bond yields themselves were exerting an adverse influence on other financial market segments, the banking sector and also the effectiveness of monetary policy. What is the relevance of sovereign debt market tensions for monetary policy? There is a strong link between the stability of sovereign debt markets and the smooth functioning of monetary policy. This becomes very clear once we consider the prominent role of government bonds in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. I would like to identify four channels through which the functioning of government bond markets can interfere with the transmission of monetary policy. Let me call them the interest rate channel, the wealth channel, the collateral channel, and the bank balance sheet channel. First, government bonds play a key role in transmitting the monetary policy stance to the real economy via the so-called interest rate channel. In times when government bonds are considered as essentially risk-free and liquid instruments, a change in current and expected policy rates is a central factor in shifting the government bond yield curve. Changes in long-term bond yields, in turn, translate to some extent into movements in corporate bond yields and bank lending rates – either via arbitrage relations or via pricing heuristics based on government bonds –, thus ensuring a smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout financial markets. However, since end-2008 bond yield changes of several sovereign issuers in the euro area have become heavily dominated by high and volatile premiums, often driven by contagion and market overreaction. Such effects have come to override changes in the monetary policy stance, blurring the transmission of monetary policy signals to the real economy.  Second, faced with threatening direct and indirect losses from strong price declines of sovereign bonds, consumers may opt for precautionary savings, which would counteract a desired stimulus to consumption from monetary policy easing. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Third, government debt securities have been a key source of collateral for banks to use in secured lending with other banks and the ECB. With the sharp decline in sovereign bond prices – often associated with a rating downgrade of the respective sovereign issuer – government bonds were made subject to significant haircuts and their refinancing power declined. This has eroded the volume of collateral available in the form of government bonds and stressed the re-financing possibilities of banks.  Fourth, the re-pricing of government debt also had a direct negative impact on the asset side of banks and therefore on their own perceived riskiness. In fact, since 2009, we can see a close relationship between measures of bank and sovereign credit risk. This sovereign-bank nexus constitutes a fundamental impediment to resolving the crisis in the euro area. On the one hand, rising sovereign credit risk affects banks’ credit risk via their exposure to government debt. This creates deleveraging pressure that may turn into disorderly dynamics characterised by fire sales. On the other hand, ailing banking sectors increase the burdens faced by governments. These two effects are mutually reinforcing and constitute a vicious circle. For the banks, the increase in their own credit risk makes their re-financing harder. In short, unsecured financing is hampered by the perception of increased bank riskiness while secured financing is undermined by the erosion of collateral. This can in turn become a major obstacle to granting loans to the real economy. As banks are the main source of financing in the euro area, this could seriously jeopardise the flow of credit to enterprises and households.  What lessons have we learnt? These developments in the euro area sovereign bonds markets offer one clear lesson: financial markets are prone to exaggerations, which amplify further the pro-cyclicality inherent in asset valuations. Usually, during “good times”, when risk appetite is strong and economic conditions are favourable, asset prices tend to be high and risk spreads tend to be low. However, financial markets tend to be over-complacent from time to time, especially after protracted periods that did not see any extreme events materialising. This tendency has probably led to an excessive tightening of euro-denominated yields in the run-up to the euro. In “bad times”, when the degree of risk aversion increases and GDP growth contracts, asset prices tend to decline and risk spreads rise. Also in bad times, this standard pattern of pro-cyclicality may be amplified by market exaggerations: investors tend to over-price certain types of risk and thus under-price the respective financial assets. Exaggerated pro-cyclicality of this type has hit the sovereign bond market during the crisis. Furthermore, in particular through the use of sovereign bonds as collateral, it has exerted adverse effects on other segments of financial markets, such as the funding markets for financial institutions. To remedy exaggerated pro-cyclicality does not mean that we should dispense with the disciplining role of financial markets. The history of the monetary union teaches us an interesting lesson: when the disciplining role of intra-euro area exchange rates was lost, volatility and tensions have in fact migrated to sovereign debt markets, where they were building up under the surface. Even though markets sometimes misprice assets, they nevertheless provide a useful service in terms of signalling, price discovery and incentives. For example, if markets had not pushed up the yields of countries in weak fiscal positions, imbalances would have remained unnoticed and grown much larger, and the cost of fixing them would have been even higher. While attenuating exaggerated pro-cyclicality is important to avoid self-fulfilling expectations leading to bad equilibriums, at the same time we should recognise that markets have issued valuable signals.  There are a number of ways to mitigate exaggerated pro-cyclicality of government bond markets. One way is to reduce the reliance of the financial, regulatory and supervisory framework on credit ratings. The European Commission has put forward a number of proposals to this end. Similarly, it is worth considering ways to delink the risk assessment of credit institutions from the credit rating of the sovereign. In addition, risk management by 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  central clearing counterparties or CCPs is of particular importance, as an increasing number of financial transactions is expected to migrate to them. The CPSS-IOSCO principles for financial market infrastructures expect CCPs to adopt forward-looking and conservative margin and haircut policies to limit the risk of destabilizing responses to changes in credit ratings. But to address the root causes of the current instability, fundamental policies will have to be adopted. The adverse feedback loop between banks and sovereigns, that I mentioned before, can be broken by establishing a true financial union: in my view this includes the creation of a pan-euro area deposit insurance fund and a pan-euro area bank resolution framework, supported by a single supervisory system with centralised decision-making. If the European Stability Mechanism – an institution that can provide financial assistance to euro area Member States in order to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole – could inject capital directly into banks, this would also help to break the bank-sovereign loop. Of course, such support must come with strong conditionality and control. Let me note that depending on its design, the financial union could introduce additional elements of risk-sharing among euro area countries, and as such, it should be subject to strong democratic accountability and control at national and European level. Most importantly, all euro area countries need to return to sound macroeconomic and fiscal positions. This may sound obvious, but unfortunately it has threatened to slip out of focus in some of the recent discussions. There has been substantial progress towards consolidating the foundations of EMU. Fiscal rules are being strengthened, and almost all European governments have signed a Treaty that contains the so-called fiscal compact, which mandates all contracting parties to introduce legally enforceable debt brakes in their countries.3 The reformed governance framework also provides new tools to improve budgetary surveillance as well as to prevent and address macroeconomic imbalances – the “six-pack” reforms and the “two-pack” legislation are examples and should be forcefully implemented.  Looking ahead, a path towards a fiscal union, based on a principle of responsibility and with proper control and accountability, would provide a sound “fiscal pillar” on which the single currency could safely rest. Some have suggested that it could provide a basis for the introduction of euro area-wide funding instruments with joint and several liabilities. Such instruments could contribute to a smooth functioning of a stability-oriented monetary policy, protecting Member States from temporary tensions arising in some parts of the Union and offsetting the emergence of self-fulfilling expectations leading to bad equilibriums. There is an important caveat, however. In his 1790 Report on Public Credit, Alexander Hamilton wished “to see incorporated, as a fundamental maxim in the system of public credit of the United States, that the creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of its extinguishment”. Common funding instruments would require shared decision making on national debts and deficits and probably joint control on fiscal expenditures and taxation. They can only result from further political integration; they cannot precede it.  Likewise, and importantly, a fiscal union can only come about once the participating countries have successfully restored domestic fiscal sustainability and solidified the conditions for long-term growth. Joint debt issuance cannot be a substitute for putting national fiscal houses in order and restoring competitiveness.                                                 3 “A fiscal compact for a stronger Economic and Monetary Union”, ECB Monthly Bulletin, May 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Conclusion Let me conclude. Euro area sovereign debt markets are going through unprecedented challenges. The inherent pro-cyclicality and the exaggerations that at times characterize financial markets should be recognized and addressed. However, structural problems call for structural answers. The current overhaul of fiscal, financial and economic governance in the euro area will help put the single currency on a sound and sustainable footing.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  K C Chakrabarty: ICT based financial inclusion – carving a new path through innovation Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Inaugural Plenary session of the 7th BANKing TECH Summit 2012, Mumbai, 28 June 2012. *      *      * Assistance provided by Ms Radha Somakumar in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged. Shri N. Chandrasekaran, Chairman-CII BANKing TECH Summit 2012 and CEO & Managing Director, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd; Shri Pratip Chaudhuri, Chairman, State Bank of India; Shri Pradeep Bhargava, Chairman – CII Western Region; Mr Manoj K. Kashyap, Executive Director, Pricewaterhouse Coopers Pvt. Ltd.; Mr Dev Ranjan Mukherjee, Director, CII; distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. When the financial sector is going through perhaps the most chequered phase of its history and the usefulness of financial innovation is itself under extensive debate globally, it is heartening to be participating in a seminar which is endeavoring to carve a new path for Indian banking through innovations. Congratulations to the organizers for choosing this contemporary but forward looking topic. Let me begin by referring to a recent report by the World Economic Forum titled “Rethinking Negative Innovation – Reducing Negative Outcomes while Retaining the Benefits”. The report attempts to answer certain fundamental questions: a. Is financial innovation needed? b. There is a thin line of demarcation between innovation and violation. c. What is needed to ensure that financial innovation better emphasizes the positive outcomes and reduces adverse consequences? After the financial crisis, while it has become fashionable to condemn financial innovation in toto, we must recognize that without continued financial innovation, the financial markets in both developed and developing nations will perform below their potential. But for financial innovation to result in benefits, it needs to focus not on the treasury incomes but must, instead, have customer orientation. When innovations have focused on better alignment of interests between the bank and its customers, they have always resulted in win-win situations. I can say that most of the innovations in payment and settlement systems, particularly those which deal with one-time customer interface, had this customer focus. The results are visible across the globe. The only segment of the financial markets that came out unscathed during the crisis has been the payment and settlement system. However, the financial sector has not succeeded in innovating to bring in efficiency in products that engage customers on a life cycle basis. Finally, it has to be remembered that financial innovation cannot outpace the innovations in the real sector. Customer-centric technology You have assembled here to chart a new path for innovation. However, let us bear in mind that for innovation to be successful, it has to necessarily be customer focussed. In a country like India, where access to financial services remains an issue, Innovation should particularly focus on financial inclusion and on the small and marginalized, but viable sections of the society. What makes innovations feasible at a rapid pace today vis-a-vis say, the last century? Undoubtedly, it is the advent of technology. But, as I have said in the past also, in the financial sector, for technology and innovation to be of true value to the customers, it must lead to better customer service in three ways (a) faster and hassle free (b) safer and error free, and most importantly (c) easier access but cheaper. Have these happened? If 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  asked to vote, I may cast a half vote to (a) abstain from vote to (b) and cast a negative vote to (c). Let me amplify. What is the most important prerequisite of a computer or an electronic device from the customer’s perspective and from an inclusion perspective? To me it is the standardization. Has it happened across banking services? Let me start with what is termed as the best financial innovation of the recent times – the ATMs. Do they result in faster dispensation of cash? A definite “yes”. Is it hassle free? To me, “No”. What are the problems faced by the aam admi? The problem starts with the standardization of ATMs. Some swallow your card, some require only swiping, some reckon paise when you key in the amount, some do not, some drop the cash on to a tray, some do not , some retract the cash if you are not prompt, some require keys to be pressed, others have a touch-screen. All these are confusing to the man on the street. Why do we not think of standardization even in this basic product? When this is the case with the most basic of the products, issues arising from lack of standardization are more serious in case of other products. There is no standardization of even the account numbering convention across the banking system. One Core Banking System of a bank is so different from another that a customer changing a bank will have to de-learn and re-learn banking operations all over again. Coming to (b), the attention paid by the banks to database migration has been so casual that the full benefits of computerization and technology are yet to be reaped. Is it not an irony for the banks to claim that NPA levels in a particular period went up as they moved over to “system generated” NPA computation? As far as the customer is concerned, the systems fail at the most inappropriate time. Let us go back to ATMs. Even today, we continue to receive a large number of complaints on account of malfunctioning of ATMs. Is the incubation period for the ATMs installed by banks not yet over? Should the system continue to run based on fear of penalties for inefficient customer service? Or would White label ATMs, for which RBI has recently issued exhaustive guidelines, provide encouraging solutions to these issues? Technology and consumer protection One developing concern is the increasing number of frauds in our electronic banking payment scenario. As the banking and payment space becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the challenge is to maintain the quality of security at the highest level in the financial sector. In the recent survey conducted by the Bank for International Settlements, 55% of the financial market infrastructures surveyed indicated that cyber attacks are increasing on account of phishing, weaker credentials / passwords, trusted insiders, denial of service attacks, etc. Technology should result in reduction in risk, not otherwise. This situation warrants huge investments in IT security and I would urge the banks and the IT companies to work together in this regard. Another angle to this issue is the protection that a customer has to be assured in the electronic banking scenario. The Reserve Bank expects banks to put in place checks and balances that provide confidence and protection to a genuine customer against frauds. Otherwise, the credibility of the entire system will come under scrutiny. The customer should be afforded the same kind of protection in an electronic transaction that he now gets in a paper-based transaction. The customer is not held liable if a signature is forged, whereas he is held responsible when a fraudulent transaction takes place electronically and the onus rests on the customer to prove that it was so. Is this fair? Will such a scenario encourage electronic transactions? We need to find a solution which provides a near zero liability to the customer. Let me now turn to the issue of technology and cost. Before I speak my mind on the issue, let me make it very clear that RBI does not support the argument that cash transactions in this country will disappear rapidly or that all paper based transactions would turn electronic if the financial sector was to offer electronic transactions free of cost. In fact, we firmly believe that anything that is offered free of charge can never be scaled up and that it cannot become 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  robust and efficient unless it offers commercial viability to those who offer the product / service. Having said that, I also do not support the principle, ostensibly being followed by some of the institutions, to recover a large part of technology expenses from the customers. I was amused at the action of banks deciding to waive charges on “inter-core” transactions hitting headlines in the media. It should have never happened in the first place. In fact, such charges, rather than their removal, should have hogged the limelight. Further, in an electronic banking scenario, ad valorem charge to customers is an issue which needs to be relooked. In fact, in a country like ours, part of the cost efficiencies achieved through technology must be passed on to the smaller customers. This calls for a rejig in the way in which banks approach technology. In a technology led financial sector, collaboration among all stakeholders, including competitors, could prove to be the big cost saver. With rapid strides in security standards and capabilities, such a collaboration and sharing of IT infrastructure is feasible on a much larger scale than is happening today. It is always perceived by the industry that the handholding / intervening by RBI is necessary for the systems to be operational in an efficient manner. I am unable to understand why collaborative approach cannot be the guiding force for success in adoption of shared IT infrastructure. Reserve Bank has contributed to the fostering of innovative methods to improve access to financial services through mobile and opened up and clarified the issue of Business Correspondent (BC) interoperability. Leveraging technology for making financial inclusion possible and a success Prior to the enablement of BC interoperability, the banks and technology providers had made a case that it was the lack of interoperability, that was a deterrent for financial inclusion and hence, much headway had not been achieved. According to the technology providers, investment in a non-interoperable technology would be a costly proposition and they did not see a business case to offer financial services at low cost. But now, with RBI permitting / clarifying interoperability, why is it that the transactions at BCs are not picking up, which ultimately, if increased, would change the cost and access equation, making it economically viable for financial service providers to reach poor and isolated individuals and communities? Banks have to make more investments in technology and work together with BCs for fast tracking initiatives under financial innovation. More importantly, focus of all innovations need to be customer, not process, system or employees. It must be recognized that only customer can bring business to the banks and contribute to their bottom lines. All other constituents such as technology, employees, BCs, etc only act as enablers to the process. Recently, I came across the report submitted by Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and ACCESS based on the “Retreat on the Business Correspondent (BC) model” which was jointly organized by the College of Agricultural Banking (C.A.B.), Reserve Bank of India and ACCESS. The report spells out the challenges faced by both banks and BCs in extending facilities to the recently financially included and to the financially excluded. The findings indicate that the banks have to ensure that the BC model finds space in the business strategies of the banks and not in the footnotes of their annual reports and that the banks should make client acquisition under this model a business proposition; and not treat it as a CSR activity. An important observation indeed! Further, it has become imperative for the banks to have full control and exercise due diligence, especially when the front end customer contact points are not regulated entities. While the customer has some relief at point of sales when a card is swiped in his presence, the uncertainty of a transaction going through in an E-Commence transaction is very high. Given the constraints of lack of control with respect to internet connectivity while doing such a transaction, banks have to step in to protect a customer when the transaction fails and ensure that the refund process is quick. Why is it that when a website like IRCTC can give the assurance to the customer through its terms and conditions that the refund will take place on such a day, other websites are not able to have similar efficient and transparent 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  processes? Financial service providers should disclose key information clearly, at appropriate points before, during, and after a transaction is completed. Of course, some of the responsibility lies with consumers too – to make sound financial decisions to the best of their ability. However, inexperienced or low-income customers with lower levels of formal education or literacy can be particularly vulnerable to unscrupulous conduct. Innovation through technology – creating a favourable ecosystem Technology provides the opportunity to innovate at a much faster pace and to create products that are closely linked to the needs of the consumer. There is a need to create an enabling ecosystem which will encourage and foster innovation by leveraging the best available technological platforms. Here, I would like to highlight some of the essential prerequisites that would help in creating this enabling ecosystem: i. Access to suitable and cost effective technology which can support multi-channel delivery system, particularly for low income groups. ii. Standardized systems, structures, products and processes, at least for the small and marginalized customers. iii. Efficient Business Models: viable but not exploitative. iv. Efficient Delivery Models: having integrity, speed and low cost. v. Comprehensive MIS capable of meeting all management information requirement and which is reliable and fast: Integrity of Information. vi. Information literacy at all levels, more particularly, for senior management and for all sections of the society including customers, technology vendors, banks, regulators, policy makers, etc. Way forward Stepping into the shoes of a regulator, you would appreciate that the principal challenge for regulators is to strike an appropriate balance between financial openness that supports growth-enhancing innovation while at the same time implementing regulations and effective supervision that limits the potential risk of financial instability. Further, there can often be a thin line of difference between innovation and violation of regulation. This poses challenges on regulatory resources. In respect of payment systems, having reached a critical mass, attempt has to be made by the stakeholders to provide a canvas for safe, efficient, interoperable, inclusive electronic payment systems. The banks will have to firm up the business model with appropriate technology and definite plan of action, attract more and more customers through reduced charges, introduce a time line for post launch management, give top priority to downstream variants and conduct electronic banking financial literacy drives. All these require charting a totally new path through innovation. We have an opportunity, like never before, to harness technology for the benefit of the masses. Responsible innovation is the key. We have to ensure that financial innovation is customer focussed and results in faster, safer and cheaper access to financial services, particularly for the large sections of our population that are still excluded from the formal financial system. Each one of us has a positive role to play in this process, including, banks, technology partners, customers, civil society, policy makers, regulators, etc. This alone can ensure financial and economic stability across the globe. I wish the deliberations at the summit great success. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Bwalya K E Ng’andu: Financing small- and medium-scale industries in Africa Keynote speech by Dr Bwalya K E Ng’andu, Deputy Governor (Operations) of the Bank of Zambia, to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa Expert Group Meeting on “Financing small- and medium-scale industries in Africa”, Lusaka, 26 June 2012. *      *      * • The UNDP Resident Representative, Ms Khanni Wignaraja;  • Director of UNECA, Southern Region office, Ms Beatrice Kiraso  • The AfDB Representative, Dr Fred Kwesiga;  • Officials from the Ministries of Finance of various countries;  • Officials from various central banks; Development Banks, Commercial Banks and other financial institutions;  • Private Sector Representatives  • Participants;  • Ladies and Gentlemen;  I would like to firstly express my appreciation to the Director of UNECA, Southern Region Office for extending an invitation to me to deliver the keynote address at the start of the Experts Group meeting of Financing Small and Medium Scale Industries. I commend UNECA for this great effort to bring together this assembly of high level officials and experts from Government, the financial sector, private sector and academic institutions to discuss the vexing problem of enhancing financial flows to the SME Sector in Africa.  I note from the very elaborate programme for this meeting that you will in the next three days cover a wide spectrum of issues some of which will focus on factors that constrain SMEs access to finance and some of which will focus on what needs to be done to change this situation. The meeting is, therefore, an opportunity for us to face a number of challenges that characterize this sector. These will include revisiting strategies and approaches to SME financing currently in use as much as it will require a review of current institutional arrangements through which finance is directly delivered to SMEs, on one hand, and those which indirectly obstruct or facilitate this flow of resources, on the other.  However, I believe that probably the greatest challenge before this assembly is to attempt to narrow the gap between analysis of the problem and the implementation of measures and actions that work. Meetings, workshops, seminars, etc. on SME financing are plenty at national, regional and international levels. Some of you have had the opportunity to attend several of these meetings in the past. Indeed, some of you have become experts at talking about the subject. Barely two weeks ago, the Bank of Zambia held a financial sector forum here in Lusaka at which views of various stakeholders on what needs to be done to address binding constraints to the SME sector were considered. The fact that the discourse on SME financing continues underpins two significant positions.  Firstly, it gives recognition to the fact that we are all aware of the potential of this sector in generating employment, promoting economic growth and reducing existing poverty levels. In low income sub-Saharan African countries, SMEs and micro-enterprises make up about 90% of all enterprises. However, due to the various constraints they face, their overall contribution to GDP can in some countries be as low as 20% although estimates show that this could be scaled up to 60% with the greater realization of the sector’s potential. Contribution to employment can be as high as 63%. For most low income countries, SMEs are the main 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  source of jobs and income after subsistence agriculture. Particularly significant is that they are a great source of livelihood for women who own more than half of SMEs while over 70% of Africa’s rural population survives through the formal and informal SME sector. There is little doubt, therefore, that SMEs form a solid basis for sustainable economic development on our continent.  Secondly, the continued discourse on SMEs reminds us of the possibility that we have probably done more talking about the problem than fixing it. Although the development of SMEs is varied extensively across Africa, what is clear is that in most countries a major obstacle to their growth is the lack of sustainable and cost effective financial products. South Africa and Mauritius in this region and North Africa have done a commendable job in developing flourishing SMEs sectors. Part of the reasons for success in these countries can be attributed to their modern financial systems and clear policies that support the growth of the sector. However, the fact still remains that for most African countries, a sustainable way of financing SMEs has yet to be found.  As I mentioned earlier, the programme for this meeting is broad and extensive. But I would wish to draw your attention to a number of broad areas of reflection which I believe can help in delivering greater finance to the sector.  The first area is that there is a need to accept that not all banks can or should even be expected to provide SME financing products. The cost structure and skills orientation simply make some financing institutions completely unsuitable to deliver SME products cost effectively.  The implication of this is that greater effort must be placed on developing financial institutions that see SME financing as the core business and therefore set out to develop the expertise required to finance the SMEs successfully.  Fairly often the discussion on SME financing is reduced to two diametrically opposed positions. On one hand, SMEs are considered by banks as representing a high risk and therefore, should be avoided or only dealt with cautiously and at a premium price. On the other hand, banks are accused of being inflexible and risk averse and consequently irrelevant to the sector.  It is important to understand where the truth lies in these two statements in order to advance the cause of SME financing. Firstly, it is a fact that SMEs present higher credit risk than well-structured corporate entities. SMEs may not have proper accounting records, may have severe governance issues which undermine accountability, have poor access to markets, poor skill levels including financial illiteracy by promoters, lack collateral which the lender can rely on in the event of failure, may not even exist in an appropriate legal form and even the assessment of the viability of a project might be difficult. Lending to SMEs can be a lenders nightmare for bankers. But it is also true that banks which are structured to deal with corporates are risk averse and inflexible when they deal with SMEs. Often when they bring inappropriate risk assessment tools, they may focus too much on collateral rather than project viability. They may even regard SME financing as peripheral to their business. Because of their limited knowledge of SMEs, they experience failure which itself reinforces the notion that SMEs are risky. What we want are financing institutions that are structured to respond to the unique characteristics of SMEs. Specialised SME lending institutions are more likely to handle the risk problem presented by SMEs as a challenge to be overcome with appropriate products and credit risk management strategies and not as a basis for inaction or avoiding the sector altogether. In short, lending strategies which ensure success with corporates do not necessarily ensure similar success with SMEs. Appropriate SME financing institutions must at the very least make lending to SMEs the core business.  The second area of reflection that I would urge this meeting to consider is that of building appropriate financing models that have been shown to work in Africa or other developing countries so that we all benefit from the best practices available. In South Africa, for instance, franchising which allows the use of brand names and building capacity have been an 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  important driver of SME financing since it reduces the perceived risk of business failure. Warehouse receipt financing which guarantee loans with agricultural stock are extensively used elsewhere but not as much in Africa. In some countries in Asia, the use of the SME cluster model has helped to increase SME financing by building greater confidence between lenders and SMEs. The cluster model is based on members of an SME entity seeking financing together and providing collective guarantees to financial institutions. The cluster also ensures credit compliance by members while facilitating constant interaction with financial institutions. Naturally, one must guard against the temptation to adopt other experiences without serious reflection – but, what appears desirable is the need to build financing models that are appropriate and therefore can deliver sustainable financing. We do not always require to re-invent the wheel in this process.  The third and last area of reflection for me is that we must understand that the constraints that limit the flow of finance to SMEs is sometimes beyond the scope of what financial institutions can do or outside the inherent adverse characteristics of SMEs. There are factors which exist outside the financial system and beyond SMEs which nonetheless affect resource flows. These might include poor infrastructure, bureaucracy which makes it difficult to carry out business, an unattractive tax regime and unclear or unfavourable government policies. Acquiring an appreciation of these factors and appropriately dealing with them can help to foster the efficient use of available financial resources by SMEs, increase their success in the application of credit and therefore give positive feedback to financing institutions which itself encourages them to lend more to the sector.  Let me conclude by wishing you all a fruitful three days of deliberations and to reiterate my challenge to you to attempt narrowing that undesirable gap between the identification of problems and the delivering of practical solutions that will enable the flow of appropriate and sustainable financial resources to SMEs to enable them to play their wealth creation and development role in Africa. For me, the SME sector can be a great engine for economic development in Africa. Meetings like this can help in making them become just that. But we must also go beyond just paying lip service to the sector and show true and real commitment to making the sector strong on our continent. I suspect that to go beyond lip service might, in some instances require a paradigm shift on the part of financiers, governments and the players in the SME sector itself.  I thank you for your attention!!! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ipumbu Shiimi: Addressing financial inclusion in Namibia Statement by Mr Ipumbu Shiimi, Governor of the Bank of Namibia, at the official launch of the Nam-mic Payment Solution, Windhoek, 24 April 2012. *      *      * Director of Ceremonies Members of the Board of Directors of Nam-mic Payment Solution Members of the Media  Distinguished Invited Guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen I am pleased to join you in witnessing the official launch of Nam-mic Payment Solutions, which will be a second mobile payment services provider authorised by the Bank. I am equally pleased to note that Nam-mic is embracing modern technology to provide value added services to its 200,000 union members. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bank welcomes the Nam-mic Payment Solution because it comes at a time when there is a greater need to find accessible, affordable and inclusive payment services to extend financial services to the excluded community. I therefore welcome the “Nam-mic CellCard” authorised by the Bank as an electronic wallet card that will enable payment for goods and services, person-to-person payments, airtime and electricity purchases. The Bank has identified financial inclusion to be an important thrust in the Bank’s developmental role in achieving the ideals of Vision 2030. The Bank, therefore, has made financial inclusion as one of the key strategic objectives of the Bank. At the centre of the Bank’s agenda to address financial inclusion, is access to financial services and payment services. As you may recall, in 2011, the Bank with the banking industry launched the National Payment System (NPS) Vision 2015 document. One of the strategies set out in that document, is to increase the accessibility of the payment system by providing for new types of participants, but at the same time maintaining the safety and efficiency of the payment system by adhering to sound internationally accepted payment system risk principles. In line with the NPS Vision 2015 the Bank issued a Determination on the Issuing of Electronic Money in Namibia which became effective on the 1st of March 2012. This regulation essentially applies to all persons who intend to issue e-money in Namibia. Both banking institutions and non-bank actors are permitted to apply for authorization to issue e- money. As such any persons operating and/or issuing electronic money without the distinct authorization from the Bank of Namibia is committing an offence in terms of the Payment System Management Act, of 2003, as amended. The determination on the issuing of electronic money paves the way for the development of innovative solutions which are supported by a realistic approach to regulation. Competition in the provision of innovative payment solutions, especially where such solutions are turned into practical products that are responsive to the needs of the financially excluded, is healthy. Although we expect banking institutions to continue to serving as the core of the payment system, it is non-banking institutions such a Nam-mic Payment Solutions that will be contributing to the competitive environment in the establishment of payment methods and delivery channels thus serving as an impetus to innovation. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Electronic payment solutions and thus mobile payment solutions is one of many initiatives that the Bank is promoting to increase financial inclusion. In this connection, this initiative of enabling money to be transferred across the country from person to person through a mobile solution at affordable costs will go along way in increasing access to financial services in line with broader National Objectives.  In conclusion, Director of Ceremonies, Ladies and Gentlemen we have come a long way in establishing a safe, sound and efficient payment system in Namibia. The challenge is to make them accessible, affordable and inclusive. Payment systems issues are perpetual on the Bank’s agenda and we all need to contribute to achieving the twin goals of financial inclusion and provision of speedy, efficient, robust, accessible, safe and affordable modern payment methods. Let me once again congratulate Nam-mic Payment Solution for coming up with this innovative mobile payment services for their members. At this juncture, I now declare the “Nam-mic CellCard” officially launched. I thank you for your kind attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Loi M Bakani: Papua New Guinea’s semi annual Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) Address by Mr Loi M Bakani, Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, 30 March 2012.  *      *      * Objective of monetary policy The objective of monetary policy in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is to achieve and maintain price stability. This entails low inflation supported by stable interest and exchange rates. The maintenance of price stability leads to: • Confidence in the kina exchange rate and management of the economy; • A foundation for stable fiscal operations of the Government; • Certainty for businesses to plan for long-term investment; and •  A stable macroeconomic environment conducive to economic growth. Executive summary In 2011, PNG realized high economic growth as measured by the increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 8.9 percent, while inflation for the year was a moderate 6.9 percent. Real GDP growth is expected to remain buoyant in 2012 of around 8.0 percent, supported by strong domestic demand, as construction activity for the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project peaks, production at the Ramu Nickel/Cobalt mine commences, other private sector investments come on line, and high public and private spending ensues in the lead up to the national elections. All sectors are expected to grow, led by manufacturing, building and construction, and transportation/storage/communication. The Bank projects annual headline inflation for 2012 to be around 8.0 percent, and both the exclusion-based and trimmed mean measures to be around 7.5 percent. PNG has also experienced significant levels of excess liquidity within the banking system in recent years, which poses a threat to the soundness of the financial system and to macroeconomic stability. The main source of liquidity is the foreign exchange reserve build-up, stemming largely from dollar-denominated mineral tax earnings1, inflows related to the PNG LNG project and other private foreign direct investments. Whilst liquidity does not seem to currently have an impact on inflation via private sector credit, despite strong economic growth, the Bank of PNG (Central Bank) is concerned about its potential adverse impact on price stability. The balance of payments recorded a surplus in 2011 and is projected to increase further in 2012. This outcome is associated with inflows for the PNG LNG project and high export earnings. At the end of 2012, the gross foreign exchange reserves are projected to be around US$5,087 (K10,598) million, sufficient for 7.6 months of total and 19.9 months of non-mineral import covers.                                                 1  These foreign exchange inflows are then converted by the Bank of PNG into kina, and either spent or re-deposited by the Government largely at commercial banks, thereby adding to liquidity. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The increase in international reserves led to growth in the money supply and liquidity. The trends in growth of monetary aggregates as experienced in 2011 are expected to continue in 2012. In 2012, broad money supply is projected to increase by 14.8 percent, driven mainly by an increase in the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system. Monetary base and private sector credit are projected to grow by 33.2 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively. The Government projects a balanced budget of K10.5 billion for 2012, with emphasis on key priority areas, consistent with its medium term plans. However, any further increases in Government expenditure in relation to the national elections and rapid draw down of trust accounts at the Central Bank would exacerbate the already high levels of liquidity. It is therefore important that there is close coordination between fiscal and monetary policy to ensure macroeconomic stability. In anticipation of the sizeable revenue inflows from the PNG LNG project, the Government enacted the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Act in February 2012. The SWF is expected to contribute to macroeconomic stability and provide ongoing funding to the Government budget. The funds will be managed on-shore and invested off-shore and therefore will minimise the effect of large foreign exchange inflows on domestic liquidity and reduce upward pressure on the exchange rate. Given the projected strong domestic economic growth and associated demand pressures in 2012, the Bank will continue to assess the trade-off between high economic growth and inflation. The Bank will therefore maintain the tight policy stance and may adjust it to ensure the high level of liquidity is managed appropriately so that inflation is at an acceptable level and stability in the financial system is maintained. 1.0  Monetary policy discussions 1.1  Monetary policy assessment, issues and expectations Annual headline inflation was 6.9 percent in the December quarter of 2011, lower than 7.2 percent in the December quarter of 2010, after peaking at 9.6 percent in the June quarter of 2011. The lower outcome was attributed to a decline in the price of betelnut and lower imported prices of food and fuel, supported by the appreciation of the kina exchange rate. Underlying inflation as indicated by the exclusion-based and trimmed mean measures were 7.7 percent and 6.5 percent in the December quarter of 2011, respectively. These outcomes were lower than the forecast made in the September 2011 MPS, despite the strong domestic demand associated with the PNG LNG project and high Government expenditures. The Bank projects annual headline inflation for 2012 to be around 8.0 percent, while trimmed-mean and the exclusion-based inflation are projected to be around 7.5 percent. The forecasted headline inflation is lower than the 8.4 percent average for 2011, due to the strength of the kina, lower imported inflation, and stable international food and fuel prices. The kina is expected to remain strong through 2012, mainly due to high capital inflows and export receipts. While this has the effect of lowering inflation, it can adversely affect the traditional export sector. On the other hand, firms must be fair in the conduct of their businesses by passing the benefit of kina appreciation through lower prices to consumers. Inflation in PNG’s major trading partners eased in the second half of 2011 and is expected to pass through to domestic inflation in 2012. Food, in particular cereal, and fuel prices dropped in the second half of 2011, though both have increased slightly in the first few months of 2012. However, inflationary pressures still prevail, attributable to domestic demand pressures arising from the ongoing construction of the PNG LNG project and subsequent increase in business activity in 2012, and increased private and public spending in relation to the national elections. The elections will also increase the transactions demand for money. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Supply-side shocks in early 2012, attributable to bad weather and subsequent damage to agricultural output and transport infrastructure are also expected to contribute to inflation. For the medium term, headline inflation is projected to be around 7.5 percent in 2013 and 7.0 percent in 2014. These projections are based on a number of factors including the winding-down of the construction phase of the LNG project in late 2013, the continued strengthening of the kina and easing global demand (see Chart 1). There are upside risks to these projections, including higher domestic demand and associated inflation expectations by firms due to the PNG LNG project, any substantial increase in food and fuel prices, as well as higher than expected inflation in PNG’s major trading partners. The European debt crisis and oil export embargo on Iran embodies further risks to global macroeconomic stability. The global economic recovery continued to slow down during the second half of 2011, mainly driven by lower economic growth in both the advanced and emerging economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) accordingly revised downwards its global growth estimate for 2011 to 3.8 percent in the January 2012 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update, from 4.0 percent in the September 2011 WEO. Global growth is now forecast to be at 3.3 percent in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013, down from 4.0 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, projected in the September 2011 WEO. Easing inflation and concern over economic recovery has prompted central banks in the advanced economies to maintain their accommodative monetary policy stance, except for the European Central Bank (ECB) and Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Financial market volatility was high in the second half of 2011, mainly due to the European debt crisis, which caused investors to retreat to safe haven assets such as US government securities and gold. The overall balance of payments is projected to be in surplus by K1,371.3 million in 2012. This projected outcome is mainly associated with the inflows for the PNG LNG project and other private sector foreign direct investments. The current account is projected to record a deficit in 2012, attributed mainly to increased imports and higher net services and income payments related to the PNG LNG project (see Chart 2). By the end of 2012, the gross foreign exchange reserves are projected to be around US$5,087 (K10,598) million, sufficient for 7.6 months of total and 19.9 months of non-mineral import covers. Gross reserves are projected to be higher in the medium term due to increased inflows associated mainly with high volumes of PNG’s export commodities (See appendix – Table 2). As at 28th March 2012, the level of gross foreign exchange reserves was US$4,283.4 (K8,794.6) million. Reflecting the developments in the balance of payments, the daily average kina exchange rate appreciated against the US dollar by 19.9 percent to US$0.4458 between the March quarter of 2011 and 28th March 2012. The appreciation reflected high agricultural and mineral export receipts, combined with inflows related to the construction phase of the PNG LNG project. The kina appreciated against the Australian dollar by 8.3 percent to A$0.4276 over the same period. The appreciation was attributed to cross currency movements, as the Australian dollar weakened against the US dollar. As a result, the Trade Weighted Index (TWI) appreciated by 12.6 percent during the same period. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) also appreciated by 7.6 percent during the December quarter of 2011 (see Chart 3). The increase in international reserves led to the growth in money supply and liquidity. Annual growth in broad money supply (M3*) and monetary base in 2011 were 17.3 percent and 61.7 percent, respectively. The increase in broad money supply resulted mainly from increases in NFA of the depository corporations, while the substantial growth in monetary base mainly reflected increase in commercial bank deposits at the Central Bank. Lending to the private sector continued to grow moderately as a result of firms utilising own funds while those associated with the PNG LNG project received funding from the project. The Bank issued net new Central Bank Bills (CBBs) totaling K1,102.0 million, to diffuse some of the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  excess liquidity. However, domestic interest rates continued to fall, given the persistent high level of liquidity, with CBB rates at around 2.0 percent and Treasury bill rates at around 3.0 percent. Total liquidity of the banking system further increased by 37.2 percent to K8,888.4 million in 2011, due to high Government expenditure and foreign exchange inflows. Net claims on the Government declined by K846.7 million in 2011, mainly due to increased deposits in the trust accounts. In the first quarter of 2012, the Bank issued additional net CBBs of K92.4 million. Excess liquidity continued to remain high, therefore the Bank increased the CRR by an additional 1.0 percent. In 2012, broad money supply is expected to increase by 14.8 percent, driven mainly by increase in NFA of the banking system. Monetary base and private sector credit are projected to grow by 33.2 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively. The Bank considers the projected growth in monetary aggregates appropriate to support economic growth, but is also mindful of their inflationary impact, for instance if growth in private sector credit picks up (see Appendix-Table 1). Economic activity in PNG as measured by real GDP growth for 2011 is estimated by the Bank to be higher than the 8.9 percent projected in the 2012 National Budget, with increases in all sectors. The annual level of employment in the formal private sector2 increased by 6.2 percent in the December quarter of 2011. The construction of the PNG LNG project, Government-donor funded projects, combined with strong growth in private sector activity contributed to higher employment. Excluding the mineral sector, the annual level of employment also grew by 6.2 percent in the December quarter of 2011. In addition, the total nominal value of sales by the private sector3 remained high, over the twelve months to September 2011. Strong economic growth is expected to continue in 2012, as construction activity for the PNG LNG project reaches its peak, combined with high Government spending, especially related to the national elections and commencement of production by the Ramu Nickel/Cobalt mine. All sectors are expected to grow, led by the mining and quarrying, manufacturing, building and construction, and transportation/storage/communication sectors. The 2012 National Budget was framed against the uncertainty in the global economy and high domestic economic activity. The Government projects a balanced budget of K10.5 billion, with emphasis on increased spending in the priority areas of education, transport, law and order, and health, consistent with the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) and Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP). The Government also projects balanced budgets for 2013 and 2014 of similar magnitude (see Chart 4). Public debt is projected to be 23.2 percent of GDP in 2012, compared to 24.1 percent in the 2011 revised estimates. The lower ratio is mainly due to an increase in GDP. Under the 2011 original budget, K723.2 million was appropriated for specific project trust accounts. This was not fully funded and therefore the 2011 Supplementary Budget allocated a further K648.5 million to be deposited in trust accounts at the Central Bank. However, only K433.0 million has been deposited as at December 2011. Despite the Government’s undertaking to open and transfer trust account funds to the Central Bank, Government deposits including trust accounts in commercial banks continue to remain high totaling K2,884.3 million. Thus, at the Central Bank, the amount of trust account funds decreased from K741.3 million in September 2011 to K366.3 million as at 23rd March 2012 (see Chart 5). Depositing all Government trust account funds at the Central Bank and smooth spending of those funds over time will assist with liquidity management.

Furthermore, the Government should refrain from competing with the PNG LNG project and plan for the utilization of these resources when the construction phase ends. In anticipation of the sizeable revenue inflows from the PNG LNG project and other mineral projects, the Government enacted the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Act in February 2012. The Fund will be managed through the Stabilisation and Development Funds, and is expected to contribute to macroeconomic stability and provide ongoing funding to the Government budget. It will be managed on-shore, with funds invested off-shore and spent on-shore. This will minimise large foreign exchange inflows and reduce upward pressure on the exchange rate, thereby mitigating the effect of Dutch Disease. Until the SWF comes into operation, the Government should deposit revenue inflows from mineral taxes in an offshore account to be managed by the Central Bank. This will also assist the Bank in its liquidity management efforts. In light of these developments, closer coordination and cooperation between the Treasury and Finance Departments and the Bank in the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies is necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability. 1.2  Monetary policy stance The main issue that the Central Bank is confronted with is the increasing level of liquidity in the banking system in recent years, caused by the foreign exchange reserve build-up related largely to dollar-denominated mineral tax earnings, high export earnings, inflows related to the PNG LNG project and other private foreign direct investments. Whilst the high liquidity levels do not appear to influence inflation via the credit channel despite strong economic growth, it is still a threat to price stability and soundness of the financial system. Upside risks to the Bank’s projection of 33.2 percent in monetary base would come from: • faster drawdown of trust accounts from the Central Bank; • higher than budgeted overall expenditure by the Government; • higher transactions demand for money during the national elections; and • continued high inflows of foreign exchange. Some or all of these, if realized, could potentially lead to price instability and adversely affect business confidence. In addition, the upside risks to the Bank’s inflation projection of around 8.0 percent in 2012 include: • significantly higher domestic demand pressures and inflation expectations; • any substantial increase in food and fuel prices; • higher than expected inflation in PNG’s major trading partners; • any supply-side shocks associated with bad weather; and • impact of the European debt crisis and oil export embargo on Iran. As a result of this concern on high level of liquidity and potential impact on price stability, the Central Bank maintained a tight monetary policy stance by leaving the KFR unchanged at 7.75 percent in the December quarter of 2011 and March quarter of 2012 (see Chart 6). To support the tight stance, the CRR was increased from 6.0 percent to 7.0 percent in March 2012. Given the projected strong economic growth and associated demand pressures in 2012, the Bank will continue to assess the trade-off between high economic growth and 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  inflation. The Bank will therefore maintain this policy stance and may adjust it to ensure the high level of liquidity is managed appropriately so that inflation is at an acceptable level. 1.3  Conduct of monetary policy Monetary policy will be conducted within the reserve money framework. The MPS provides the overall monetary policy stance, while the monthly KFR remains the instrument for signaling this stance or any changes through an announcement by the Governor. Following the announcement, Open Market Operations (OMOs) will be conducted to support the Bank’s monetary policy stance. The OMOs involve Repurchase Agreement (Repo) transactions with commercial banks and the auction of CBBs to ODCs and Treasury bills to the general public. The Bank will also consider using its direct policy instrument, the CRR, to assist in liquidity management. In 2012 the Bank plans to introduce the Tap facility for small retail investors to participate in the Government securities market. The Bank will continuously assess developments in the market and use all the instruments at its disposal to ensure that financial stability is maintained and inflation is at an acceptable level.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  G Padmanabhan: India’s regulatory approach to sophisticated financial products Comments by Mr G Padmanabhan, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Award Ceremony of Dufrenoy Prize for Responsible Innovation in Finance, Paris, 18 June 2012. *      *      * Assistance provided by Alpana Killawala and Ms Indira Nanu is gratefully acknowledged. Ladies and gentlemen, C' est en effet un honneur et un privilège d’être ici ce soir, dans une des plus belles villes du monde, d’accepter au nom de l’une des Banques centrales les plus respectées du monde le prix Dufrenoy de l’Innovation décerné pour l’année 2012, à la Reserve Bank of India (pour nos calibrage politique dans le règlement des produits financiers). Je remercie tous ceux qui ont contribué à nous choisir pour cet honneur. Maintenant avant que l’on me décerne le prix pour l’innovation dans la langue française, je voudrais continuer mon discours en anglais. (It is indeed and honour and a privilege to be here this evening, in one of the most beautiful cities in the world and to accept, on behalf of one of the most respected Central Banks in the world, the Dufrenoy Prize for innovation, awarded for the year 2012 to the Reserve Bank of India, for our calibrated approach to the introduction and regulation of financial products. I thank all those who have contributed to conferring this honour on us. And now, before I am awarded the prize for innovations to the French language, let me continue my speech in English.) Let me begin by referring to the citation of the jury who decided on this prestigious Dufrenoy Prize to the RBI. The observations of the honourable jury members about the Indian regulatory approach being precautionary and gradual, with a culture of testing and paying attention to potential negative effects of sophisticated financial products before facilitating them, precisely encapsulates the culture and methodology of the Reserve Bank of India, as it seeks to fulfill its mandate – by juggling the multifarious roles assigned to it – of maintaining stability of both prices and the financial system and supporting economic growth. In all the roles that we play, the common thread that underlies any policy is that it should promote growth. Not just growth, but sustainable growth, which in turn can be brought about only with inclusive growth, benefiting the society at large, but without undermining financial stability. Now, a few words about what RBI does. Apart from the quintessential central banking roles like formulation of monetary policy and printing and distribution of currency, we also manage the external sector, regulate and supervise banks, non-bank finance companies and segments of financial markets (money, forex, government securities). We also regulate the payment and settlement systems. We are banker to banks and to the Government – federal and state governments. We are also the debt manager of the government, managing all their market borrowings, calibrating both the amounts and the timing to ensure that this does not crowd out other players. Added to all this, and perhaps unique to Central Banking anywhere in the world, we are mandated to pay special attention to the agricultural and allied sectors and have created and hived off several institutions for channelizing credit to agriculture, industry, small and medium enterprises, housing, mutual funds, settlement of trades, etc., etc. We also have a key role at very micro levels in the development process. We are currently in the process of ensuring empowerment to a hitherto voiceless segment of society by facilitating their entry into the mainstream of economic activity by trying to bring them into the ambit of formal banking channel (financial inclusion) by customizing certain products and services for them. We are following up this objective by also educating the people (financial literacy) about the benefits of being part of the formal financial sector and the host of facilities 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  and benefits they can demand from it. We are also following up with the Government to include financial literacy in the curriculum of educational institutions so as to equip the young ones with the necessary skills before they enter the real world. Having given you a bird’s eye view of our myriad functions, let me walk you through our policy formulation processes. Before introduction of any new concepts, regulations or financial products, we generally elicit the opinions of various segments, i.e., stake holders, academicians, financial institutions, researchers, and laymen. We do this by placing a discussion paper on our website and the paper is converted into policy only after factoring in the various inputs so received. This serves the dual purpose of (i) preparing the market for the new product/dispensation and (ii) negating to a large extent the unexpected consequences that a possibly one sided regulation could have brought about. Since we have been awarded the prize for the gradual introduction of new financial products into the markets, let me illustrate with an example on the guided, gradual, sequenced and calibrated development and integration of markets in India, one of which, namely, the forex market, Mrs. Gopinath and I have been privileged to witness almost since the very beginnings. Forex markets started in India with the banks being required to maintain square or near square open exchange position and the central bank announcing the buying and selling rates. Today the country can boast of a market with a daily turnover of USD 60 Billion, with most of the products and their variants being traded and a Central Counter Party (CCP) arrangement for settling inter-bank forex transactions. Even today, corporates are allowed to access the market only to hedge an underlying exposure and not to take any punts on the currency. They are still not allowed to write options and thereby take on open ended risks. In recent times, the same thumb rule has been followed even while enabling Credit Default Swaps (CDS) contracts. In other words, little skeptical of the globally accepted, almost axiomatic belief in the self correcting mechanism of markets, but also conscious that too much regulation could throttle, we have put in place certain safeguards, which while allowing normal free play would guard against the ability of individual market makers to move markets in directions beneficial to them but detrimental to the stability of the system. We, therefore, prescribed limits on positions and leveraging keeping in view the interconnectedness of institutions in the financial system. The recent global meltdown occasioned precisely on account of these factors of excessive leverage coupled with lack of regulation have vindicated our stand that no systems that undermine the real economy should be allowed unbridled freedom as any ravages to the real economy take years to repair. At the same time, recognizing that well developed, efficient markets are a prerequisite for price discovery and critical from a Central Bank perspective for the efficient transmission of monetary policy impulses, the RBI has been playing a proactive role in developing the financial markets in a manner so as to ensure that they are in sync with the real economy. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to develop infrastructure, technology and capabilities of market participants, while evaluating their ability to absorb shocks, and insisting on their putting in place robust risk management systems, since we are conscious that our overarching objective is the maintenance of financial stability. But should all this mean a total change in approach to financial innovation? At the International Research Conference hosted by us, Mr John Lipsky of the IMF while focussing on the importance of finance for rapid and sustainable growth, observed, and I quote, “While some might consider this topic odd in light of the current crisis, I will seek to draw out some key lessons of recent events for the appropriate policy stance toward financial innovation. Many critics...have concluded that such innovation is to be actively discouraged. But I would claim that this is precisely the wrong lesson to draw. Despite the unsettling and even dramatic recent global experience with “cutting edge” finance, I believe that without a renewed effort to foster financial innovation in the global economy, all countries – including emerging market economies – will underperform their potential. The principal challenge for policymakers, then, is to strike an appropriate balance between financial openness that supports growth – enhancing innovation while at the same time implementing regulations 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and effective supervision that limit the potential risk of financial instability...” The recently published report by the World Economic Forum titled “Rethinking Financial Innovation” (2012) concludes, “Successful innovation in financial services can improve capital productivity with beneficial effects that permeate through the wider economy. Unsuccessful innovation can have the opposite effect. It is important, therefore, to face up to the challenge effectively...” The report advocates that effective risk management systems need to be put in place and goes on to argue that “aside from explicit risk-management frameworks, governance mechanisms (should) also include new product development and approval processes employing various safeguards against unwise innovation…and an extensive regulatory infrastructure”. This is a daunting challenge and has indeed been challenged, but the Indian regulatory approach to financial innovation has always endeavoured to be on these lines. In concluding, I would once again like to convey gratitude of the Reserve Bank of India to Ecole des Mines de Paris for recognizing and appreciating us for the very reason we were criticized not so long ago. It is indeed an honor and we are here to accept the award with all humility and are deeply conscious of the fact that we have miles to go yet. I would also like to thank all those who are present here today to witness this award ceremony. Merci beaucoup and a bientôt. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Øystein Olsen: Promoting high-quality research in financial economics Closing remarks by Mr Øystein Olsen, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Norwegian Finance Initiative (NFI) conference 2012, Oslo, 20 June 2012. *      *      * In 2011 Norges Bank established the Norwegian Finance Initiative – NFI. Through the NFI we aim to promote excellence. Excellence in research, in curiosity and in criticism. One objective of NFI is to contribute to a qualified debate in Norway on the fund, its strategy and its management. Top-quality research at academic institutions in Norway is a necessary condition for this. The fundamental idea of the NFI is to provide incentive programs that will lead to long-run structural improvements in research and teaching in financial economics. Over the past year, we have introduced seven programs, directed at both students and faculty of financial economics at academic institutions in Norway. One important program involves co-sponsoring positions and hiring of outstanding academics. In this way the Norwegian Finance Initiative can help academic institutions in Norway build the infrastructure needed to sustain a lively research culture. Another NFI program is the publication bonus. The publication bonus has been established by the Norwegian Finance Initiative to provide incentives for existing faculty to go the extra mile to produce high-quality, high-impact research. The program also signals to young scholars the value their institutions place on this level of achievement. As scholars in Norway begin to respond to these incentives, they in turn will help to set expectations for their peers and students, leading to a virtuous cycle. Today, I am very proud to announce the first of two such bonuses for articles that have been accepted for publication in the best journals after this NFI program was established. The first is for Øyvind Norli, professor at the Norwegian Business School – BI. In 2007, Norli authored a much cited paper: “Sports Sentiment and Stock Returns”, published in the Journal of Finance. Here, Norli documents the effect of mood swings: Stock markets tend to take a serious hit the day after losing what is perceived as an important football match. Interesting as that is, this is not why we have decided to pay him this bonus now. Recently, the Journal of Financial Economics accepted another of his papers: “Geographic Dispersion and Stock Returns”. Norli and his co-author Diego García show that companies which are truly local outperform more geographically dispersed companies by eight percentage points a year – a remarkable effect. The other winner I am equally happy to announce is Richard Priestley, also professor at BI. Priestley has published several papers on exchange rate regimes, many on the relationship between the establishment of the euro and equity pricing across the region. The scope of his bonus-winning paper is even more global. It is titled “The World Business Cycle and Expected Returns”, which has been accepted for publication in the premier European finance journal: the Review of Finance. In this paper, Priestley and co-author Ilan Cooper use a novel and interesting measure of the business variable, namely the ratio of capital to output. This ratio is a good predictor of return on financial indices, both equity and bond returns and credit spreads, across time and across markets. The paper by Cooper and Priestley demonstrate neatly a central element of modern financial economics: expected returns on financial securities vary over time, and tend to move with the business cycle. This fact is highly relevant for a long-term investor such as the fund, and is one of this conference’s central topics. Since its inception in 1998, the mandate of the fund has prescribed a strategic fixed equity share; at 40 percent in the initial years, increased to 60 percent some years ago. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches A fixed share may sound trivial. It is not. The average portfolio of all investors cannot be rebalanced. As the risk premium varies over time, equity values swing. Equities are more volatile than bonds, and the equity share of the combined market portfolio of bonds and equities fluctuates substantially. Rebalancing as we do implies taking on more risk just when risk is already perceived to be high. When the value of equities fall more than that of bonds, rebalancing means that we would sell bonds and buy equities. To develop a robust rebalancing strategy, we must understand why there are other, also highly competitive investors, who take the other side of these trades. We also need to understand our own edge, the comparative advantage – or disadvantage – of the size, time horizon, and governance structure of the fund. These issues are all intimately linked to questions on the research frontier of financial economics. So far, the rebalancing strategy has served the fund well. From 1998 to 2011, around 0.5 percentage point – a considerable portion – of the total annual return can be attributed to rebalancing. We believe rebalancing will also be important going forward, but we need to further deepen our understanding of time-varying expected returns and risks. The other main topic of today’s conference – well-functioning markets – is also of particular interest to us. Without well-functioning markets, the massive reallocation of wealth from oil in the ground to a claim on a small share of future global output would not have been feasible. Well-functioning financial markets are also, through the allocation of real resources, important for sustained growth at a global level. The financial crisis displayed great challenges related to how the markets function. We saw mispricing of risk, and the difficulties of managing financial imbalances. Other problems were related to liquidity. Trading of fixed income instruments take place at the desks of the large investment banks. The problems of these banks in September 2008 implied a literally closing of the main fixed income markets. The financial crisis and subsequent great recession have dramatically increased interest among academics in research of asset pricing with frictions. Questions of regulation, segmented markets, liquidity and principal/agent problems represent central issues for a fund manager, and at the same time topics on the forefront of academic debate. We need to understand how these issues affect our investment possibilities, given the fund’s strategy and characteristics. I have pointed to some of the links between the management of the fund and the two main areas discussed in this conference – time-varying risk premiums and well functioning markets. The questions on the forefront of academic debate – and their potential answers – are not just of theoretical interest, but of immediate practical relevance to us. The fund will be a significant contributor to Norwegian government budgets for decades, maybe centuries to come. The strategy of the fund will need continuous development. We hope our annual research conferences will provide valuable inputs to this process. I would like to thank the organizers for making this conference possible, and not least, the speakers for their very valuable contributions. Also, thanks to all the participants – I hope to see you again for the conference next year! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Sayuri Shirai: Europe’s economic and financial developments and monetary policy in Japan Speech by Ms Sayuri Shirai, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the 77th meeting of the Society for the Economic Studies of Securities, Tokyo, 9 June 2012. *      *      * I. Introduction Good afternoon, members of the Society for the Economic Studies of Securities. My name is Sayuri Shirai, and I am a Policy Board member of the Bank of Japan. It is indeed a great honor and a pleasure for me to give a talk at this esteemed society. Today, I would like to focus on Europe, which is the common theme of today’s meeting, with the greater emphasis being on the euro area, where developments have shown considerable uncertainty over recent months. First, let me briefly outline the content of this presentation, which will consist of four parts. I would like to begin by describing recent changes seen in the euro area. Next, I will summarize my view on the fundamental issues facing the euro area. Following that, I will review the region-wide responses to the European sovereign debt crisis. In the final part, I would like to summarize recent economic and price developments in Japan, the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on the Japanese economy, and Japan’s monetary policy and related developments.1 I very much look forward to a lively discussion with you after my talk. II. Changes in the political situation and greater emphasis on growth – two recent transformations in the Euro Area As we are all aware, global financial markets have been nervous in recent months following a period of some easing of strains in the first quarter of 2012. I believe that two important changes have been associated with the recent enhanced sensitivity of global financial markets: one is changes in the political situation; the other is growing focus on growth, the interpretation of which appears to be somewhat different from what it was in the past.  Recent changes in the political situation With regard to political changes, I view the first event in the euro area as having been the collapse of the coalition government in the Netherlands on April 23, 2012. This occurred as a result of disagreement over budget cuts. That dispute emerged because then-Prime Minister Mark Rutte had stressed the need for additional budget cuts in order to meet the 3-percent fiscal deficit target – the common target set by the EU – by 2013. However, his minority coalition partner, the Freedom Party, rejected the proposal and demanded that the target year be postponed. As you are aware, the Netherlands is one of the “core” countries of the EU,2 which are known for having achieved favorable macroeconomic performance over a long period. Prior to the global financial crisis of 2008–09, the fiscal balance of the Netherlands had recorded a surplus, and the ratio of sovereign debt to GDP had remained below the EU’s 60-percent threshold. Since the crisis, the fiscal balance has shifted to a deficit, with a peak of 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009; however, the Netherlands managed to                                                  1 The data used in this speech cover the period up to June 6, 2012. 2 Here, I refer to Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Finland as the core countries. All these countries enjoy current account surpluses and a very high-grade credit rating on their sovereign bonds. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches reduce that to 4.6 percent by 2011. Owing to the continued fiscal deficit, the sovereign debt to GDP ratio has risen to 65.2 percent, though this is well below the euro-area average of 88 percent. Moreover, the Netherlands is, like Japan, a net external creditor nation, thanks to its accumulated current account surpluses – a phenomenon that is in contrast with the “peripheral” countries of the EU. The unemployment rate in the Netherlands is also low at around 5 percent. Therefore, I was genuinely surprised by the news about the political turmoil. This event reminded me that fiscal austerity measures are painful even for the core countries, and the Dutch public felt frustrated about the recession that had continued over three consecutive quarters from July to September 2011 and the resultant rising unemployment rate. On April 26, nonetheless, the Dutch government managed to produce an agreement with some opposition parties on austerity measures worth around €12.4 billion in 2013 to meet the 3-percent target; however, the Dutch general election is scheduled to take place in September.  The next regime change took place in France – the second-largest economy in the euro area – and that event surprised the world. The first round of voting in the presidential election was held on April 22, 2012, in which Mr. François Hollande, the candidate for the Socialist Party, took a lead over Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, the incumbent president and candidate for the Union for a Popular Movement. During the election campaign, Mr. Hollande promised to renegotiate the terms of the EU Fiscal Compact, which was signed by 25 of the 27 EU member countries in March 2012.3 Like Mr. Sarkozy, he is also committed to meeting the 3-percent fiscal deficit target in 2013 and subsequently balancing the budget by 2017. Mr. Hollande’s plan was to achieve this by, for example, imposing a tax on financial transactions, introducing a 75-percent income tax on earnings above €1 million euros, and raising the corporate tax on the biggest companies to 35 percent, while reducing taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and scrapping a value-added tax (VAT) increase proposed by Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Hollande has also promised to expand public spending by such efforts as raising state spending, reducing the retirement age to 60 years for those having worked more than 41.5 years, hiring 150,000 youths in state-subsidized jobs, and hiring more teachers and police officers. In the second round of presidential voting held on May 6, Mr. Hollande won the first vote and became the country’s first socialist president in 17 years. The market now appears to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude before it judges the credibility of his fiscal consolidation plan as well as the fate of the Fiscal Compact. The biggest political change occurred in Greece after the general election held on May 6, 2012, in which the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and New Democracy (ND) – who had joined in a grand coalition in November 2011 headed by Mr. Lucas Papademos, the former European Central Bank (ECB) vice-president – lost by wide margins. Since no political party won an absolute majority of seats, President Karolos Papoulias attempted to offer successive exploratory mandates to the leaders of the three main parties in accordance with the constitution. However, each party ended up failing to form a government and returning their mandates to the president. After the president had failed in his final attempt to form a government after meeting all party leaders, it was decided that Mr. Panagiotis Pikrammenos, head of the Council of State, would become the leader of a caretaker administration until a new election could take place on June 17. The result of the Greek election intensified the nervousness of markets amid fears that a new government other than                                                  3 The Fiscal Compact is an intergovernmental treaty signed by all the EU members except the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom on March 2, 2012. The compact is expected to go into force on January 1, 2013 if 12 members of the euro area ratify it by that time. According to the compact, the structural fiscal deficit must not exceed 0.5 percent of GDP, and this fiscal rule has to be specified in each country’s national legal system at least at the statutory level, although some deviation may be permitted under exceptional circumstance. The rule contains an automatic correction mechanism in the event of deviation, with a possible penalty equivalent of up to 0.1 percent of GDP. According to the enhanced Stability and Growth Pact, moreover, countries whose sovereign debt exceeds the 60-percent threshold level should reduce it at an average rate of 1/20 per year as a benchmark. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 PASOK and/or ND could reject the fiscal consolidation and economic reform programs already agreed with the troika – the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the ECB. Greece would thus fail to receive its scheduled financial support, thereby leading to the collapse of the government administration and a possible exit from the euro area.  Increasing attention on growth Against the background of these political changes, I noticed that a second type of change has occurred in recent months: a number of key policy players have begun to actively use the key word “growth,” though in a different context from how it was used in the past. For example, ECB President Mario Draghi stressed the need of a Growth Compact in addition to the already-agreed Fiscal Compact on April 25, 2012. On May 3, he subsequently elaborated the idea of a Growth Compact by proposing the following: (1) an increase in the involvement of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a redirection of EU structural funds toward the low-income areas; and (2) prioritizing an expenditure cut (especially a cut in current, rather than investment, expenditure) over a tax increase.4 On May 5, European economics commissioner Olli Rehn made remarks somewhat similar to those of Mr. Draghi and stated that the EU needs to increase public investment to promote growth and jobs in the region. Mr. Rehn said it should do so by creating project bonds for infrastructure development (as proposed by the European Commission in October 2011), increasing the lending capacity of the EIB, and improving accessibility of EU structural funds for guaranteeing lending to SMEs. Mr. Rehn also stressed that, based on economic analysis, the Stability and Growth Pact contains considerable scope for judgment regarding public deficit and debt and also that its legal provisions applied to excessive deficit procedure; he encouraged countries with fiscal surpluses to boost public spending. On May 8, European Commission President Barroso announced a plan to expand infrastructure investment in the EU by, for example, issuing project bonds by June 2012. Regarding the feasibility of a renegotiation of the Fiscal Compact, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup, has taken a balanced position between the demand by Mr. Hollande to renegotiate the compact and resistance to this by Ms. Angela Merkel. On May 7, Mr. Juncker declared that it would not be possible to renegotiate the Fiscal Compact, although it would be possible to add growth elements, but not necessarily in the form of a treaty. Reflecting these new moves, EU President Herman Van Rompuy called for an informal European Council (EU summit) to be held on May 23 to discuss the balance between growth and fiscal austerity measures. EU’s approach to growth thus far The question emerges as to why the growth agenda has now suddenly become a focus of attention. Does it mean that previously the EU had barely paid attention to the issue? It is clear that the EU has been tackling the issue of promoting growth together with fiscal consolidation over the past few years. As you may recall, for example, the European Council in June 2010 adopted the growth strategy called “Europe 2020,” whereby each member country had to undertake structural reforms toward strong, sustainable recovery. The strategy also targeted EU needs to better focus on boosting Europe’s competitiveness, productivity, growth potential, and economic convergence to deliver more growth and jobs.                                                  4 This approach over fiscal consolidation has gained some support in recent years. For example, World Economic Outlook compiled by the IMF (2010) stresses that fiscal contraction that relies on spending cuts tends to have smaller contractionary effects than tax-based adjustments. This is partly because central banks usually provide substantially greater stimulus following a spending-based contraction than after a tax-based contraction. Monetary stimulus is particularly weak following indirect tax hikes (such as VAT), which raise prices. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Accordingly, five headline targets were agreed to as common objectives for guiding the action of member countries.5  In line with this approach, the EU introduced a so-called “European Semester” in 2011, whereby each member country submitted a medium-term budgetary strategy and a National Reform Program to the European Commission for assessment. The commission then published a country-specific report on detailed policy recommendations, covering fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Moreover, the EU introduced the “Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP)” in December 2011, which, as the name suggests, is a surveillance mechanism that aims to prevent and correct macroeconomic imbalances within the EU. This alert system uses a “scoreboard” of 10 indicators as well as detailed country studies. Each indicator is given a threshold, so a large divergence in each country’s performance from the threshold functions as a warning signal.6 As in the original “Excessive Deficit Procedure,” which was applied to the size of fiscal deficits, strict rules come into effect in the event of a large divergence in the form of a new “Excessive Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (EIP)”; this carries a possible financial penalty of up to 0.1 percent of GDP for euro-area member countries. The decision-making process in the new regulations will employ reverse qualified majority voting to make all the appropriate relevant judgments before a penalty is introduced. This semi-automatic procedure makes it difficult for member countries to form a blocking majority.  In February 2012, the European Commission disclosed the first Alert Mechanism Report. Of the 27 EU member countries, those that are already under enhanced economic surveillance – Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Romania – were exempted from examination under the macroeconomic imbalances. The report indicated that 12 countries – Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Hungary, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom – bore some potential risk related to macroeconomic imbalances and thus warranted further detailed analysis.7 According to the report, Spain, for example, will take time to correct its external and internal imbalances despite the efforts being made to rectify its imbalances owing to the sheer size of the internal and external debt. It has also been pointed out that a fall in employment linked to downsizing in the construction sector and the economic recession has been aggravated by a sluggish adjustment of wages. At the end of May 2012, the commission confirmed that the 12 countries need to correct the large macroeconomic imbalances and that the adjustment process should be closely monitored.                                                   5 The five targets were as follows: (1) an increase of the employment rate for women and men aged 20–64 to 75 percent; (2) achieving combined public and private R&D investment levels to 3 percent of GDP; (3) reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared with 1990 levels; (4) reducing school drop-out rates to 10 percent and increasing the proportion of the population aged 30–34 having completed tertiary or equivalent education to 40 percent; and (5) promoting social inclusion, particularly by reducing poverty and aiming to lift at least 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion. 6 The 10 indicators are divided into two areas: external imbalances and competitiveness, and internal imbalances. The external imbalances and competitiveness comprise the following: (1) three-year average of current account balance as a percent of GDP (with an indicative threshold of between plus 6 percent and minus 4 percent); (2) net international investment position as a percent of GDP (minus 35-percent lower quartile); (3) three-year percentage change in real effective exchange rate (between plus and minus 5 percent); (4) five-year percentage change in export market shares (minus 6-percent lower quartile); and (5) three-year percentage change in export market shares. The internal imbalances comprise the following: (6) year-on-year change in deflated house prices (plus 6-percent upper quartile); (7) private sector credit flow as a percent of GDP (plus 15-percent upper quartile); (8) private-sector debt as a percent of GDP (160-percent upper quartile); (9) general government debt as a percent of GDP (60 percent); and (10) three-year average of the unemployment rate (10 percent). 7 The report concludes that the following countries do not require a further detailed review: the Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, and Slovakia. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Background to the refocus on growth Thus, it could be said that greater efforts have been made over recent years at the EU level to boost growth and competitiveness. Why, then, has the question of growth been discussed so intensively over recent months? In general, boosting growth requires the implementation of various structural reforms (Chart 1). And some peripheral countries have only just launched some needed structural reforms and are thus far from being in a position of completing them. The answer to this question may be associated with public anxiety because some reforms may be accompanied by social transformation and short-term economic suffering, such as wage restraints, job losses, and profit losses in protected sectors. Moreover, the public may become frustrated by fiscal austerity measures that end up squeezing domestic absorption and promoting deleveraging of the banking sector in the short term; this is because it takes time to realize long-term gains, such as an improvement in credibility and a cut in long-term interest rates. Furthermore, sluggish growth in the rest of the world has not generated sufficient external demand for the euro area that could offset the shrinkage in domestic demand driven by the collective acts of fiscal consolidation. In addition, it is important to recognize that the context of growth has shifted from improving competitiveness, which could be achieved in the medium to long term, to moderating short-term pains caused by austerity measures implemented during the economic recession. Various interpretations related to growth Despite the above reasoning, it is my impression that the word “growth” is interpreted differently from the way it was in the past and by the people employing the term. It appears that there are at least three types of interpretation.8 According to the first interpretation, the EU should expand its region-wide infrastructure investment by issuing project bonds and more actively utilizing EIB and EU structural funds to mitigate the adverse impact of fiscal austerity measures adopted by a number of member countries. The second interpretation holds that the current fiscal consolidation schedule could be slowed down – for example, by extending the target year for fulfilling the 3-percent fiscal deficit goal if the situation allows it.9 With this interpretation, the better mix of revenue-generating and expenditure-reducing measures is also stressed. According to the third interpretation, structural reforms should be prioritized so as to effect an immediate positive impact on growth and employment. This latter option may help reduce the sense of exhaustion with austerity programs that some countries have experienced. However, I believe that these interpretations do not rule out the structural reforms needed for boosting growth in each country. Some action has recently been associated with the first interpretation. On May 23, the informal European Council agreed that the board of the EIB would be invited to consider an increase of its capital by June for financing projects across the EU. The previous day, political agreement was also reached by the Council of the EU, European Commission, and Parliament with regard to the pilot phase of the project bonds. Based on the guarantee of €230 million from the EU budget, project bonds could possibly finance up to €4.6 billion of key infrastructure projects in the areas of transport, energy, and                                                  8 Other proposals include Eurobonds, which would be issued jointly by euro area member countries by pooling their debt. This idea was rejected by Ms. Merkel in 2011, but it was brought up again by Mr. Hollande at the European Council on May 23, 2012. While Eurobonds could be a long-term strategy for integration, Ms. Merkel stressed that they would reduce incentives for countries to contain their fiscal deficits. Recently, the European Commission addressed an idea of a banking union, with integrated financial supervision and a single deposit guarantee scheme. The idea of a uniform deposit guarantee scheme was proposed and rejected by member countries a few years ago. It would appear to require quite some time before this proposal can be agreed upon. 9 On May 2012, the European Commission suggested, for example, that Spain, France, the Netherlands (the impact of an additional deficit cut agreed at the end of April was not taken into account), Slovenia, and Slovakia might not meet the 3-percent fiscal deficit target unless additional measures were undertaken. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches communications.10 The second interpretation, or a moderation of the fiscal consolidation schedule, might be feasible if a country could present a credible medium-term plan. But this may not be possible for some peripheral countries owing to a lack of market confidence. On this issue, the European Commission made an initial move with Spain by suggesting a possible extension of one year on the schedule for meeting the 3-percent fiscal deficit target to 2014 – on condition of improved expenditure control over local governments and the submission of a credible two-year budget plan for 2013–14. III. Three fundamental issues related to the Euro Area So far, I have discussed recent changes in the political situation and the increased focus on growth in the euro area. My observation is that those changes reflect deeper fundamental issues pertaining to the region: (1) issues arising from accumulated current account imbalances; (2) issues related to the savings-investment gaps that constitute the current account imbalances; and (3) issues arising from accumulated fiscal imbalances. These issues are of course interconnected, but the distinction may assist in understanding the fundamental problems that the region faces. Accumulated current account imbalances Regarding the first fundamental issue, the current account imbalances have expanded in the euro area since the adoption of the euro (Chart 2). Thanks to an elimination of exchange-rate risk and a decline in inflation differentials, peripheral countries – such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain – gained access to considerable financial resources from the region at substantially lower interest rates than before. In real terms, their interest rates were lower than those of the core countries. Cheap external finance enabled the peripheral countries to swell their net external debt (Chart 3).11 Major financiers to the peripheral countries were largely concentrated in the core countries (with current account surpluses) and France. Since capital inflows to the peripheral countries mostly took the form of bank loans and bond issues, the growing net external debt made those countries more prone to changes in investor sentiment. In retrospect, if those countries had allocated the external financial resources toward more productive investment and investment leading to a shift to higher-value-added economic structure, they could have improved their economic productivity and enhanced international competitiveness. Subsequently, this would have enabled those countries to repay their external debt by gradually shifting to current account surpluses.  Instead, the capital inflows largely financed domestic consumption and the real estate and construction sectors (although this comment does not necessarily fully apply in the case of Ireland, where a number of high-technology multinational firms have been operating). Thus, the foreign borrowing did not promote sustainable economic growth or contain external debt growth (Chart 2). To reduce net external debt, it is necessary to achieve a current account surplus. At this stage, only Ireland, whose current account deficit was initially small, has succeeded in achieving a current account surplus. It is fair to say that the other countries have made efforts to reduce their current account deficits – at the scale of around 5 percentage points or more of GDP in the case of Greece and Spain and 4 percentage points in Portugal during the period of 2007–11. Nonetheless, it will be some time before these three countries could achieve current account surpluses, and so their net external debt                                                  10 The EIB will manage the project. If the EIB could guarantee the project bonds, more bonds could be issued on the market. Private sector participation would also be expected. 11 Italy is not included in this analysis, because its current account to GDP ratio is small and its net external debt to GDP remains below the indicative threshold of 35 percent specified under the macroeconomic imbalance procedure. Its primary fiscal balance is in surplus, although its government debt to GDP ratio is large. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 is unlikely to decline soon. In other words, the external imbalance on a stock (debt) basis will remain for the time being. Meanwhile, among the core countries, Finland reduced its current account surplus to GDP ratio by 5 percentage points over the same period, though Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands barely reduced their current account surpluses. In particular, the current account surplus to GDP ratio remains high in Austria (around 2 percent), Germany (around 5 percent), and the Netherlands (over 7.5 percent). This enables these core countries to further accumulate their net external assets. In other words, the surplus countries have continued to accumulate net external assets, and the deficit countries net external debt – despite some emerging improvements over the current account imbalances in the euro area (Chart 3). I believe that this partly explains why the debtor peripheral countries currently find it difficult to resume adequate private-sector-based capital inflows despite their adjustment efforts.  Growing savings-investment gaps With respect to the second issue listed above – savings-investment gaps – the savings–GDP ratio (hereafter, saving rate) showed a declining trend in the four peripheral countries before the global financial crisis. The scale of the decrease was greatest in Greece followed by Portugal (Chart 4). It could be said that Greece and Portugal allocated a large part of their capital inflows to both private and public consumption (such as public pay, pensions, and medical care). Owing to the tendency for Germany to increase the saving rate, the current account imbalances between Greece and Portugal, on the one hand, and Germany, on the other, could be explained primarily by the difference in saving-rate patterns. However, the saving rates of Ireland and Spain were not very different from that of Germany: Ireland and Spain increased the investment-GDP ratios (hereafter, investment rates), while that of Germany remained at a low level. Thus, the current account imbalances between Ireland and Spain, on the one hand, and Germany on the other, could be attributed largely to the difference in investment patterns (Chart 5). An increase in the two countries’ investment rates reflected a boom in real estate and construction investment. It is a well-known fact that those two countries underwent rapid real estate price appreciation prior to the global financial crisis.  Since the global financial crisis erupted, all four peripheral countries have faced a decline in their saving rates. This implies that the improvement in the current account balances, as indicated earlier, arose solely through a sharp decrease in the investment rates. This was particularly the case in Ireland, where the drop in real estate prices was more drastic than in Spain and which experienced the sharpest decline in the investment rate. However, the decline in the investment rates for the other three countries has also been great. Given that the four peripheral countries have suffered from a substantial fall in investment, it is understandable that the idea of expanding EU-wide infrastructure-investment projects to offset the adverse impact of austerity measures has been widely stressed recently, as noted earlier. Growing fiscal imbalances On the third fundamental issue listed above – that related to accumulated fiscal imbalances – Greece was the only country where the size of the fiscal deficit was large and whose general government debt as a share of GDP exceeded 100 percent even before the global financial crisis (Charts 6, 7). In Ireland and Spain, the ratio of general government debt to GDP remained below the 60-percent target thanks to their accumulated fiscal surpluses. Portugal had been poised to bring its fiscal deficit–GDP ratio down toward the 3-percent target prior to the global financial crisis, and so its general government debt–GDP ratio remained at around 70 percent.  Since the global financial crisis, the fiscal balances of most euro-area countries have deteriorated because of the implementation of fiscal-stimulus policies and measures to bail 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches out the banking sector. The size of deterioration of the fiscal balance between 2007 and 2011 reached minus 2.6 percentage points in Greece, minus 13.2 percentage points in Ireland, minus 1.1 percentage points in Portugal, and minus 10.4 percentage points in Spain. By contrast, the deterioration in Germany’s fiscal deficit–GDP ratio was a mere 1.2 percentage points over the same period, which contributed to the widening gap in fiscal balances in the euro area. Moreover, Germany’s fiscal deficit–GDP ratio is already below the 3-percent target and, according to the European Commission, the ratio is projected to drop to around 1 percent in 2012 and reach a balance by 2013. Germany achieved more than 3 percent economic growth for 2010–11, and its unemployment rate dropped to a historical low of 5.6 percent. These favorable outcomes have helped Germany conduct fiscal consolidation without having to introduce drastic measures to cut its fiscal deficit. Meanwhile, the peripheral countries are obliged to contain their fiscal deficits further to prevent overall government debt from swelling. Since Germany faces a decline in the ratio of general government debt to GDP in the near future, this means that the internal imbalances on a stock (debt) basis are likely to expand in the region. IV. Assistance at the EU or Euro-Area level Given this background, the peripheral countries, rather than the core countries, are expected to make greater economic adjustments, such as fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Some of these reforms will take time and cause hardship before they bear fruit. To mitigate the adverse impact of the adjustments, financial assistance at the EU or euro-area level is necessary. This is especially true for the peripheral countries because of their lack of private-sector capital flows. Without regional or international financial support, such countries would have been forced to squeeze domestic absorption so drastically that the public would have had to go through intolerable suffering – notwithstanding that a correction could have been made more rapidly for both the internal and external imbalances.  First recipient of international financial assistance – Greece As is well known, Greece was the first country in the euro area to receive international financial assistance. The total amount was set at €110 billion in the first round of assistance, which was agreed to be shared between the euro-area member countries (€80 billion) and the IMF (€30 billion). Since the general government debt for Greece had been growing rapidly, the idea of private-sector involvement (PSI) gained favor in the euro area. After negotiations, a large number of private sector creditors finally agreed to voluntarily accept restructuring of the Greek debt. This PSI took place before the completion of the first round of financial assistance scheduled for Greece and was regarded as a precondition for the second round of financial assistance.12 The total amount for the second round of assistance was set at €172.7 billion, including undisbursed amounts from the first program. The cost was agreed to be borne by the euro area (€144.7 billion) mainly through the platform of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the IMF (€28 billion). The contribution from the euro area included the amount related to the PSI incentive and bank recapitalization.  Newly established financial support system in the Euro Area  It will be recalled that the Greek sovereign debt crisis had a contagious effect on other peripheral countries such as Ireland and Portugal. As a result of the contagion, these countries found it difficult to raise funds in the market and thus asked the EU, the euro area,                                                  12 The PSI ended up covering €205.6 billion, including both Greek and foreign law sovereign bonds, and the rate of participation reached 97 percent as of the end of April 2012 as a result of applying collective action procedures to the Greek law bonds. With the PSI and additional international financial assistance, Greece’s general government debt ratio is expected to decline to below 120 percent of GDP by 2020. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 and the IMF for financial support – in November 2010 in the case of Ireland and in May 2011 in the case of Portugal.13 The EFSF was established by the euro area following the decisions made in May 2010, and it began operations in August 2010. It is backed by guarantee commitments of €780 billion from the member countries and has a lending capacity of €440 billion. In November 2011, furthermore, it was agreed to increase the EFSF’s power by (1) providing partial protection certificates to a sovereign bond issued by member countries, and (2) creating a coinvestment fund to purchase sovereign bonds in primary and secondary markets.  To prevent contagion of the sovereign debt crisis to other larger member countries, the euro area decided to create a permanent crisis mechanism called the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The ESM, which will become operational in July 2012, will take over all the features of the EFSF and have a maximum lending capacity of €500 billion, based on the paid-up capital of €80 billion. Both the EFSF and ESM will coexist until the EFSF expires in mid-2012. The new treaty to create the ESM was signed in February 2012. The decisions to grant stability support are generally taken by mutual agreement, but in the case of urgency they could be decided by a qualified majority of 85 percent of the votes cast. In addition, the IMF has made efforts to raise funds globally in an effort to establish sufficient power to be able to deal with a potentially contagious crisis arising from Europe. At the G20 summit of April 2012, the IMF announced that it had raised more than $430 billion, including contributions from the euro area ($200 billion) and Japan ($60 billion). Although not all of the IMF funds will be available to Europe, it certainly reduces uncertainty related to the issue of how to handle larger countries, such as Italy and Spain, in the case of contagion.  ECB monetary policy as a crisis response  In response to the recent sovereign debt crisis, the ECB has adopted a series of measures since the middle of 2011. After having raised its policy rate or the interest rate on the main refinancing operations from 1 percent to 1.5 percent by raising 25 basis points each in April and July 2011, the ECB reduced the rate back to 1 percent by cutting 25 basis points each in November and December. Other recent measures included US dollar liquidity-providing operations, a cut in the reserve ratio, a modification of collateral requirements, fixed-rate longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) with full allotment, a securities market program, and a covered-bond purchase program.  Among these measures, two notably appear to have contributed substantially to the stabilization of global financial markets: (1) the US dollar liquidity-providing operations, and (2) the LTROs with a maturity of 36 months. The ECB has been conducting US dollar liquidity-providing operations as part of coordinated actions with five other central banks to address pressures in the global money markets: namely, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank (Chart 8). The new action emerged in November 2011 as a response to the growing strains in US dollar financial markets. These central banks agreed to lower the pricing on the existing temporary US dollar liquidity swap arrangements by 50 basis points so that the new rate would be the US dollar Overnight Index Swap rate plus 50 basis points. At the same time, it was agreed that these swap arrangements would be extended to February 1, 2013. As a contingency measure, these central banks agreed to establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements so that liquidity could be provided in each jurisdiction in any of their                                                  13 The amount of financial assistance for Ireland amounted to €67.5 billion, which was received from the EFSF (€17.7 billion), European Financial Stabilization Mechanism (EFSM; €22.5 billion), and IMF (€22.5 billion), and included bilateral assistance from the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden (€4.8 billion). The assistance for Portugal amounted to €78 billion, from the EFSF (€26 billion), ESM (€26 billion), and IMF (€26 billion). The EFSM is a financing facility for EU member countries with a lending capacity up to €60 billion based on borrowing on the market by the European Commission. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches currencies if necessitated by market conditions. In particular, the cut in the interest rate on the US dollar liquidity-providing operations succeeded in substantially lowering the cost of swapping euros for US dollars (Chart 9). Furthermore, the decline in the US dollar funding cost encouraged many European banks having difficulty in raising funds from the market to borrow directly from the ECB, thereby preventing forced fire sales of assets and a cut in loans denominated in the US dollar.  The second measure contributing to the stabilization of the financial market was the LTROs with a maturity of 36 months, which were conducted on December 21, 2011 and February 28, 2012. On December 8, 2011, the ECB decided to reduce the reserve ratio and modify collateral requirements together with an announcement of the three-year LTROs. The reserve ratio was reduced from 2 to 1 percent as of the reserve maintenance period, starting on January 18, 2012. To increase collateral availability, the ECB decided to reduce the credit-rating threshold for certain asset-backed securities and, as a temporary solution, allow national central banks to accept as collateral additional performing credit claims (i.e., bank loans) that satisfied specific eligibility criteria. In allowing the application for the three-year LTROs, the modification of the collateral requirements can be regarded as having contributed to easing the funding situation of European banks caused by the shortage of eligible collateral. As a result, the LTROs succeeded not only in lowering the euro-denominated funding costs in the money markets, but also bringing down the spread of the yields on Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian sovereign bonds vis-à-vis German bonds. In addition, the LTROs helped promote the issuance of senior unsecured bank bonds (Charts 10–13). Thus, it is widely regarded that the LTROs prevented a bank funding crisis and thus deleveraging on a massive scale.  Recent Developments in Financial Markets Since uncertainty over European political and economic developments has intensified over recent months, some interest rates have risen accordingly. Nonetheless, the scale of the increase in the US dollar funding cost borne by European banks, for example, has so far been modest compared with the situation prior to the new arrangement related to the US dollar liquidity-providing operations at the end of November 2011 (Chart 9). Likewise, the euro-denominated funding cost in money markets has remained calm (Charts 10, 11). Meanwhile, the spreads of the yields on Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian sovereign bonds vis-à-vis German bonds have risen, as has the Greek spread; this was partly owing to the decline to the record low level of the yield on German sovereign bonds (Chart 13). The Spanish banking sector faces a surge in the credit spread over its financial bonds, which reflects recent growing concerns over the soundness of that banking sector (Chart 14). Stock prices are generally showing declining trends as a reflection of European sovereign debt problems and concerns over the global economic slowdown (Chart 15). Given the sensitivity of market developments, I will continue to watch closely the impact of European political and economic developments on global financial markets. V. Impact of European sovereign debt problems on the Japanese economy and monetary policy of the Bank of Japan (the Bank) I would now like to move to the final part of my presentation, and I will begin by summarizing recent economic and price developments. Outlook on economic activities and prices with risk factors Recently, it has become increasingly evident that the Japanese economy is shifting toward a pick-up phase, although economic activity has remained more or less flat (Chart 16). With regard to outlook, the Japanese economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path in the first half of fiscal 2012. This is likely since the pace of recovery in overseas economies 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11 should gradually improve – led largely by the emerging economies and reconstruction-related domestic demand in the post-Great East Japan Earthquake period. In fiscal 2013, Japan’s economy is expected to maintain its growth at a pace above its potential as overseas economies continue to achieve relatively high growth. However, the economic growth rate is expected to be somewhat lower than in fiscal 2012 because the positive effects from reconstruction-related domestic demand are likely to gradually diminish (Chart 17). With regard to prices, developments in the consumer price index (CPI; all items less fresh food) indicate that after reaching a historical trough of 2.4 percent in August 2009, the year-on-year rate of decline has continued to slow consistently since around the end of 2009. In recent months, that rate of change has been around 0 percent. In terms of the outlook for prices, the rate of change will remain in positive territory and show a gradual increase as the aggregate supply and demand balance is expected to continue improving with the moderate recovery. International commodity prices are currently bearish, partly reflecting concerns over the European sovereign debt problems; though these prices may follow a moderately rising trend owing to an expected increase in demand for food and energy in line with the growth in emerging economies. Assuming that medium- to long-term inflation expectations remain stable, the rate of change in the CPI is projected to gradually rise to a range of above 0.5 percent and less than 1 percent toward the second half of fiscal 2013. Thereafter, it will likely not be too long before the rate reaches the “price-stability goal in the medium to long term” of 1 percent for the time being, as specified in the statement released by the Bank of Japan (hereafter, Bank) in February 2012. The aforementioned outlook is the scenario the Bank considers to be the most probable: it is, in other words, its baseline scenario. As described in detail in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, or the Outlook Report for short, the following four major risks concerning the outlook for economic activity warrant attention: (1) uncertainty related to developments in overseas economies; (2) uncertainty with regard to reconstruction-related domestic demand; (3) uncertainty associated with firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term growth expectations; and (4) issues related to Japan’s fiscal sustainability. Among those risks, I personally am particularly mindful of those relating to adverse spillovers of the European sovereign debt issues and political developments to the baseline scenario.  There are mainly two types of price-associated risks. The first type concerns developments in firms’ and households’ medium- to long-term inflation expectations; the second type relates to developments in import prices. With this second type, the possibility exists that crude oil prices will surge, mainly as a reflection of geopolitical risk. If that does occur, Japan’s terms of trade will experience deterioration, which will squeeze firms’ profits and reduce households’ purchasing power, and ultimately it will have an adverse effect on the whole Japanese economy. Impact of European sovereign debt problems on the Japanese economy  Concerning European sovereign debt problems, the impact can be ascertained mainly by means of three channels – international trade, finance, and exchange rates. With international trade, it would seem that the direct impact on Japan’s exports has been limited, given that exports to the euro area account for only around 10 percent (Chart 18). Rather, a more significant impact could be felt indirectly through a slowdown in trade and foreign direct investment activities in emerging countries, such as China, where the euro area represents one of the largest trade partners (Charts 19, 20).  With regard to finance, the US dollar funding market and money markets remain calm. The US dollar funding cost remains low for Japanese banks since their exposure to the euro area has been limited and their balance sheets have been relatively sound. It is true, though, that Japanese banks faced a moderate increase in US dollar funding costs in the middle of the deepening European sovereign debt crisis from the middle of 2011. After the introduction of 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches the new coordinated arrangement of the six central banks at the end of November, however, the US dollar funding market has remained calm, especially for Japanese banks (Chart 21). Money markets have also been relaxed (Chart 22). Long-term yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) have shown further deceleration thanks to increased demand for them as safer assets (Chart 23). Like European stocks, nonetheless, Japanese stocks are in decline (Chart 24). The direct impact of the European sovereign debt crisis has been felt mainly through exchange rates. Because of its current status as a safer currency, the yen tends to appreciate with intensifying strains in global financial markets (Chart 25). This suggests that changes in the risk-taking behavior of global investors have become closely associated with movements in exchange rates. Recent movements have shown that enhanced nervousness in global financial markets caused by resurgence of the European debt crisis has increased risk aversion among global investors and promoted the yen’s appreciation relative to mid-March this year. The yen has appreciated against the euro, partly because of the reversed interest rate differentials between German and Japanese bond yields with a remaining maturity of less than two years. If sustained, the yen’s appreciation may be detrimental to Japanese firms, adversely affecting their investment and production behavior and making it harder for the Japanese economy to recover. This perspective also makes me feel that developments in Europe demand careful attention. Conduct of monetary policy The Bank is naturally concerned about the long-term prevalence of deflation in the Japanese economy. On February 14 of this year, the Bank introduced “the price-stability goal in the medium to long term” – defined as the inflation rate consistent with price stability sustainable over the medium to long term. The purpose of this action was to promote public understanding of the Bank’s determination to overcome deflation. It was decided that the goal would be within a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, and the goal was set at 1 percent for the time being. Moreover, the Bank made it clear that it would continue pursuing powerful monetary easing – through its virtually zero-interest rate policy and continued implementation of the Asset Purchase Program (hereafter, Program) – until it judged the 1-percent goal to be within sight; this was on condition that it identified no significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. At the same time, the total size of the Program was raised by 10 trillion yen – from about 55 trillion to about 65 trillion yen (Chart 26). On April 27, the Bank decided to increase the total size of the Program further by about 5 trillion yen – from about 65 trillion to about 70 trillion yen – following changes in its composition, including the increase in the purchase of JGBs by about 10 trillion yen.14  Regarding the decision to enhance monetary easing in April, I would like to stress that a high degree of uncertainty remains in terms of the Bank’s assessment, as already explained. The positive signs in economic and price developments that have emerged in recent months do not necessarily imply that the baseline scenario will be realized as projected. Even though                                                  14 Moreover, the purchases of exchange-traded funds and Japan real estate investment trusts were increased by about 200 billion yen and 10 billion yen, respectively. The maximum outstanding amount of the Bank’s fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral with a six-month term was reduced by about 5 trillion yen, taking into account the recent episodes of under-subscription. In addition, the remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased under the Program was extended from one to two years to one to three years. The same treatment was applied to the remaining maturity of corporate bonds to be purchased under the Program. In addition, it was decided that the schedule for increasing the outstanding amount of the Program to about 65 trillion yen by around the end of 2012 would be maintained. It was further decided to increase the outstanding amount of the Program to about 70 trillion yen by around the end of June 2013. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 13 the scenario may eventually materialize, it is still not certain how soon it may do so. Considering recent episodes, for example, there were some cases of the baseline scenario not having been fulfilled, even though the economy appeared to be on the track of sustainable economic growth and prices also initially appeared to be rising steadily. Therefore, the Bank decided to seize this occasion and further enhance monetary easing to better ensure the return of the Japanese economy to sustainable growth with price stability. As explained above, I believe this action also demonstrates the Bank’s determination to implement its monetary policy commitment.  Tackling the long-term structural challenge Finally, I would like to address an issue commonly faced by a number of major central banks in advanced countries and regions: the extremely accommodative monetary environment has not necessarily led to increased domestic demand, such as investment and consumption, as much as had been expected (Chart 27). Though there are structural factors relating to this issue, their root causes are country- or region-specific and thus different from each other.  In the case of Europe, the short-term depressing impact of the fiscal austerity measures and deleveraging of the banking sector, as explained earlier, make it difficult to increase bank lending for the moment. It is likely to be some time before the region starts to enjoy sustainable, favorable growth in lending activities. In the case of Japan, the working-age population has been in decline since the mid-1990s, and this has contributed to the decreasing trend in growth rates. To overcome deflation, it is thus important to stress the need to address Japan’s long-term structural challenges of diminishing growth rates amid a rapidly aging population. It is clear that we need to enhance productivity growth (of the working-age population) so as to overcome the depressing impact caused by the rapid pace of the decrease in the population and working-age population growth rates. However, it may be said that implementation of the necessary structural reforms for boosting growth and productivity has been sluggish, and the shift in economic structure has been limited. Issues related to mounting government debt and social security reforms have generated uncertainty over the future economic outlook. Moreover, a series of shocks – such as the global financial crisis, the Great East Japan Earthquake, the European sovereign debt crisis, and the 2011 Thai floods – also contributed to this outlook. These factors combined to deter expectations of further rises in growth by firms and households despite a very accommodative financial environment driven by monetary stimulus measures. To meet the diverse challenges that arise out of this background and establish a new basis for economic growth, Japanese firms need to become more innovative and competitive in an effort to add value to their activities and explore new sources of demand, both at home and abroad. The government also needs to support the business community by creating a more business-friendly environment. Financial institutions should strive toward strengthening the foundations for economic growth by giving financial support to innovative, viable firms and providing new types of financial and other services, which are increasingly under demand. Meanwhile, the Bank’s accommodative monetary policy will certainly shore up such private-sector activities through a steady decline in the cost of raising capital. By promoting longer-term economic growth, the Bank has helped sustain the business community indirectly: it introduced a fund-provisioning measure to help reinforce the basis for economic growth (Growth-Supporting Funding Facility) in 2010, and it has provided longer-term fixed-rate funds to financial institutions. This facility was expanded in March and April of this year (Chart 28). It should be emphasized that the goal of overcoming deflation will be achieved through such continuous, comprehensive efforts by firms, financial institutions, the government, and the Bank operating within their respective roles. In conclusion, I would like to express once more my gratitude to the Society for the Economic Studies of Securities for giving me this wonderful opportunity to make a presentation in front of its distinguished members. Thank you very much for your kind attention. And I wish you all every success in your work and further development in the Society.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Benoît Cœuré: The importance of money markets Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Morgan Stanley 16th Annual Global Investment seminar, Tourrettes, Provence, 16 June 2012. *      *      * I wish to thank Marie Hoerova for her contribution to this speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to speak at this Morgan Stanley Global Investment Seminar. In my remarks today, I would like to share with you some concerns about the present state of the euro area money markets, which are characterised by segmentation between cash-rich and cash-poor banks and a fragmentation along national lines. I would also like to offer some thoughts on how proper money market functioning can be restored. As you know, money markets around the world came under severe stress during the recent financial crisis and in the subsequent sovereign debt crisis, with interest rate spreads jumping to unprecedented levels and market activity declining significantly in many market segments. In my remarks today, I’ll first consider the functioning of money markets before the crisis and their malfunctioning during the crisis, highlighting specifics of the euro area’s situation compared with that of the US.  Tensions in the money markets led banks to seek to replace money market funding with central bank funding. Central banks have, since the beginning of the financial crisis, increasingly become intermediaries for interbank transactions, as witnessed by the steep increase in the size of their balance sheets. These developments give rise to the following questions. First, if central banks are providing funding to banks in crisis times, when money markets are malfunctioning, why don’t they also do so in normal times? In other words, what useful functions do decentralised money markets perform? I will argue that these markets are essential to ensure price discovery, information aggregation and peer monitoring. Given these important benefits, a second question that arises is, how can the proper functioning of money markets be restored? I’ll discuss policies that can help to revitalise money markets in the euro area later on. Such policies must be directed towards reducing counterparty risk concerns. This can be achieved by restoring adequate capital ratios and reducing the heterogeneity in the capitalisation of banks, as well as taking decisive steps towards a banking union. In the end, lending is an act of trust and there is no alternative but to restore full confidence in the soundness of bank and government finance. Secured and unsecured money markets: the US and the euro area experience Money markets are vital funding markets for financial institutions. I would like to highlight some key developments across various money market segments from the onset of the financial crisis to its most critical point in the autumn of 2008, and the trends that have been observed since then. While my main focus will be on the euro area, I will allude to some US developments as well, not only because the crisis had its origins in the US sub-prime market, but also to underscore the importance of the different structural characteristics of the two financial systems in determining which money market trends affected banks’ access to funding most. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The start of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007 was triggered by a sudden re-pricing in the US sub-prime mortgage market, on account of risks not being properly reflected in the price of the related instruments, in particular mortgage-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations. A market-wide reassessment of financial risk led to sharp increases in premia and spreads across credit markets. Opacity in banks’ balance sheets, coupled with uncertainty about the real valuation of their assets, led to acute tensions in the markets for credit instruments. The crisis became systemic when these tensions spread to money markets worldwide in early August 2007. Some banks were facing direct exposures to “toxic” sub-prime assets; others needed liquidity to be able to honour committed credit lines to so-called conduits, bank-sponsored investment funds. These off-balance sheet entities, a part of the large shadow banking sector in the US, became unable to roll over short-term financing in the US asset-backed commercial paper market (ABCP) amid great uncertainty about asset valuations.1 These events reinforced each other and generated uncertainty about both the solvency and liquidity of money market participants, as the extent of sub-prime exposures was unknown and counterparties could not distinguish good banks from bad.2 Longer-term unsecured money markets, the most heavily exposed to counterparty credit risk, showed signs of stress, as signalled by the spread between the three-month unsecured interbank rate (Libor for the US and Euribor for the euro area) and the overnight index swap in three months’ time (OIS), a standard measure of tensions in unsecured markets.3 Chart 1 shows the spread for the euro area (red line) and the US (blue line) from January 2007 to the first week of June 2012. The spreads had been fairly stable at around five (euro area) and eight (US) basis points before August 2007. After the crisis erupted, two “regime shifts” could be seen for both the euro area and the US. First, in August 2007, the spreads jumped and remained mostly elevated at above 50 basis points. Second, after the Lehman collapse in autumn 2008, the spreads reached all-time highs of 186 and 365 basis points for the euro area and the US, respectively. In addition, there were indications that liquidity was no longer flowing from cash-rich banks to cash-poor banks. Towards the end of September 2008, euro area banks with a surplus of liquidity seemed to prefer to “hoard” liquidity by depositing excess funds with the Eurosystem, rather than lending it through the market to banks with a liquidity shortage. Banks facing a shortage demanded high amounts of liquidity from the ECB. Chart 2 shows the amounts of liquidity deposited by banks with the Eurosystem (blue bars, daily averages per week in billions of euro), together with the Euribor-OIS spread (red line). While the amounts deposited with the Eurosystem rose dramatically (also reflecting an increased liquidity provision by the ECB in response to market tensions),4 the average daily volume in the overnight unsecured interbank market in the euro area almost halved by late September 2008, suggesting that even the very short-term money markets were coming under stress.5                                                  1  Covitz et al. (2012) document “runs” on ABCP programs during the second half of 2007 in the US; see D. M. Covitz, N. Liang and G. Suarez, “The Evolution of a Financial Crisis: Collapse of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market”, Journal of Finance, forthcoming. 2  The effects of asymmetric information and counterparty credit risk on the interbank market functioning are analysed in F. Heider, M. Hoerova and C. Holthausen, “Liquidity hoarding and interbank market spreads: The role of counterparty risk”, ECB Working Paper No 1126, 2009. 3  The OIS is a measure of what the market expects the overnight unsecured rate to be over a three-month period. Since interest rate expectations are present in both variables, the difference between EURIBOR (or LIBOR) and OIS reflects other factors, such as liquidity effects and credit risk. 4  A rise from a daily average of €0.09 billion in the week starting 1 September 2008 to €169 billion in the week starting 29 September 2008. 5  At the onset of the crisis in August 2007, the overnight interbank market actually saw an increase in volume. The average daily volume was €41 billion in the year prior to 9 August 2007. It increased by 27%, to 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The US overnight unsecured interbank market also showed growing counterparty risk concerns following the Lehman bankruptcy, with poorly performing banks seeing an increase in the interest rates on their interbank loans.6 To prevent market-wide liquidity problems from turning into solvency problems for individual institutions, the Eurosystem introduced, as of October 2008, a fixed-rate full allotment regime in its refinancing operations, offering unlimited liquidity to banks at predictable cost against an expanded set of eligible collateral. This led to an excess supply of central bank liquidity, relative to the liquidity needs of the banking sector. The rise in the liquidity deposited with the Eurosystem after October 2008 (Chart 2) was a direct consequence of this new regime and a symptom of a malfunctioning money market. Let me add that many banks deposit their excess liquidity back with the Eurosystem as a result of a simple accounting identity; by itself this does not necessarily imply that banks are not injecting liquidity into the economy. Since the onset of the crisis, the key money market trends affecting bank funding patterns were, for the US, the tensions in the secured markets (known as a “run on repo”) and, for the euro area, a shift from unsecured towards secured funding, as well as a fragmentation of money markets along national lines, further exacerbated by the emergence of the sovereign debt crisis. The “run on repo” has been often seen as playing a key role in the collapse of the US shadow banking sector. This was a major cause for concern as the size of the US shadow banking sector, measured by the total amount of its assets, was comparable with that of the traditional, regulated banking system.7 Tensions in the secured markets manifested themselves in increased haircuts across collateral types. Recent empirical evidence suggests that most of the increase occurred on private sector securities, while haircuts on government bonds, which constitute the bulk of assets used as collateral in repo transactions, increased only modestly.8 However, some key dealer banks with large exposures to private sector securities were heavily affected by the contraction in repo. As a result, these institutions reduced lending to other players in the shadow banking system.  The shadow banking system in the euro area is less important than in the US, as it constitutes less than half of the total assets of the banking sector. (Assets held by shadow banking-related sectors in the euro area were estimated to amount to €10.8 trillion in the second quarter of 2011).9 A major fraction of intermediation in money markets occurs at the interbank level. Still, interbank markets in the euro area came under severe stress because of weaknesses in parts of the banking system: in some countries banks were heavily exposed to real estate and housing bubbles; in other countries banks suffered from sovereign risk exposure.                                                                                                                                                       €52 billion between 9 August 2007 and 26 September 2008. This increase could reflect a shift towards more short-term financing in the interbank market. See Heider et al. (2009) cited above for details. 6  See G. Afonso, A. Kovner, and A. Schoar, “Stressed, Not Frozen: The Federal Funds Market in the Financial Crisis”, Journal of Finance, Vol. 66, No. 4, 2011. 7  For details, see K. Bakk-Simon, S. Borgioli, C. Giron, H. S. Hempell, A. Maddaloni, F. Recine, and S. Rosati, “Shadow banking sector in the euro area: An overview”, ECB Occasional Paper No 133, 2012. 8  Krishnamurthy et al. (2012) report that a full-scale “run on repo” did not seem to have occurred (unlike in the ABCP market). See A. Krishnamurthy, S. Nagel and D. Orlov, “Sizing Up Repo”, NBER Working Paper No 17768, 2012. This contrasts with previous studies, for example, G. Gorton and A. Metrick, “Securitised Banking and the Run on Repo,” Journal of Financial Economics, forthcoming. 9  See Bakk-Simon et al. (2012) cited above. The shadow banking aggregate corresponds to a sector comprising the other financial intermediaries (OFI) sector plus money market funds (MMFs) minus investment funds other than MMFs. The OFI sector comprises all financial institutions other than those included in the monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and the insurance corporations and pension funds. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Let me provide some evidence of key trends in euro area money markets with a series of charts.10  Stress in the unsecured money market segment continued beyond 2008, with a reduced turnover and preference for lending at shorter maturities, which carry relatively less risk for the lender (Chart 3). More generally, the share of interbank liabilities in the total assets of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) domiciled in the euro area has exhibited a declining trend since the fourth quarter of 2008 (Chart 4). The levels are still below those observed in the pre-crisis period. The euro repo market also experienced tightening conditions in 2008, characterised by declining volumes, the exclusion of some securities from the pool of eligible collateral, as well as the exclusion of some counterparties by means of larger haircuts and margin requirements. After a drop in 2008, volumes started increasing from 2009 onwards, reflecting to some extent a shift from unsecured to secured funding, which gives lending banks more protection against counterparty credit risk.11  Before the crisis, financial markets in the euro area were integrating rapidly. According to the financial integration indicators developed by the ECB, euro area money markets achieved the fastest and most complete integration.12 However, as liquidity dried up in the money markets, a tendency for a “home bias” in interbank lending arose. This tendency intensified with the onset of the sovereign debt crisis for banks domiciled in fiscally strained euro area countries. The nationally based government support schemes may have contributed to this phenomenon. Chart 5 shows that, after a steady decline since the end of 2004, the share of domestic interbank liabilities in total interbank liabilities in the euro area started rising in the first half of 2008. The unweighted average of the shares across euro area countries then stabilised around the same levels, while the weighted average (driven by the largest countries) continued along an upward path. With regard to cross-border euro area interbank liabilities (that is, interbank liabilities coming from other euro area countries), after a fall in the last quarter of 2008, the share remained broadly stable (Chart 6). At the same time, dispersion in banks’ access to funding increased considerably in the euro area, with banks domiciled in countries under sovereign strains facing severe constraints even in obtaining secured funding. These trends led to an increased reliance by a part of the banking system on central bank funding. Chart 7 shows that, at the end of 2008, the Eurosystem’s funding (as a share of total deposit liabilities) to banks in some euro area countries increased markedly. After a mild improvement in euro area money market activity in the second half of 2010, increased borrowing from the Eurosystem was observed again in mid-2011, owing to the intensified sovereign debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, average recourse to central bank funding by euro area banks in respect of total deposit liabilities stood at over 5%, slightly higher than the level observed after the Lehman collapse, with a very wide dispersion across euro area countries. Central bank intermediation of interbank funds was necessary to ensure a smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area and to avoid a major credit crunch. However, it may have come at the cost of crowding out some market activity. It may take a long time before secured, and particularly unsecured, money market segments begin to function normally again. More importantly, money market transactions will not come back if the fundamental causes are not addressed.                                                  10  For a detailed account of changes in the funding patterns of euro area banks see “Changes in bank financing patterns”, European Central Bank, April 2012. 11  See the report “Changes in bank financing patterns” cited above. 12  The full set of the indicators can be found in the ECB’s annual report “Financial Integration in Europe”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Importance of money markets I now turn to the more general question of why well-functioning, decentralised money markets are a crucial component of the financial system. Three factors explain the importance of money markets: their contribution to market efficiency and market discipline; their impact on financial stability and on financing conditions in the economy at large; and their role as an initial link in the chain of monetary policy transmission. Deep and liquid money markets, not unlike other markets in the economy, play an important part in information aggregation and price discovery. Indeed, money market rates, such as Euribor and Libor, provide benchmark rates for the pricing of fixed-income securities and loan contracts throughout the economy. Moreover, interbank money markets play a significant role in providing incentives for banks to conduct business in a safe and sound manner, thus ensuring market discipline. Specifically, in the unsecured money markets, where loans are uncollateralised, interbank lenders are directly exposed to losses if the interbank loan is not repaid. This gives lenders incentives to collect information about borrowers and to monitor them over the lifetime of the interbank loan, making the loan repayment more probable. Therefore, unsecured money markets play a key peer monitoring role.13 The information banks acquire about each other may not be readily available to regulatory authorities and central banks.14  In the secured money markets, lenders mitigate credit risk exposure by requiring borrowers to post collateral, and by imposing haircuts on collateral values. While attenuated credit risk concerns may make it easier for borrowing banks to obtain credit, secured funding comes at the cost of acquiring and holding collateral, as well as relatively weaker incentives for lending banks to conduct monitoring. Developments in money markets can have profound implications for financial stability and the functioning of the entire economy, for they affect the financing conditions faced by non-financial corporations and households. Being an essential source of bank funding, money markets have a significant impact on the size of the balance sheet of financial institutions and the amount of credit they can extend. As such, money markets can contribute to pro-cyclicality and the so-called leverage cycles: at times of generalised optimism, high asset valuation, low haircuts and abundant liquidity in money markets can lead to higher leverage and credit expansion, whereas when bad shocks hit the economy asset prices drop, haircuts increase and liquidity can dry up.15                                                   13  Rochet and Tirole (1996) emphasise the role of interbank peer monitoring in reducing borrowers’ moral hazard and their excessive risk-taking ex post; see J.-C. Rochet and J. Tirole, “Interbank Lending and Systemic Risk,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Vol. 28, No. 4, 1996. Hoerova and Monnet (2011) view market discipline in the unsecured money markets as a provision of ex ante incentives to mitigate risk of borrowers’ investments; see M. Hoerova and C. Monnet, “Money market discipline and central bank lending,” presented at the workshop on the “Post-crisis design of the operational framework”, European Central Bank, October 2011. 14  Money markets were among the first to respond to the arrival of bad news about the US sub-prime mortgage market, with rising interest rates and/or unwillingness to roll over maturing debt. When perceived risk and the distribution of risk in the financial system suddenly increase, the incentives of money market lenders to monitor their borrowers intensify, resulting in adjustments in the price and quantity of credit granted. Conversely, when risk is perceived to be low and relatively homogeneous, borrowers get refinanced easily. Smooth money market functioning in the run-up to the crisis was aided by generalised optimism and low risk aversion in markets, driven inter alia by a benign macroeconomic environment, ample liquidity in the financial system due to a “savings glut” and accommodative monetary policy, as well as agency problems in the financial sector. 15  See J. Geanakoplos, “Solving the Present Crisis and Managing the Leverage Cycle”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, August 2010. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches If liquidity dries up, it can force banks to de-leverage, thus affecting the supply of bank credit, or to acquire liquidity by liquidating or selling assets. Asset liquidation can impose externalities on other players in the financial system through, for example, fire sales and financial contagion.16  From the monetary policy perspective, money markets play a central role in monetary policy transmission in the euro area. This is because the euro area financial system is largely bank-based and interbank money market interest rates represent the marginal cost of funding bank loans. When money markets function normally, the ECB can influence the longer-maturity rates, which are relevant for determining bank lending rates, by steering very short-term money market rates to keep them close to its official rates. A smooth functioning of money markets therefore guarantees that the impulse of monetary policy is transmitted across the financial system and to the real economy without impairments. Revitalising money markets in the euro area Given the significance of well-functioning money markets, their revival is essential for the euro area. Revamping money markets calls for a reversal of the aforementioned adverse trends of low and fragmented money market activity, and the resulting increased reliance on liquidity provision by the ECB. As these trends are driven by counterparty risk concerns in the banking system, restoring proper money market functioning and integration among different jurisdictions requires restoring confidence in banks’ health. It also requires banking and market supervisors to resist the temptation to ring-fence liquidity and capital within national boundaries. This is a classic problem of collective action: uncoordinated national reactions to heightened uncertainty could be collectively lethal to the single market for capital.  Two sets of actions seem to be key in tackling these concerns at their root: one set to strengthen bank balance sheets and another set of actions to break the self-reinforcing loop between bank and sovereign debt risks and move to truly unified European supervision. To strengthen bank balance sheets, first, adequate capital ratios must be reached in the banking system. The EBA Capital Exercise, with EU banks being expected to reach a core Tier 1 capital ratio of 9% by the end of this month, will be an important milestone. Regulators should then make sure that the subsequent transition to the Basel III framework does not result in a weakening of the capital buffers. The heterogeneity of capital ratios must also be reduced. The median core Tier 1 capital ratio of large euro area banks is not significantly lower than that of their global counterparts. However, the variation in this ratio across institutions is substantially wider in the euro area, introducing asymmetries in banks’ access to funding and funding costs. Second, leverage in the euro area banking system must be reduced. The aggregate leverage (asset-to-equity) ratio of large euro area banks remains comparatively high by international and historical standards.17 The adverse feedback loop between banks and sovereigns, in which doubts about the solvency of the sovereigns feed doubts about the solvency of the banks, and vice versa, will be broken more readily by the establishment of a true banking union.                                                  16  See, for example, V. Acharya and S. Viswanathan, “Leverage, Moral Hazard and Liquidity”, Journal of Finance, Vol. 66, No 1, 2011; F. Allen and D. Gale, “Financial Contagion”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 108, No. 1, 2000; and M. Brunnermeier and L. H. Pedersen, “Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity”, Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 22, No 6, 2009. 17  For more information on the deleveraging process in the euro area banking system, see Special Feature A, Financial Stability Review, ECB, June 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 This should include the creation of a pan-euro area deposit insurance fund and a pan-euro area bank resolution framework, supported by a single supervisory system with centralised decision-making. If the European Stability Mechanism could inject capital directly into banks, with strong conditionality and control, this would also help to break the bank-sovereign loop. These new institutions would mitigate counterparty risk and promote a truly integrated approach to banking supervision. In addition, they would foster the integration of the banking system not only at the money market level, but also at the retail level: the emergence of truly pan-European banking institutions, provided they are properly controlled, would attenuate asymmetric shocks within Member States and favour risk-sharing. Depending on how they are devised, some features of such a banking union, such as a single euro area deposit insurance or a single resolution fund to wind down failed banks, may result in additional sharing of fiscal risk among euro area countries. These mechanisms should come with the appropriate parliamentary controls. There should be no sharing of fiscal risks without democratic decision-making and accountability. Money market functioning will also be affected by the incoming regulation. I have in mind in particular the new set of liquidity standards proposed by the Basel Committee,18 the moving of over-the-counter derivatives trading towards central counterparties (CCPs) and the reform of the shadow banking sector. The aim of the current regulatory reforms is to establish an incentive-compatible regulatory framework as well as to encourage banks to adopt business models that allow them to limit their risks and fulfil the regulatory requirements without relying excessively on central banks as liquidity providers. In respect of liquidity, the Basel Committee proposed in December 2010 two new standards: the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which aims to ensure that banks hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand an acute stress scenario lasting one month; and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which aims to address banks’ longer-term structural liquidity mismatches by requiring a minimum amount of stable funding (based on the liquidity characteristics of banks’ assets) over a one-year period. It is important that the regulation does not hamper the functioning of funding markets. This applies in particular to the calibration of the run-off rates for interbank funding and to the asymmetrical treatment of liquidity facilities extended to financial firms. The regulators’ welcome push to move over-the-counter derivatives towards CCPs, which aims to limit counterparty risk and promote greater netting efficiency and transparency, may also have an effect on both the unsecured and secured money market segments. This is because such a move will lead to an increased need for high-quality collateral.19 However, the supply of safe assets is finite and the pool of “good” collateral is dwindling as the creditworthiness of certain sovereigns is questioned by market participants. The more good collateral is pledged to the CCPs, the less is left to use in the secured money market, and the fewer assets are available to other creditors in the event of default, making it difficult to obtain unsecured refinancing. This strengthens the need to find ways to identify or produce new assets that can be used as collateral and to mitigate the pro-cyclical consequences of credit ratings and of market valuation. Lastly, money market functioning may be affected by the ongoing discussions on the regulation of the shadow banking sector, some parts of which provide funding to the                                                  18  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems”, December 2010 (revised version of June 2011). 19  The higher demand can be driven by a number of factors including a current under-collateralisation of over-the-counter transactions, reduced re-hypothetication of collateral and CCPs only accepting relatively high quality collateral. Estimates of the demand for extra collateral vary. A recent report by Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman estimates the demand at USD 500–800 billion. Singh (2009) estimates the costs to be around USD 200 billion (see M. Singh, “Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the OTC Derivatives Market”, IMF Working Paper WP/10/99, 2009). 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches traditional, regulated banking system. For example, there is some evidence that US money market funds (MMFs) provide sizeable US dollar funding to European banks.20 In this context, the changes in the US regulation on MMFs, which sets shorter maturity limits for securities held by MMFs and other liquidity requirements, may have a lasting effect on the US dollar funding conditions for European banks. Conclusion Let me conclude.  The importance of money markets for monetary and financial stability and for lending conditions in the economy calls for careful monitoring of recent money market trends to assess which trends are temporary and which are more structural, induced inter alia by the current regulatory overhaul. Restoring proper market functioning requires a series of actions to rebuild confidence in the creditworthiness of banks and governments, as well as the taking of decisive steps towards a banking union.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jean-Pierre Danthine: The Swiss National Bank’s 2012 Financial Stability Report Speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Vice Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 14 June 2012. *      *      * Introductory remarks by Jean-Pierre Danthine I, too, would like to welcome you to this news conference, which for me is also the occasion to present the 2012 edition of the Swiss National Bank’s Financial Stability Report. The report contains the SNB’s assessment of the risks to the stability of the Swiss banking system, and of the need for action. This promotes risk awareness among Swiss banking sector agents, thereby contributing to financial stability. Introduction Economic and financial conditions for the Swiss banking sector have deteriorated since the last Financial Stability Report. The sovereign debt crisis escalated, threatening to spill over from peripheral euro area countries to the core countries of the euro area. In addition, global economic growth lost momentum and tensions grew in the international banking system. There was, likewise, no easing of tension on the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets. The momentum observed in real estate prices and mortgages continued. As my colleague, Thomas Jordan, has already mentioned, under its baseline scenario the SNB expects a gradual improvement in economic and financial conditions over the next 12 months. Although this is considered to be the most likely scenario, the risk of a renewed deterioration in the environment remains high. In the short term, under the adverse scenario there could be a substantial price correction on financial markets, and economic growth could slow markedly. Such a scenario would affect the two big banks in particular. For domestically focused commercial banks, the main risk stems from a potential fall in Swiss real estate prices over the medium term. This risk increases the more market prices diverge from those justified by fundamentals. Given the high risks in the economic and financial environment, the SNB considers that there is a need for action by big banks and domestically focused commercial banks alike. The SNB’s recommendations are aimed at strengthening the resilience of the Swiss banking system, to ensure that it is in a position to continue performing its essential functions for the Swiss economy, even if the adverse scenario I have just described were to materialise. Situation at the big banks I would now like to present the key points of our assessment of the big banks. Since June 2011, both big banks have made further progress in improving their resilience; first, by increasing their highest-quality capital – by which I mean loss-absorbing capital – and, second, by reducing their risk-weighted assets. CDS spreads, for example, suggest that the market considers the solvency of both big banks to be above average compared to other international banks. This is partly explained by the fact that they are only moderately exposed to the most vulnerable peripheral euro area countries. Despite the fact that this progress has been achieved, the SNB considers that the big banks’ loss-absorbing capital is still below the level needed to ensure sufficient resilience. This assessment is based on three factors: First, in the event of a further escalation of the euro 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches area crisis, the loss potential for the big banks would be substantial compared to their loss-absorbing capital. As I have just pointed out, the big banks have only moderate direct exposure to the most vulnerable peripheral euro area countries, yet if the crisis in these countries were to deepen, a general deterioration in economic and financial conditions could be expected. In such a case, the potential losses for the banks would extend to a significant portion of their credit and trading positions. Second, the SNB’s assessment is based on a comparison with capitalisation levels at other international big banks. This comparison uses the definitions of the Basel III framework once fully implemented. These definitions yield the most accurate picture of a bank’s true resilience. The comparison based on these definitions reveals that both Swiss big banks  – and in particular Credit Suisse – are below the international average. Given the importance of the big banks for the Swiss economy and for financial stability, an above-average capitalisation level would be appropriate. Third, the leverage of both big banks remains very high, despite a reduction in risk-weighted assets. At end-March 2012, the share of loss-absorbing capital in the net balance sheet total was 2.7% at UBS and only 1.7% at Credit Suisse. This capital would, for example, be insufficient to absorb losses such as those experienced by UBS in the recent financial crisis (over 3% of the net balance sheet total). In addition, the question remains as to what extent the reduction of risk-weighted assets is matched by an effective reduction of economic risks, if the balance sheet total remains unchanged. For these reasons, the SNB considers that it is essential for both big banks to further strengthen their resilience. It recommends that UBS continue with the capital strengthening process – including, in particular, pursuing a policy of dividend restraint. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, should accelerate its process and take all action necessary to expand its loss-absorbing capital base significantly during the current year. The SNB also recommends that both big banks increase their transparency with regard to resilience. Concretely, they should publish information on their capitalisation as defined under Basel III once fully implemented – as, indeed, UBS has done in the two most recent presentations of its quarterly results. They should also regularly calculate and disclose their risk-weighted assets according to the Basel standardised approach. The results of such calculations would provide a basis for comparison with risk-weighted asset figures calculated using internal risk models. This comparison would enable the ongoing reduction of risks to be presented more transparently. Implementing these two measures is necessary from a financial stability perspective. However, it is also in the big banks’ own interest to hold sufficient loss-absorbing capital, as a high level of resilience strengthens their competitiveness in the core business of wealth management, and boosts market confidence. Situation at domestically focused commercial banks I would now like to turn to our assessment of domestically focused commercial banks. There are clear and growing signs of a build-up of imbalances on the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets. Over the past 12 months, mortgage lending volumes and real estate prices have once again grown strongly. Thus, the mortgage-to-GDP ratio, which was already high in a historical comparison, continued to increase. At the same time, residential real estate prices have reached levels that, in some cases, exceed those that can be justified by fundamental factors, such as demographics or per capita income. Taking the national average, this is the case for prices of owner-occupied apartments. In some regions such as Lake Geneva, Lake Zurich and Lake Zug, this is the case, on average, for all segments of the residential property market. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Under the baseline scenario, the momentum in the mortgage and real estate markets continues. It is therefore to be expected that imbalances will continue to build up, and that, consequently, the risk of an abrupt correction of these imbalances will increase over the medium term. For domestically focused commercial banks, average capitalisation relative to regulatory requirements is at a historically high level. Moreover, most of these banks’ capital is of the highest quality, and thus loss-absorbing. However, in the current environment, the resilience of these banks, as measured by the regulatory capital indicators, is overestimated.  First, certain risks are not captured by the regulatory requirements. This applies, in particular, to interest rate risk in the banking book, which covers traditional deposit and lending activities. In the current situation, with historically high interest rate risk exposures, this is a significant shortcoming.  Second, the current capital requirements have a procyclical effect. Thus rising real estate prices, by causing loan-to-value ratios to fall, can lead to lower capital requirements. Given the growing imbalances on the real estate market, banks’ resilience, as measured by the regulatory capital indicators, is overestimated.  Third, the low level of diversification of most domestically focused commercial banks is not taken into account in capital requirements. The main focus of these banks’ business activities, and their risk exposures, relate to mortgage lending. This concentration of activities is compounded by a geographical concentration at the cantonal or regional level. In the light of these factors, the SNB considers that action is needed on two fronts: First, the capacity of some banks to bear the risks incurred must be reviewed, and strengthened if necessary. This applies particularly to banks which have cumulative risks, such as high interest rate risk and high exposure to the mortgage and real estate markets. FINMA’s microprudential measures will play a key role in this regard. Second, as the SNB has repeatedly emphasised, given the cyclical risks in the Swiss mortgage and real estate markets, a temporary adjustment of banking system-wide capital requirements may have to be considered. To this end, on 1 June the Swiss Federal Council announced that a macroprudential instrument will be made available to the Swiss authorities from 1 July, in the form of a countercyclical capital buffer. Introduction of a macroprudential instrument To conclude, I would like to briefly describe how the countercyclical capital buffer will work. This instrument will enable the authorities to adjust capital requirements in the banking system, depending on potential excesses in the Swiss credit market. It is a preventive instrument that can be activated if necessary, to a level deemed appropriate. It can also be targeted to a specific segment of the credit market. Once the imbalances have been corrected, the countercyclical capital buffer will be deactivated, either immediately or gradually. In activating the countercyclical capital buffer, the aim of the authorities is twofold: First, it should increase the resilience of the banking sector, thereby helping to protect against the consequences of a correction of excessive credit growth. Second, it should help to lean against the build-up of such excesses. The Federal Council decides on the activation, deactivation and level of the countercyclical capital buffer, upon the proposal of the SNB. The SNB consults FINMA before submitting its 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches proposal. The proposal will be based on an in-depth analysis and assessment of the situation on the Swiss credit market, which will, in principle, be carried out once a quarter.1 The signs of a build-up of imbalances on the Swiss credit market relate to the residential mortgage segment. Thus, if the buffer had to be activated, it would be aimed solely at this segment of the credit market. When assessing the necessity of activating the buffer, the SNB will take into account the impact of other recently announced measures focusing on the mortgage and real estate markets. These measures include a further revision of the self-regulation rules and a tightening of risk weightings for mortgage loans. In addition, as part of its monetary policy mandate, the SNB will closely monitor the impact of a possible activation of the countercyclical capital buffer, in order to assess the consequences for the economy as a whole. The current situation justifies the fact that this instrument, scheduled for implementation under Basel III, has been made available to the Swiss authorities at an early date. Numerous past crises have highlighted the costs associated with credit market excesses. Even if the countercyclical capital buffer does not enable us to prevent the build-up of all imbalances in the Swiss credit market, it should help to reduce these costs in the future, provided it is activated early enough for its preventive properties to take full effect.                                                  1  Swiss National Bank, “Implementing the countercyclical capital buffer in Switzerland: concretising the Swiss National Bank’s role”, fact sheet, June 2012; available at www.snb.ch, Financial Stability, Publications. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: South East Europe – pre-requisites for reform Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the high-level seminar “South East Europe: pre-requisites for reform”, hosted by the Bank of Albania in collaboration with the University of Oxford, Tirana, 14 June 2012. *      *      * Dear Mr. Minister, Dear Governors,  Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  I would like to thank you all for your participation and interest in sharing opinions on an extremely important issue to all of us: economic reforms and policies the countries of the region need to undertake against a background of an unclear situation in Europe, our main trading partner.  I would like to thank in particular the representatives of the University of Oxford and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, who have worked closely with the Bank of Albania in hosting this Conference. This activity today is a follow-up of our joint study work with the University of Oxford dedicated to the competitiveness of the Albanian economy in a regional and global context, attraction of foreign investment and macro-financial stability of our economy.  Dear guests, The year 2011 and the first part of the current year evidenced that euro area crisis has plunged into its most acute phase. Right at the centre of this crisis, the sovereign debt risk, the curtailed ability of the financial system to absorb this risk and the continuous economic activity slowdown are spinning in a vicious circle. Against a background of public and private sector deleveraging, there are heightened concerns about public debt financing, cost and sustainability. This phenomenon is a concern not only for the short but also for the long run, and moreover, it has spread across a number of euro area member states.  Developments in global economy, and particularly the European one, in the recent years are as significant to the countries of our region as to Europe itself. The direct effects of this situation on personal business budgets and the economy in general have been in the spotlight of daily discussions of politicians, policymakers, central bank, analysts and the public. The short-term and direct concentration is justifiable in light of the hard time facing our economies and taking into account that the euro area is our main trading partner. The short-term focus and problematic situation have shifted the attention away from long-term policies and reforms. The fact that the global crisis was perceived and interpreted with an escalating crescendo tone is indisputable. It was partly perceived from the moment it first hit and, little by little, it transformed from a mortgage crisis into the deepest global crisis since the Great Depression. The response to the crisis and the lessons drawn from it followed in a similar fashion. The approach and extent of response to the crisis was not uniform across the countries. The economies having fresh memories of the financial crises responded swiftly and more strongly. The same can be said for the public and business community in these economies. The economies enjoying a favourable fiscal position also faced the crisis without impairing their long-term fiscal sustainability. The situation seemed slightly more complex in some developed European economies. Seeking to find a balance between deleveraging and fiscal consolidation, euro area authorities demanded setting up a protective wall against the possible fire bursting into from the outside. But, as noted, this fire had already burst out and was spreading inside the euro area walls; therefore, setting up this “protective wall against fire” was pointless at this point. The European Union and its institutional structures, along 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  with the international financial institutions and partners, are undertaking a number of reforms to put this “fire” out. However, it is still unclear how long this “agony” will last and likewise is its impact on the euro area and its trading partners.  The exhaustion of fiscal and monetary policy incentives failed to increase economic activity and, moreover, it further aggravated the sovereign debt situation and financial stability. Consequently, the sovereign debt sustainability and banking system credibility-related issues were added to the concerns about economic growth. The question facing many countries today has the form of a trade-off between stability and sovereignty. Currently, the latter two are intertwined in an endogenous relationship (of mutual impact on one another), in which the multi-dimensional need for stability (implying the maintenance of price stability, macroeconomic stability, financial and fiscal stability) requires taking balancing measures. The latter have considerable social costs in the short run. Social discontent against them and the governments proposing them erodes the credibility of reforms and the authorities, increasing, in turn, the sovereign debt risk. Euro area, and particularly its Southern members, are facing a concern, whose solution bears consequences with economic and political implications for the future of all member states and the common currency. The reforms and policies undertaken by euro area authorities, individually or in a concerted manner, have important and direct implications for our economies.  Experience to date has shown that our partners and their large banks have adopted an approach that maximizes their benefits as “owners”. Consequently, their decision-making is entirely conditioned by the fear of loss of stability and sovereignty that associates the current concerns of the economy and the parent bank. This has pushed these countries to take biased measures against our economies, risk rating investment in our countries at 100%. This decision-making, which is directly linked to the events taking place within the euro area, has practically transferred the issue of stability versus sovereignty in our economies. These policies represent a negative phenomenon, which contradicts the positive and stabilizing role that our partners have been playing so far in South East European economies and societies.  The countries of our region have in the last 20 years undertaken numerous structural, political and economic reforms, in view of consolidating the democratic state, the rule of law based on principles of market economy and supported by a consolidated financial system. These reforms have enhanced the credibility and independence of public institutions and, in particular, the central bank’s role and independence. They were not guided by the wish and goal to join Europe, but rather to build a society similar to the European one. By achieving economic, political and social convergence in these countries, each of them hopes to become a worthy partner to the developed Europe, and adopt the euro as the final phase of this transformation process. From this viewpoint, the European integration process, European Commission and the euro became powerful external anchors for each SEE country.  Current developments have diminished the anchoring role of the EU and the euro. Consequently, the European Commission and all European decision-making authorities should, in the future, pay greater attention to the characteristics of countries and regions aspiring to EU membership, and engage in closer cooperation with the respective national authorities. It is, however, important to emphasize an evident and indisputable fact to all of us: external factors cannot safeguard long-term stability if internal anchors are missing. The current situation in Europe shows that the integration process does not prove to be a sufficient anchor, be it both inside and outside the euro area, as long as the internal economic and political choices are not stable in the long run.  This conclusion underlines the role and importance of internal anchors as warrantors for macro-financial stability and continuation of structural reforms that have brought our 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  economies to this point. These anchors are strong arguments in the hands of the public at large to exert pressure on public institutions, and to formulate and implement policies that guarantee long-term stability and sovereignty.  Unfortunately, as I stated earlier, these anchors are currently being jeopardized by internal factors. Driven by short-term perceived benefits vis-à-vis the real costs of the correction process, the public, the business community, syndicates and stakeholders ask for short-term concessions from the institutions, and particularly from the central bank. Judging on the benefits, they require shifting the focus from the objectives and traditional instruments our institutions have been mandated for. These short-term perceived benefits, seemingly, have the potential to offer a right and moral solution to sovereignty versus stability, but they bear the risk of causing the loss of both in the long run.   Political and institutional factors have not addressed yet some important concerns identified by the Bank of Albania to have caused financial stability-related concerns and decelerated economic growth in Albania. I refer here to collateral execution, lowering of perceived risk arising from the severe political situation and lack of consensus, deceleration of reforms required by the European Commission and receiving EU candidate country status, severity of political warfare, and use of the economy and the situation for political gain.  Lastly, the Bank of Albania notes that the Albanian economy remains under the pressure of market developments in our main trading partners and their economic and financial policies. The measures taken by our trading partners to enhance confidence in their financial systems and adjust the macro-financial imbalances hamper monetary policy transmission in the economy. They heighten public concern and undermine its confidence in the future. These are the very reasons preventing the banking system to finance the economy and the government at lower interest rates and, consequently, the central bank’s monetary policy transmission to easing the monetary and financial conditions.  What is currently happening represents higher risk premium in the countries of the region for all the reasons referred to earlier, rather than an increase in real interest rates. Concluding, I would like to clarify that central banks should make their utmost to preserve the frail macro-financial balances and bolster public confidence in institutions and the financial system.   In this context, the Bank of Albania, as to date, will continue to foster macroeconomic and financial stability in Albania. This is our major obligation arising from the Constitution and relevant laws. We are committed to meeting this obligation with dedication and meticulousity. We are fully focused on these two major objectives, just like a good captain focusing on the horizon, rather than on the hands laid on the ship’s wheel. The Bank of Albania believes that, by guaranteeing these two vital pillars to the stability and prosperity of the economy, we have provided the best contribution to achieving higher economic growth.  On the other hand, this would create an attractive surrounding for absorbing and accommodating foreign investment, and allowing the entry of new capital into the economy, which is vital to support the country’s economic activity and its credibility in the region and beyond.  The Bank of Albania is committed to guaranteeing a sound banking system and efficient in channelling public savings into the economy. We will continue to carry out our periodic examinations to guarantee the banking system’s stability. Sufficient capitalisation and capital quality remain our primary objective. I would like to guarantee the system that the Bank of Albania will take all the measures to supply with liquidity, while increasing the pressure for higher credit volume and improved quality.  Dear guests,  I invite you to actively participate in today’s debate and discussions on issues that have been and will remain the focus and our common interest in the future. I invite you all to contribute, 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  through presentations and discussions, to setting objectives our region will face in the future and solving the current challenges.   Thank you for your attention!  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Mario Draghi: President’s address at the 14th ECB and its Watchers Conference Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the 14th ECB and its Watchers Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 15 June 2012. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to take part in this fourteenth edition of the ECB watchers conference – and the first I am attending as President of the European Central Bank. As you are all aware, the ECB has the crucial role of providing liquidity to sound bank counterparties in return for adequate collateral. This is what we have done throughout the crisis, faithful to our mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term – and this is what we will continue to do. The Eurosystem will continue to supply liquidity to solvent banks where needed.  In normal times, “adequate liquidity” may be defined as a volume of refinancing in line with the need for banks to meet the obligatory reserve requirements and the financing of other autonomous factors. In times of increased financial instability, “adequate liquidity” indicates a volume of central bank money that also counteracts a temporary inability of banks to refinance in the market, which could lead to systemic consequences for the banking sector as a whole. In my introductory remarks this morning, I will talk in a little more detail about the ECB’s monetary policy. I will also discuss Europe’s agenda for growth and issues relating to a longer-term vision of our economic and monetary union.  1. Considerations on monetary policy  Let me start with monetary policy.  There are two features I would like to highlight. The first relates to the effectiveness of the three-year long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) that we launched a few months ago.  As you will recall, these operations were introduced in an environment where money market spreads had surged, liquidity had dried up and banks’ access to market-based funding had eroded rapidly.  The uncertainty about market-based funding for banks – especially medium-term funding – was perhaps the most critical issue in that environment. It truly threatened to undermine bank lending and created pressures for a broad-based deleveraging.  A resulting credit crunch would have severely aggravated the slowdown in economic activity, hurt employment and given rise to acute downside risks to price stability.  We must always remember that over two thirds of external financing of firms comes from banks. This ratio is even higher for small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for about three quarters of corporate employment in the euro area.  It is against this background that we decided to launch the three-year LTROs.  Their objectives have been broadly met.  The April bank lending survey points to a marked decline in the net tightening of credit standards and a general improvement in banks’ funding conditions. This evidence is 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches supported by a range of market and other indicators. Overall, it confirms that supply side constraints on bank credit have been removed. This has been a very important result.  The full supportive impact of the three-year LTROs needs time to unfold, so it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the behaviour of a single variable – namely, bank credit to the private economy – that is influenced by a multitude of factors. In the current environment of very weak credit demand and heightened risk aversion, a rebound in the volume of credit will be particularly slow. Yet granular balance sheet data indicate that in February and March, banks domiciled in stressed constituencies could interrupt and partly reverse the sustained decline in loans over the previous months. Indeed, smaller banks in some of those countries could increase their supply of loans. Inflation expectations remain well anchored and there is no inflation risk in any euro area country. Financial market-based inflation expectations over a ten-year horizon are consistent with our definition of medium-term price stability. And should risks to price stability emerge, the Eurosystem has sufficient tools at its disposal to absorb excess liquidity.  The second point I would like to highlight as a way of understanding the ECB’s current conduct of monetary policy is heterogeneity. The situation regarding economic growth is quite different across the euro area.  This is not the first time; we had clearly diverging cycles ten years ago. At that time, growth in Germany was very low and growth in other countries was buoyant. This is part of a normal degree of cyclical heterogeneity that we observe in very large continental economies. It is very similar to what we observe in terms of cyclical heterogeneity within the United States.  What is new in the current episode is the parallel fragmentation of financial markets. This first concerns the interbank market, which works almost exclusively on a national, collateralised and very short-term basis. It is also true for broader capital markets and private capital flows, where home bias is rising.  The prime reason for the current home bias is general risk aversion. In addition, we are very attentive in monitoring whether regulatory initiatives – including anticipation of future liquidity ratios – or initiatives from national supervisors are affecting this market, especially across borders.  We have partly responded to the fact of increased heterogeneity by allowing some national central banks to enlarge the collateral pool. This was essential to ensure sufficient outreach to the real economy in their constituencies in a context of significant heterogeneity. They could accept more direct credit claims, particularly to support credit to the small and medium-sized enterprises that are so important for investment and employment.  This collateral enlargement was crucial for addressing a situation of liquidity abundance in some countries and liquidity scarcity in others. The enlargement has taken place with prudence and its risk management framework is overseen by the Governing Council.  While the process will take time, the restoration of adequate credit flows and the renewed functioning of the interbank market remain our firm objectives.  2. Europe’s growth agenda  Let me now turn to the European growth agenda.  Strengthening the growth potential of our economies is crucial.  We have a whole range of pending reforms at the national level: the liberalisation of product markets; the removal of bureaucratic impediments to entrepreneurial activity; greater labour market flexibility, which facilitates the re-entry of the unemployed into the job market; and a growth-friendly composition of fiscal adjustment. Let me elaborate a little. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Product market regulations can be streamlined so as to foster competition, particularly in sheltered professions and the services sector. Extensive administrative reforms should facilitate the start-up of new firms. Moreover, judicial systems can be adjusted so as to resolve and avoid court backlogs, which hamper the conduct of business activities. Once a critical mass for such reforms is achieved, they will considerably strengthen economic dynamism, innovation and employment. These efforts should be complemented by active labour market policies, targeted at the low-skilled, the elderly and young unemployed people. This would facilitate re-entry into productive activities for those who typically face the most difficult starting position. It would also foster social cohesion despite the burden of economic adjustment facing our economies. Second, important reforms are pending at the EU level, with the implementation of the Services Directive being a very important initiative to facilitate cross-border trade in services. By reducing the market power of producers, these reforms will put downward pressure on prices and upward pressure on productivity.  Third, I believe that we should oversee national reforms to promote growth in a way that is a parallel to the way in which we oversee fiscal policies. Here we might draw inspiration from the fiscal compact and the idea of avoiding unsustainable policies in the first place and providing incentives for positive reform. In a single currency area, national reforms that affect growth potential and competitiveness are just as important as fiscal policies because they are equally essential for economic sustainability.  Fourth, many items that are considered at the national level could be considered at the EU level. For example, measures to foster labour mobility could be implemented, inter alia by facilitating the cross-border portability of pension rights. European funds could be reallocated to areas most conducive to long-term growth and durable employment opportunities. And the capacity of the European Investment Bank to finance infrastructure projects could be strengthened.  As you can see, there is a long-standing agenda on growth. It is time to implement it with determination and confidence about its longer-term benefits.  Collectively we can compete more effectively in the global economy. Collectively we can better support growth and job creation. And collectively we can preserve our common European values of fairness, social cohesion and social progress. 3. Considerations regarding the longer-term vision for economic and monetary union Let me turn to the broader question about the evolution of the euro area towards a genuine economic union – one that is commensurate with our monetary union.  As you know, I am in close contact with Presidents Herman Van Rompuy, José-Manuel Barroso and Jean-Claude Juncker to reflect on elements of a longer-term vision for our economic and monetary union. Ultimately, such a vision can be the basis for a process where objectives, progress, conditions and deadlines are specified; and where credibility is substantiated by action in the short run that is in line with long-term objectives.  Since this is a joint effort and our work is still in progress, I cannot provide specifics about this matter as yet.  But I can tell you that my reflections are founded on the central aim of securing stability and sustained prosperity for the euro area.  Price stability will remain a cornerstone of economic and monetary union, as it has been since the beginning. But in order to preserve broader economic stability, we need strengthened foundations in the fields of financial, fiscal and structural policy-making.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches The strengthened foundations should secure the past achievements of integration. They should improve the management of the euro area economy. And they should bring economic and monetary union closer to the hearts and minds of Europe’s citizens, whose ownership of our collective project of integration has been shaken by the crisis.  A key issue in this context is sovereignty.  In processes of economic integration, we often speak about giving up sovereignty. Yet integration is far from being equivalent to giving up sovereignty. There are many cases in which integration implies a “sharing” or “pooling” of sovereignty. And there are some cases where integration actually leads to more sovereignty and at a higher level.  For example, some smaller euro area countries actually regained sovereignty with the euro by regaining influence over monetary policy at a higher level.  Something similar may hold for countries joining the EU, when they can participate in the shaping of the single market rules rather than having to adjust to them. In a globalised economy, the dwindling of individual influence may actually be reversed through integration.  Of course, this is only true if countries and their citizens are involved in joint decision-making. The degree of participation is therefore much more important than the level of policy assignment to determine whether sovereignty is lost, shared or actually gained.  In the case of Europe, more and more decisions have been elevated to a supranational level because they could only be taken efficiently and effectively by accounting for interlinkages and spillovers. But at some point, when supranational institutions and processes continually gain influence, the need for greater political legitimacy becomes more and more pressing.  In some cases therefore, the first issue to consider with any possible further transfer of competencies would be the transfer of legitimacy through political accountability. If legitimacy is fully ensured at all levels, the policy assignment question can be answered on grounds of policy optimality.  Conclusion Let me conclude. As half a decade of crisis has forcefully demonstrated, macroeconomic and financial imbalances entail considerable challenges for the smooth functioning of our economic and monetary union.  Despite these challenges, our monetary policy framework, which is firmly anchored in central bank independence and a clear focus on price stability, has provided a robust basis for the ECB to deliver on its mandate. By preserving an unambiguous commitment to price stability, the ECB has made its best contribution to mitigating the fallout from the crisis. This commitment will continue to guide our policy in the time to come.  Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’  speeches 1  Agathe Côté: Strengthening financial infrastructure – the new Canadian central counterparty Remarks by Ms Agathe Côté, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Association of Quebec Women in Finance, Montréal, Quebec, 14 June 2012 *      *      * It gives me great pleasure to address the Association of Quebec Women in Finance. You are all aware that we are once again in the midst of a period of heightened financial turbulence. This current episode reminds us—if that was necessary—of how important it is to have a robust financial system. Today, I will briefly talk about the risks to which Canada’s financial system is currently exposed. However, my main focus will be on a major step that we have taken to strengthen our financial system against future shocks. I am referring to the new central counterparty service for repo transactions, which was launched on 21 February. This service, operated here in Montréal by the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), is a key initiative designed to improve the infrastructure of Canadian core funding markets. Recall that our short-term funding markets, like those of many other countries, were severely battered in 2008. These markets are not immune to further turbulence, so it is important that we take measures to increase their resilience. CDCC worked closely with the Investment Industry Association of Canada, stakeholders in the financial industry, the Bank of Canada and other regulatory authorities to create this new central counterparty. However, much remains to be done. It is my hope that, by the time I conclude my comments, you will have a greater understanding of why it is essential that we continue with the next phases of implementation, in which the volume of transactions and the number of participants with access to the counterparty will be expanded. Risks presented in the Financial System Review But first, let’s talk about risk. Today, the Bank of Canada is releasing the latest issue of its Financial System Review, in which it analyzes the principal risks weighing on our country’s financial system. I am sure it’s not news to you that these risks remain high. After a period of calm earlier this year, global financial conditions have deteriorated markedly in recent weeks as the debt crisis in Europe has intensified. Markets are skeptical about the capacity and resolve of policy-makers to address unsustainable fiscal situations, the capital adequacy of some euro-area banks and the underlying balance-of-payments problems within the euro area. If these issues are not dealt with in an orderly way, the contagion effects on global financial conditions could be significant. While less urgent than the situation in Europe, the risks surrounding sovereign debt are also affecting other regions. In particular, in the United States the spectre of a “fiscal cliff” looms over that country’s prospects for growth. More generally, weakness in global demand that is partly due to international current account imbalances continues to represent a major source of risk. Moreover, in several advanced economies, keeping policy rates low over an extended period of time may stimulate excessive risk-taking. 
2 BIS central bankers’  speeches  Here in Canada, the high level of indebtedness and the potential for a correction in the housing sector are the principal domestic risks facing the financial system. As well, the fragile situation abroad increases the probability of a negative shock to the incomes and wealth of Canadian households. To date, the crisis in Europe has had a limited impact on our financial system. Canadian markets have remained relatively stable, and our banks continue to have good access to wholesale funding markets. Nonetheless, a deterioration in the situation could have a considerable effect on Canada through trade, confidence and financial channels. Even though our financial system is solid, it is important to take further steps to bolster its ability to absorb shocks. The creation of a central counterparty for the repo market is a step in that direction. With your permission, I will now turn to the crucial role played by the repo market in Canada. The repo market Repos – transactions that involve selling a security while concurrently committing to repurchasing it at a later date for the sale price plus interest – are the economic equivalent of secured loans. Investment dealers and banks use the repo market as a source of low-cost secured financing to fund long positions and hedge short positions on securities. These activities allow market-makers to generate liquidity for the broader financial system and maintain liquid secondary markets. Other institutions, such as insurance companies and pension funds, also use the repo market as a tool to manage cash balances. Since a very large proportion of repo transactions are short term, the turnover rate in this market is high. These transactions provide the immediate margin of adjustment for financial institutions’ funding structures. To give you a sense of magnitude, on 30 March 2012, the repo positions on the securities of Canadian banks were valued at a total of Can$90 billion (approximately 5 per cent of their Canadian-dollar-denominated assets). Government of Canada securities provided the underlying collateral for almost 70 per cent of transactions. Hence, the repo market supports the functioning of crucial cash markets. In sum, the repo market is considered a core funding market in Canada, because it represents a major source of funds for financial institutions. In addition, there is no immediate substitute for this market, so if it were to cease operating, significant contagion would likely result.1 This is why we must make every effort to ensure that it remains continuously open. Risks brought to light by the crisis During the financial crisis of 2007–08, weakness in the infrastructures of some financial markets contributed to uncertainty and, although not the cause of the crisis, intensified the systemic risk. This was notably the case in repo markets. In fact, participants’ uncertainty about the valuation of collateral and the network of bilateral exposures among financial institutions exacerbated their aversion to counterparty risk, to the point that many reduced the number of trades and, in some cases, even left the market.                                                 1 J.-S. Fontaine, J. Selody and C. Wilkins, “Improving the Resilience of Core Funding Markets,” Bank of Canada Financial System Review (December 2009): 41–46. 
BIS central bankers’  speeches 3  Recall that illiquidity in the repo market was an important contributor to the near-collapse of Bear Stearns in March of 2008. Repo markets in Canada suffered a severe liquidity crunch in the autumn of that year. Following the bankruptcy of major financial institutions abroad, concerns about counterparties spread, and balance sheets were subject to severe strains. In the absence of a CCP that would allow its members to ease their balance sheets through balance-sheet netting, banks drastically curtailed their repo activity. The crisis clearly demonstrated the need for action to bolster the resilience of this market. In Canada, the Investment Industry Association of Canada, with the support of the Bank of Canada, issued a request for proposal for the development of CCP services for repos. In December 2009, CDCC was selected to provide these services. The CCP for repo transactions and risk management How does this central counterparty work? Put simply, a central counterparty functions as an intermediary in financial transactions. Through a legal process called “novation,” it becomes the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer.2  In other words, a very complex network of bilateral exposures is replaced by one exposure to a hub, the central counterparty. This process does not, however, eliminate risks? risks that are now concentrated in a single institution. As a result, for a central counterparty to contribute to reducing systemic risk, it must have solid risk-control mechanisms in place and be subject to rigorous oversight. CDCC has implemented mechanisms to manage the various risks confronting it, notably, legal, operational and financial risk. With regard to financial risk, controlling both credit and liquidity risk is key to containing overall counterparty risk in the system.3  The legal rules that govern CDCC’s management of defaults, together with the financial resources available to it for addressing credit risk and liquidity risk, enhance the stability of the repo market by ensuring an orderly winding down in the event that a major institution defaults, while also ensuring that all novated transactions are settled. During the crisis, the benefits of a central counterparty became apparent with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Thanks to the participation of Lehman in a central counterparty for derivatives, its positions on interest rate swaps – which were enormous (US$9 trillion and more than 66,000 transactions) – were unwound in an orderly and timely fashion. Thus, the market for interest rate derivatives – another core market – continued to function smoothly despite the Lehman collapse. The role of the Bank of Canada In light of the crucial role played by this central counterparty service in the efficient functioning of the repo market, the Bank of Canada considered that the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Service (CDCS) might pose a systemic risk, whereupon it designated the CDCS under the Payment Clearing and Settlement Act. Consequently, CDCS has been subject to oversight by the Bank since 30 April 2012.                                                 2 N. Chande, N. Labelle and E.

4 BIS central bankers’  speeches  The Bank’s oversight process includes reviewing significant changes to both the system and its operating rules, reviewing the results of audits, and defining standards. In carrying out its oversight mandate, the Bank works closely with the relevant financial market regulators, the Autorité des marchés financiers and the Ontario Securities Commission. This oversight will soon be based on new international standards developed with the participation of the Bank. It is worth noting that lessons learned during the creation of Canada’s central counterparty for repo transactions were very useful in the development of these new standards. Implementation of the central counterparty The metaphor frequently used by the industry to describe the financial system infrastructure is simple and appropriate: it’s called “plumbing.” Why? Because it is essential to the viability and efficient functioning of markets. As for our financial system, the plumbing is quite complicated. Hence, developing this new infrastructure took a great deal of time. It is a complex process, in terms of both creating and implementing adequate and robust risk-control mechanisms. Moreover, time is required to resolve operational issues, such as the development and testing of required software for both the central counterparty and the participants, and issues associated with the interaction between new software and existing systems. The launch of the first phase of the service therefore represents a major step. But much remains to be done. Delivery will take place in three phases. Phase one deals with bilateral repo transactions on a single Government of Canada security, although these represent only a small fraction of the market. Phase two, planned for the end of this year, will incorporate cash transactions on fixed-income securities and repo transactions negotiated by intermediaries, including those with anonymous counterparties. Finally, phase three, proposed for 2013–14, will target general-repo transactions in which any security in a predetermined basket of instruments can serve as collateral. The introduction of this last phase is expected to significantly increase the volume of trades made through the central counterparty, as well as the liquidity and efficiency of the repo market. International efforts to mitigate risk in Short-Term Funding Markets In Canada, the creation of a central counterparty will contribute significantly to limiting the risk of instability emanating from the repo market. At the international level, the Financial Stability Board is currently assessing potential reforms of repo markets and for loans of securities in the context of its work on the shadow banking sector.4  The repo market is part of this sector because it is a form of credit intermediation which, like banking intermediation, rests on maturity transformation and may include leverage effects. There are a number of possible reforms.                                                 4 Financial Stability Board, “Securities Lending and Repos: Market Overview and Financial Stability Issues,” Workstream on Securities Lending and Repos, Interim Report of the Shadow Banking Workstream 5, 15 March 2012. 
BIS central bankers’  speeches 5  One of the specific measures under consideration is the increased use of central counterparties. Another promising avenue addresses the regulation of margins to mitigate the problems associated with procyclicality. Adopting minimal, or countercyclical, margins could help to curb excessive leveraging during periods of exuberance and lessen the extent of a disruptive curtailment of leveraging during difficult periods. Moreover, increased use of central counterparties for repos could facilitate the implementation of this type of regulation. Conclusion It was my intention today to talk about risks, but even more to shed some light on the significant strides taken in Canada to improve the resilience of our financial system. One tangible, and local, example of this progress has been the creation, right here in Montréal, of a central counterparty for repo transactions. Transactions executed by this counterparty are completely transparent and well capitalized, and there are rules and procedures in place in the event of default. Today, Canada’s experience is benefiting other countries and authorities. However, it’s worth emphasizing that it was the willingness of the private and public sectors to work together that led to the creation of this counterparty. It is essential that this spirit of co-operation be maintained, because much remains to be done. The success of this counterparty depends on the subsequent phases of implementation, which will broaden its sphere of influence. We will never have a risk-free financial system. That’s why we need to take measures to render it more resilient to shocks that may occur, either from abroad or domestically. Let us make the financial system stronger to build a more stable future. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Daniel Mminele: Monetary policy implementation – the impact of the changing regulatory landscape on the policy transmission mechanism Address by Mr Daniel Mminele, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Rand Merchant Bank FICC Research Macro Forum, Cape Town, 31 May 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Good morning and thank you to Rand Merchant Bank for inviting me to what has certainly been an enlightening morning. The topic I have been asked to address you on is a very interesting one from a central bank policy perspective, and relates to an area of our work in central banking which is still evolving, and the real impact of which remains uncertain.  The two speakers before me provided some interesting insights around the fiscal and political dynamics locally, both areas which in the international context carry a fair share of the responsibility for the current sovereign debt crisis and financial market stresses. It seems quite appropriate to round off the day with a discussion on monetary policy, which has been playing an increasingly central role in recent years, given the limited, and in some cases, exhausted fiscal space, and a seeming lack of political will to meaningfully resolve the crisis. The result of this has been an unprecedented expansion in the demands on monetary policy, which necessitated an enlargement of the toolkit in a manner that one would have thought impossible only a few years ago. However, as we know, all actions have consequences, and while central bankers in many ways can be credited with coming to the rescue when fiscal policy no longer could, there are many challenges going forward, not least of which remains the illusion of unlimited intervention1 and potential for moral hazard, when to exit from these unconventional measures and ultimately how best to exit without creating another crisis. It seems we keep returning to this question of “exit”, only to get derailed again by a further upset or deterioration in the global environment.  In my remarks today I will touch on the costs of an unstable financial system and developments around macro-prudential policies, before I discuss the impact of regulatory changes on the transmission mechanism.  2. The costs of an unstable financial system The economic and social costs associated with an unstable financial system are well known. Fiscal policy went to extraordinary lengths to try and secure the stability of the real economy and the financial system, but in so doing, was sowing the seeds of the sovereign debt crisis. To remedy the situation in Europe, harsh austerity measures were implemented in order to put public finances on a sounder and more sustainable footing, and to inject the necessary confidence into financial markets. In reality, however, while one cannot doubt that such measures were implemented with the best of intentions, it is doubtful that the desired outcomes are being achieved, and in some instances these measures turned out to be self-defeating. Austerity measures came at the expense of growth, and as a consequence, public finances have not been able to recover as quickly as expected and fiscal deficit targets have not been met. The result has been that the debt crisis has lingered longer than anticipated, and ultimately spread from peripheral Europe to other countries within the Euro zone. Hence there is an argument now raging between those who continue to favour austerity and those who favour less austerity and more stimuli to support growth. The                                                  1 Monetary policy in the crisis: testing the limits of monetary policy, Herve Hannoun, Deputy General Manager, Bank for International Settlements 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches austerity versus growth debate has found its way into the political discourse, such that the euro zone fiscal pact is now being challenged with the scales seemingly now tilted more in favour of growth rather than too much austerity. The ideal scenario would some combination of measures that support growth in the short term, but do not put fiscal sustainability in the medium term at risk.  When it became clear that fiscal policy had been exhausted and in some cases over extended, monetary policy had to step in. Interest rates in a number of advanced economies had already been cut to near zero. Central banks found themselves turning to unconventional measures such as quantitative easing or balance sheet policies2 and conducting large scale interventions in financial markets to resuscitate market segments that were no longer functioning. Liquidity was provided to the dysfunctional interbank and credit market to mitigate a credit crunch and to prevent a complete collapse of the global economy. These policies were used to stabilize financial market tensions and dampen the rise in credit and liquidity risk premia. In short, the balance sheet policies were employed to target overnight and term money-market rates, long-term government bond yields and various risk spreads, with an impact on a wider range of asset prices. Via these channels the central bank actions were meant to be eventually transmitted to the real economy. These policy actions by central banks have certainly played a significant role, by preventing a higher degree of financial instability and buying some time to get the needed repairs done. Unfortunately, it seems the time bought is not being used in the most opportune manner.  3. Macro-prudential policy Given the severe repercussions of the financial crisis, the question arose as to whether “it is better to pick up the pieces after a bust or rather to try to prevent the build-up of bubbles”? Olivier Blanchard3 stressed that “financial intermediation matters” and while markets are segmented and there are specialized investors operating in specific markets, they are all linked through arbitrage. For this reason, a withdrawal by an important investor from a market (segment) might create severe distortions in asset prices and therefore policy interventions will become necessary to restore dislocated prices and to align them with fundamentals. This was quite clearly played out during the US subprime crisis. In this context he argues in favour of preventative measures, rather than to be reactive.  We have learnt firstly that systemic risk cannot be prevented by focussing only on regulation and supervision, and secondly that achieving price stability does not equate to achieving financial stability. Hence, the birth of macro-prudential policy which pursues financial stability as its objective, whereas the objective of monetary policy is price stability. The latter uses interest rates as its instrument, but it is well known that interest rates can be a blunt tool in dealing with excess leverage, extreme risk taking, or unwarranted deviations of asset prices from fundamentals. A combination of monetary and regulatory tools is needed, such as increases in regulatory capital ratios when leverage is deemed too high, or changes in margin requirements to reign in excessive asset price moves. It is true also that macro-prudential policy is not sufficient on its own to ensure financial stability, as we have seen with the euro zone debt crisis, where markets doubted the solvency of the sovereign and in this manner, fiscal policy led to financial instability. Nonetheless, I will focus purely on macro-prudential policy for now.                                                   2 Balance sheet policies involve central banks using their balance sheets to influence broader economic and/or financial conditions, particularly when the policy rates have reached their zero limits. 3 Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 In an interview4, Olivier Blanchard notes that macro-prudential measures are likely to have a more targeted impact than the policy rate on the variables they are trying to affect. Whereas the policy rate is best used primarily in response to aggregate activity and inflation, the specific macro-prudential instruments should be used to deal with specific output composition, financing, or asset price issues. The two policies have different objectives, however, the implementation of macro-prudential policies will have an impact on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, given that both work through the same channels (bank lending and balance sheets of financial institutions) and focus on the same institutions (monetary and financial).  The question is whether macro-prudential policy will amplify or dampen interest rate cycles? Jaime Caruana5 noted that the troughs may become less extreme as macro-prudential policies should reduce the likelihood of financial crises and their disinflationary consequences. Similarly, interest rate peaks may be less severe, assuming that macro-prudential policy succeeds in restraining asset price and credit booms. On the other hand, by having to contribute to financial stability and thereby placing additional weight on the risk of imbalances, there may be a need for larger interest rate increases during expansions. Interest rates, he believes, could move more symmetrically over the financial cycle and there would be reduced risk of hitting the zero lower bound and of having to resort to balance sheet policies. As I mentioned in my introduction, this is uncharted territory and there is still much research which is going into this topic. South Africa has not used any macro-prudential tools, but a number of changes have been implemented to enhance macro-prudential policy. These changes include an elevation of the Financial Stability Committee to equal status as the Monetary Policy Committee, as well as the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Committee, chaired by the Governor of the SARB and the Minister of Finance.  4. The regulatory changes and impact on the transmission mechanism The global financial crisis has forced a revision of the international regulatory framework. Reform is being implemented in a number of areas, including the strengthening of macro-prudential policies, strengthening the supervision of individual financial institutions, oversight of key market infrastructures, and the monitoring of the financial markets. Basel III capital and liquidity requirements are currently the most prominent regulatory changes with the greatest potential to impact the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Although Basel III is envisioned to increase the resilience of the banking system and in so doing, improve the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and South Africa as a member of the G20, the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision and the FSB in principle supports these regulatory reforms, there are nonetheless risks of unintended consequences associated with the implementation of these requirements. Basel III requirements are not of a macro-prudential nature, but like previous Basel requirements, are aimed at the balance sheets of commercial banks and could therefore impact economic activity and hence monetary policy. I would like to focus specifically on the liquidity framework which requires banks to adhere to a new liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) to ensure that they have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a month-long significant stress scenario. The LCR aims to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets that can be converted into cash to cover net outflows during the period of stress.                                                   4 Interview with Olivier Blanchard, IMF Survey Magazine, IMF Explores Contours of Future Macroeconomic Policy, February 12, 2010 5 Monetary Policy in a world with macro prudential policy, Speech by Jaime Caruana, General Manager of the BIS, at the SAARCFINANCE Governors’ Symposium 2011, Kerala, 11 June 2011 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches In South Africa, like in other countries, the Basel III liquidity regulations aim to reduce the reliance of banks on short-term funding. South Africa has very large and persistently high levels of income inequality, as reflected by a high gini coefficient of over 60. It is not surprising therefore, that households saving is very low, and that a large portion of the population is unable to make a significant contribution to national savings. Gross saving by the household sector has been around 1.6 per cent of GDP over the past two years. Consequently, national savings are concentrated in wholesale savings, resulting in a structural constraint, in that banks rely heavily on wholesale funding rather than retail deposits. The relatively high reliance on wholesale funding, increases the requirement in terms of both the LCR and the other component of the liquidity framework under Basel III, namely the net stable funding ratio (NSFR)6 , and therefore will result in a higher cost of funding for domestic banks. There is a double whammy, however, because at the same time, the opportunity cost to acquire high quality liquid assets will imply that there will be a decline in the supply of loanable funds. Implementing the Basel liquidity risk standards in South Africa could reduce the availability of long-term credit, particularly in South Africa where assets that meet the Basel III qualifying criteria for the new LCR are in short supply (paradoxically also as a result of having pursued responsible fiscal policies and avoided excessive government debt). This intuitively would result in a reduction in broader economic activity, without raising policy rates, and would possibly compromise the transmission mechanism based on the prevailing monetary policy settings.  South Africa implements monetary policy through a classical cash reserve system, where a liquidity shortage is created in the money market through the cash reserve requirement and other open market operations, such as the issuing of SARB debentures and reverse repos. Through the shortage, the Bank impacts on marginal cost of funding of commercial banks, as banks have to refinance this shortage at the SARB once a week at the repo rate. This places additional pressure on the demand for liquid assets, because banks refinance this shortage against eligible collateral, which is in addition to the assets needed for the prudential liquid asset requirement. I should add that one of the national discretion options available to authorities in jurisdictions with inadequate qualifying liquid assets is to make available a committed facility from the central bank, from which commercial banks can draw in times of liquidity stress. As you are all aware, the Bank has recently announced its intention to make available such a committed liquidity facility against eligible collateral to all South African banks to help them meet the required LCR. This should help avoid any abrupt changes to the business models of bank, which could both complicate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and have a detrimental effect on the real economy. The bank is presently investigating options to also deal with the challenges presented by the NSFR should it be applied in its current form.  In addition to the economic impact, the LCR may have a host of other unintended consequences, such as increasing the interlinkages with governments (although in theory it should enhance the attractiveness of corporate bonds and therefore spur activity in this segment of the market), encouraging disintermediation, as well as cross-border interlinkages, while inadvertently negatively impacting on liquidity in debt markets. Thus, under Basel III, banks may appear safer, but systemic risk may not necessarily be lower. In sum, faced with these structural constraints, the Basel III liquidity requirements may result in South African banks reducing their lending, and therefore the availability of credit to the real economy. This will most certainly have negative consequences for economic growth and employment creation, which will further reduce available savings. The BIS concedes that Basel III will impact on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, however, formal research studies are still in their infancy. While we understand the                                                  6 This funding ratio calculates the proportion of long-term assets which are funded by long term, stable funding. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 qualitative impact, it is not possible to measure it at this stage, while the impact will differ according to each country’s initial conditions. These are the issues which central banks are grappling with today and the challenges they present for the conduct of monetary policy going forward. The new Basel requirements do not suggest that there needs to be any changes to the South African monetary policy implementation framework, unless we change the operating framework from the current classical cash reserve system to an overnight targeted rate framework. South Africa’s money markets are not yet sufficiently developed to potentially justify a change from the current classical cash reserve system operating framework to an overnight target rate framework. This segment of the market needs to be developed much more, and this forms part of the on-going work at the Bank in consultation with market participants such as the Money Market Subcommittee of the Financial Markets Liaison Group. Thus, at least over the medium term, the monetary policy implementation framework in South Africa is unlikely to be affected by these regulatory changes, however, they will have an impact on the monetary policy transmission mechanism and therefore on monetary policy and interest rates and need constant monitoring.  5. Conclusion In conclusion, the global financial crisis has forced a rethink about monetary policy and financial stability, resulting in new macro prudential frameworks. The consequences thereof are still unknown but could have significant implications for the conduct of monetary policy and the institutional set up of central banks. What is certain is that the operating procedures of central banks will become much more complicated, with a much wider variety of tools available. I thank you  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: Promoting investment in Albania Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the 3d International Conference on “FDIs in Albania”, organised by the Albanian Investment and Development Agency (AIDA) and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Tirana, 11 June 2012. *      *      * Your Excellency Mr. Sali Berisha,  Dear Mr. Khalid Al Aboodi,  Dear Minister of Finance,  Dear ladies and gentlemen!  It is a special pleasure for me to address this joint conference with the Islamic Development Bank, dedicated to the promotion of investment in Albania. Allow me first to extend my thanks to Dr. Ahmed Mohamed Ali Al Madani, President of the Islamic Development Bank, for his utmost contribution to lobbying and supporting Albania’s interests in the Arab and broader world.  The Bank of Albania assesses that Albania’s macroeconomic stability has been and remains a fundamental condition steering economic agents’ investment, consumption or savings-related decision-making, not only for the present but also for the future. It is this very fundamental equilibrium in the economy that paves the way for Albania’s long-term economic and financial development.  Let me recall to you that, in present days, macro-financial situation represents the “passport” the entire economic and financial credibility of a country is built on. In an integrated market that is ever-increasingly being affected by the globalization process, macroeconomic stability exerts the same impact on foreign investors as well. It is for this reason that our monetary policy, our role as the supervisory authority for the banking sector in Albania, and our contribution to the communication between the public authorities at home, have been based on and have reflected this fundamental principle.  The Bank of Albania has succeeded in guaranteeing a favourable macroeconomic environment in the recent years. I would like to remind you that the stability of the Albanian economy has been achieved under the constant pressure of the global crisis, which has severely hit our main trading partners.  Thanks to the efforts of the Bank of Albania, successful monetary and fiscal policy mix, stimulating policies in the tax area and ongoing improvement of the business environment, the Albanian economy has recorded satisfactory growth rates ranging 3–4% in real annual terms. This growth has been achieved amidst an environment characterized by stable prices and a balanced exchange rate. Albania’s financial stability has, in no single moment, been put into question, and the banking system, which enjoys buoyant liquidity situation, continues to increase financial intermediation in the economy.  Allow me now to elaborate on these issues. The primary objective of the Bank of Albania is to maintain consumer price stability, which in quantitative terms is expressed as the annual increase in prices in the 2–4% range and targeting the midpoint of 3%. The Bank of Albania has successfully achieved this objective.  Different surveys show that economic agents report stable expectations for a low inflation. This consistent profile of our monetary policy has proved particularly useful in the last few years. We have had greater flexibility to implement a prudent easing monetary policy that promotes investment and consumption at home. Over a several-month period, the Bank of Albania has made a number of decisions for cutting the key interest rate in the economy, the one-week interest rate on repurchase agreements, to its record low of 4.25%. It is a pleasure 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  to note that the degree of pass-through to the economy is satisfactory and in accordance with the time lags in the monetary transmission mechanism. During this easing cycle, the annual increase in the inflation rate has remained under control and lek’s exchange rate has been stable.  As a result, foreign direct investment and other portfolio flows have been stable, financing the major part of economic agents’ current demand for foreign currency. Macroeconomic stability is not an exclusive task of the central bank’s activity, but it reflects broadly the sharing of the same principle and harmonization of actions with fiscal policy.  Financial system’s stability, and the banking sector’s stability in particular, is the second main pillar of our activity. I can state that, in the recent years, we have devoted most of our capacities to meeting this objective.  The challenges have been numerous considering that banking activity reflects not only the stability of the institution itself, but also the overall economic conditions. However, in close cooperation with the banking industry, we have succeeded in taking some measures that have enhanced the banking system’s resilience.  As a result, despite the slower credit growth rate and lower credit quality, the banking sector continues to generate profit and remains well capitalized and liquid. In March, capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.9%, while liquid assets accounted for almost one-third of total sector’s assets. The banking sector has expanded its activity driven mainly by the performance of public deposits, which continue to grow at buoyant rates.  We are, however, aware of the risks exposed during this period characterized by numerous unstable developments in global and regional economy. Therefore, our supervision has placed great emphasis on identifying the various risks to banking activity, improving the banking sector’s ability to manage these risks and strengthening the legal and operational framework to address them in case of their materialization.  In the wake of the global economic crisis, many countries are redesigning their economic development agendas and models. Throughout many years, the Bank of Albania has initiated, encouraged and supported this discussion by engaging in an open communication with the public authorities, business community and academic circles.  Our opinion is that economic development policies should contribute to setting a better balance between the development priorities of the sectors of the economy, by supporting agriculture and production. One of our immediate objectives is enhancing the economic capacities that improve the competitiveness of our products and benefit more from foreign demand. To this purpose, the development and further perfection of financial infrastructure, as well as the qualitative improvement of technology, are, among others, a priority. We must ensure a well-educated labour force, able to adapt to the international labour market, in addition to the local one. Therefore, the education-related policies on the younger generation must, above all, ensure the quality of education and incorporate programmes that assign greater importance to its practical orientation.  The Bank of Albania is now very seriously committed to its public financial literacy programme. In this context, we have designed and implemented a series of projects and cooperation initiatives, covering different age groups and geographical areas across the country.  It is clear that these objectives cannot be accomplished by the simple wave of a magic wand. They are even hard to be accomplished in due time and with the capacities of a single economy. Albania is indeed a small economy but thanks to continuous reforms, it has turned into an attractive country to foreign investors. Our vision has been and remains open to any regional initiatives. We are able to become part of joint regional projects, thus providing evidence for the great absorptive capacity for big investments and serious investors.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Therefore, the formulation of policies for attracting foreign investment, coupled with the constant improvement of the business climate and relevant legal framework, should be continuous part of the country’s economic development strategy.  Dear guests,  Despite being a small country, Albania represents a vibrant economy with vital people who are able to undertake wide-ranging business intitiatives.  Moreover, our country shares a considerable part of its official borders with Albanian-inhabited areas, hence providing a different quantitative and geographical dimension to various potential business initiatives. I believe that Albania is one of the countries currently being listed among the distinguished European countries, enjoying stable macroeconomic and financial stability, and economic growth.  We have ample natural resources, fantastic diversity of climate, cultures, social, ethnographic and geographical features, qualified labour force, admirable flexibility of private entrepreneurship and an improved legal framework. For these reasons, I avail myself of this opportunity to invite you to increase your interest in Albania and make it part of your investment or partnership projects. I am strongly confident that this will not only contribute to Albania’s and the Albanian people prosperity in the future, but it will also represent a safe investment alternative.  Thank you for your attention and I wish you all great success!  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Andreas Dombret: The present state of the euro-area sovereign debt crisis Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Macro Conference, London, 12 June 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Having joined the Board of the Bundesbank only two years ago after a long career in banking, I am, once again, delighted to address senior market participants. I am acutely aware of the importance to exchange information on the euro-area sovereign debt crisis not only among central bankers and policymakers but also with the markets. First of all, before commenting on the sovereign debt crisis, I would like to remind you of a success story. More than 330 million people in the euro area are benefiting today from a single currency, which was introduced in 1999. The euro is not only our most visible symbol of European integration. While the motivation for its introduction was predominantly political, the euro has been a success in economic terms, too. Since its introduction, its internal value has been at least as stable as the earlier national currencies. The average inflation rate has stood at 2%. I call this a true success. That is all well and good, you may say, but some of you may be wondering whether such a positive verdict has not been refuted by the most recent upheavals in the euro area. Indeed, some investors are sceptical about the euro, and more than just a few are predicting the break-up of the currency union, or at least the departure of individual member states. In plain language, the central question in my remarks today is “Can the euro make it, and how?” The answer to the first part of this question is crystal clear: “Yes, it can and it will.” To answer the “how”, I shall proceed in two stages: first, by explaining how the crisis came about and, second, by describing Europe’s response so far and, to our mind, future actions needed. 2. Analysis of the crisis  There is no doubt that the euro-area sovereign debt crisis, which was triggered by the global financial and economic crisis, has been the greatest challenge ever faced by European Monetary Union. The European Monetary Union is certainly at a crossroads. The more pressing question, though, is what European Monetary Union will look like over the medium to long term. Will monetary policy, for example, be able to deliver price stability as it did in the past? And how should it be organised in order to do so? When it comes to solving the current crisis, it is essential to take account of the root causes as well as of the particular features of European Monetary Union. The root causes of the crisis are well known by now, so I shall be brief on this. The convergence of long-term interest rates at low levels attracted large capital flows to the peripheral countries of the euro area. Yet, those member states failed in many respects to put these funds to productive use. Instead, they spent the cheap money on public or private consumption – as in Greece and Portugal – or they allowed their residential construction sectors to boom, which eventually led to oversized and vulnerable banking sectors – as in Ireland and Spain. Sharp reversals of credit booms or persistent losses in competitiveness can very easily put the solvency of governments at risk – which is exactly what happened. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches And this is of particular relevance in a monetary union, since member states are no longer capable to offset losses in competitiveness by devaluing their exchange rates. Higher-than-average rises in unit labour costs therefore require internal and often painful adjustments in order to regain price competitiveness in international goods and services markets. In a nutshell, several member states failed to meet the requirements of European Monetary Union membership. They did not implement the necessary adjustments. The inherent risk of monetary union was recognised right from the outset, however. Specifically, the combination of a single monetary policy with national fiscal policies distinguishes the euro area from federal republics like the United States or unitary countries like the United Kingdom. This setup increases the deficit bias and implies the incentive to take advantage of central bank balance sheets to mutualise sovereign debt in one way or another among the taxpayers of different nations. The founding fathers of European Monetary Union had these disincentives very much in mind when they agreed on the institutional arrangements. First of all, the eurosystem was mandated with a single primary objective, namely maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole. Moreover, the no bail-out principle, the prohibition of monetary state financing by the eurosystem, and the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were all put in place to prevent idleness on the part of member states. Nevertheless, the crisis also made obvious the shortcomings of the institutional framework of European Monetary Union. The set of rules did not prevent the member states from making the errors I mentioned. Implementation of the fiscal rules was too lax. Moreover, the fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact were, in effect, relaxed some two years before the financial crisis broke out in 2007, following a strident campaign by Germany and France to make the pact “smarter”. Furthermore, the designers of the framework turned a blind eye to the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances and their risks to fiscal sustainability as well as to financial stability. 3. Europe’s response to the crisis 3.1 Crisis resolution in the short run Euro-area fiscal and monetary policymakers have taken extraordinary measures to contain the crisis and maintain financial stability. First of all, the euro-area member states and the IMF supported Greece with bilateral loans. Then, a temporary stabilisation mechanism was established, the EFSF. As you know, its beneficiaries have been Ireland, Portugal and, including a second adjustment programme, Greece. Over the course of the sovereign debt crisis, the effective lending volume of the EFSF has been increased, the lending conditions have been relaxed, and the toolbox of the EFSF has been extended. A permanent mechanism, the ESM, with a more resilient funding structure, has been established; it is scheduled to replace the EFSF in summer of this year and to operate temporarily alongside the EFSF. Recently, the euro-area finance ministers agreed to raise the ceiling for combined ESM and EFSF lending to €700 billion. Moreover, the IMF member countries pledged over $430 billion in new loans to the Fund in order to erect a global firewall. The European and global firewalls alike have been substantially strengthened over the past two years. Are their levels now sufficient? Or should European leaders increase their volume even further? My opinion in this regard is that policymakers should refrain from a wild goose chase in pursuit of ever higher firewalls. Making the firewalls higher and higher will not resolve the crisis. Instead, policymakers should care that firewalls do not fall into a credibility trap owing to unavoidable political or financial constraints. Generally speaking, a firewall cannot extinguish a fire. It only buys time until sustainable measures become effective. Therefore, the fire has to be extinguished by other means. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Monetary policy cannot extinguish the fire either. This is not to deny that the monetary policy of the eurosystem has helped to stabilise the financial system of the euro area and beyond. Our policy stance remains rather accommodative. In effect, monetary policy is more expansive than the key interest rate of 1% might suggest. Owing to excess liquidity, market rates are well below that margin. The large excess liquidity results from the non-standard policy measures of the eurosystem. These include an extended list of eligible collateral, the full allotment policy and the provision of very long-term refinancing operations with maturities of up to three years. The Securities Markets Programme and the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme are additional non-standard eurosystem measures. All these measures, I wish to emphasise, are temporary in nature. The recent setback in equity and credit markets, along with still strong flight-to-safety and flight-to-liquidity flows in sovereign bonds, are mainly the result of political uncertainty in Europe. This reminds European governments that they cannot afford to ease off in their reform and consolidation efforts. But let me also point to the inherent risks and side effects of the central bank measures. Over the medium to long term, continued provision of ample liquidity might, through various channels, de-anchor inflation expectations, which would translate into higher inflation risks. It could also pave the way for new asset bubbles, thereby sowing the seeds of the next crisis. Pointing out the risks and side effects of crisis measures does not imply that the Bundesbank wishes to obstruct the stabilisation of the euro. Quite the opposite. We are aiming to strengthen the framework of the euro and to ensure that we continue to have a stable euro in the future. Recurring suggestions to the contrary, for example by George Soros, are therefore ill-advised. A disintegration of the currency union would be linked to extremely high costs and risks. That’s why such a scenario cannot be anyone’s goal. Yet this does not imply that Germany becomes open to blackmail and promises guarantees without control. This would indeed erode the stability basis of the currency union. Some argue, of course, that the eurosystem needs to do whatever it takes to maintain the euro – particularly those who consider the ECB and the national central banks to be the “last men standing”. However, it should be borne in mind that it makes a substantial difference whether a non-monetary union central bank – such as the Fed or the Bank of England – or the eurosystem uses its balance sheet as a policy instrument. In the latter case, balance-sheet policies and the implicit risk of losses would imply a shift of burdens among the taxpayers of different member states. But since it is taxpayers’ money, it is up to national parliaments and not central banks to decide on such a shift. Hence, monetary policy must not sacrifice its stability orientation and its credibility in fighting inflation, the more so as monetary policy cannot resolve the crisis anyway. Addressing the sovereign debt crisis is and remains, first and foremost, a fiscal policy task. Nevertheless, the fiscal and economic policy reforms needed to bring about a lasting solution are, in the short run, costly – both politically and economically. Therefore, a major challenge for monetary policy is that its unconventional measures and the temporary relief they afford are not seen as an excuse to delay, or even reverse, these reforms. Otherwise, monetary policy risks being taken hostage by fiscal policy. This would do lasting damage – to central banks’ credibility, to their ability to maintain price stability, and to public acceptance of monetary union as a whole.  3.2 Sustainable crisis resolution But what fiscal and economic policy action is needed to achieve a lasting solution to the current crisis and to prevent future crises? In my view, three conditions have to be met. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches 1. The first of these conditions is the rigorous implementation of budgetary consolidation and growth-enhancing structural reforms in the member states of European Monetary Union. 2. The second is a reform of the framework of the European Monetary Union that takes recent experience into account. 3. The third condition is further progress in financial regulation. Financial regulation is a far-reaching and complex field, and I do not wish to go into that today. But please allow me to highlight just two points. The first is that, when European Monetary Union was established, financial markets were expected to act as an additional corrective measure against unsound fiscal policies. History has taught us, however, that because of low risk awareness, markets have not worked effectively as a timely sanctioning mechanism – and once they finally became aware of the risks, the response was quick and fierce. Nevertheless, the watchdog function of financial markets – of all of you here today – is indispensable. To be effective, financial regulation has to encourage investors to become aware of the risks and to signal them at an earlier stage. The second point I would like to mention is the painful lesson that contagion, via the financial system, has proven to be the Achilles heel of European Monetary Union. Hence, improving the resilience of the financial system, even though it is a major policy goal across the world, is particularly important in the context of our monetary union. But let me now elaborate on the first and the second requirements of the euro area for overcoming the crisis – fiscal and structural reforms in the member states as well as a better framework for European Monetary Union. Significant progress has already been made with regard to budget consolidation and, to a lesser extent, in terms of structural reforms. This is true of the programme countries which have to comply with the conditions of the respective adjustment programmes. And it is also true of Italy and Spain, the third and fourth-largest euro-area economies, which have seen a significant rise in their bond yields. Their governments have embarked on labour market reforms and spending cuts. But there is no room for complacency. Flagging eagerness or too little disclosure of looming risks will be penalised immediately. We have to bear in mind that market pressure – together with political pressure – has fostered reforms and hopefully keeps them on track. By the same token, however, investors should have some patience for reform measures to unfold. True, we are now in the third year of the sovereign debt crisis, and too often precious time has been wasted. But we should not forget that the adverse developments that led to the sovereign debt crisis emerged over a decade. Clearly, they cannot be reversed in a matter of weeks. The road to recovery is long and uneven; backlashes are to be expected. Looking at Spain, the country on which markets are focusing presently, I wish to acknowledge that the government has already taken bold steps to address structural weaknesses, for example by overhauling some of the rigid labour rules. Yet it has become clear that the Spanish banking system needs more capital. Therefore, I appreciate the intention of the Spanish government to seek financial assistance from euro area member states. The financial assistance will be provided by the EFSF/ESM for the recapitalisation of Spanish financial institutions. Funds would not be provided directly to the banks but, in line with current EFSF/ESM rules, be channelled through the Spanish state, in this case the restructuring fund FROB. I am optimistic that this package will effectively mitigate the negative feedback loops between the banks’ deleveraging and the real economy. But quick and decisive action is now warranted in Spain, and any further delay should be avoided, as the longer one waits, the more expensive it is likely to get. Conditionality only applies to the banking sector, but this makes it all the more important that the Spanish government itself pushes vigorously ahead with the reforms to tackle the structural problems of the Spanish economy. It is definitely not the task of the eurosystem to substitute for national fiscal policies. This is true with regard to Spain, and it is particularly true with regard to Greece. Greece must do 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 everything in its power to strengthen its competitiveness. The country needs to stick to the agreed austerity and structural reform measures – no ifs, no buts. There is no basis for external aid without the agreed reform program. There can be no exception for Greece in this regard, as this would inevitably undermine the balance of give-and-take in other program countries, too. The repeat elections will show whether the Greek voters still support this way forward. If not, Greece must be aware that it puts further aid at risk. The consequences would be severe, and most severe for Greece itself. As the Bundesbank has stressed time and again, the way Europe deals with the crisis in Greece will have far-reaching implications for the nature of European Monetary Union as a stability union. This is a deeply political question, and we have come to a point where policymakers can no longer avoid taking sides. Attempting to dodge this decision and muddling through as before no longer is an option. Rather, a further muddling through would also be an – implicit – response, and one of the least desirable ones, both from the perspective of a stability-oriented monetary policy and with regard to overcoming the crisis. A crucial question with regard to public finances in European Monetary Union is whether the right cure is to prescribe frontloaded consolidation for all euro-area countries. A considerable number of experts are vehemently opposed to this approach. Paul Krugman, for example, sees the euro area spiralling into disaster. And George Soros is accusing many − including the Bundesbank, with its emphasis on frontloaded consolidation − of destroying the euro. It will hardly come as a surprise to you that I do not share such views. Rather, I suggest that dragging out fiscal adjustment would have major negative effects. Of course, it is correct to say that, in normal times, consolidation dampens economic growth. Current circumstances, however, are anything but normal, and it is an illusion to believe that backloading consolidation would help to restore confidence. The current crisis is essentially one of confidence. On the other hand, one should not exaggerate the risks of a more restrictive fiscal policy stance, all the more so as the rescue packages and the extremely accommodative monetary policy stance do help to cushion the adjustment. The long-term benefits of frontloaded consolidation, I am convinced, will significantly exceed the short-run negative effects. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing discussion on whether the euro area should shift its focus from austerity towards growth. Indeed, the crisis cannot be overcome without growth. This is very much undeniable. What is now being hotly disputed is the question of what constitutes the right approach to stimulating growth. After ECB President Mario Draghi proposed a growth compact, he was getting applause from all quarters as long as he did not spell out what such a growth compact should comprise. He was not promoting a relaxation of the austerity course – either in programme countries or in countries facing close market scrutiny, nor in countries that are considered to have more fiscal leeway. On the contrary: He denied the existence of a contradiction between the goals of consolidation and growth. Instead, he pointed to the need for structural reforms in all member states of the euro area, in particular concerning product markets and labour markets. In this sense, I appreciate the Portuguese Prime Minister’s support for Mario Draghi. He was quoted as saying: “There are no overnight structural reforms and the effects do not show up immediately, but we know that our capacity to grow depends on these reforms. They are the ones we are implementing.” This could not have been expressed any better and clearer. And I am confident that, once the implementation of structural reforms has started, investors will return even before the effects of these reforms have fully unfolded. Those who are currently short in European sovereign debt and the euro will have to decide when the right time has come to go long again. The second requirement for a lasting solution to the current crisis and the prevention of future crises is the much needed strengthening of European Monetary Union’s institutional framework. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches For me, right now, it has become evident that European Monetary Union’s constitutional setting is far from being sustainable. To make European Monetary Union sustainable two paths can be followed that I will briefly discuss subsequently: truly improving the Maastricht Treaty or building the foundations of a fiscal union. With respect to the shortcomings that I have mentioned, we have already seen a number of accomplishments. The fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact have been reinforced. The introduction of a reversed majority rule, for example, makes it more difficult for countries with excessive deficits to avoid sanctions. Second, member states have agreed to launch a Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure in the euro area. The purpose of macroeconomic surveillance is to identify potential risks early on, to prevent the emergence of harmful imbalances, and to correct excessive imbalances that already exist. Third, the Heads of State and Government of the euro-area countries have agreed to “move towards a stronger economic union” and have announced a fiscal compact. The key component of the fiscal compact is a further strengthening of the commitment to bring the budgets of the member states at least close to balance in structural terms. To this end, fiscal rules will be tightened further at the EU level, and new rules will be introduced nationally. The UK has, unfortunately, not agreed to the fiscal compact. However, I appreciate that the Irish voters have given their clear “yes”. While the fiscal compact is certainly a major step in the right direction, it is far from being the cornerstone of a “fiscal union” in the euro area. The fiscal compact aims at strengthening the current framework, but its success will hinge crucially on the member states’ willingness to implement and apply the rules. European authorities are not equipped with a supranational right to intervene in national budgets when member states do not apply the rules properly. Therefore, the fiscal compact – which has not been ratified by all member states yet – does not justify calls for monetary policymakers to further extend central banks’ balance sheets. Nor does it substantiate any extensive joint liability. Against this background the recent proposals of a so called banking union appear to be premature. Such a banking union, potentially comprising a euro area deposit-guarantee system, a euro area resolution fund and common euro area supervision for the largest and systemically important banking groups could very well represent a sensible step forward. Yet it has to follow a deeper fiscal union as it would imply significantly increased risk sharing amongst countries. Introducing a banking union without having established a genuine, democratically legitimated fiscal union would risk undermining the no bail-out clause and the disciplining effects of financial markets on fiscal policy. From a formal perspective it necessitates amending the EU Treaty – meaning it is very unlikely to be a short-term fix to the current challenges mainly related to recapitalisation needs in some banking systems, to political risks and to contagion effects within the euro area. The same is true regarding the proposed introduction of eurobonds. This is where I respectfully disagree with Olivier Blanchard, the IMF chief economist, who was quoted as saying: “… the Germans had good reason to reject bearing the brunt of irresponsible policies by other states. But now we have a fiscal treaty.” And he concluded: “The Germans should accept that the eurozone is going by way of eurobonds.” Under the current framework, the issuance of commonly guaranteed sovereign bonds would actually increase the existing mismatch between liability and control. I think, that, at least for the time being, euro-area governments have been reluctant to surrender their fiscal autonomy to a European authority. 4. Conclusion The euro area consists of independent member states. Each member state has its own constitutional tradition which has to be respected by its government. To some extent, the status of the euro area is similar to the Articles of Confederation drawn up in the late 1770s, which legally established the United States of America and served as its first constitution. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 We do not necessarily have to become a United States of Europe. It is quite possible that a reformed Maastricht framework of truly self-responsible member states – in other words, the European Monetary Union as it was planned to be – will guide us to a sustainable monetary union. Or the peoples of Europe might indeed make the leap to a substantial deepening of European integration, particularly in terms of economic and fiscal policies. Both options are viable. The decisions taken up to now do not yet indicate which direction Europe will take. However, there is absolutely no doubt as to the political will to ensure the continuity of European Monetary Union. Especially to observers from outside the euro area, and given the often slow decision-making processes, the strength of this commitment is underestimated. We in the euro area believe in the continuity of the euro. And if the euro area embarks on the necessary reforms that I have outlined today, it will emerge from the crisis stronger than ever. Thank you very much for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Yaseen Anwar: International regulatory initiatives to enhance global financial stability Speech by Mr Yaseen Anwar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the 9th Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) Summit, hosted by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, Istanbul, 16 May 2012. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, the Secretary General IFSB, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen!  It is a pleasure and an honor to join you at this 9th IFSB Summit. I am greatful to IFSB for inviting me to share my views on “international regulatory initiatives to enhance global financial stability” with this esteemed audience. In my remarks today I will briefly discuss the events that lead to recent reforms, importance of regulatory initiative introduced so far and Pakistan’s standing.  The crises that hit the global financial landscape during 2007 remains the worst since the great depression of 1930s. Though originating from financial markets and innovative “opaque” financial products, it impacted virtually every aspect of the world economy with consequences affecting the masses. The instruments that were meant to disperse financial risks instead allowed financial institutions in general and the banking system in particular to become highly leveraged that ultimately lead to financial meltdown. As a result, it not only put the innovations in the financial markets under the spotlight, but also singled-out regulatory and supervisory weaknesses in assessing the risks associated with financial institutions, markets and innovative financial products. The Euro region still faces the effects of the financial turbulence in the form of sovereign debt crisis. The fragile GDP growth and the unemployment data in the UK, USA and other crisis hit advanced economies still falls short of the pre-crisis level. On a positive note, the financial crisis provided valuable lessons for improving the effectiveness of financial system regulation and supervision. To policymakers, it reminded that the present state of the international financial system requires a complete overhaul of the functioning of the markets and institutions. From supervisory perspectives, it showed that the available prudential regulations are simply not effective and prudent enough to ensure financial system stability.  The lessons learnt from the financial crisis signify the far-reaching changes in the structure and functioning of the financial systems and institutions. The international regulatory bodies including Financial Stability Board (FSB), IMF and BIS along with national supervisory bodies have developed a set of regulatory and supervisory reforms that aim at increasing the effectiveness of financial sector supervision. Furthermore, the G-20 leaders at various Summits have endorsed the policy framework recommended by FSB and BCBS, which has made countries reach a consensus on the selection of a reforms agenda. Much of the focus of the reforms is on improving the soundness of the banking system, addressing the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs), developing macroprudential policy tools, strengthening accounting standards, disclosure requirements and crisis resolution framework.  We know that excessive leveraging by the banking sector, particularly in advanced countries was one of the key reasons that lead to the recent crisis. Banks took excessive on and off-balance sheet exposures while maintaining an inferior quality of capital base with insufficient liquidity buffers. In order to avoid such situations in the future, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced fundamental reforms in the Basel II capital adequacy regime by issuing a number of reforms and enhancements of the existing the Basel framework. These enhancements commonly referred to as Basel III are aimed at 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches raising the level and quality of capital, introduction of leverage ratio, capital conservation buffer, counter cyclical capital buffer and liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios.  Similarly, in order to facilitate the national supervisory authorities and small and medium sized banks and to avoid a sudden credit crunch in already fragile economies, the BCBS also set a rather relaxed timeline from 2013 to 2019 for the adoption of Basel III. It is therefore expected that increased capital requirements and further consolidation in international banking will prove to be a major step towards promoting financial stability. However since Basel III only affects banks, the regulators of other financial sectors such as insurance are expected to encourage the implementation of solvency II for insurance companies in order to reduce the presence of shadow banking and restrict the risk to move towards less regulated entities or creating regulatory arbitrage.  In recent times, an important reforms measure being pursued is to improve regulation and oversight of Shadow Institutions, so as to limit arbitrage opportunities, arising from the transfer of risk to relatively less regulated areas/sectors. The regulators therefore, are now focusing on minimizing the regulatory gaps in the shadow banking framework. To bridge this gap, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is working closely on the development of an effective regulatory regime for shadow banking system that would largely focus on a) mitigating any spill-over between regular and shadow banking as banks are part of the intermediation chain of the shadow banking sector, b) reducing buildup of leverage in shadow banking through securitization, c) assessing systemic risk posed by shadow banking, d) reducing pro-cyclicality incentives posed by secured lending (REPOs) and e) reducing vulnerability of Money Market funds to possible runs. While focusing on improving the soundness of financial institutions, the reforms emphasized heavily on the global and national Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) and the moral hazards they pose while being vulnerable. Since the initiation of reforms, there has been considerable debate on the identification of SIFIs and the institutions that have the capacity to become SIFIs. Factors such as institution size, suitability and interconnectedness including “time varying judgment based assessments” have been prescribed for identification of SIFIs. Under the new reforms agenda, emphasis is on changing Too Big To Fail (TBTF) status of SIFIs and for devising a resolution regime as well as a safe exit mechanism for these entities. Further, supervisory authorities are focusing on enhanced supervision of SIFIs to mitigate the financial risks propagated by them through interconnectedness with other institutions that cause system-wide distress. Similarly a multipronged strategy has been adopted for addressing the risks posed by G-SIFIs (Global SIFIs) that comprise development of a new international standard for resolution regimes, more intensive and effective supervision, and requirements for cross-border cooperation, recovery, and resolution planning. The reforms also impose a cost on the SIFIs in the form of increased capital requirements ranging from 1% to 2.5% of Risk Weighted Assets for enjoying economies of scale and scope and to have higher loss absorbing capacity. As per FSB and BCBS assessment, the long term economic benefits of this additional capital requirement in terms of greater resilience of these institutions far exceed the modest temporary decline of GDP over the implementation horizon.  Another significant regulatory initiative in the post-crisis period has been greater focus on adopting a macroprudential framework along with traditional inflation targeting and monetary policy models. Central banks and regulatory bodies who traditionally have been using microprudential tools to ensure financial system stability are now increasingly using macroprudential tools along with traditional microprudential tools to ensure the soundness and stability of the financial system. The scope of the macroprudential policy framework is very broad and includes (a) identifying, monitoring and limiting systemic risks, (b) designing and calibrating instruments for executing macroprudential policies and (c) building institutional and governance arrangements. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Though at initial stage, the macroprudential framework has already started delivering key results including broader coverage of central bank financial stability analysis and monitoring of systemic risks. Furthermore, much work is done in closing data gaps and coming up with techniques to assess systemic risks and development of new macroprudential tools that have the capacity to identify systemic risk in a forward-looking way. The stress testing frameworks have also been redesigned by the regulators that incorporate extreme shocks (tail risk) to capture systemic risk and to identify the effects of macroeconomic vulnerabilities on individual institutions as well as on the overall financial system. However, the challenging task of building institutional and governance arrangements call for additional debate among policy makers. The post crisis reforms also stress the need to improve and bring uniformity in international accounting standards. In this regard, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) initiated a convergence project of their accounting standards and practices. The FSB made recommendations for converged accounting standards of IASB and FASB in four areas including lending activities, impairment of financial assets, addressing valuation uncertainty in fair value measurement guidance and offsetting/netting of financial instruments. Accordingly, the IASB and the FASB are jointly developing a common impairment model to assess and record the impairment in the value of financial assets/instruments. Both Boards have also agreed to expand the scope of their joint project of financial instruments to address netting financial assets and liabilities on the statement of financial position. Furthermore, disclosure requirements have also been revisited in the reforms agenda. Much of the focus has been on improved disclosures on structured credit products, instruments and exposures taken in Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), and on- and off- balance sheet items of banks. Similarly, Basel III also improved its disclosure requirements for exposures in securitization, off-balance sheet exposures and exposures in asset-backed papers and mortgage-backed securities. In a recent survey organized by the FSB it was found that the disclosure recommendations have improved the disclosure practices in certain OECD countries. However, it is felt that the disclosure on SPE securitization and exposure before and after hedging need certain improvements.  The financial crisis resolution framework has also been revisited in the post-crisis period and its scope has been enhanced to an integrated crisis management and resolution framework. Similarly, the FSB has put forward the principles for cross-border cooperation on crisis management that includes effective coordination amongst the national supervisory agencies, central banks and government finance ministries for making advanced preparations for managing the financial crises.  In the backdrop of the recent Global Financial Crises, the remuneration of Directors and Executives of banks and financial institutions have lately come under scrutiny around the globe. In order to put things in the right direction, there has been a growing effort globally to address the issues related to rationalization of compensation in the financial sector. Institutions like BIS, FSB and many national regulators like FSA, APRA and HKMA, among others, have made purposeful attempts to bring the issue of excessive remunerations to the forefront and make it more transparent and fair, not only by making enhanced disclosure requirements, but also drawing a detailed structure of requirements and guidelines for determining the remuneration and compensation of executives. FSB issued “Principles for Sound Compensation Practices” in April 2009 and relevant “Implementation Standards” in September 2009. Both these documents were later adopted in a consolidated form by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in January 2010.  Pakistan is a small, open economy, with domestically an active financial sector with limited interconnectedness with advanced economies. Like many other developing countries, it did not face the direct impact of the crisis on its banking system and financial markets. In terms of banking concentration, top 5 banks (all locally incorporated) account for 51% of industry 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches assets; while foreign assets of the system are 10.4% of total assets. Moreover locally-incorporated banks and most foreign branches don’t have significant exposures to the complex financial assets that caused the financial meltdown in the U.S. and Europe. SBP has always required banks to meet higher capital and liquidity standards, exceeding international norms in several areas. More importantly, we have a strong legal framework, which has been tested for effectiveness during the last decade and half. SBP has successfully restructured a number of banks, successfully demonstrating the problem bank resolution regime.  SBP being the regulator of the banking sector, has introduced and implemented key regulatory reforms and prudential measures to ensure financial system stability. Further, in order to align its regulatory framework with international regulatory standards and best practices, it regularly reviews and evaluates the standards issued by them for their possible implementation keeping in view our own local legal, regulatory and economic environment.  Similarly, SBP has taken steps to improve the effectiveness of macroprudential supervision by revising its prudential regulations like rationalization of loan classification and loan loss provisioning requirements whereby the loan loss provisioning framework was made more stringent during economic booms and relaxed during stressed economic conditions. In addition, SBP has devised a stress testing mechanism that not only stress tests the solvency and liquidity profile of the banking system under various extreme scenarios but also conducts macroeconomic stress testing under which macroeconomic indicators are set to influence the financials and solvency and liquidity profile of the banks.  We are also working on the subject of Consolidated Supervision of Conglomerates having direct or indirect holdings or influence on banks through shareholdings as well as large exposures. A legal framework is being formulated in consultation and coordination with the regulator of the non-banking sector i.e., Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that this framework will provide an overarching supervisory control over the major stakeholders of the financial services. Additionally, the disclosure standards for banks are being revised to make performance of the banks more transparent and management of the banks more accountable. While the regulatory reforms agenda being pursued vigorously by policy makers and regulatory bodies across the globe is likely to strengthen the financial system and may possibly be instrumental in preventing financial crisis in the foreseeable future, history says that reforms initiated after each crisis could not prevent the next crisis and each time the nature and dimension of the crisis was different from the earlier ones. This suggests that there may be fundamental and structural problems with the financial system like risk transfer rather than risk sharing, development of speculative products in the name of risk management instruments (derivatives), allowing unprecedented growth of the financial sector without any comparable growth in the real sector etc. Incidentally, these are some of the key features and principles of Islamic Finance as it believes in risk sharing, encourages growth of the financial sector in tandem with the real sector and prohibits investment in speculative activities. I would thus suggest that national and international supervisory authorities to objectively evaluate the potential of Islamic Finance principles in mitigating the existential risks faced by the financial system. I would also request Islamic Finance scholars and practitioners to reach out to their conventional counterparts to highlight the potential of the Islamic Finance system addressing the issues faced by the financial system.  Finally, I will reiterate that every crisis brings an opportunity, and it is upon us how we benefit from it. Let this crisis be the one whose lessons help us in improving the soundness and stability of international and domestic financial systems.  Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Stefan Ingves: Financial crises and financial regulation – thoughts after five turbulent years Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to the Swedish Economics Association, Stockholm, 13 June 2012. *      *      * Palmstruch and the Bank of the Estates of the Realm In 1656, Johan Palmstruch founded Sweden’s first bank, Stockholms Banco. In 1661, to facilitate the handling of money, Palmstruch launched the first banknotes. They were initially successful. But it all ended in a bank failure after Palmstruch became tempted to issue too many banknotes in relation to the underlying value that was deposited in the bank. In response to this failure, the Riksdag resolved to form the Bank of the Estates of the Realm in 1668. This bank was later renamed the Riksbank and is today the world’s oldest central bank.  Palmstruch’s story illustrates the importance of price stability – and also the risks of financial instability.  Today, I would like to discuss financial crises and financial regulation from the perspective of the national economy. I want to explain the value of orderly and well-reasoned financial regulations for the prevention of financial crises. Banks are not normal companies. For one thing, banks in crisis can result in very large costs for the entire economy. The public sector thus has an obligation towards the citizens to attempt to prevent and manage financial crises to the best of its ability.  I will start by touching on the benefits and risks of a financial system, and how these can be balanced against each other. I will then go on to describe the global financial crisis and how it was met. Following this, I will discuss how the global financial crisis turned into a euro crisis, and the role the banks are playing in this crisis. In the final part of my speech, I will try to provide some answers as to how society can better avoid crises like this in the future. The economic balance between benefit and risks in the financial sector I have elsewhere described the banking system as a motorway junction for the economy. In the banks, and, more generally, in the financial system, households’ and companies’ income and expenditure meet like a flow of traffic coming from all directions. A robust structure is needed to make this interaction proceed smoothly. When a lot of traffic is moving at high speed, the structure must also have a clear focus on safety. The higher the speed limit, the greater the safety margins must be. Banks are important to the national economy The Riksbank defines financial stability as the maintenance of the financial system’s basic functions and its resilience to disruptions. The system converts savers’ money into productive investments, ensures that we can pay each other when we exchange goods and services, and allocates risk among those who are willing to take risks and those who are not.  The banks are the single most important providers of these basic functions. The banks’ income largely consists of payments by consumers to the banks for their specialisation in these functions. This income also reflects the fact that the banks borrow over the short term – for example through our wage accounts – and lend over the longer term – for example 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches through our mortgages. As it is cheaper to lend over the short term than the long term, the banks also earn money this way. In comparison with companies in other sectors, the banks have little equity. To some extent this is natural, in that the banks’ core activity is borrowing money, which is to say taking on debt. Leverage means that the banks can earn a lot of money by maintaining low equity/assets ratios. Of course, leverage applies to all companies, but, as we will see, banks can have particular reason to take greater risks than other companies. Vulnerability and contagion risks demand special bank regulations The combination of the banks’ central functions and their high indebtedness creates risks. This is a matter of credit risk – the risk of not getting the money you lent back again – and of liquidity risk – the risk of being unable to borrow money. The banks are vulnerable due to their high levels of indebtedness.  Problems at one bank also risk spreading to other banks. This kind of contagion can happen on both the asset and liability sides of a bank’s balance sheet. Deposit and lending surpluses in different parts of the world are managed on a global interbank market. The banks’ assets thus largely consist of loans to other banks. The banks’ liabilities largely consist of loans from other banks.  The banks are dependent on confidence – illustrated, in its most classic form, by a bank run. Rumours that a bank is facing problems can lead people to want to take their money out, which may give the bank problems – even if it had no problems to start with.  So banks have a series of characteristics that distinguish them from normal companies. If a normal company is unable to meet its payments, it will have to file for bankruptcy. If a bank defaults on its payments, the consequences for the financial system – and the real economy – can be enormous.  This means that it is difficult to let banks go bankrupt, at least if these banks are large and times are troubled. So other disciplinary mechanisms must be found – such as tougher regulation and thorough supervision. Special legislation covering banks in distress is also needed.  Of course, bank regulations are primarily a way of allowing the public sector to safeguard the public interest. But the regulation of banks is also a way of mitigating principal-agent problems between a bank’s management and borrowers on the one hand, and the bank’s owners and lenders on the other. For this second category, it is often difficult or expensive to monitor the risks on the bank’s asset side. One important aspect of bank regulation is the requirement for the amount of capital the banks should maintain. As capital adequacy requirements play a central part in the discussion of financial stability, I would like to examine them in a little more depth. There is a difference between the private and social benefits and costs of financial regulation Demands for bank regulation are not infrequently met with resistance from interested parties who claim that regulation is too expensive. Not least, this resistance is aimed at higher requirements for banks’ capital adequacy, as the interested parties claim that capital is more expensive than loans. But in this context, it is important to make a distinction between private costs and social costs. Higher capital adequacy requirements entail private costs for the banks. But we public sector participants should primarily be discussing the social consequences.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 One cornerstone of modern financial research is the basic theory that was established by Modigliani and Miller over 50 years ago.1 This says that the value of a company does not depend on how that company is funded – under certain assumptions. In principle, the model shows that the form of funding is only significant if there is a difference between the debts of companies and those of private individuals. And there is, of course – a limited liability company is basically a means of protecting its owners from the private consequences of the company becoming bankrupt. Being able to fund a business operation through borrowing is, of course, necessary and, in most cases, effective. In efficient markets, lenders’ risks are handled by means of interest rates and contract clauses. The limited liability company is thus a historically wealth-generating social institution. Nevertheless, the example illustrates that the higher cost of funding through equity is more a matter of private than social costs. Another factor that separates the costs for own and borrowed funds is the tax system. Companies may deduct interest on loans, but pay corporate tax for profits on equity. But this is just a private economic difference – from the social perspective, the only difference is the subsidisation of debt-financing in preference to equity. This specifically applies to banks that may be systemically important – it would be socially costly to allow them to file for bankruptcy. So the market often expects that the state will save a bank that is on the ropes, one way or another. These so-called implied guarantees create even greater differences between social and private costs, and risk leading the banks to take even greater risks.  Banks are vulnerable, contagious and sometimes systemically important. There are great differences between private and social cost-benefit calculations. Economic theory and empirical experience gives us good reason to regulate banks. But the difference between social and private costs also makes clear that many well-motivated social measures will meet with resistance from private interests. The global financial crisis illustrated these risks all too clearly The global crisis painfully demonstrated the risks of banking activities and financial instability. Of course, experience from the crisis lies behind the comprehensive agenda of regulations that has been developed in recent years. So I thought I would describe the course of the crisis, how authorities met it, and the lessons we believe we have learned.  The risks were realised during the crisis of 2007–2009 The factor that triggered the global financial crisis was the increasing problems in the US mortgage sector in 2007. These problems then spread, as many mortgages had been repackaged into so-called structured products, sometimes to the point of being unrecognisable. These instruments were held by a number of agents – and the complexity of the instruments made it difficult to see which agents had major or minor problems. At the same time, many banks had low equity/assets ratios. When the problems spread in the financial sector, even relatively limited losses could thus lead to major problems. The lack of transparency and weak resilience led to an almost-total lack of confidence between financial institutions in the autumn of 2008. Banks became hesitant to lend to each other. As the banks largely obtain funding from loans from each other and other financial                                                  1 Modigliani, F & Miller, M H (1958): “The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment”, American Economic Review 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches institutions, the lack of confidence led to a drying-up of liquidity within both the financial and real economies.  The crisis was met in a somewhat similar way by the United States, Europe and Sweden  On the whole, the financial crisis was met in a similar way by all OECD countries. The automatic stabilisers were put to work in fiscal policy, and many countries launched targeted fiscal policy stimulation measures to break the fall. The central banks reduced interest rates to very low levels. Almost all economies also took measures to prevent even deeper problems in the financial sector.  In the United States, where the crisis originated, the Federal Reserve and other authorities provided emergency liquidity assistance to the banks and other parts of the financial system. The Department of the Treasury’s TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program) purchased problem assets from banks and other financial institutions. The guarantee programme for the banks’ deposits was expanded. In addition, in 2009, a stress test was carried out of the 19 largest US banks as of the spring of 2009. Ten of these banks were deemed to need new capital, which they also succeeded in raising. It seems likely that this test helped restore confidence in the equity/assets ratios of the US banking system.  In Europe, the banks are more important for the supply of capital to the real economy than they are in the United States. So, on our side of the Atlantic, support was channelled via the banking system to a greater degree. The ECB has increased liquidity, partly by offering loans with longer maturities. In addition, the ECB has supported the markets for both covered bonds and government securities and has thereby supported the banking system of the euro area. It has not been able to prevent European banks from encountering serious problems. Many smaller banks – and a number of major banks – have been forced to close. These liquidations have often been carried out with governmental participation and support. The costs of government capital contributions and guarantees have been comprehensive. These lie behind a large part of the fiscal policy problems currently being faced by many European states, a subject I will return to. The most critical period for Swedish banks was between the autumn of 2008 and the spring of 2009. The liquidity shortage on the financial markets made it difficult for the banks to renew their loans. This was joined by the threat posed by the crisis in the Baltic countries and the Swedish banks’ exposures there. The consequences of this were that the value of Swedish bank securities fell drastically and demand for government securities rose. In this situation, the Swedish authorities implemented a series of measures:  The Swedish National Debt Office issued extra treasury bills and, in practice, let the banks exchange their mortgage bonds for more liquid government securities.  The government and the Riksdag extended the deposit guarantee and quickly passed laws enabling support to the banking sector.  In addition to the repo rate cuts we implemented, the Riksbank provided liquidity in several ways. We lent money for longer periods, eased the policy for collateral and introduced more counterparties to supply more liquidity to the banking system. We created swap lines with the Federal Reserve and ECB to meet the banking system’s need for foreign currency. We also contributed to crisis management in neighbouring countries by creating swap lines with Iceland, Latvia and Estonia. Finally, we also extended emergency loans to Carnegie and Kaupthing Sverige. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 The Riksbank no doubt considers that Sweden’s crisis management was successful. And other analysts have also shared this assessment – including, for example, Goodhart and Rochet in their review of the Riksbank’s work carried out last year.2 Unlike other central banks, we have also been able to phase out our crisis measures.  The crisis has cost enormous amounts  The crisis entailed huge costs, both for society as a whole and for the tax-funded public sector. Andrew Haldane, Executive Director of Financial Stability at the Bank of England, has shown that the crisis cost UK taxpayers just over 1 per cent of GDP. The corresponding figure for the United States is just below 1 per cent, or USD 100 billion.3 Eurostat has calculated the figure for the EU as a whole at 0.7 per cent, or EUR 90 billion.4 But these figures are only the direct public costs of keeping the financial system more or less on its feet. The real social costs of the crisis are significantly higher. Financial crises lower output and the growth path. In addition, a part of the effect is permanent, even if it is difficult to say how large a part. A historical estimate of the cost of financial crises, calculated as a present value, is about 60 per cent of GDP. For the global financial crisis, this figure is considerably higher.5 The banks are playing an important role in the sovereign debt crisis The banks are also central to the problems that succeeded the global financial crisis, which is to say the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area. As I mentioned, several governments in Europe were forced to manage problems in the banking sector, often at great expense. Those countries with domestic property bubbles were hit particularly hard. But financial exposures to the United States and the other countries most affected by the crisis impacted the banking systems of several countries. These stresses led to financial problems in many European banks and countries, and, eventually, to the current sovereign debt crisis.  The crisis has created a vicious circle between the real, financial and public economies The current European sovereign debt crisis has its origins in the period before 2007. In the absence of a common fiscal policy, budgetary discipline in the euro area should have been safeguarded by the Stability Pact. But, by 2003, it could already be seen that the implementation of the Stability Pact was weak. The financial markets also treated the euro countries as a homogenous block for a long time. Consequently, warning signals in the form of interest rate differentials between countries were absent. When the global financial crisis impacted what were often weakly-capitalised banking systems, and the ability of many countries to support their financial systems became questioned, the crisis became acute. The crisis has often been described as a vicious circle between the real, financial and public economies: weak growth in the economy leads to                                                  2 Goodhart, C & Rochet, J-C (2011): “An evaluation of the Riksbank’s monetary policy and work with financial stability 2005-2010”. 3 Haldane, A (2010): “The $100 billion dollar question”. 4 This is reported in, for example, European Banking Federation (2011): “Facts and Figures 2011/2012”. 5 Haldane gives an interval of 90–350 per cent for the global economy, depending on assumptions of the extent of the permanent effects. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches problems in the banking sector; banking problems generate costs for the state; the public sector has to implement austerity measures to maintain credibility, and this reduces growth. This vicious circle also works in the opposite direction: problems in the banking sector spill over into lending and growth, which weakens public finances and the state’s ability to back up the banking system when necessary.  Incidentally, this pattern of interaction between problems in the financial, real and public economies recurs throughout history. Reinhart and Rogoff have described how economic problems and bursting speculation bubbles have led to financial crises and subsequent sovereign debt crises time and again over the last 800 years. Developments in the banking system, 2007 and on So far, the European banks have not regained their credibility in the same way as the US banks did in 2009 and the Swedish banks did in 1992 and 1993. A great deal of uncertainty still prevails over which European banks are robust in the long-term. According to one estimate, the total decline in the value of assets on the European credit markets amounted to EUR 184 billion by the summer of 2011. The same publication made the assessment that losses over the years to come could amount to over EUR 200 billion, of which EUR 125 billion would derive from losses linked to government securities.6 The IMF has calculated that the effects of the sovereign debt crisis may amount to EUR 300 billion.7 Even so, the European banking sector was reported to have a larger balance sheet total in 2010 than in 2008. This reflects the fact that the problem assets have still not been addressed.  For long periods, European banks have had problems obtaining funding on the market. This uncertainty is also reflected in the Riksbank’s calculations of the stress index for Europe.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 Figure 1: European stress index  State support to the banking sector has been significant. In addition to EUR 90 billion in direct public expenditure, governments and central banks have paid out the equivalent of 13 per cent of GDP, EUR 1.6 trillion, in emergency liquidity assistance and support for the banks. The total commitments amount to triple this figure.8 The problems in the banking sector have still not been addressed  The management of the present European banking problems can be contrasted with the way we handled the Swedish banking crisis twenty years ago. Of course, although we are often considered to have succeeded well in Sweden in 1992, this was due to a relatively beneficial political environment, rather than intellectual superiority. Even so, the differences illustrate an important insight from economics – more specifically, the significance of asymmetric information. Like other central banks, the ECB intervened in 2008 to support liquidity by various means, including offering loans at longer maturities. Unlike in Sweden, these extraordinary loan facilities continue to be available. Furthermore, the ECB has supported the markets for both covered bonds and government securities. In a crisis situation, it is necessary to maintain liquidity among the banks. The Riksbank and other Swedish authorities did the same in 2008–2010. In 1992, the Swedish government issued a guarantee for the banks’ commitments aimed at preserving confidence in the Swedish banking sector. But guaranteeing liquidity is not enough. Confidence in the European banking market is still low. Few lenders are prepared to lend to European banks on market terms over the longer term. This is where the theory of asymmetric information comes in. As nobody knows with certainty which banks will or will not remain solvent over the longer term, cautious investors                                                  8 European Commission (2011): “State Aid Scoreboard: Report on state aid granted by the EU Member States, Autumn 2011 Update”. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches will treat all banks as high-risk counterparties – in the same way as the car buyers in Akerlof’s “Market for lemons” treat all used cars as potential wrecks.9 When we, in Sweden, introduced the bank guarantee in 1992, it was to win time while banks were closed down, divided up and recapitalised with government assistance. The banks that were left were robust and able to regain the market’s confidence. This action reduced uncertainty and, in the course of time, contributed to keeping government expenditure down. In Europe, similar measures have only been carried out to a more limited extent. This delay and lingering uncertainty have contributed to the current sovereign debt crisis. Before these problems are brought to light and dealt with, it will be hard to see any long-term solution for the European banking sector.  A new framework – the way forward At the same time as the crisis has to be managed, those of us interested in financial markets must think ahead and build a more robust framework. The world doesn’t need a new 2008. Encouragingly enough, we have taken important steps towards creating structures that may prevent new problems. But there is still a lot of work to do. The crisis taught us lessons about risks in the financial sector Obviously, the experience of authorities around the world in the crisis will form the basis of a new and more secure financial framework. Academic research has also contributed valuable insights.  It is obvious that risks in the financial sector were underestimated before the global financial crisis. One underestimation concerned the degree of correlation of risks in individual institutions. But it could also be argued that we, on the regulatory side, were a little naive regarding the risk of moral hazard in the governance of banks. To generalise slightly, it could be said that, before 2008, we felt quite safe when we saw that the risk in individual institutions looked manageable. Today, we know better. Even an individually well-diversified bank has assets that could be highly exposed to the same macroeconomic risk. In addition, as the banks largely act as each other’s counterparties, one bank’s problems can easily become another’s. If the banks providing loans suddenly no longer wish to continue lending, the banks that have borrowed money can face problems. And, if they are not affected before, the other banks will be impacted when one or more banks rapidly need to sell their assets, pushing down the prices. To this can be added the vicious circle of negative effects for the real, public and financial economies that I have already discussed. To continue these generalisations, it could also be said that previously we usually believed that market discipline was enough to ensure that business incentives would correspond to socio-economic efficiency. Following the crisis, we know that this is not the case. Private economic incentives for decision-makers in the banks can be so strong that market discipline is not always enough to achieve transparency or effective risk management (to take two examples). The observation that US subprime loans were often sold with the same credit rating as Swedish sovereign bonds should be a good enough example of this. The private benefits – or corporate profits, if you prefer – of debt-financing relative to equity lead to moral hazard. Risks can be passed on to lenders and taxpayers. The management of the banks have been rewarded according to return on equity. By using their own risk models, the banks                                                  9 Akerlof, G (1970): “Market for ‘lemons’: quality uncertainty and the market mechanism”, Quarterly Journal of Economics. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 have been able to keep risk weights low, which has meant that they have not had to maintain so much equity. New frameworks are being established on the basis of these insights. Here, I will briefly explain what Basel III – the new regulatory framework for the banks – entails. I will also briefly discuss the thinking behind macroprudential policy, which has become something of an in-word in recent years.  Basel III increases demands on the banks The most important areas of the global Basel III Accord deal with the quantitative demands for capital and liquidity being placed on the banks.  The banks are to have sufficient equity… As financial crises can lead to considerable losses, the Basel Committee maintains that the banks need substantial resilience.  So capital requirements are being increased in Basel III, above all for Common Equity Tier 1.10 The minimum requirement for the banks’ equity is being set at 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets – more than double the requirement under Basel II. A capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent, added to a counter-cyclical buffer, has created a stronger shock absorber than previously existed. I will return to the counter-cyclical buffer when I discuss macroprudential policy. The capital adequacy requirement can also be complemented with a pure gross solvency measure, meaning that equity may not fall below 3 per cent of total assets. All in all, the banks’ capital position will be strengthened considerably compared with previous regulations, contributing to the boosting of confidence, both in the individual banks and in the system as a whole. …and carry out clear measures for liquidity In the light of the crisis of the autumn of 2008, the Basel Committee has decided, for the first time, on quantitative requirements for liquidity in the banks. Basel III works with two liquidity measures – one short-term and one long-term. The short-term measure is based on, in principle, every bank having sufficient liquid assets to survive for at least 30 days. It is difficult to consider such a requirement as unreasonable. The long-term measure, in principle, limits the gap between the maturity of a bank’s assets and the maturity of its debts. So this limits the duration risk of the bank. In the end, Basel III will be implemented as national legislation The regulations I have just sketched will eventually enter national legislation. They are to be fully implemented by 2019, with several sub-targets on the way.  In the EU, Basel III will be implemented through what is referred to as the CRR/CRD IV.11 Those of you who have followed the ongoing negotiations know that both countries and EU institutions have different views about how implementation should take place in the EU. An important dividing line has been to what extent countries should be able to stipulate higher requirements nationally than those formulated in the common EU regulations.                                                  10 Basel III defines Common Equity Tier 1 as, in principle, share capital and retained profits (i.e. previous profits minus dividends). 11 An abbreviation for the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches The Basel Committee has been clear that the regulations and the implementation of them form a minimum standard. As you know, the Riksbank and other authorities in Sweden believe that there are good reasons for moving more quickly ahead and setting higher requirements than the minimum regulations in Basel III. Our reasons for this are that the Swedish banking market has distinctive features that entail risks and that there is no international framework for managing banks in crisis. Although banks live globally, they die locally. Ultimately, the Swedish banks are our responsibility.  Macroprudential policy has become a distinct policy area Responsibility for the national banking systems leads to the final point of my speech: macroprudential policy. The crisis has taught us that relatively stable institutions do not necessarily add up to a stable system, for the reasons I have already discussed. There is a clear need for a system perspective. This is the perspective of macroprudential policy. The idea behind macroprudential policy is that it should address risks in the financial system as a whole and thus complement microprudential focus on risks in individual institutions. The macroprudential policy analysis can be divided into two dimensions: the structural and the cyclical. The structural dimension addresses the concentration of risk and interlinking The structural (or cross-sectional dimension) relates to how the concentration of risk and the links between different parts of the financial system at any given time affect the risk of a crisis hitting the system as whole. I have already discussed the links between financial institutions and the contagion risks these entail. Existing and newly-invented tools have been proposed and applied to deal with these structural risks. The former include stricter capital adequacy requirements and limits on activities and exposures. The newly-invented tools include plans to manage banks in crisis (so-called recovery and resolution plans), liquidity requirements and special capital adequacy requirements for institutions that are deemed to be systemically important. Work is underway within the framework of the Basel Committee to identify globally systemically important banks which will be subject to stricter capital adequacy requirements. The Swedish authorities’ demand for a higher level of capital adequacy in our major Swedish banks is of course an example of the same thinking. The cyclical dimension addresses risk management over time The cyclical dimension (also referred to as the dynamic dimension or the time dimension) relates to how risks in the system as a whole can develop over time. The crisis and the period preceding it clearly illustrate the tendencies towards exaggerated cyclical behaviour that often characterise the financial markets. The demand for loans usually increases during periods of strong growth, and the perception of risk often appears to weaken. When the downturn comes, lending is tightened and many players want to sell their assets at the same time, which aggravates the downturn in both the financial and the real sectors. Cyclical risks can also be met using existing tools or tools especially designed for the purpose. A loan limit has been imposed on lenders in Sweden in the form of a mortgage cap. Although Finansinspektionen introduced this cap for consumer-protection reasons, the measure can also be used, at least potentially, for counter-cyclical purposes. Liquidity requirements also have a cyclical dimension. The Basel III regulations comprise a counter-cyclical buffer that should be built up in good times when lending is increasing faster than the trend. When a downturn comes, the authorities can then release the buffer, which gives the banks a safety margin and can counteract credit tightening. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11 Macroprudential policy requires organisational development The advance of macroprudential policy has also led to organizational changes in supervisory work. In an increasing number of countries, individual authorities, or authorities working in collaboration, are being given direct responsibility for macroprudential policy. However, the question of the responsibility for macroprudential policy analysis and tools is not always simple. Macroprudential policy encompasses clear elements of both supervisory and central bank activities. I discussed this in my speech here at Nationalekonomiska föreningen a year ago. Then I made the remark that a separated responsibility for monetary and macroprudential policy, without any coordination, could result in a game between authorities, which could lead to an outcome not desired by any of the authorities. In the United Kingdom, sole responsibility has been given to the central bank. A Financial Policy Committee is to be set up alongside the existing Monetary Policy Committee. Such a solution of course means that the coordination between these two almost parallel committees, although each with a different focus, becomes an important issue. In the EU, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has been set up at the ECB in Frankfurt. Central banks and supervisory authorities are represented on the ESRB, but the central banks have the majority of the votes when decisions are made. In Sweden, Finansinspektionen and we at the Riksbank set up the Council for Cooperation on Macroprudential Policy in January this year. This council will discuss the assessment of risks in the financial system as a whole and discuss appropriate risk-prevention measures. The Council will also discuss analyses and the development of tools and methods in the area of macroprudential policy. The Council is a temporary solution while awaiting a more permanent distribution of the responsibility for macroprudential policy. At present, the Financial Crisis Commission is working with this issue. The recently appointed inquiry on capital adequacy regulations will focus specifically on responsibility for the future counter-cyclical capital buffer. In our region, the cooperation between the Nordic and Baltic countries is also important in the effort to discover and manage systemic risks. This cooperation also covers plans and preparations for dealing with potential crises.  A summary in three reflection Let me conclude where I started. Palmstruch discovered the benefits of a financial system, but also experienced the individual temptations associated with irresponsible lending and how dependent banking operations are on public confidence. Palmstruch also lived to see how the state – rather drastically – learned the lessons of this experience. In this speech I have provided an introduction to banks and financial regulation – why banks are needed, but also the risks they entail. I have argued that the differences between a cost-benefit calculation at the social and private levels justifies a strict regulation of the financial sector and declared that such regulation will always meet with resistance. I have spoken about the global financial crisis, how it was met and how it became a debt crisis in the euro area. I have also spoken about the course we should take in the future, and why. If I were asked to sum up my speech in three reflections they would be as follows:   We have to distinguish between the economic costs of financial regulation at the social and private levels.  Problems in the banking sector cannot be resolved unless we do something about them.  Banks should lend a little more of their own money and a little less of everybody else’s. Now I look forward to discussing this with you in the association. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Masaaki Shirakawa: The era of linkages among Asia and across the Pacific Ocean Remarks (via videoconference) by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Conference, San Francisco, 11 June 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction I am privileged to have the opportunity to speak at this invaluable conference being held by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Today, I would like to talk about the strengthened linkages among Asia and across the Pacific Ocean, as well as the challenges in finance to be tackled to achieve sustainable growth in Asia. Unfortunately, our Monetary Policy Meeting scheduled for the day after tomorrow does not allow me to join you in San Francisco. Nonetheless I am grateful for being given the opportunity to speak in this way. I now realize that a new linkage across the Pacific, which relates to the topic I want to discuss today, is being formed through such innovative information technology like this. Since the voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492, there have been economic, cultural and political exchanges between the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean for more than five centuries. Since the nineteenth century, the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean have been regarded as the center of the civilized world. Compared to this long history of trans-Atlantic linkages, the history of trans-Pacific linkages is quite brief. Thirty years after Columbus made his voyage, the fleet led by Ferdinand Magellan discovered and crossed the Pacific Ocean during the years 1520 and 1521. However, more substantive trans-Pacific economic exchanges only began after the Forty-niners came to join the California Gold Rush and the population of the U.S. Pacific Coast increased substantially. The only exception was the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade, in which Spanish trading ships sailed between Acapulco and Manila once or twice a year when the Spanish viceroy of Mexico ruled the Philippines. The biggest obstacle to linkages across the Pacific was the gigantic scale of the Ocean. In order to sail between Acapulco and Manila, Spanish people of the 16th century had to build the largest galleons they could, whose size was as much as 2,000 tons (Chart 1). Compared with the famous Mayflower whose size was estimated to be 180 tons, we can easily imagine how exceptionally big the Spanish galleons were. Even in the modern era, the first trans-Pacific undersea telegraph cable was built in 1903, 45 years after the construction of the trans-Atlantic cable. Non-stop trans-Pacific flights became widespread only 40 years ago, in the 1970s, after Boeing 747 “Jumbo Jets” were fully introduced (Chart 2). Thus, it was not long ago that people began to see the Asia-Pacific region as an economic bloc. Indeed, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, was established as a forum for the governments of Asia-Pacific countries only in 1989. Although there remains the geographical distance between Asia-Pacific economies, owing to technological innovation it is far less an obstacle to economic exchanges than before, and the Asia-Pacific countries have become able to enjoy the benefits of sitting around the same sea together. Apart from the historical context, last year there were a couple of big events that reminded me of the strong linkages that exist within Asia and across the Pacific. The first one was the tragic Great East Japan Earthquake. This massive earthquake severely damaged supply chains of manufacturing of Japan (Chart 3). When factories of micro-controllers, integral parts of automobiles, came to halt, the resultant shortage substantially affected not only automobile production lines in Japan but also those in overseas in Asia and the United States (Chart 4). In terms of negative impacts on supply chains, the floods in Thailand since 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches last summer also struck production lines of hard disk drives, disrupting computer manufacturing in other Asian economies including Japan. These natural disasters revealed the strength of linkages among Asia-Pacific economies. Another event that reminded me of strong linkages across the Asian-Pacific region was extremely quick popularization of tablet PCs and smart phones. Indeed, we now see people looking at smart phones almost everywhere. Today’s industrial linkages do not necessarily take the traditional form of division of labor depicted in textbooks on international trade. With new “concepts,” firms have become increasingly capable of attracting wide-ranging resources from all over the world to bring these new concepts to reality. As is shown in the case of tablet PCs, the Asia-Pacific region has become more and more important as an “incubator” of innovation. An estimated break-down of the costs of Apple’s iPhone, whose retail price is 649 dollars, consists of manufacturing cost of 8 dollars, component costs of 188 dollars and a gross profit margin of 453 dollars (Chart 5). The concepts of iPad and iPhone were generated in Silicon Valley. During the process of turning these concepts into real merchandise, there were trans-Pacific flows of goods, human resources and financial services in all directions, such as in the development of component technologies, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. In such processes, not only Silicon Valley companies but also many Asian firms in China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan are involved. 2. Asia in the global economy Asia acting as growth pole to enhance resilience of global economy Now, let me briefly illustrate the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region and the strengthened linkages among the countries of that region, as the basis for further discussion. The economic growth of Asia has continuously exceeded that of the global economy in recent years. Indeed, the relative strength of the Asian economy has been more pronounced since the global financial crisis. According to the IMF World Economic Outlook, Asian growth, which stood at 5.9 percent in 2011, is expected to continue growing at a relatively high rate of 6 percent in 2012. Meanwhile, the growth of advanced economies, which stood at 1.6 percent in 2011, is expected to remain as low as 1.4 percent in 2012 (Chart 6). According to the IMF, Asian economies are expected to increase their share of the global economy from 30% to 40% or more by the year of 2030 if the current trend of Asian growth is maintained (Chart 7). The Asian share of the global economy is also increasing in terms of trade (Chart 8). In this regard, Japan’s “White Paper on the International Economy and Trade” published in 2011 provides an insightful analysis on the global trade structure. This Paper divides the world into six areas, that is, NAFTA, the EU, ASEAN, MERCOSUR, China and Japan (Chart 9). According to this analysis, the share of the trade between advanced economies such as NAFTA, EU and Japan to the total was as much as around 60 percent in 1990, but this figure declined to a little more than 30 percent in 2008. On the other hand, the share of trans-Pacific trade among NAFTA, ASEAN, MERCOSUR, China and Japan excluding that between NAFTA and Japan increased from around 25 percent in 1990 to around 45 percent in 2008 (Chart 10). This fact illustrates the dramatic development of trade network among the Asian-Pacific region. The growth of Asia is leading global economy even after the global financial crisis. Despite the bursting of the housing bubble in the U.S. and the financial turmoil after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the global economy has not fallen into a deep and prolonged slump such as that experienced in the Great Depression in 1930s (Chart 11). As to the background of such resilience in the global economy, let me point out the contribution made by emerging economies, especially by emerging Asia, as well as various policy responses taken by governments and central banks worldwide. With the strong growth of emerging economies, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 the global economy now has multiple growth “pillars”, which fortify its resilience. Needless to say, it may not be appropriate to overemphasize so-called “de-coupling” in this globalized economy. Nonetheless, further endogenous economic development associated with the rise in living standards in Asian and other emerging economies will surely continue enhancing the robustness of global economy. Asia as a new frontier for global economic growth I would also like to emphasize that the high growth of Asia, which enhances the resilience of global economy, also expands new growth frontiers for non-Asian economies. As many advanced countries are now facing common issues of an aging population and fiscal imbalances, enhancing the growth potential has become an imminent challenge for these countries.1 In addition, the solution to the European debt problem ultimately rests with the ability and efforts of peripheral countries to boost their productivity and growth sufficiently. In this regard, Asian economies could offer great potential, as they have a vast pool of human resources and are now becoming major high-tech suppliers. Moreover, emerging Asia is expected to substantially grow as consumption markets. According to an industry survey conducted early this year, China has surpassed the U.S. to become the world’s largest smart phone market by shipments. To exploit Asia’s potential, advanced economies should build systematic and productive linkages with Asian economies, instead of viewing Asia simply as labor-intensive production base. Case in point is Japanese retailers, medicare service industries and private education industries which used to focus on the domestic markets. They are now formulating global business strategies targeting the broader Asian market. Moreover, through their environmental and energy-saving engineering technologies, advanced economies could contribute to alleviating growth constraints associated with the rapid rise in living standards in Asia. It would also be fruitful for advanced economies to consider how they could make use of Asia’s human resources and supply capacity to overcome the problems associated with their aging population. Establishing such strategic and coordinated linkages with Asian economies would expand growth frontiers and thus bring about “win-win” relationships, which would be beneficial to both Asia and the rest of the world. 3. Economic development and financial stability in Asia Asia’s strength and challenges in terms of finance Next, I would like to talk about the relationship between the economic development of Asia, new linkages and the role of finance, which is indeed the main topic of this conference. As mentioned earlier, Asian economies recovered relatively smoothly and swiftly after the global financial crisis and remain a driving force of the world economy. As one of the major factors behind the resilience of Asia, I would like to point out the overall stability of Asian financial systems. In my view, there are three major factors behind such financial stability in Asia. First, Asia’s economic fundamentals are relatively strong. Most emerging Asian countries have excess domestic savings and their fiscal conditions are also better than those of advanced economies. The external balances of these countries generally remain in surplus.                                                  1 Regarding the issues associate with demographic changes, see Shirakawa, “Demographic Changes and Macroeconomic Performance: Japanese Experiences” (Opening Remark at 2012 BOJ-IMES Conference) [2012] 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Against this background, capital inflows to Asia quickly rebounded after the sudden contraction during the initial stage of the crisis.  Second, the business models of Asian financial institutions are different from those of European and U.S. institutions. In Asia, traditional banking businesses play a major role in financial intermediation, and the “originate to distribute” business model, which was one of the major causes of the financial crisis, has never been popular. Moreover, Asian banks’ exposures to structured products were limited. Third, based on the Asian experiences of financial crises in the 1990s, many Asian countries including Japan have already made various efforts to enhance the stability and resilience of their financial systems, such as strengthening banks’ capital and building financial safety nets. Now advanced economies are focusing on “macro-prudential” policies. In this regard, some Asian economies, based on the experiences of financial crises in 1990, have already made use of various macro-prudential tools such as loan-to-value ratio to curb excessive real estate loans. As such, some Asian economies have moved ahead of advanced economies in terms of implementing macro-prudential policies.  In spite of their relative stability, Asian financial systems also face challenges. One of the policy challenges is to foster the development of capital markets, especially the corporate bond markets. In emerging Asia, there would be huge financing needs for building social infrastructure such as public transportation, energy supply and communication networks. In view of the length of financing needs for building infrastructure as well as the risks associated with possible maturity mismatches, a well-functioning capital market, as well as credit intermediation through banks, should play an important role in such long-term domestic financing. Moreover, the co-existence of different financing tools such as bank borrowing and corporate bonds could enhance the resilience of the financial systems. In this regard, Asia has already taken various steps including the introduction of Asian Bond Fund. Japan’s possible contribution toward financial developments in Asia On this front, I firmly believe that Japan is able to contribute to Asian financial stability as well as to the development of financial infrastructure in Asia, for two reasons. First, Japan’s financial system, on the whole, is being stable and resilient. Given that Japan experienced a financial crisis in 1990s, various measures have already been taken to strengthen its financial system. Partly due to such efforts, Japan’s financial system have remained mostly stable, surviving successive events such as the failures of Lehman Brothers and other financial institutions, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the European debt problem. To date, internationally active Japanese banks have generally set aside sufficient capital, and are in a position to contribute, as financial intermediaries, to satisfying Asian needs for various financial services. Second, not only for internationally active Japanese banks but also for Japanese non-financial firms, establishing linkages with other Asian economies is now at the core of their overseas business strategies. Internationally active Japanese financial institutions are now allocating their resources to Asian businesses as a part of their global strategies and increasing their lending in Asia. They are also exploring various businesses such as M&A financing in Asia. For example, Japanese “mega” banks’ loans to Asia as a share of their total overseas loans is continuously increasing, and has now reached around 30 percent (Chart 12). Recently, some European banks are streamlining their exposures to emerging economies, and Japanese banks are filling a part of the void created by such “deleveraging” of European banks (Chart 13). Such Japanese banks’ activities would certainly contribute to stable financial intermediation in Asia. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Also for Japanese non-financial firms, economic developments in Asia also provide a new growth frontier. In view of the widening gap between savings and investment in Japan’s corporate sector due to the sluggish growth in domestic investment opportunities, Japanese non-financial firms are now expanding their direct investments and M&A activities in emerging Asia so as to explore their business frontiers and to seek for higher rate of return. Such activities are not confined to large companies, but medium-sized manufacturers and service providers are also involved. In 2009, the aggregate amount of Japanese firm’s direct investments in Asia exceeded the amount invested in the European Union (Chart 14). Such activities of Japanese financial institutions and firms would contribute to sustainable growth in Asia by facilitating a steady flow of risk capital into productive investment in Asia, including Japan itself. On the other hand, in order for the Japanese economy to enhance its growth potential, it is critical that financial institutions and firms improve their productivity and profitability by taking advantage of the growth potential of Asia in terms of both supply and demand. 4. Toward a new “win-win” relationship In view of the strengthened linkages among Asia and across the Pacific, I would like to highlight three tasks for policymakers in order that both Asia and the rest of the world achieve sustainable growth through establishing a win-win relationship from a broader perspective. First of all, I would like to reiterate the importance of each Asian country continuing its effort to maintain economic stability by strengthening fundamentals and the policy framework. As Asia’s share of the global economy increases, possible impacts on the global economy stemming from fluctuations in the Asian economy and policies adopted by each country in Asia could become more pronounced. In terms of economic fundamentals, emerging Asia, lagging a bit behind advanced economies, will also be required to tackle the issue of ageing population in the near future. For example, the working age population in China is expected to start decreasing in around 2020 (Chart 15). How effectively and promptly each country responds to this issue, after enjoying the “population bonus”, could have significant implications for their economic fundamentals. Regarding growth constraints on Spaceship Earth, policy efforts aimed at protecting the environment and saving energies would also become more important. As emerging economies’ share of the global economy increases, growth expectations for the global economy often lead to rise in commodity prices, which constrains policy conducts of emerging economies by intensifying inflationary pressures. In this regard, policy efforts in environmental protection and energy savings will alleviate such growth constraints and enhance emerging countries’ resilience against fluctuation of commodity prices. I believe that Japanese firms, which have strength in environment-related technology, could and should make a valuable contribution on this front. From the policy framework perspective, it is also imperative that each influential economy maintain sufficient exchange rate flexibility. Under economic and financial globalization, inflexibility of exchange rates may trigger abrupt changes in international capital flows and increase the burden of monetary and prudential policies. In this regard, I truly welcome recent efforts Asian countries have made to enhance exchange rate flexibility. Second, with regard to financial stability policy, we are still struggling with the question of reconciling the borderless nature of globalized financial services and the national nature of financial intermediaries located within the border of a home-country sovereign state. If we look at the first half of the decade since 2000, or at western nations since the end of 19th century before the World War I, we can see that the periods of economic prosperity have 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches almost always coincided with big waves of globalization. Looking back at such history, we cannot avoid further progress in globalization, for it would be the surest way to raise growth potential for advanced economies which are faced with unfavorable demographics and for emerging Asia which is trying to raise living standards further. As a financial aspect of larger economic globalization, we cannot escape from financial globalization either. Moreover, since money is scalable and can now move beyond borders instantly at an extremely low cost, it is little wonder if financial globalization goes further in future. On the other hand, financial service providers cannot be free from their home country’s “nationality” no matter how far financial services themselves are globalized, as long as the current system of national borders is maintained. There have been debates on whether these providers could or should be saved in an emergency at the cost of taxpayers in a specific jurisdiction. Ultimately, the perceived quality of debt issued by financial institutions cannot be separated entirely from the credibility of their home country and the resilience of its regulatory and supervisory framework. At the very least, in order to perform their functions sufficiently, financial service providers must be backed up by public confidence under institutional frameworks such as home country’s effective supervision. In fact, we see some signs of “re-nationalization” of funds under the current financial environments. At present, under the initiative of G20 and Financial Stability Board, policymakers are discussing various issues stemming from tensions between financial globalization and sovereign states, such as cross-border resolution of globally active financial institutions. Indeed, this issue is a quite big challenge for policymakers now. Third, it is also important to further promote mutual understanding of different national economies and financial structures. As I already mentioned, the resilience of Asian economy played a key role in preventing global economy from falling into a deep and prolonged slump. As this fact illustrates, global economy would be more vulnerable to shock when it consists of homogeneous countries in terms of economic structure and policy framework than when it is a hybrid system embracing diversity.  In spite of the development of information technology and strengthened linkages among global economy, various “differences” among countries and regions are likely to continue existing at least for a foreseeable but substantially-long period of time. Nonetheless, creative concepts, innovations and sources of growth will emerge from new linkages between such economic diversity. Since we are living in a world of diversified economies, there should also be various forms of linkages, ranging from an ultimate form of currency union to much looser ties. Thus, it is important for policymakers to seek the most appropriate form and combination of linkages, taking differences in economic structures and nations’ development stage fully into account. In addition, at the occasion of international discussions, constructive dialogue is needed to foster a mutual understanding of such differences and to learn from one another. The economies of advanced countries tend to be affected by common economic cycles, and thus, their policy discussions inevitably tend to focus on similar themes such as the “Great Moderation”. In this regard, the developments in Asian and other emerging countries are adding diversity to the world economy, and their fresh viewpoints will enable policymakers to explore new frontiers of policy debates. 5. Conclusion In my speech today, I have sought to explain my current thinking given the deepening linkage among Asia and across the Pacific. Before concluding my speech, I would like to refer to one issue to which we might need to pay attention as financial linkages within this economic area continue to deepen. That is, the issue of time zone differences. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 You are now watching me live, with only a slight time lag as video signals are transmitted from Tokyo to San Francisco. That said, it is the 12th of June for me, which is tomorrow for you, and I am actually talking to you from “the island of the day after” over the International Date Line. For you, my speech is being delivered on the 11th of June, but my diary shows this important speech is scheduled for the 12th of June. We are communicating across the Pacific in real time, but the dates in our minds are different. As for the dates of a speech, I can rely on my secretary to ensure that there is no misunderstanding. However, when it comes to finance, dates mean a lot more. Suppose I am committed to sending money to some of you two days from now. Should the money reach the recipient on the 13th, or on the 14th? Moreover, if both sides take account of mutual weekends, there are only 4 days in a week when transactions can be processed. These problems could probably be solved by laying down rules beforehand. Still, complicated issues could arise in terms of risk management, including when bankruptcy procedures are set in motion. The foreign exchange settlement risks associated with time zone differences have been substantially reduced by CLS settlement. Nonetheless, many of the currencies of emerging economies are not yet available for CLS settlement (Chart 16). The example I have used today is seemingly a small problem. Nonetheless, through solving these practical problems one by one the world will become closer to a seamless economy and the global economy including Asia-Pacific region will become able to realize its full potential. In this regard, I sincerely hope that the discussions held in this conference will constitute another step in the right direction. Thank you for your attention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Matthew Elderfield: Solvency II – the impact in Europe and Bermuda Address by Mr Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the Insurance Day Summit, Hamilton, 12 June 2012. *      *      * Thank you to Insurance Day for the kind invitation to join you at this event. It’s a great pleasure to be back in Bermuda to have this opportunity to speak and also to spend a bit of time meeting the Bermuda firms and my former colleagues at the Bermuda Monetary Authority. In addition to my obvious personal interest in Bermuda, there are clearly close ties between Bermuda and the Irish insurance market. A number of Bermuda insurance companies have a significant presence in Ireland which they use as their base for pan European activity. And more broadly, wearing my hat as a member of the European Insurance Regulators or EIOPA Management Board, there are very close ties between Bermuda and the EU. Bermuda is an important source of risk capital and insurance services into the European Union, and as such it is an important source of diversification of risk and provides benefits to wholesale and ultimately retail consumers across the European Union. For example, 37% of EMEA property cat risk was placed with Bermuda companies according to the most recent Aon Benfield data. France, Germany, Spain and Benelux each place between 18–25% of their total premiums with Bermuda companies. It is therefore encouraging to see that in spite of difficult operating conditions last year the Bermuda Insurance market is continuing to play an important role internationally and that the Bermuda Monetary Authority is continuing to make good progress in its drive to enhance its regulatory regime. What I propose to do today is to start with a brief update on Solvency II implementation. Secondly, I want to choose 3 particular aspects of Solvency II to consider in a bit of detail. And, finally, I would like to take an opportunity to say a word about the equivalence process and what it means for Bermuda.  By this time almost everyone in the Insurance Industry from chairmen to secretaries, underwriters to loss adjusters and indeed not just in Europe but in Bermuda, the US and elsewhere, will have heard about Solvency II. It is the new regulatory framework for setting risk based solvency requirements for insurance and reinsurance companies operating within the European Union. It is organised around three pillars: a first pillar setting quantitative solvency requirements covering all aspects of insurance business, including asset risks and prescribing eligible forms of capital. The second pillar is aimed at qualitative requirements concerning risk management and governance standards. And a third pillar is designed to encourage market discipline by requiring a high level of transparency and disclosure from regulated firms. This framework is a clear improvement on the current European Solvency I rule book. Unlike Solvency I, it is risk based, covers the asset side of the balance sheet and provides an incentive for investment in risk management, including the use of internal models. Importantly, it is founded on a balance sheet based on market consistent economic value. Solvency II is not a single piece of legislation but rather an interconnected group of laws and European rules. The Solvency II directive itself has been adopted but a supplemental piece of legislation known as Omnibus II is concluding the process of approval in Europe and makes important amendments to the core Solvency II law. In addition the directive framework will be supplemented by a significant raft of so called level 2 regulations and EIOPA, the European Insurance Authority, will promulgate a wide range of binding technical standards, guidance and other materials to flesh out the detail of this regulatory framework, often known as level 3 measures.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  This all adds up to what will certainly be a highly complex corpus of rules. While Solvency II has many benefits and is a distinct improvement on the current European Framework, that complexity is certainly a source of concern. Regulators, large firms and certainly small firms will each struggle to some degree to assimilate and implement this significant scale of change. This complexity is indeed impacting the implementation timetable of the directive. The process of finalising Omnibus II has unfortunately been delayed in the Brussels process, which has the knock on effect of squeezing the time available for consulting on, issuing and then implementing the range of secondary rules. The current target is that member state governments will domestically implement the European framework by 30th June 2013 and then the directive will come into force for insurance firms themselves at the start of 2014. While this timeline is certainly challenging even if it does slip a little, it is certain that Solvency II is getting very close and will have significant implications for the insurance industry not just in Europe but globally.  There are a lot of dimensions of Solvency II which could be discussed and which will impact on the industry, but I would like to take an opportunity to focus on just three in the brief time available.  First, a word on the impact of Solvency II on the life industry, as this is the biggest open issue that remains in the final negotiations on the directive and its related rules. At question here is the impact of the market consistent economic valuation principle on the life industry business model, particularly with respect to the provision of long term guarantees. Industry has expressed concern that by prescribing a fixed common discount rate while at the same time requiring mark-to-market changes in asset values, then long term guarantee products in particular could be exposed to spikes in solvency requirements in times of short term market volatility. Similar but related concerns exist regarding the impact of mark-to-market requirements on assets more generally and in light of recent experiences on sovereign debt in particular. Again: short-term the concern is that volatility that drives mark-to-market changes in the fixed income portfolios of insurance companies could lead to volatility in solvency buffers. This has caused concern among some observers on a number of fronts. First there is the worry that this framework will discourage the provision of long term guarantee products, which provide a useful source of savings and investment for retail consumers. Second there is a worry that the framework may be inherently pro-cyclical by exacerbating pressure to dispose of assets in times of increased market volatility.  These are real and reasonable concerns and are being tackled in the final negotiations on the directive. Discussions are underway to adapt the framework by allowing adjustments to applicable discount rates for certain matched assets and liabilities. Also, a so called counter cyclical premium is being developed – again to allow an adjustment to discount rates to offset excess short-term volatility in certain aspects of the fixed income portfolio. There are a number of different technical approaches to achieve this end and as ever the devil is in the detail, but the desired outcome is a framework that seeks to square the circle of providing a more risk sensitive solvency framework, while at the same time permitting the continued provision of guaranteed products and avoiding dangerous pro-cyclical effects. While this is a highly technical debate about the detail of discounting and valuation requirements on particular portfolios of assets backing certain insurance products, I think it is important to highlight it as one of the key outstanding issues because of the significant impact it will have on the development of long-term savings products and its relevance to the current turbulence in the euro sovereign debt markets. The second subject I would like to mention briefly is that of internal models. Solvency II permits insurance companies to propose the use of their own internal model as an alternate to the directive’s standardised formula for calculating solvency requirements. The framework is calibrated to provide an incentive for firms to invest and develop more sophisticated risk management. This is to be welcomed and encouraged. But there are risks to manage as well. Solvency II’s use of internal models is broadly similar to that of the Basel Framework but in fact provides even greater scope to firms in their modelling, as Basel set certain 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  minimum correlation assumptions for models but Solvency II does not. There is clearly a strong incentive for insurance companies to optimise their use of capital under the directive and to do so through the adoption of models. This is perhaps stronger in the general insurance market than in the life market due to the anticipated relative strengthening of solvency standards. Internal models are, however, subject to supervisory approval, and of course approval by the insurance company’s own board. To my mind it is important that the approval process doesn’t get bogged down in detail such as endless documentation reviews but stays focussed on the key drivers of the overall solvency calculation arising from the use of a model. Regulators and industry spend a lot of time arguing about the detailed calibration of very specific risk factors under the Solvency II Framework. But it is when the solvency requirements for different lines of business and different aspects of risk are combined that the overall solvency requirement can swing significantly as a result of the judgements that are made regarding correlation and diversification. If this is where the big swings in numbers can occur, it should be at the forefront of the regulatory approval process and above all in the challenge from insurance companies’ boards.  Diversification is of course an inherent part of the insurance business model but as you are aware, the risk is that diversification in times of stress is more apparent than it is real. The assessment of correlation and the level of diversification that is recognised is not a matter for a black box or a theoretical formula. It is inherently a matter of expert judgement for an insurance company’s senior management and boards, not just its quants and risk team. It is right and proper that boards should be expected to challenge vigorously the amount of diversification benefit being claimed in internal models even if they don’t know the internal plumbing of copulas or correlation matrices. Regulators should expect them to take a prudent and conservative approach and to ask challenging questions about how the models will hold up in times of stress. The third dimension of Solvency II I would like to mention briefly is the impact of the directive on business models or, more narrowly, corporate structures. As I have mentioned, capital optimisation will inevitably be a key theme for the management of companies impacted by the directive. In addition to the use of models, revisions to corporate structures are to my mind likely to be a further avenue of exploration. In particular, in Ireland we see considerable interest in the so called Hub and Spokes Model. This involves choosing a single European jurisdiction as the location for the Hub operating company and conducting pan European insurance business on a branch basis throughout various EU countries. As necessary, existing subsidiaries outside of the hub country are therefore transferred into branches. This has the dual advantage of consolidating operations, thereby reducing costs through economies of scale, and also crucially of optimising capital, as capital is no longer fragmented in each individual subsidiary. There are some prominent examples of the Hub and Spokes structure in Europe involving Ireland as the choice of Hub. We will have to see whether this trend continues or not, although as I say there appears to be a compelling logic behind it. A challenge for the supervisor is the effective supervision of such structures. For our part, our starting proposition that the Hub must have substance and be able to deploy effective controls over the operations of its branches. Then, as a supplement, as a supervisor we too will assess branch operations directly or through the use of skilled persons such as auditors and consultants. Finally there is a significant challenge of coordination between both home and host supervisors to ensure that all interested stakeholders are kept well informed. At the Central Bank of Ireland we are very committed to ensuring that the appropriate regulatory framework is in place for Hub and Spoke operations and that our supervisory resources are adequate to the task of overseeing such operations. It will be interesting to see whether this model will grow as Solvency II gets closer to implementation. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I have by now given you a sense of where Solvency II stands in the implementation process and a few of the key issues that are currently being debated or considered. Let me conclude with a few words about the equivalence process and where Bermuda stands. Solvency II requires that insurers from third country jurisdictions must be subject to a regulatory framework that is broadly equivalent to that within Europe itself. Absence of such an equivalence finding provides the prospect of a more punitive solvency treatment for firms from such jurisdictions.  Bermuda, along with Switzerland and Japan, is in the first wave of countries being assessed for equivalence and is making extremely good progress. The first assessment of Bermuda by EIOPA was largely very positive, albeit with some further work to do in some areas. The protracted process of Solvency II implementation in Europe has in fact given more time for Bermuda and other countries to adapt their framework in order to be ready.  Following a further assessment by EIOPA the ultimate decision will rest with the European Commission, in consultation with other EU institutions. My view is that Bermuda is very well placed for this assessment process and is to be commended for the work that Jeremy Cox and his team have undertaken to drive forward enhancements to the Bermuda regulatory framework. These are by no means insignificant and have included the development of a risk based solvency framework and introduction of group solvency requirements. This is a significant accomplishment, although clearly more remains to be done. It may seem odd that recently Europe has proposed a transitional equivalence regime which will allow the benefits of the directive to be enjoyed on an interim basis, allowing other jurisdictions to take a longer route to reforming their regulatory frameworks to broadly match that in Europe. I wouldn’t be distracted by those developments. By being in the first wave of the equivalence assessment process and by hopefully winning a favourable outcome, Bermuda will be in the enviable position of having definitively cleared the EU process before many other competitor jurisdictions are able to do likewise. That provides absolute certainty to the Bermuda Market as to the treatment it will receive under the EU rule book and unlike other countries means that the risk of adverse regulatory developments will not be hanging in the background. Moreover, full equivalence recognition will cement Bermuda’s reputation as a financial centre that is committed to high standards of regulation.  There will, however, be continuing challenges in implementing the new framework on the ground. A regulatory framework is only effective as the supervision system that implements it. In Bermuda, the three issues that I have flagged earlier will have local ramifications that need to be worked through. The Bermuda solvency framework for life companies’ remains to be finalised and the implications of a market consistent economic valuation approach on balance sheets still needs to be fully developed. The internal model approval process will, as in Ireland and Europe, be a big challenge for Bermuda and will require some tough supervisory calls. And the new complex group structures of the post Solvency II world will require adequately resourced and high quality supervisors. Let me reinforce that last point in the Bermudian context, given the likely significant number of groups for which the BMA will be responsible. Group supervision is a major task and requires high quality dedicated supervisors who understand the business models of the firms they supervise, are able to periodically test governance and control frameworks, have a good understanding of complex intercompany transactions, can oversee the assessment of group solvency requirements, closely monitor the performance of internal models and ensure effective coordination and information flow between all relevant supervisors with an interest in the group. It is important that the Bermuda Market continues to provide support to the BMA as it builds up its capacity to undertake effective group supervision in practice, as the various tasks come on line and need to be executed. The Central Bank of Ireland is committed to working closely with the BMA to ensure effective cooperation in the supervision of those Bermuda groups with a presence in Ireland and across Europe. There is also a good working relationship between EIOPA and the BMA on questions of Solvency II cooperation and implementation.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Solvency II – while its implementation is not yet directly upon us – will have profound implications for the shape of the insurance market in Europe and beyond. The new regulatory standards will have implications both subtle and profound for insurance pricing, investment strategy and risk taking. It will encourage investments in risk management capability and ever more sophisticated modelling. It may provide incentives for fundamental reshaping of corporate structures. These are big challenges for regulated firms and for supervisors too. It is essential then that Ireland and Bermuda, and indeed Europe and Bermuda, work closely together through this process. It is encouraging to see the progress that has been made so far and I am confident that it will continue in the future.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Vítor Constâncio: Understanding the driving forces behind systemic financial crises Speech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 2011 Bernácer Prize Award Ceremony in honour of Mr Lasse Heje Pedersen, Madrid, 28 June 2012. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to address a few words to you in honour of this year’s winner of the 2011 Bernácer Prize, Professor Lasse Pedersen from New York University. The developments on the global financial markets that we have been witnessing in the past years are unprecedented in nature and have raised a number of challenges for policy makers and central banks alike. In times like these it is more important than ever that we use the advice of the brightest and most talented scholars in order to find answers to complex questions and develop effective tools with real-world applicability in order to combat the potentially adverse effects of financial instability without jeopardizing our primary mandate of medium-term price stability. Without doubt, Lasse Pedersen has been one of the leading minds that have re-shaped our thinking about financial markets, as his contributions during the past decade have greatly improved our understanding of the driving forces behind systemic financial crises and the propagation of liquidity shocks across markets and throughout the economy.  Naturally, academic research plays an important role for central banks in general because it provides the foundations for the conduct of monetary policy and its impact on the real economy. The Eurosystem is no exception to this and naturally finds itself in constant exchange with the global research community in the form of research seminars and conferences as well as regular academic visitors. Moreover the ECB regularly funds policy-relevant academic research via the Lamfalussy Fellowship. In 2010, the Eurosystem launched the Macroprudential Research Network MaRs with the objective to develop core conceptual frameworks, models and tools that would provide research support in order to improve macro-prudential supervision in the European Union.  Lasse Pedersen’s research focuses on the role of liquidity in financial markets. While much of the classical theory of asset pricing assumes a frictionless world, his work departs from this idealisation and acknowledges that real-world features such as the institutional structure of the way capital is invested around the globe have profound implications for both the determination of asset prices as well as for the stability of the financial system itself. Today, most trade in financial markets – be it stocks, bonds, currencies, or derivatives – does not take place between individuals but rather financial institutions such as banks and investment firms. This has important implications for the functioning of these markets because it introduces several important types of frictions. As we have all witnessed in the past years, many of these entities are very large, at least in terms of their balance sheets. Besides giving rise to the too-big-to-fail problem that has been at the heart of the current financial crisis, the size of these financial institutions has profound implications for the way investment portfolios are constructed and assets are traded, because it makes a large difference whether an agent wants to buy or sell 100 shares or 100,000 shares. For large investors, the impact of their actions on market prices is no longer negligible and they potentially incur large transaction costs due to “market impact”, such that fluctuations in market liquidity – the ease with which a security can be transformed into cash – become a first-order concern. Based on this real-world insight, Acharya and Pedersen 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches developed the liquidity adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM),1 which shows that investors do not only require compensation for bearing the risk associated to an asset’s fundamentals but also will command an additional premium related to the asset’s liquidity risk. Their theory is strongly supported by numerous empirical studies and can explain real-world phenomena such as the episodes of a flight to liquidity that we have witnessed more than once during the past years. Another salient feature of financial institutions that has featured prominently in the current financial crisis is leverage. In fact, most market participants do not finance their entire trading positions with equity but rather fund part of their investments by pledging the securities as collateral in repurchase agreements and asset-backed commercial paper. This implies that asset prices are also affected by funding liquidity, a concept that refers to the ease with which a security can be used to raise outside capital. In the years preceding the 2007–2008 financial crisis, leverage in the financial sector build up steadily fuelled by high demand for dollar-denominated short-term debt in conjunction with low interest rates. When the first rumours of problems in the market for sub-prime mortgages began to spread, uncertainty of exposures to potential losses directly translated into funding liquidity problems. In an equally rigorous and elegant contribution, Pedersen and his co-author Markus Brunnermeier – Winner of the 2008 Bernácer Prize – show how shocks to funding liquidity and market liquidity can reinforce each other and culminate in a downward spiral that gives rise to financial instability and systemic risk.2 If funding conditions worsen, initial losses on leveraged positions may lead to forced selling, and this temporary excess supply of securities cannot absorbed by liquidity providers precisely because speculative capital has become more costly. In turn, this reduced market liquidity leads to lower prices and increased volatility, thus creating a negative feedback effect as these developments imply a further tightening of funding liquidity, culminating in further fire sales and so on. The events around the collapse of the US housing market and the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy underline the central role of this vicious circle in the propagation of shocks across markets and market participants. Uncertainty about the exposures of potential counterparties lead to a temporary breakdown of the interbank market, thereby disrupting banks’ ability to manage their liquidity and additionally distorting the transmission of monetary policy. Because many investors, including hedge funds, heavily relied on bank funding, these problems ultimately spilled over to many other asset markets as liquidity providers were forced to become liquidity consumers, which lead some markets to virtually cease to exist while others saw repeated failures of the famous law of one price, that is instruments (nearly) identical cash flows traded at different prices.3 Another important contribution of Lasse Pedersen with co-authors relates to the measurement of systemic risk with development of indicators like the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) of financial institutions which jointly with Leverage is used to estimate Systemic Risk.4  Fortunately, Lasse Pedersen’s research does only help our understanding of these phenomena but also provides exact prescriptions of what policy makers can do to improve market stability and break these vicious downward spirals. In particular, his research                                                  1 Viral Acharya and Lasse H.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 prescribes an intervention aimed at improving funding liquidity as a measure of breaking the mentioned downward spiral and restoring market liquidity, thereby avoiding the failure of illiquid but solvent financial institutions. Additionally, he shows that measures such as broadening the universe of acceptable collateral and adjusting margin requirements can serve as important monetary policy tools in times of protracted liquidity and are complementary to the interest rate policy. In line with this, the European Central Bank has, as have many other monetary authorities around the globe, adopted several of these non-standard measures in an effort to combat a potential market breakdown and I think it is fair to say that their success in unquestionable. While considerable progress has been made with respect to our understanding of the causes, consequences and propagation of systemic financial crises, our knowledge is far from sufficient. Further advances are particularly needed in the fields of macro-prudential policy and regulation, and the Eurosystem aims to continue contributing to a filling of this knowledge gap, in particular via its Macroprudential Research Network and its involvement with the European Systemic Risk Board. I am confident that Lasse Pedersen will continue making extraordinary contributions in the coming years and hereby extend my very best congratulations to him for winning the 2011 Bernácer Prize.  I thank you for your kind attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Rodrigo Vergara: Chile’s latest Monetary Policy Report and Financial Stability Report Presentation by Mr Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, of the Monetary Policy Report and the Financial Stability Report, before the Finance Commission of the Honorable Senate of the Republic, Santiago de Chile, 18 June 2012. The Monetary Policy Report of June 2012 and the Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2012 can be found at http://www.bcentral.cl/eng/index.asp *      *      * Introduction Mr. President of the Finance Commission of the Senate, Senator José García, senators members of this Commission, ladies, gentlemen. I am grateful for your invitation to the Board of the Central Bank of Chile to share our views on recent macroeconomic and financial developments, prospects and implications for monetary and financial policy making. These views are contained in detail in our Monetary Policy Report of June 2012 and our Financial Stability Report of the first half of 2012. For several quarters now the world economy has been suffering constant swings. We have said time and again that the causes and consequences of the financial crisis of 2008 are yet to be resolved. Thanks to a combination of economic policy responses and its healthy economies and financial systems, the emerging world succeeded in mitigating its effects and resuming a growth trajectory. But the developed world, especially the Eurozone, has been unable to regain its strength. We have seen continuing tensions in world financial markets, doubts over the future behavior of the global economy, together with risks appearing, disappearing and reappearing again. As time has passed, with no evident signs of improvement in these economies’ outlook, problems have been exacerbated. Weak growth and the need for households, firms, banks and governments to reduce their debts, have created a vicious circle that hampers the solution to the macroeconomic and financial problems facing the advanced economies. Certainly, the case of the United States is different from the case of the Eurozone, because their institutions and the way they solve their internal imbalances are different. In the Eurozone, the situation of some economies is hardly sustainable. However, there are differences. While the economic block as a whole has a practically balanced current account, it varies from one country to the next. Germany has kept excess savings for several years, which has resulted in a current account surplus, while many peripheral countries post a deficit (figure i). Exchange rate and wage rigidities do not help resolve the imbalances within the region. Overall, in the past few quarters part of the necessary adjustments have been taking place. Germany has increased imports from peripheral Europe, and has cut down its exports to the same countries. Solving the imbalances of the Eurozone will take time and it will not be easy. Any solution will be costly, without a doubt. The events of recent weeks have confirmed that the crisis is far from over and that imbalances persist in the developed world that keep financial markets under stress. The reappearance of risks and the tensions we have seen are a reflection of that, and have deepened the differences between the behavior of the world economy and our own (table 1). Thus, today we are again facing significant risks. After some improvement in the first quarter of the year, conditions in the Eurozone relapsed and their financial markets have experienced tensions in the levels of last December or worse. The baseline scenario of our March Monetary Policy Report assumed that temporary, limited frictions would occur, although it warned about existing risks. In recent months those risks have resurfaced. There 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches is new debate about a possible disorderly resolution of the Eurozone crisis. Several economies are questioning the political support to the fiscal austerity measures. Economic and financial conditions in Spain have worsened further and its risk premium is in record highs, despite the announced capitalization of its banking industry. In addition, there are still doubts whether other countries will be needing similar action. Financial markets respond with increased risk premiums and greater appetite for safer assets. Stock prices are falling across the board, volatility is up, the dollar has appreciated again and the interest rates of government bonds from economies perceived as safe have dropped to record lows. At the same time, commodity prices have fallen sharply, especially oil. As in late 2011, the main effects of these tensions in emerging economies, aside from lower commodity prices, have been the depreciation of their currencies, fallen stock prices and increased risk premiums on their external bonds. Chile has not been spared, although as of the statistical closing of these Reports the effects have been limited. Compared with March, the peso/dollar parity has depreciated somewhat below 5 percent; the stock market, as measured by the selected price index IPSA in pesos, has lost over 7 percent, and the sovereign premiums of Chilean CDS have risen nearly 40 basis points. Money markets, meanwhile, have operated normally. In contrast with the developed world, in Chile domestic output and demand are still strong. In the first quarter, y-o-y GDP growth exceeded March’s forecasts. However, in quarter-to-quarter terms it lost strength with respect to late 2011 and grew according to trend. Inflation has been lower than expected, which, combined with the drop in international fuel prices, has reduced the risks for its short-term evolution. In general, medium-term inflationary risks are still latent because domestic markets remain tight. In this context, the Board has kept the monetary policy interest rate (MPR) at 5 percent since January, and has conditioned its future movements to the implications of domestic and external conditions on the inflation outlook. Chile is on a healthy position to confront further deterioration of the global scenario. We have built economic institutions that allow us to reach substantial levels of growth, and the necessary tools to mitigate any adverse shocks facing our economy. But we are not immune. In the globalized world of today, any change in conditions is rapidly propagated to other economies. The movements in financial markets that I mentioned a while ago are proof of this. Trying to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world would be not only useless, but harmful in the long run. The important thing is for us to have the capacity to shield ourselves from negative events and, when necessary, to take action to reduce their effects on our country. We already did so when the Lehman Brothers crisis hit in 2008. We couldn’t prevent the global recession from affecting our economy, but we did succeed in fostering a fast, sustainable recovery from 2009 onwards. In any case, our domestic macroeconomic situation has varied in these four years. Today, inflation is at 3 percent, GDP is growing at near-trend rates and the MPR is in a neutral range. This provides room to respond with monetary policy if necessary, although the timing and magnitude of the measures will have to be evaluated with special prudence and in light of the actual effects of external developments on our economy. Our financial system, meanwhile, has been solid and resilient to sudden changes in the international economy. The Board of the Central Bank is firmly determined to adopt any measures needed to mitigate the adverse effects of a worsened external scenario, but it also must be careful not to allow medium-term inflationary risks to end up triggering an unwanted increase in inflation. In the baseline scenario that we believe to be the most likely, the world economy will remain weak and will give us less impulse than we expected a few months ago. Although the Chilean economy will be affected, it will continue to perform well. Inflation will stay around 3 percent. But the external risks facing said baseline scenario are significant. Let me now look into this setting in more detail, examining the risks we have identified in our Monetary Policy Report and our Financial Stability Report. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Macroeconomic scenario As I just said, the external impulse on the Chilean economy in the next two years will be weaker than forecast in March. The poor performance of the developed world – for several quarters already – is being compounded with early signs of weakness in emerging economies, thus exacerbating the risks coming from abroad. I want to begin by the developed world. In the Eurozone, the new financial tensions have tightened credit constraints, while ongoing fiscal measures will not contribute to boost growth in the near term. The recession foreseen for the region this year will be deeper than previously estimated. The other developed economies will grow slowly. The U.S. will fall short of March forecasts, due to the slow recovery of its labor market, a real-estate sector that is still unable to leave the subprime crisis behind, a household deleveraging process that continues its course, and little additional room to apply any measures to boost growth. But, compared to March, the biggest difference in terms of world growth lies in the emerging world. In contrast with 2011, the main emerging economies have lost dynamism. Some indicators for China suggest that the decline in its growth rate will be sharper than forecast in March. This has prompted the adoption of more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, and India has followed suit. The rest of emerging Asia is feeling the effects of lower growth in China, the U.S. and Europe in its exports and its manufacturing industry. In Latin America, although there is more heterogeneity, the poor performance of Brazil in the first quarter stands out. Other economies, like Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile remain strong, sustained by their domestic demands. This world scenario of weaker economies and reduced inflationary pressures due to the lower oil price has triggered a relaxation of monetary policies of several emerging economies. The baseline scenario forecasts that Chile’s trading partners will grow 3.6 and 3.9 percent in 2012 and 2013, respectively, a little less than was foreseen in the previous Monetary Policy Report. This will also result in lower prices for copper and oil than were expected in March. In summary, the baseline scenario considers a reduced external impulse associated to slower world growth and somewhat tightened external financing conditions. It also considers that new stress episodes will occur in external financial markets (table 2). As has been observed in recent months, these events can be triggered by negative news coming from the fiscal accounts, economic growth and the banking situation in the Eurozone.  The feeble external outlook contrasts with the performance of Chile’s domestic demand and output in the last few quarters. In the first quarter of this year, GDP grew 5.6 percent, exceeding forecasts in the March Monetary Policy Report. In quarter-on-quarter terms, it expanded at trend rates, leading the Board to estimate that output gaps are still narrow. This view is based on the fact that, although the labor market continues to show signs of being tight, these signs have not intensified: employment has reduced its rate of expansion, the unemployment rate has settled at low levels and y-o-y growth in wages, while still strong, has moderated lately. In the first quarter, domestic demand grew somewhat less than output, but private consumption and investment are still robust. Inflation has behaved favorably in the past few months, below March’s forecasts. This, combined with oil prices falling in external markets, has reduced the risks that were envisioned then for its short-term trajectory. Still, the services component of inflation continues to be the largest contributor to its increase, so medium-term risks remain present, due to the closing of output gaps and the tight labor market (figure 2). Market inflation expectations have moderated for the short term and remain around 3 percent over the projection horizon. The baseline scenario foresees GDP growing this year between 4 and 5 percent, which is the same range forecast in March. Although the economy outgrew forecasts in the first quarter, the worsened external conditions will result in output slowing down more deeply than 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches forecast in March. Still, GDP growth will not drift substantially away from the trend, which the Board estimates at 5 percent. This projection also considers that y-o-y growth in consumption will moderate further, in line with decelerating labor income and less expansionary lending conditions than some months ago. Interest rates on consumer loans have risen lately, coinciding with a decline in the y-o-y growth of these credits. In addition, the Survey on Lending Conditions of the first quarter revealed greater constraints in the supply of consumer loans by some financial institutions. Demand for consumer loans continued to rise, according to this survey. For investment, the more persistent construction and infrastructure component – largely associated to the execution of mining and energy projects – suggests that it will remain strong in the coming quarters. Accordingly, measured in real terms, it will amount to 26.9 percent of GDP in 2012, up from 26.2 percent of GDP in 2011. The effects of the worsened external scenario will be visible mainly in inventories. The baseline scenario estimates that in 2012 inventories as a percentage of GDP will vary less than they did in 2011, reflecting the inventory adjustments that enterprises will be carrying out because of the uncertainty coming from abroad. Consumption and investment will also be partly affected by the worsened global conditions, but the main determinants will be the aforesaid factors. All these elements combined depict a scenario for 2012 where domestic demand grows less than in 2011, although still faster than output. The baseline scenario foresees the current account of the balance of payments posting a deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP this year, that is, bigger than in 2011, but somewhat smaller than forecast in March. Despite the lower price assumed for copper and the weak domestic demand, the expected adjustment in domestic demand plus the drop in the oil price are behind this smaller deficit (table 3). The Board estimates that y-o-y CPI and core inflation will continue to hover around the target until the end of the projection horizon, this time the second quarter of 2014 (figure 3). This trajectory assumes that wages will be adjusted to reflect productivity and the inflation target. As a working assumption, the real exchange rate is assumed to remain fairly unchanged, because it is estimated to be now within the range believed to be consistent with its long-term fundamentals. Finally, the baseline scenario also uses as a working assumption that, over the short term, the MPR will be stable. The baseline scenario reflects those events that are believed to be the most likely with the information at hand at the statistical closing of the Report. There are risk scenarios, however, which, if materialized, may reshape the macroeconomic environment – in some cases, significantly – and, therefore, may alter the course of monetary policy. On this opportunity, having evaluated the alternative scenarios, the Board estimates that the risk balance is downward biased for output, and unbiased for inflation. The greater risk originates abroad, because of the situation in the Eurozone. This is very complex and the developments of recent months have revived the possibility of more extreme scenarios. Most importantly, economic and financial problems in the region could be worked out in a costly and disorderly manner, for example with Greece leaving the monetary union. Despite its small size within the Eurozone, such an outcome could inflict severe damage on the rest of the world if there is contagion to bigger European economies. The macroeconomic and financial situation of Spain continues to spur doubts, as reflected in the steady increase in its risk premiums. The lack of clarity about the capitalization plan announced for the Spanish banking industry, its difficulties to meet the fiscal targets given the gloomy growth outlook and its impact on its sovereign debt are still cause for concern. Similarly, apprehensions have increased about other countries in the region, such as Italy, because of the bulk of its public debt and its slow growth. The coupling of risk premiums in Spain, Italy and France provides evidence of this risk. Also possible is a reversal of current tensions, for instance if there are agreements favoring compliance with the adjustment measures agreed or new announcements of support by economic authorities in the zone, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 that could buy time to advance in the necessary structural changes. The outcome of yesterday’s elections in Greece where the winner was the political option whose program is more in line with the country staying in the Eurozone, mitigates somewhat the eventuality of a Greek default triggering a crisis in the rest of the Eurozone. However, it is still premature to draw any conclusions. But undoubtedly the coming days will bring important news and we must be watchful of its effects on our economy. Additionally, other events will bring new information. More detail about the capitalization plan of Spain’s banks and the EC meeting later in the month may shed some light on new bailout measures. Other risks have to do with world growth prospects beyond the Eurozone. Doubts persist in the U.S. about how the transition to a sustainable medium- and long-term debt trajectory will proceed. Special attention is due to the possibility that political difficulties to reach agreements on the fiscal front could trigger the automatic adjustments foreseen towards 2013, hurting its GDP growth. In the emerging world, a sharper and/or longer Chinese slowdown than foreseen in the baseline scenario cannot be ruled out, hindering growth in other economies due to its weight in the global economy, and affecting commodity prices significantly. Domestically, as aforesaid, medium-term risks for inflation are still present. The growth rate of domestic demand and output has dropped, albeit not as fast as expected. Although the Board estimates that output gaps have not narrowed further, if output again takes up a more dynamic path, there can be pressures pushing inflation up and demanding a monetary policy response. Domestic demand has outgrown GDP in the last two years, thus widening the current account deficit. Households’ saving is low compared with earlier years, while corporate savings have decreased in the past year and investment is in record-high levels. If domestic demand becomes more dynamic, it could amplify the current account deficit. This could be risky in a scenario of weak world growth. As noted in our Financial Stability Report, aggregate solvency and liquidity of the Chilean economy remains stable. This is important, considering that banks’ and enterprises’ access to external credit could be hampered by a further deterioration of the global financial environment. In any case, and despite the impact of external volatility on the prices of some assets, financial markets have operated normally. In this context, I would like to highlight the need to continue advancing in initiatives to strengthen our regulatory and supervisory framework. One such case is the bill to reform insurance companies currently being debated in Congress. The banks’ solvency and liquidity indexes have been stable in the first half. In a context of good rents, core capital has hovered around 10 percent while regulatory capital – as measured through risk-weighted assets – around 14 percent. Meanwhile, since the last Financial Stability Report the banking industry has increased its long-term debt certificates, and some medium-sized banks have pursued strategies to attract retail deposits. Another favorable development is the greater diversification of banks into different types of credit from abroad. Also worth noting is the hoarding of liquid assets in foreign currency. The stress tests presented in our Financial Stability Report show that the banking industry’s current capitalization levels allow it to cushion an episode characterized by a GDP slowdown, higher financing costs in local currency and an exchange rate depreciation associated with the materialization of the external risk scenario. As for household debt, it should be noted that, on aggregate, borrowing has increased in tandem with disposable income. This has translated into fairly stable aggregate debt indicators, whether comparing the debt level or financial burden with disposable income or the wage mass. Corporate debt shows a similar pattern, increasing along with economic activity, without any widespread deterioration of financial indicators. Thus, it is our view that the Chilean financial system has not suffered any material increase of its systemic vulnerabilities. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches However, our Financial Stability Report also identifies some elements that might be sources of risk and that must be closely monitored. The construction and real estate sector has been strong lately. Activity in the real estate market has had stronger sales as a counterpart, for both housing and commercial use. While the vacancy rate in the commercial sector has remained low, the expected substantial expansion of supply and its inertia, especially in top-quality offices, is one factor that must be monitored closely given the risk scenarios facing economic activity. The evaluation of any new project should take this element into consideration. In the same token, aggregate housing prices have evolved in line with the economy’s level of interest rates and income. However, at some higher-priced districts, prices are still outgrowing their historic trends, possibly due to limited land available. It is important to keep in mind that the materialization of negative risk scenarios could lead to a breakdown in current price trends. The potential implications of this are price adjustments influencing the returns of executed projects and, additionally, the collaterals backing mortgage loans. With respect to household debt, two factors deserve careful attention. One is its rate of expansion. This, because if it continues to grow at the present rates, the debt and financial burden of households could rise substantially if a negative risk scenario materializes. In this context, having a consolidated data base is particularly important, to allow proper risk administration by suppliers and enhance the monitoring capacity of supervisors. The second factor is the behavior of credit-risk indicators. Although moderately, since mid-2011 there have been increases in banks’ non-performing consumer loans and in delinquency rates of commercial stores (figure 4). This element, as well as the sustained growth of credit-card financing and car loans should also be taken into account when evaluating the credit risk of households. Medium-sized, retail, and investment banks are persistently dependent on institutional financing sources. Besides, and despite the smaller relative weight of foreign banks in the external debt of local banks, the reduction in credits from banks based in peripheral Europe has resulted in greater concentration in banks from abroad. The complexity of today’s scenario calls for prudent monetary policy making and careful risk administration, in order to be prepared to deal with significant changes in the macroeconomic scenario. The international economy’s situation is worrisome and a further worsening could have major effects in Chile. Domestically, some risks persist relating to inflation, and it is the Central Bank’s task to be vigilant. The Board monitors closely the evolution of the external and internal macroeconomic scenario and its consequences on inflation, and it reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy in a way such that projected inflation stands at 3 percent in the policy horizon. Allow me some final remarks. Concluding remarks As has happened often in the past several years, our presentation of these Reports coincides with increased global financial stress and poses important challenges. The short-term inflationary risks we identified in March have lessened, although for the medium term they are still present. Our immediate challenge, however, is dealing in the best way possible with any effects from the external crisis on our economy. The Board of the Central Bank is willing to adopt whatever measure it deems necessary if more adverse scenarios occur. Events abroad are being monitored with special attention. For the moment, however, we estimate that worst-case scenarios are possible but not the most likely, although they are more likely now than before. In our projections we use as a working assumption that, in the short term, the monetary policy rate will remain stable. A change in scenery will certainly lead to a change in decisions. As I said before, the Board – present in 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 this session – monitors macroeconomic conditions closely and will act promptly whenever said changes warrant reorienting our monetary policy or using other tools at our disposal. There is the room and the will to do so. Let me share with you some thoughts about what I have perceived at the meetings I have held in recent months with monetary authorities around the world. The central bank governors of developed economies, plus some from emerging markets, get together once every two months to share our views on the global economic and financial situation. Two things have called my attention in the three meetings I have attended since I assumed as the governor of the CBC. On the one hand, the severity and gravity of the situation of some developed countries. Being so distant geographically from the main financial centers of the world, in Chile we often fail to grasp in full dimension the hardships facing some economies that interact with us. These meetings allow us to see firsthand these situations and feel their true magnitude. On the other, I am amazed by the high prestige that the Chilean economy enjoys in these same arenas. It is clearly set apart from others, because of its strength, its sound macroeconomic administration and the efficacy of its institutions. Of course this makes us confident as it gives us more and better tools to confront possible shocks coming from abroad. Our responsibility is twofold. On the one hand, is to keep inflation low and stable, to help in achieving sustainable growth. On the other hand, is to contribute with our powers to identify and address the risks threatening the normal functioning of our financial system. This certainly helps create an environment that facilitates economic growth and the population’s welfare. This is the main contribution that our institution can make to the development of our country, and the Board of the Central Bank of Chile is firmly committed to fulfilling this role. Thank you.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepak Mohanty: Price stability and financial stability – an emerging market perspective Address by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, in the 2012 Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Board Retreat, Cape Town, South Africa, 27 June 2012. *      *      * The assistance provided by J.K. Khundrakpam and Rajeev Jain is acknowledged.  “A system of credit which has slowly grown up as years went on, which has suited itself to the course of business, which has forced itself on the habits of men, will not be altered because theorists disapprove of it, or because books are written against it.” Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street,1873. It is indeed an honour for me to be addressing the distinguished members of the Board of Directors and Senior Management of the Central Bank of Nigeria. I thank Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi for this opportunity. The recent global financial crisis has generated an intense debate on the role and responsibility of central banks in maintaining financial stability. Over the centuries, the world has experienced periodic financial crises, prompting changes in the way we think about monetary and financial stability. Yet, we are not immune from crisis. In the present context, several questions arise. What ought to be the objectives of central banks or more specifically that of monetary policy? Is there a trade-off between price stability and financial stability? Were central banks blindsided by the success of price stability to the neglect of financial stability? Do central banks have the necessary mandate and instruments to handle multiple objectives and at the same time maintain credibility? How does one ensure accountability with multiple objectives? Is there a need to revisit the best practice in monetary policy? While we currently grapple with these issues, they are by no means new. Against this background, I sequence my presentation as follows. First, I briefly trace the evolution of central bank objectives over the centuries. Second, I review central bank objectives and practices in emerging market economies (EMEs). Third, I highlight our experience in India in the conduct of monetary policy and how we have combined it with financial stability. Finally, I conclude by drawing three practical lessons in central banking in terms of monetary policy framework, institutional design and communication in pursuit of both monetary and financial stability. Evolution of central bank objectives Let me first turn to central banking history for some insights. What was the motivation for setting up central banks in the 17th century? While the early central banks were set up for issuance of currency and financing governments, financial stability considerations got embedded as trade expanded and the banking and financial sectors developed. For instance, the Swedish Riksbank, the first central bank, was set up in 1668 as a joint-stock bank to lend funds to the government and to act as a clearing house for commerce. The Bank of England (BoE) was set up in 1694 to act as the government’s banker and debt-manager. How did central bank objectives change in the 19th century? Most central banks began assuming financial stability function though it was not articulated the way we understand it now. Drawing from the criticism on its functioning during the panics in 1825, 1837, 1847, and 1857, the BoE adopted the “responsibility doctrine” proposed by Walter Bagehot. The doctrine required the BoE to subsume its private interest to that of public interest of the banking system as a whole. As per the Bagehot’s rule, the BoE was to lend freely on the basis of any sound collateral offered, but at a penal rate to prevent moral hazard. Thus, the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches role of the central bank as the lender of last resort (LOLR) as espoused by Bagehot remains the cornerstone of financial stability function even today.1  How did central banks change in the 20th Century? The functions of central banks came to be further aligned with public policy objectives. Frequent bank panics in the US led to the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 with LOLR as one of its main functions. However, the Fed could not prevent the Great Depression as monetary policy followed the “Principle of Real Bills Doctrine”.2 After the Great Depression, central banks transformed themselves as growth and employment facilitators and put in place deposit insurance. This kept the world economy insulated from any major banking crisis from the late 1930s until the mid-1970s. But fiscal activism and the belief that employment can be permanently increased at the cost of inflation, supported by the early version of the Phillips Curve,3 led to accommodative monetary policy. This manifested in high inflation in the 1970s. In order to address the inflation surge and the accompanying economic stagnation, intellectual opinion swung in favour of price stability supported by the work of economists like Milton Friedman, which advocated a dominant role for monetary policy.4 Thus, price stability emerged as a primary objective of most central banks during the 1980s. How did financial stability fit into this framework? The understanding around that time was that monetary policy directed at maintaining price stability would lessen both the incidence and the severity of financial instability. The argument was that price stability obviates the information problems for both borrowers and lenders and ensures financial stability through efficient allocation of resources. Studies based on the experience of advanced countries such as the US, the UK, Canada and Japan also concurred with the view that price instability contributed to financial instability (Bordo and Wheelock, 1998).5 Did the financial crisis of the 21st century with its epicenter in the advanced countries change the world view of central bank objectives? The dominant view, particularly among the advanced economies, was that monetary policy should ideally have a single objective, a corresponding single tool, and an operationally independent and accountable central bank. In fact, following this wisdom, many countries, both advanced and emerging markets, set explicit inflation targets and mandated inflation control as the paramount objective of monetary policy since the 1990s. Explicit emphasis on price stability often came with certain legislative changes in central banks and emphasis on fiscal rules in many countries. Although central banks were cognisant of the importance of financial stability for conduct of monetary policy, a distinction between monetary policy and financial stability policy was generally maintained. The current global crisis seems to have undermined the view that monetary policy should only have a single objective of price stability. The pre-crisis view, also called the “Jackson Hole Consensus”, was that central banks should respond to asset prices and financial imbalances only to the extent that they affect the shorter term inflation forecast. However,                                                  1 The term was first used by Francis Baring (1797) but systematically explained by Thornton (1802) who first identified it as a function of Bank of England.

New York: Rinehart and Co., 1939. 2 If only real bills are discounted by banks, the expansion of bank money will be in proportion to the needs of trade. It was assumed that monetary system will be self regulating. 3 Phillips, A. W. (1958).

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 such perception was belied by the recent crisis (Gali, 2011).6 It became clear that financial stability can be jeopardised even if there is price stability and macroeconomic stability (Subbarao, 2009).7 Consequently, post-crisis assessment increasingly veered towards explicit recognition of the financial stability objective. But there are unsettled issues and the jury is still out. First, should financial stability be considered as an explicit objective of the central bank or, more specifically, as an additional objective of monetary policy? It has been argued that central banks are not only the lenders of last resort, but also better equipped to look at both financial system and economic cycles. In this context, Eichengreen, Prasad and Rajan (2011) suggest a dual mandate of price stability and financial stability so that “monetary policy is recognised as a legitimate element of the macroprudential supervisor’s toolkit.”8 Similarly, Woodford (2012) argued that monetary policy might indeed lessen the severity of risks to financial stability.9 Gokarn (2010) was of the view that broader mandates for central banks will need to be made explicit and conditional on the priority of the core mandates.10 In contrast, Svensson (2010) argued that it was important to distinguish financial stability policy from monetary policy to avoid conceptual and practical confusion between the two policies. Using monetary policy for the financial stability objective can lead to poor outcomes.11  Second, how compatible is inflation targeting framework with financial stability as an additional objective? The views are quite diverse. While some recommend eschewing of inflation targeting altogether, Woodford (2012) suggested modifying inflation-targeting practice for making interest rate policy a more effective tool for financial stability.12 In contrast, Svensson (2010) opined that flexible inflation targeting remains the best-practice monetary policy before, during, and after the financial crisis.13 Third, should financial stability be the sole or shared responsibility of the central bank? A BIS survey shows that in practice an overwhelming majority of central banks have either full or shared responsibility for financial stability, but the mandates are rarely explicit.14 Similarly, Čihák (2010) found that the remit for central bank’s role in financial stability was weaker than in the case of price stability.15 The dominant view, however, seems to be that financial stability should be a shared responsibility, as monetary policy instruments of central banks can only have a partial impact on the ultimate objective of financial stability. Fourth, do central banks have the instruments to ensure both price stability and financial stability? Central banks functioning with a single instrument of short-term interest rate,                                                  6 Gali, Jordi (2011), “Monetary Policy and Rational Asset Price Bubbles”, Barcelona GSE Working Papers Series No.592. 7 Subbarao, D.

4 BIS central bankers’ speeches particularly those with inflation targeting framework may not be equipped to achieve multiple objectives following Tinbergen’s assignment rule.16 In this context, many have argued that interest rate is too blunt an instrument for dealing with overall financial stability issues (for example, Bernanke, 2011).17 Goodhart (2008) opined that many central banks with only one instrument of monetary policy may find these two objectives often conflicting with each other.18 In contrast, it is argued that though identifying the bubble is difficult, and therefore a risky strategy, the cleaning up cost after the bubble burst may be costlier than leaning against the bubble (Stark, 2010).19  Finally, there are additional complexities in the context of EMEs as asset price bubbles are often accompanied by exchange rate appreciation emanating from large capital inflows or trade surplus. Therefore, raising interest rate in an attempt to burst asset bubble may engender further capital inflows aggravating the bubble itself. Thus, it has been emphasised that even if monetary policy is used to lean against the wind, it needs to be supplemented by counter-cyclical instruments. Some economists believe that combining financial supervision with monetary policy tasks, as indeed the case in many EMEs, can lead to synergies and a more effective conduct of monetary policy (Borio, 2009),20 and it can be usefully connected to the central banks’ lender-of-last-resort function (Blinder, 2010).21 Danthine (2012) suggested that central banks should be endowed with macroprudential instruments that directly target the root causes of the problems generated by excessive risk taking in times of low interest rates.22 In this regard, Mohanty (2011) argued that while interest rate continues to be the dominant instrument for implementing monetary policy, supplementing it by other quantity or macroprudential instruments even in normal times will enhance the flexibility of monetary policy to attain multiple objectives.23 Therefore, post-crisis, there has been greater emphasis on introducing additional instruments for central banks to deal with aspects of financial stability. In short, the role of central banks in ensuring overall stability of the financial sector has now got a fresh impetus. Against this background, I turn to the experience of EMEs. Central bank objectives in emerging markets How have the central bank objectives in EMEs been different? Historically, price stability has been a key objective for central banks in EMEs as in the case of advanced economies. However, given the level of financial market development and institutional structure, financial                                                  16 Tinbergen, J.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 stability has been important to policymaking, considering the greater incidence of financial crises in EMEs in the 20th century. Moreover, many of them were also responsible for macroprudential regulation even though only a few of them directly derive it from the explicit mandate (Table 1). Indeed, the resilience of the financial systems in the emerging markets during the recent global financial crisis owes to financial stability already being an important monetary policy objective (De Gregorio, 2011).24 Even as many EMEs formally adopted inflation targeting (e.g., Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand and Mexico), in practice they followed a “flexible inflation targeting” framework, as discretion was used to respond to shocks and also to pursue other objectives.25 EMEs which did not formally adopt inflation targeting (e.g. China, Nigeria, Malaysia and India) have price stability as one of the key objectives of monetary policy (Table 2). Multiple instruments, including quantitative tools such as the cash reserve ratio, were used to moderate the pace of domestic credit growth as well as monetary impact of large capital inflows in China, India and Russia. In the East Asian EMEs, the importance of financial stability and the need to prevent financial imbalances by active use of macroprudential policy measures was emphasised after the Asian crisis. Accordingly, central banks were given either the sole or shared responsibility in pursuing financial stability in addition to the traditional mandate of monetary stability (Watanagase, 2012).26 In South Africa, the prudential regulation and supervision of banks assisted and complemented the central bank in its pursuit of financial system stability. Similarly, the Central Bank of Brazil actively used macroprudential measures to deal with emerging financial risks, particularly from excess capital flows in the economy. According to a BIS survey (2010), EMEs significantly outnumbered advanced economies as users of some type of macroprudential instrument.27  Global financial crisis highlighted the importance of using a broader set of instruments for financial stability. In this regard, most central banks in EMEs where monetary policy and prudential supervision were within their purview seem to have been better equipped to address financial stability issues as compared to advanced economies. Now, I turn specifically to our experience in India. Financial stability: Indian framework The core functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are enshrined in the preamble to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 as, “to regulate the issue of bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage”. In addition, the RBI is also microprudential regulator as the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 entrusts it with the power to regulate and supervise commercial banks and co-operative banks. The RBI also regulates                                                  24 De Gregorio, José (2011), “Price and Financial Stability in Modern Central Banking”, Keynote Speech, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the joint Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association (LACEA)-Latin American Chapter of the Econometric Society (LAMES) Conference 2011, University Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, November 11. 25 Flexible inflation targeting (IT) framework which requires achievement of the desired inflation target over the medium-term makes it easier for central banks to look not only for price stability, but also consider other variables, such as the output gap or the exchange rate. In a sense, flexible IT also implies a departure from the corner solutions of the ‘Impossibility Trinity’ of fixed exchange rates, independent monetary policy and perfect capital mobility. 26 Watanagase Tarisa (2012), Remarks at Monetary Policy Workshop on Strengthening Macroprudential Frameworks organised by IMF Regional Office for Asia and Pacific (OAP) March 22–23, Tokyo, Japan. 27 Bank for International Settlements (2010), “Macroprudential Instruments and Frameworks: a Stocktaking of Issues and Experiences”, CGFS Papers, No. 38. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches and supervises non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Similarly, the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 empowers it to regulate the foreign exchange market and the oversight of the payment systems is derived from the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Drawing from a wider mandate, monetary policy in India has evolved to have multiple objectives of price stability, financial stability and growth. These objectives are not inherently contradictory, rather mutually reinforcing. The Reserve Bank’s approach recognises that price and financial stability are important for sustaining high levels of growth which is the ultimate objective of public policy. The Reserve Bank’s approach to financial stability has been proactive and preventive rather than reactive. Its role as monetary policy authority, well integrated with macroprudential regulation and microprudential supervision, with an implicit mandate for systemic oversight has enabled the Reserve Bank to exploit the synergies across various dimensions (Subbarao, 2011).28  Even before the crisis, the institutional arrangement in the financial sector was already in place for inter-regulatory co-ordination to monitor financial stability in the economy. A High Level Co-ordination Committee on Financial Markets (HLCCFM) was set up in 1992 with the Governor of the Reserve Bank as Chairman, and the Chiefs of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and the Finance Secretary to Government of India as members. However, post-crisis, the collegial approach to financial stability has been further strengthened by constituting the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC). The FSDC, headed by the Finance Minister, was set up in December 2010 in the wake of the global financial crisis with a specific mandate, inter alia, for systemic financial stability. The FSDC is expected to deal with issues relating to financial stability, financial sector development, inter-regulatory co-ordination and macroprudential supervision of the economy including the functioning of large financial conglomerates. A Sub-Committee of the FSDC, headed by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, replaced the HLCCFM and is the primary operating arm of the FSDC. This Sub-Committee has also set up a dedicated Crisis Management Framework. In addition, various committees of the Reserve Bank’s Central Board monitor financial stability issues: the Board for Financial Supervision reviews the Reserve Bank’s supervisory and regulatory initiatives and the Board for Payment and Settlement Systems oversees the overall functioning of the payment system. Another development signifying the Reserve Bank’s role in the context of financial stability is the setting up of Financial Stability Unit in the Bank in July 2009 with a mandate to conduct effective macroprudential surveillance of the financial system on an ongoing basis and enable early detection of any incipient signs of instability. The Reserve Bank also brings out biannual Financial Stability Reports. Incidentally, the IMF has just concluded a Financial Sector Assessment Programme, which in fact comes close on the heels of a comprehensive self assessment of financial sector carried out by the Reserve Bank. Thus, the RBI is one of those central banks to recognise financial stability as one of the objectives of monetary policy even before the crisis. Lessons for central banks In my opinion, the global financial crisis has fundamentally altered the way we used to view monetary policy and financial stability and the interface between them. However, there are                                                  28 Subbarao, D. (2011), “Financial Stability Mandate of Central Banks: Issues in the International and Indian context”, RBI Bulletin, July. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 issues which entail further work in three key areas. First, a relook at monetary policy framework in terms of both objectives and instruments towards a clear recognition of financial stability. Second, to put in place an appropriate institutional mechanism drawing upon countries’ own experience and history for better co-ordination among the concerned regulatory entities to deliver on financial stability. Third, address the communication challenge of multiple objectives to preserve central bank credibility to ensure price and financial stability. Let me now elaborate on each of these three aspects. (i) Monetary policy framework The view that monetary policy framework should allow policymakers to lean against the build-up of financial imbalances, even if near-term inflation expectations remain anchored, is gaining importance. While there is little doubt that monetary policy framework of central banks needs to change, the moot point is what should be the ideal monetary policy framework for better analysis of the macroeconomic effects of financial imbalances? One approach could be to formally broaden the set of information variables for monetary policy decision making: in a way, for example, the two pillar approach of the ECB or the multiple indicators approach of the Reserve Bank of India that factors in financial considerations into monetary policy.29 The multiple indicators approach has the advantages of broad-basing monetary policy operations on a large set of information such as money, credit, asset prices, interest rates and exchange rate and providing flexibility in the conduct of monetary management. Such approach, however, may involve a greater element of judgment. At an operational level, the most widely accepted presentation of monetary policy reaction function that combines both inflation and growth objectives is the “Taylor Rule”. The Taylor rule can be augmented by adding financial variables to the standard monetary reaction function based on inflation and the output gap so as to enhance central banks’ ability to react to financial stability concerns. However, efficiency of such a formulation needs to be tested. Whichever framework is adopted, there should be flexibility for the central bank to respond to potential imbalances and the risks, apart from growth and inflation control. (ii) Institutional design for better coordination The recent crisis and the subsequent response have shed new light on the critical role of central banks in promoting financial stability. However, it needs to be recognised that this added responsibility should not come at the cost of their conventional role for price stability. This is more relevant particularly for central banks in EMEs which admittedly, are yet to achieve that level of credibility as their advanced economy counterparts. For many EMEs, exchange rate stability is an important objective, and without price stability it is not possible to maintain exchange rate stability. Furthermore, the financial markets and institutions have grown in complexity, the oversight and regulation of which could be beyond a single entity such as the central bank. Hence, financial stability would have to be a joint responsibility, though the central bank could have a dominant role by virtue of it being the natural lender of last resort. However, there is a need to explicitly incorporate the financial stability role of the central bank into its statute to establish an accountability framework. The challenge for a central bank is to achieve multiple objectives without losing credibility as a monetary authority solely responsible for price stability. This would be possible only if policies implemented by various stakeholders in financial stability are coherent. Accordingly, an appropriate design for co-ordination mechanism is required to derive synergies between monetary policy and macroprudential policy and make more effective use of policy tools available with multiple bodies having the mandate of financial stability.                                                  29 For discussion on multiple indicators approach, please see: Mohanty (2010), “Monetary Policy Framework in India – Experience with Multiple-indicators Approach”, RBI Bulletin, March. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches The design of co-ordination mechanism may, however, vary across countries depending on the nature and size of their financial systems and their own historical experience. In fact, efforts towards greater institutionalisation of co-ordination mechanism have already begun. Most prominent examples are the newly created bodies, both in advanced countries and EMEs, like the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the US, the Financial Policy Committee (Interim) in the UK, the European Systemic Risk Board for the European Union, Financial Regulation and Systemic Risk Council in France, Financial Stability Council in Chile, Council for the Stability of the Financial System in Mexico and Financial Stability and Development Council in India (Table 3). In some other countries, financial stability framework has been strengthened by setting up committees in central banks to gauge systemic risk (e.g., Brazil in 2011). Under the new institutional design, as shown in Table 3, though financial stability has been recognised as a shared responsibility, central banks have been assigned the lead role in most of the countries. Even as details of the newly created bodies differ, the thrust is the same, i.e., better co-ordination to gauge systemic risks and plan an appropriate response. Furthermore, with increasing sovereign risk concerns in a number of economies, particularly the advanced economies, better policy response is expected as fiscal authorities are also a part of the new institutional framework for financial stability. However, even under the more collegial approach to financial stability, policy co-ordination is not going to be so easy, especially when there is a problem of time-inconsistency and the objective functions of the authorities may not always be the same (Praet, 2011).30 It is also important to guard against the risk that active involvement of governments should not bring back fiscal dominance and compromise the autonomy of each regulator and the central bank. (iii) Central bank communication In a market-determined system, central banks have placed a greater reliance on transparency and communication to enhance monetary policy transmission and establish accountability to the public for their decision-making. So far the experience shows that communication on monetary policy issues has moved from complete secrecy, to constructive ambiguity to transparency. For instance, the Fed and the ECB have in recent years frequently provided fairly direct indications about future interest-rate decisions in their official statements. We, in the RBI, have also started giving forward guidance since September 2010. However, there are several challenges. It is not easy to communicate clearly on a single objective. Going forward, as central banks broaden their mandates and institutional design grows in complexity, so also will the communication challenges. For example, if a central bank were to ease monetary policy on financial stability concerns even when inflation is high, it risks unhinging of inflation expectations, which in turn could complicate financial stability. During the recent crisis, there were many instances of communication challenges faced by central banks. For instance, the US Fed faced communication challenge with regard to quantitative easing and the exit policy of its unconventional measures. We, in the RBI, had to face communication challenge when we reduced cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks in January and March 2012 on liquidity concerns even when inflation was above our tolerance level. While some interpreted it as premature reversal of tight monetary policy stance, others saw this as a pure liquidity action not inconsistent with our monetary stance. If the policy measures are not properly guided and not understood as intended, they may not transmit the right signal and eventually prove to be a noise to financial market entities.                                                  30 Praet, Peter (2011), “The (Changing) Role of Central Banks in Financial Stability Policies”, Speech at the 14th Annual Internal Banking Conference, Organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the European Central Bank, Chicago, November 10. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 Guidance by central banks, at best, could be conditional because of the provisional nature of immediate available information set, limitations of macro models, incomplete knowledge and uncertainties about the evolution of the economy and periodic unanticipated shocks. Thus, transparency in communication is a double-edged sword which at times could produce unintended consequences. As central banks broaden their objectives so also they have to hone their communication skills. Conclusion To sum up: Financial stability as an objective of central banks has turned a full circle from being the predominant objective, to a virtual neglect to being reinstated recently as an important objective drawing on the lessons of global financial crisis. However, financial markets and institutions have grown in complexity making it difficult for a single entity to deliver on financial stability. Therefore, financial stability has to be a shared responsibility wherein central banks have a predominant role. This necessitates a fresh look at monetary policy framework, institutional design for policy co-ordination and effective communication. Moreover, there is a need for explicit recognition of financial stability objective, particularly in the statute of the central bank, to establish an accountability framework. While it is not very apparent whether price stability can ensure financial stability, it is clear that price instability could jeopardise financial stability. Financial stability objective, therefore, cannot or should not override the price stability objective, which should continue to be the predominant objective of monetary policy. Thank you.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ebson Uanguta: Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in Namibia Speech by Mr Ebson Uanguta, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Namibia, at the Namibia Business Innovation Centre (NBIC) Business Idea Competition, Windhoek, 23 May 2012. *      *      * Master of Ceremonies  Prof. Tjama Tjivikua, the Rector of Polytechnic of Namibia  Ms. Dagmar Honsbein, Director: Namibia Business Innovation Centre (NBIC)  Dr Malan Lindeque, Permanent Secretary: Ministry of Trade & Industry  Other Members of Polytechnic of Namibia’s Management Team  Members of Advisory Board and NBIC Staff  Invited Guests  Participants of the competition  Members of the Media  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to join you today at this important event. I am honoured to be the keynote speaker and to present the awards to the finalists and overall winners.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Let me begin by congratulating each finalist of the Business Idea Competition. This year, I understand there were a record number of entrants and the quality of entrees has improved. Therefore, to be chosen among all these applications as the top 3 winners, you are truly among the creative and innovative individuals. We honour you for your hard work and resilience thus far on this very important journey of innovative entrepreneurship. This is indeed an important step in that journey; that is the step of conceptualisation of your business ideas. The next important step should be to monetise your innovation. Judging by your demonstrated hard work and commitment thus far, I have no doubt that all of you will pull through to the stage of sustainable monetisation of your ideas. The mentorship programme provided by the NBIC will help greatly in that process. I therefore implore you to avail yourselves to the ultimate mentoring that will be offered, so that you will be able to implement your business ideas successfully.  To the other participants who did not make it to the finals, I urge you to keep on pursuing your ideas and dreams to innovate. History has repeatedly shown that perseverance is a key factor to the long-term success of every innovator and each entrepreneur. For instance, Thomas Edison termed as one of the most prolific inventor in history had 1,000 unsuccessful attempts at inventing the light bulb. It is reported that when a reporter asked, “How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?” Edison replied, “I didn’t fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps.” This is the attitude that we should adopt; an attitude of “persistence until the breakthrough”. This is exactly what Namibia needs; an army of persistent, innovative entrepreneurs that will steer employment creation and economic growth.  Ladies and gentlemen,  As we all know, NBIC aspires to be the innovation hub that sparks the interest for innovation and entrepreneurship among people from all walks of life. This is done through different programmes in place, such as workshops and individual mentoring to help people develop their innovative ideas into formalized businesses. As such, today we are marking the outcome of one of these programmes which is the Business Idea Competition. This 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  programme in particular, targets the general public. It is a form of inspiring citizens of Namibia to initiate innovative business Ideas. Entrepreneurs play a key role in keeping economies strong and competitive. They are the creators, risk takers, inventors and creator of jobs and wealth in an economy.  The starting point for any business centers on the belief that entrepreneurship is about creativity through a person coming up with an innovative idea in the market. In other words, one point of starting a business is to identify a problem in a certain market and come up with an idea of how to solve that problem. This was also confirmed by Thomas Edison when he said “I never perfected an invention that I did not think about in terms of the service it might give others… I find out what the world needs, then I proceed to invent.”  With these words, Ladies and gentlemen,  Entrepreneurs should be encouraged to explore causes and problems in areas they are passionate about because any problem could translate into a business. In addition, to be a successful entrepreneur, you need to have the passion, confidence as well as the commitment and ability to realize the materialization of your business ideas. Of course, you also need a business plan, but at the beginning, you need to come up with an idea. In short, one can say a great businesses start with a creative innovative idea that solves a problem at hand.  Against this background, Ladies and Gentlemen,  We need to change our focus and spend more time on training our people and help them to become innovative and creative. The reason is that, if we can get better ideas, we get better business plans and better businesses. For example, Bill Gates, Mary Kay, Richard Branson, Thomas Edison, Debbi Fields – to name just a few, are some of the successful entrepreneurs in the world, but they never graduated from college, nor did they pursue formal education in business or entrepreneurship. Yet from Microsoft to Virgin and other big businesses, they redefined what it takes to turn good ideas into lucrative businesses. We therefore acknowledge and recognise the important role the NBIC is playing in training, coaching and mentoring aspiring innovative entrepreneurs. We believe that NBIC provides a unique opportunity to exchange ideas, explore new businesses, discuss emerging technologies, share growth strategies and obtain insight from global business leaders, community leaders and worldwide experts.  The Bank of Namibia is therefore very proud to be associated with the NBIC’s quest to help people to create and realize their new innovative ideas. Indeed, as one of the sponsors of NBIC, today, the Bank of Namibia would like to reaffirm its commitment and support to this noble call. We have faith in what NBIC is doing and hope that it will continue to do even more. We know that NBIC’s contribution to innovation and creativity will help greatly in the Nation’s quest for employment creation and economic growth, and more so, for Namibia to become a competitive country in the world.  On its part, the Bank of Namibia, together with the Ministry of Finance and support from other Government Ministries and Agencies will continue to persist in ensuring that the Financial Sector Strategy that makes access to finance for SMEs as one of its focal points is successfully implemented. This is in light of the fact that access to finance will go a step further in complementing the efforts of institutions such as NBIC and thereby ensuring that we create a vibrant culture of entrepreneurship as a Nation.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Without much ado, allow me to go to the second part of my task today to applaud the finalists. These are the people who worked late into the evening and early in the morning to come up with creative and innovative business ideas. On behalf of the Bank of Namibia, once again, I want to congratulate all the finalists of the NBIC Business Idea Competition and wish you the best of luck. We look forward to learning more about your innovative ideas and helping you to move them off the drawing boards and into the marketplace. Although, you 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  have emerged as winners today, the ultimate winners will be the people whose quality of lives will be changed through the impact of your business ideas on economic growth and job creation in Namibia – through your hard-work and determination.  Finally, I would like to leave you with these words from Steve Jobs as food for thought, “I am convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.” Let’s persevere, and make Namibia a truly competitive, global player. Ladies and gentlemen, it is therefore a great honour for me to present the awards to the winners of the Business Idea Competition.  I thank you! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Asia in the world – sustaining the region’s transformative momentum Keynote address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Wharton Global Alumni Forum: “Asia in the world – sustaining the region’s transformative momentum”, Jakarta, 22 June 2012. *      *      * The global economy is experiencing a period of profound change. Asia is very much at the centre of this global change. Asia’s changing role in the global economy has not only been in terms of its growing size, but also in terms of its influence in global economic and financial developments. The issue before us is whether Asia will continue its transformative momentum over the medium to longer term, to become an increasingly important source of global growth and stability. It is my very great honour and pleasure to be here in Jakarta to speak at this Wharton Global Alumni Forum. Exactly a decade ago, I was actually invited to speak on the same subject on the state and future of Asia at the Wharton School in Philadelphia. Then, having just emerged from the Asian financial crisis, the region was again being challenged by a series of economic and financial shocks, in particular, the bursting of the dot com bubble in the United States in the year 2000. Observers had questioned the sustainability of the region’s medium and longer term growth prospects. Now, five years into the global financial crisis, Asia is faced with an even more challenging and uncertain global environment, as significant spillovers originating from Europe and the United States are being felt by the region. Again, questions on the sustainability of the region’s economic growth prospects are being raised. My remarks today will focus on the new challenges that are confronting Asia, and whether its resilience built in this decade will now enable Asia to rise to these greater and more complex challenges. Challenges arising from global spillovers Given the degree of openness of most of the Asian economies, Asia is highly integrated with the global economy. While Asia benefited from this openness, it also resulted in the region being more vulnerable to global financial and economic developments. Many previous episodes of economic recession and crisis were triggered by external shocks, which at times exacerbated and amplified domestic vulnerabilities. These include the commodity price shocks in the 1970s and ‘80s, the large swings of destabilising capital flows in the 1990s, the bursting of the tech bubbles and the SARs epidemic in the early 2000s, and finally the global recession which saw an unprecedented decline in global trade.  The ongoing global financial and economic crisis is resulting in turbulence in the international financial markets. In part, this is emanating from the global policy spillovers arising from the unprecedented monetary easing, which has resulted in surges of capital inflows in search of higher returns in a low interest rate environment. This is followed by reversals arising from the deleveraging efforts to reduce public and private indebtedness. These volatile capital flows in the international financial markets have increased the volatility in exchange rates and asset markets. The low international interest rate environment has also been a factor that has increased the prospect for the financialisation of commodity markets. Finally, there is the impact of the potential unintended consequences of the global financial regulatory reforms. The effort to implement the new global regulatory reforms is already underway in Asia, with many jurisdictions making significant progress. These reforms are aimed to significantly enhance financial institutional soundness and safeguard financial stability. Concerns have, however, been raised on the unintended consequences that may 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches arise in the emerging economies, including its potential ramifications on the real economy. This underscores the importance to implement these reforms cautiously, including the need to conduct impact and behavioural studies, and to consider how the national implementation of these global standards should reflect the respective domestic experiences and circumstances. Factors underlying the transformation of Asia Asia’s rapid growth trajectory over several decades has been underpinned by a number of fundamental characteristics. These same characteristics are still present and will continue to support the ongoing transformation that is currently taking place. More recently, distinct strategies have been implemented to strengthen further the macroeconomic fundamentals and financial system soundness in the region. These stronger foundations, of steady growth, low unemployment, relatively low inflation, and strong and more developed financial systems, have strengthened Asia’s resilience and its ability to manage external vulnerabilities. They have placed Asia today in a stronger position to secure and sustain its future growth and stability, compared to a decade ago Three prominent characteristics that are common to most countries in the region have contributed to Asia’s economic success. First and most important is the economic flexibility of Asia – the ability to adjust to changing conditions without being weighed down by structural impediments and policy rigidities. The significant investment in productivity enhancements and technology is complemented by the high degree of capital and labour mobility. Financial reforms for deregulation and greater market orientation and liberalisation have also facilitated the region to continually shift resources to new areas of comparative advantage. These have not only enhanced Asia’s competitiveness, but also yielded a more diversified economic structure. More recently, the policy strategy has been to strengthen domestic demand as an important driver of growth. This will serve to anchor Asia’s growth prospects. As domestic demand strengthens, Asia is transitioning from being global producers to becoming global consumers. This trend will also contribute towards more balanced global growth. Asia is one of the most diverse regions in the world – in terms of market size, stage of development, resource endowment, economic structure, financial sector development, and market systems. Asia has leveraged on the complementarities arising from this diversity. This is reflected in the increased cross-border production networks in Asia, where substantial gains have been experienced from the region being involved in the entire supply chain for a wide range of products and services. Increased intra-regional trade and investment over the recent decade has also resulted in a more diversified export structure – in terms of markets and products. Going forward, this diversity will continue to present significant opportunities in the form of large and growing markets across a wide spectrum of goods and services. Accounting for 60 percent of the world’s population, Asia is by far the most populous region of the world. This demographic advantage is a key economic asset for the region. In this current decade, a young middle class population has emerged, and it is growing both in number and in affluence. Asia’s current middle class of 500 million people is projected to increase by more than six-fold, to exceed 3 billion people, by 2030. This tremendous increase in scale will significantly raise Asia’s potential to be important consumers in the global economy. In parallel, urbanisation and infrastructure development will reinforce this trend. This increase in consumption and the greater need for investment will anchor the growing importance of domestic demand in Asia. These fundamentals have been reinforced by the implementation of distinct strategies that have been undertaken in this recent decade following the Asian financial crisis, to strengthen the region’s ability to manage external shocks. The effectiveness of these reforms was put to test during the recent global crisis. While affected by the crisis, the effects on the domestic economies and financial systems have been relatively contained. Importantly, financial 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 intermediation has not been disrupted, and the financial systems have continued the supply of credit to support the real economy. Following the Asian financial crisis, wide-ranging financial reforms were undertaken to strengthen the financial systems of the region. The building of sufficient capital and liquidity buffers during good times provided the ability to support the continued credit intermediation process. Improved regulatory and supervisory approaches, underpinned by enhanced governance and risk management practices, have enhanced financial stability in the region. Enhanced surveillance arrangements and a wider range of policy tools have placed policymakers in better state of readiness to deal with problems in the financial system pre-emptively. Macroprudential policies have also been extensively relied upon to mitigate the risks from excesses and imbalances in the financial system. Continued efforts were also made to further advance financial sector development in the region. In particular, the development of the domestic bond market has served to reinforce the foundations for financial stability in Asia. Financial activities have also remained generally anchored by productive real economic activities. In addition to the region’s strong external position, high international reserves and more flexible exchange rates have also enabled Asia to absorb and adjust to changing external conditions.  The increasing cohesiveness of Asia is also a core strength and source of stability for the region. Steps have been intensified during this recent decade for greater financial integration. The motivation for greater financial integration is not only to unlock the growth potential of the region, but to achieve more effective and efficient intermediation of funds in the region, particularly by channelling the large surplus funds in the region to productive investments in the region. This would also support regional economic integration. While Asia’s trade with economies outside the region has doubled since 2000, intra-Asia trade has tripled. Now, more than fifty five percent of Asia’s total export is within the region. Intra-regional investment activity has also increased significantly during this decade. It is important to recognise that the approach to a more integrated Asia is different from that adopted by Europe. In the early 2000s, a study undertaken by the ASEAN ten economies concluded that the region did not have the preconditions for a single currency. A different route would therefore be taken to achieve greater integration. For the ASEAN region, it would involve a sequenced liberalisation of the financial sector and capital account, and the development of regional financial markets and financial infrastructure including the regional payments and settlement system. This arrangement also allows for a gradual pace of integration to ensure domestic readiness and the flexibility to take into account the prevailing conditions and stage of development of the participating financial system. Regional collaborative efforts also have been significantly enhanced in the area of crisis management. The region is now well ahead in the areas of regional surveillance and supervisory arrangement, and in crisis prevention, management and resolution. Regional support mechanisms have also been established. There are also regional institutional arrangements in place for the active sharing of information on the emerging risks to regional stability and on building domestic capacities and to coordinate regional responses in the event of eminent risks to the region. These efforts will be further strengthened into the future.  Islamic finance as a growth area in Asia The rapid integration of Islamic finance into the international financial system is a growing feature in the financial landscape of Asia. Developments in several emerging economies in Asia have seen the rapid expansion of Islamic finance. Global Islamic financial assets are now estimated to be more than 1 trillion US dollars. While more than 60 percent of the world’s Muslim population is in Asia, the interest in Islamic finance transcends to beyond this community. The inherent principle of Islamic finance, which requires financial transactions to be accompanied by underlying economic activity, ensures the close link between the expansion in financial assets with the real economy. It also increases its potential in fostering 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches sustainable growth. This has positioned Islamic finance to be well-anchored to serve the real economy, and enhances its potential as a sustainable and stable form of financial intermediation.  With the intensification of the internationalisation of Islamic finance, it has an increasing role in bridging economies through the mobilisation and channelling of funds to productive investment activities across borders. More than 600 Islamic financial institutions operate in more than 75 countries. The sukuk market is fast becoming an important platform for international fund raising and investment activities that are generating increased cross-border flows. From an outstanding amount of 33 billion US dollars in 2006, the sukuk market has expanded to 180 billion US dollars by the end of 2011, of which 66 percent originated from Asia. There has also been a growing trend for multi-currency sukuk issuances in Asia, attracting global investors to participate in this market.  In reinforcing the internationalisation of Islamic finance, global initiatives have been taken to strengthen its institutional and international infrastructure, with emphasis in ensuring financial stability. International prudential standards and best practices have been issued by the Islamic Financial Services Board, which was established in 2002. The industry is also guided by international accounting standards that have been issued by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions, which was established in 1990. The International Islamic Liquidity Management Corporation (IILM), established in 2010, is a further global collaborative effort to enhance liquidity management in the Islamic financial system.  Conclusion To fully realise the Asian potential, continuing the transformative momentum of the region will not be complete without ensuring that the benefits of development are widely shared. Experience has shown, even in the advanced economies, that when inequality is high and a significant proportion of the population is excluded from the opportunity to participate meaningfully in income and wealth generation, instability follows. To ensure that rapid economic growth and transformation does not further widen the social divide and disenfranchise those who remain excluded from its benefits, access to high-quality, healthcare, social security and financial inclusion is now an important focus of the region.  The contour of the global economy is fundamentally changing amidst mounting challenges and continued uncertainties. In this environment, Asia has become an important source of stability. While the region is affected by the ongoing economic and financial crisis originating from Europe and the United States, the Asian region continues to remain on a growth trajectory, although at a more modest level. Greater regional cohesiveness and cooperation, however, has enhanced Asia’s potential to address these new challenges that are confronting the region. The success of the region is not only in the interest of the Asian economies, but the world. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Peter Pang: Launch of the new cross-border collateral management service Remarks by Mr Peter Pang, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary, at the cross-border collateral management service signing ceremony and press conference, Hong Kong, 20 June 2012. *      *      * Mr. Grimonpont, Mr. Bhatia, ladies and gentlemen, Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to welcome you to this signing ceremony. The bilateral agreements that I shall sign on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority with the Euroclear Bank and J.P.Morgan today will pave the way for the launch of the new cross-border collateral management service, a critical building block of the cross-border bond investment and settlement platform launched in March 2012. The new service, which will commence on 25 June, will bring significant benefits to the contracting partners and the money market as a whole. For Hong Kong, it will advance the development of our repo market, enhance the stability of our financial system and strengthen further Hong Kong’s role as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. The repo market is a key component of major international financial centres. It serves as the link between the money and capital markets, and is vital to the well functioning of the financing channels. By providing credit enhancement through the use of securities as collateral, the repo market also serves as the lubricant that keeps the financial engine running particularly during times of risk aversion. The new collateral management service, with its cross-border, cross-system, cross-time zone and cross-currency capabilities, will provide an efficient repo infrastructure that will help develop the repo market in Hong Kong. The importance of the repo market as a financing channel has assumed added prominence since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008. Due to a combination of the large inflows of funds into Hong Kong in late 2008 and early 2009 and heightened risk aversion, the interbank money market has been less active in recent years and financial institutions have been more careful in lending funds to each other on an uncollateralized basis. The average daily turnover of the uncollateralized interbank market has dropped significantly, by 71% from HK$286 billion in November 2007 to HK$83 billion in March 2012. The higher frequency of flight to quality, and resultant tightness in the global supply of US dollar, has also affected turnover in the currency swap market. The average daily turnover of the Hong Kong dollar swap market also reduced notably by 32% from HK$263 billion to HK$179 billion in the same period. While the Hong Kong banking sector is now faced with ample liquidity, the situation will not be permanent and we will need to find new ways to facilitate efficient interbank borrowing. Development of the repo market will help to activate the money market by addressing the credit risk through the collateralized arrangement. The cross-border funding issue is particularly important to Hong Kong given its role as an international banking centre. 139 of the 199 authorized institutions in Hong Kong are either branches or subsidiaries of banking groups incorporated outside of the territory. An important function of the new service is to enable financial institutions to make use of securities held in one of the partner systems as collateral to conduct secured borrowing in the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi in Hong Kong. As an example, a bank in Europe can make use of its securities held with Euroclear Bank or J.P. Morgan to borrow Hong Kong dollar to meet the liquidity needs of its Hong Kong subsidiary. The enhanced capability of authorized institutions to manage the liquidity needs in the local currency, no doubt, will help to maintain financial stability in Hong Kong.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches The facility will also substantially strengthen Hong Kong’s role as the global hub for offshore renminbi business. Being the first mover in developing offshore renminbi business, Hong Kong has the largest offshore renminbi liquidity pool, amounting to RMB 674 billion at the end of April 2012, and has developed a vibrant CNH market and the largest offshore RMB bond market. More foreign banks are either choosing to have a base in Hong Kong or are using RMB correspondent banking services provided by banks in Hong Kong. As at the end of May 2012, there were 196 banks participating in Hong Kong’s renminbi clearing platform. Of these, 170 are foreign-owned or located overseas. At the same time, over 1,100 renminbi correspondent accounts were maintained by overseas banks with banks in Hong Kong. The amount due to and due from such overseas banks amounted to RMB 128 billion and RMB 146 billion respectively. This is a clear indication that banks from around the world are using Hong Kong’s robust platform and large liquidity pool to offer renminbi services to their customers at home.  As more and more companies and financial institutions conduct business and transactions in the renminbi, we will see an increasing number of financial centres offering offshore renminbi business in different parts of the world. These centres can benefit significantly from having an access to the offshore renminbi platform and liquidity pool in Hong Kong. The HKMA is taking proactive steps to aid the private sector in this endeavour. The private sector led Hong Kong – London Forum is an excellent example of this effort. The Forum just held its first meeting in Hong Kong in May this year, and agreed on a number of joint actions in the areas of renminbi liquidity, payment and settlement arrangements and development of products and services, to bring mutual benefits to the growth of offshore renminbi business in Hong Kong and London. One of the key action points agreed at the Forum is to expand cross-market renminbi funding activities through the cross-border collateral management arrangement that will be launched jointly by the HKMA, Euroclear and J.P. Morgan on 25 June. The HKMA is delighted to work with Euroclear Bank and J.P.Morgan, the two premier global tripartite repo system operators, to bring this concept to fruition. With security pools valued at EUR 10.8 trillion and US$ 17.9 trillion respectively, both institutions provide a huge reservoir and a highly sophisticated platform to support cross-border cross currency lending with ample choices of securities as collateral. Linked up by the HKMA’s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) as an agent, CMU members will be able to enjoy the collateral management service of the global repo operators which include functions like auto-selection and auto-substitution of collateral, collateral eligibility filters, daily mark-to-market and prudent haircut execution, all of which will help financial institutions in their collateral management processes. As a further development, we are working with our two partners to expand the repo service to allow financial institutions in Hong Kong to use their securities kept with the CMU, Euroclear and J.P. Morgan as collateral to obtain foreign currency liquidity such as US dollars from the global broker dealers in the second half of 2012. This will help local companies and financial institutions to obtain foreign currency liquidity as they expand their business overseas. Finally, the HKMA has a long term vision for repo financing to become a more important source of funding for companies and banks in Hong Kong. It is in Hong Kong’s and Asia’s long-term interest to promote further development of the repo market, underpinned by a closer integration with overseas markets to enable a wider variety of collateral to be mobilized across borders and currencies. In this regard, the HKMA will continue to work closely with the industry to advance the repo market with a dual aim to provide a safe and more resilient source of funding, as well as to foster financial stability of the region.  Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mark Carney: Financing the global transition Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 21 June 2012. *      *      * Introduction I want to thank the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies (AIMS) for the invitation to speak here in Halifax. One of Halifax’s greatest entrepreneurs was Samuel Cunard, whose shipping empire, like this centre, still bears his name. Launched more than 100 years ago, the Cunard business prospered in the last great era of global change. In my remarks today, I will speak about the transformation currently under way in the global economy. In touching on the situation in Europe, and the challenges of the international monetary system, I will concentrate on the central role of an open, resilient financial system to sustained global growth. The transition to a multi-polar world I would like to start by putting the recent darkening of the global economic outlook in perspective. Europe has built a single market of 500 million people and 27 countries, with free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In the process, it has transformed the economies of southern and eastern Europe. It has also played a consistently positive role in rising above national interests to address global problems. On a global scale, never in history has economic integration involved so many people, such a variety of goods and so much capital. This process lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and created the potential for hundreds of millions more to follow in their path. The gap between rich and poor countries has narrowed dramatically and soon the global middle class will outnumber the poor. The shrinking disparity between the United States and China is particularly striking. In 1990, GDP per capita in the United States was almost 30 times higher than in China; by 2010, this ratio had fallen to just six times. The crisis is accelerating this transformation. But this transition will not be smooth, and it is not preordained. Downside risks to Europe are materialising, threatening the pace of global growth. More broadly, the rebalancing of the global economy is stalled, as much of the advanced world remains mired in a prolonged deleveraging. During this challenging time, we must remember that realising Europe’s and globalisation’s potential requires an open system. It is reasonable to expect capital to flow, on a net basis, from advanced economies towards higher expected returns in emerging-market economies. This is what happened during the last wave of globalisation at the turn of the 20th century when Canada, then an emerging economy, ran current account deficits averaging 7 per cent of GDP over three decades. These were good imbalances. Imported capital was invested in productive capacity that later served to pay off the accumulated debts. Global imbalances over the past decade have too often been bad, if not positively un-Canadian. In some cases, public capital has flowed from emerging-market economies to 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  advanced economies to be invested in non-tradable goods such as housing. In others, private flows overshot in a complacent, deregulated “new era”. Large current account imbalances are an inherent part of strong global growth, but in order to be sustainable, they must be: • the product of private decisions taken in a context of sound macroeconomic policies and robust market structures; and • financed by an open, resilient financial system. In many respects, the problems we face today are the product of two flawed monetary unions: one formal – the European monetary union; the other informal – Bretton Woods II. In both cases, financial reforms will be integral to the solution. European Monetary Union Europe’s problems today are partly a product of the initial success of the single currency. After the euro’s launch, the European financial system quickly became integrated, and cross-border lending exploded. Easy money fed booms, which flattered government fiscal positions and supported bank balance sheets. In aggregate, the euro area’s debt metrics may not look daunting: the total euro-area public debt burden is lower than that of the United States or Japan, and its current account with the rest of the world is roughly balanced, as it has been for some time. But as is now blindingly obvious, these aggregates mask large internal imbalances. For example, since 2007, public debt in Spain increased by 30 percentage points of GDP, in Portugal by 40 percentage points, in Greece by 50 percentage points and in Ireland by 80 percentage points...and counting. Much of these increases are the consequence of private losses in real estate and banking sectors. Indeed, the euro crisis reminds us that, one way or another, excessive private debts usually end up in the public sector. Further, price stability across the euro area has been composed of large differences in national inflation rates. In the eight-year run-up to the crisis, inflation in the crisis economies was about twice that of the core countries. Most importantly, unit labour costs in peripheral countries shot up relative to those in the core economies, particularly Germany. The resulting deterioration in competitiveness has made the continuation of past trends unsustainable. Europe is now stagnating. Its GDP is still more than 2 per cent below its pre-crisis peak, and private domestic demand sits a stunning 6 per cent below. The contraction is driving banking losses and fiscal shortfalls. These are understandably receiving much attention, but it should be remembered that these challenges are symptoms of an underlying sickness: a balance-of-payments crisis. What should the Europeans do? To repay the creditors in the core euro area countries, the debtors of the periphery must regain competitiveness. This will be neither easy nor quick. A sustained process of relative wage adjustment will be necessary, implying large declines in living standards in one-third of the euro area. A comprehensive adjustment is necessary. The burden cannot only be on increasing unemployment and falling wages in countries like Spain. Deflation in the peripheral countries will not likely prove any more tolerable than it did in the United Kingdom under the gold standard of the 1920s. An increase in German wages and private demand (and inflation) 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  would ease the transition. It is striking that German real wages barely grew in the two decades before the crisis. Moreover, it is essential that the structural reforms now under way across the deficit countries boost productivity. With domestic incomes squeezed, some of the required investment will have to be financed abroad. Unfortunately, the European financial system has aggressively renationalised in recent months. Intra-European cross-border lending – which had been growing by 25 per cent per year in the run-up to the crisis – has been falling at a rate of 10 per cent per annum since. While the European Central Bank (ECB) has adroitly stepped into the breach, reliance on central bank lending is not a recipe for robust private investment. Bold steps are required to restore the single financial market. And bold steps are now under consideration. One example is the current European proposal to create a banking union. By centralising bank restructuring, re-capitalising banks with European rather than national resources, moving towards centralised (or federalised) supervisory oversight and harmonising (or better still mutualising) deposit insurance, Europe can break the increasingly toxic links between banks and sovereigns. The recent agreement to recapitalise the Spanish banking system marks progress towards a greater financial and fiscal union that will reinforce the monetary union. It is further evidence of Europe’s resolve to address its problems. If such measures are combined with swift implementation of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) financial reform agenda, which I will outline in a moment, there is a prospect of relaunching a deeper, more robust pan-European financial system. Bretton Woods II The second flawed monetary union is at the heart of the current international monetary system: the so-called Bretton Woods II arrangement, which is centred on China and the United States. The current international monetary system is a hybrid of, on the one hand, mainly major advanced economies with floating exchange rates and liberalised capital flows and, on the other, a group of countries that actively manage their exchange rates. The result is a system that does not facilitate timely and symmetric adjustment to shocks or structural change. For example, despite its economic miracle, China’s real exchange rate did not appreciate in the two decades before the global financial crisis. In the decade before the crisis erupted, China’s relentless accumulation of reserves contributed to low real interest rates and, for a time, subdued macroeconomic volatility. Market participants increasingly assumed this stable macroeconomic environment would persist – prompting a search for yield, rising leverage and a dramatic underpricing of risks. When combined with inadequate supervision of the financial system and ill-conceived deregulation of housing and financial markets, U.S. private non-financial debt quickly rose to levels last seen during the Great Depression. With 20 per cent of global output, the United States imported 60 per cent of global capital (on a net basis) on the eve of the crisis. This would not have been a problem if this capital had been invested in expanding productive capacity. Unfortunately, not enough of it was. Now, the debt cycle has decisively turned. Creditors demand repayment, and global growth will require global rebalancing. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  How to pay down debt Austerity is a necessary condition for rebalancing, but it is seldom sufficient. There are really only three options to reduce debt: restructuring, inflation and growth. Whether we like it or not, debt restructuring may happen. If it is to be done, it is best done quickly, and on a sufficient scale to restore sustainability. Policy-makers need to be careful about delaying the inevitable and merely funding the private exit. Some have suggested that higher inflation may be a way out from the burden of excessive debt. To be effective, this would need to be coupled with various forms of financial repression, including capital controls and forced holdings of government debt. This is a counsel of despair. An inflation surprise needs to be very large or very sudden to work. Moving opportunistically to a higher inflation target would risk unmooring inflation expectations, destroying the hard-won gains that have come from the entrenchment of price stability, and increasing real rates that would exacerbate unfavourable debt dynamics. Financial repression would have to be both massive and sustained. It would undermine the system that has helped bring us the prosperity of the past three decades. The most palatable strategy to reduce debt is to increase growth. Private growth will not flourish in an environment of macro instability. Fiscal sustainability and price stability are essentials, not luxuries. Private growth needs an enabling environment, including tax competitiveness and a framework for infrastructure investment. It needs a sound financial sector that is diverse, resilient and open. Sustainable private growth and the role of financial reform This is not yet assured. Most immediately, there is a risk that a series of contingency measures could extend to a global scale the current European trend towards renationalisation. That is one reason why the European initiatives expected in the coming weeks are so important. More broadly, the financial reform agenda must address legitimate emerging-market concerns over the resiliency of the advanced-economy financial systems. Because of these worries, there is pressure for localisation to protect domestic systems and renewed use of capital controls to dampen the volatility of cross-border flows. If allowed to persist, these nascent trends could seriously restrain the global capital flows necessary for the next stage of the global transformation. The imbalance between states and markets I recall the German Finance Minister, Peer Steinbrück, at a fateful G-7 meeting in the wake of Lehman’s failure, relating that he had met a woman in East Germany earlier that week who told him that: “I have seen the fall of communism and now I am seeing the fall of capitalism.” The complete loss of confidence in private finance at that time could only be arrested by the provision of comprehensive backstops by the richest economies in the world. Even with these heroic efforts, the global financial crisis has cost $4 trillion in lost output and 28 million lost jobs, and built perilous fiscal deficits. As is typically the case, much of the cost has been borne by countries, businesses and individuals who did not directly contribute to the fiasco. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  To restore confidence in the system, we must create a truly global system, in part by rebalancing the relationship between governments and markets. Governments must discard the myth that finance is self-regulating and self-stabilising, and financial policy-making can no longer be concentrated at national levels. Given the reality of global finance, it is not enough to have our own house in order unless we seal ourselves off from the world – and if we were to do that we will end up much poorer. An open, resilient global financial system will be central to the transformation of the global economy. In order to achieve that, financial sector reform is a must. The G-20 has a serious agenda, being aggressively implemented. The current intensification of the euro crisis has only sharpened our resolve. Building resilient financial institutions Achieving a stronger banking system is the overriding priority, hence the importance assigned to full implementation of Basel capital and liquidity standards. A simple, but effective, leverage standard has been imported from Canada. It will protect the system from risks we think are low but in fact are not. These measures have lowered the probability of failure. However, our goal is not a fully risk-proofed system. That is neither attainable nor desirable. Ending too-big-to-fail Since failures will still happen, there remains the need to reduce their impact, which is one of the reasons to focus on ending too-big-to-fail. More fundamentally, we must address, once and for all, the unfairness of a system that privatises gains and socialises losses. By restoring capitalism to the capitalists, discipline in the system will increase and, with time, systemic risks will be reduced. Most importantly, the knowledge that major firms in markets far away can fail, without meaningful consequences at home, will restore confidence in an open global system. To achieve this objective, bondholders, shareholders and management – rather than taxpayers – must bear the brunt of losses. To this end, all FSB member countries have committed to have in place a bail-in authority. In addition, each global systemically important bank must have in place a Resolution and Recovery Plan within the next six months, to be supplemented by cross-border co-operation agreements. The framework for systemic institutions is now being extended to domestic banks, global insurers, and key shadow banks. When implemented, greater supervisory intensity and higher loss absorbency will ensure that the system is never again beholden to the fate of a single firm or group of firms. Creating continuously open markets An important element of ending too-big-to-fail is ensuring that key markets can withstand the failure of systemic firms. It is unacceptable that core markets seized up during crisis, and that relatively small firms had to be saved because of concerns that they would take markets with them if they failed. Creating continuously open core markets requires changes to the plumbing of derivative and repo markets, along with better data and tracking of exposures. Moving from shadow banking to market-based finance The FSB is working to strengthen the oversight and regulation of shadow banking so that it is a source of competition (to promote efficiency) and diversity (to promote resilience) to the regulated sector. This will require changes to how money-market funds are managed, the 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  terms of securitisation and, most importantly, how links between the regulated banking sector and shadow banks are managed. Timely, consistent implementation Finally, the FSB is increasingly focused on timely, full and consistent implementation of agreed reforms. This is essential to preserve the advantages of an open and globally integrated financial system. Recent experience demonstrates that when mutual confidence is lost, the retreat from an open and integrated system can occur rapidly. A return to a nationally segmented global financial system would reduce both systemic resilience and financial capacity for investment and growth. Conclusion Let me conclude with some comments on the current economic environment. The recoveries in advanced economies continue to be dampened by the ongoing need to repair sovereign, bank and household balance sheets. While the U.S. economy is expanding at a modest pace, some of the risks around the European crisis are materialising and risks remain skewed to the downside. The emerging world continues to be the engine of global growth, although weak demand in advanced economies and the effects of past policy tightening are slowing the pace of expansion in China and other major emerging-market economies. As a result of more modest global economic momentum and heightened financial risk aversion, commodity prices have fallen in recent months, although they remain at historically elevated levels. Despite these ongoing global headwinds, the Canadian economy continues to grow with an underlying momentum consistent with the gradual absorption of the remaining small degree of economic slack. Total CPI inflation is expected to fall below 2 per cent in the short term, as a result of lower gasoline prices, while core inflation is expected to remain around 2 per cent. Canada’s relatively favourable economic performance continues to rely significantly on the resilience of Canadian household spending, supported by very accommodative monetary policy and a well-functioning financial system. Our economy cannot, however, depend indefinitely on debt-fuelled household expenditures, particularly in an environment of modest income growth. Notably, housing investment rose further in the first quarter, accounting for an unusually elevated share of the overall Canadian economy. In this context, Canadian authorities are co-operating closely to monitor the financial situation of the household sector, and are responding appropriately. Today, federal authorities have taken additional prudent and timely measures to support the long-term stability of the Canadian housing market, and mitigate the risk of financial excesses. Against this backdrop, to the extent that the economic expansion continues and the current excess supply in the economy is gradually absorbed, some modest withdrawal of the present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. The timing and degree of any such withdrawal will be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments. As I have argued today, these global developments will depend importantly on sustaining an open, global system. At the G-20 meeting this week in Los Cabos, Mexico, leaders reaffirmed that “multilateralism is of even greater importance in the current climate, and remains our best asset to resolve the global economy’s difficulties”, and committed to “timely, full and consistent implementation of agreed policies to support a stable and integrated global financial system”. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  This resolve bodes well for securing the global transformation and, with it, realising the full potential of Canadian prosperity.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Thomas Jordan: The Swiss economy and global economic outlook Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 14 June 2012. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank (SNB) will maintain the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro and will enforce it with the utmost determination. It remains prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities for this purpose. Even at the current rate, the Swiss franc is still high. Another appreciation would have a serious impact on both prices and the economy in Switzerland. The SNB will not tolerate this. If necessary, it stands ready to take further measures at any time. The target range for the three-month Libor remains at 0.00–0.25%. Essentially, the SNB’s conditional inflation forecast is unchanged from its March forecast. It is based on a three-month Libor of 0.0% and continues to assume that the Swiss franc will weaken over the forecast horizon. For 2012, the forecast shows an inflation rate of –0.5%. For 2013, the SNB is expecting inflation of 0.3% and for 2014, of 0.6%. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, there is no risk of inflation in Switzerland.  The SNB expects that the global economy will only recover slowly. While the emerging economies make a major contribution to global growth, momentum in the advanced economies will remain subdued. In Europe, in particular, economic activity will be extremely weak on account of the financial and debt crisis. Switzerland will experience a significant economic slowdown over the rest of the year. Only because of the unexpectedly strong winter half-year does the SNB now expect growth of around 1.5% for 2012.  The risks for the Swiss economic situation remain exceptionally high. The uncertainty about future developments in the euro area has again risen. If global activity proves disappointing or the turmoil on the financial markets increases, downside risks will again emerge for the economy and price stability in Switzerland. The imbalances in the Swiss residential mortgage and real estate markets increased further last quarter. Consequently, the SNB welcomes the Federal Council decision to make available a countercyclical capital buffer which can counter adverse developments on the domestic credit market.  Global economic outlook Let us examine the economic outlook and the inflation prospects in a little more detail. In the first quarter of 2012, the global economy continued to grow at a moderate pace although this varied considerably from one region to another. The emerging economies were still making a major contribution to global growth. By contrast, overall momentum in the advanced economies was subdued, although here, too, differences from one country to another were considerable. Japan experienced strong growth in the first quarter due to a catch-up effect. In the US, momentum was moderate. In the euro area, a number of countries are in deep recession, while in Germany, GDP continued to expand strongly. Overall, the economy in the euro area stagnated. As in the last monetary policy assessment, we assume that the global economy will continue to recover slowly. This will be driven by globally expansionary monetary policy and strong domestic demand in the emerging economies. In the euro area and the US, developments are likely to be more subdued. Here we assume that the European financial and sovereign debt crisis will gradually ease. However, risks in this respect remain high. In particular, the difficult situation in Greece and Spain has already led to a significant deterioration in the 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches confidence of households and companies in the euro area. As a result, the economic situation remains vulnerable.  These high risks are also affecting the financial markets. Following a temporary recovery at the beginning of the year, the situation on the financial markets at present is again tense. A substantial correction has taken place on the share markets. By contrast, investments perceived to be safe, such as US, German or UK government bonds, recorded all-time low yields and correspondingly high price gains. Real yields on these investments are in negative territory for most maturities, measured in terms of inflation expectations. In addition, interest rates on money markets are at record-low levels worldwide. Swiss economic outlook In Switzerland, real GDP rose faster than expected in the first quarter. The stabilising effect of the minimum exchange rate against the euro played a major role in this development, with goods exports declining only slightly in the first quarter, in an international environment that remained weak, while exports of services rose. An improvement in consumer confidence encouraged a substantial increase in private consumer spending. However, GDP growth was also supported by temporary effects. Value added in the banking industry benefited from the optimistic mood on the financial markets during the first months of the year. In manufacturing and the hospitality industry, however, activity declined, underscoring the particularly negative impact of the strong Swiss franc on these industries. For the second quarter, we expect a significant slowdown in GDP growth. Since the global economy is expected to recover slowly, and the value of the Swiss franc is still high, the demand for exports is likely to remain subdued, even in the subsequent period. The high level of uncertainty and the pressure on profit margins are impacting negatively on corporate investment. Only because of the unexpectedly strong winter half-year does the SNB now expect growth of around 1.5% for 2012.  Swiss inflation outlook  The inflation outlook for Switzerland has remained largely unchanged from the monetary policy assessment in March. Since the fourth quarter of 2011, the annual inflation rate has been in negative territory. This is mainly attributable to a base effect, because last quarter the price level remained almost unchanged from the previous quarter. Thus the minimum exchange rate has put a halt to the deflationary situation that had arisen as a result of the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc last summer. Surveys on inflation expectations confirm that deflation is not expected at present. As the surveys also show, there continues to be no danger of inflation. This corresponds to our conditional inflation forecast which reaches 0.8% at the end of the three-year forecast horizon. Overall, the path of inflation is again more subdued than in the March forecast, due to the fact that the Swiss franc is weakening less rapidly than was forecast at that time.  Monetary and financial conditions  Let us now turn to monetary and financial conditions. These are virtually unchanged from the first quarter of 2012. After the March monetary policy assessment, the euro remained more or less stable against the major currencies. Since the beginning of May, it has weakened by around 5% against the US dollar. As a result, the Swiss franc has depreciated slightly in export-weighted terms, even if the exchange rate has remained unchanged with regard to the euro. Interest rates in the Swiss franc money market continue to fluctuate around zero. In the past quarter, the Libor persisted at a very low level, at around 10 basis points. For the foreseeable 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 future, interest rate expectations remain exceptionally low, and levels of interest rates on futures – derived from Libor futures contracts – are in fact, in some cases, substantially below zero.  Yields on bonds with high credit ratings are also very low in Switzerland. At the beginning of June, ten-year Confederation bonds attained a new all-time low, at around 0.5%. Thirty-year bonds were trading in the market at yields of under 1%. For short to medium-term maturities, yields were in negative territory, in some cases very negative.  The low interest rates continue to be reflected in robust growth in lending and rising real estate prices. As a result, the imbalances on the Swiss residential mortgage and real estate markets have increased further. Following my presentation, my colleague Jean-Pierre Danthine will take a closer look at the risks for financial stability in connection with the mortgage and real estate markets. SNB monetary policy Let us now return to the SNB’s monetary policy. The debt problems in some euro area countries have deteriorated seriously over the recent period. Accordingly, the euro has lost value against most countries since May. This has led to increased upward pressure on the EUR/CHF exchange rate. Even in this difficult environment, we have consistently enforced the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro.  To defend the minimum exchange rate, we purchased foreign currency. This has led to a further expansion in Swiss franc liquidity and the SNB balance sheet. Even when the minimum exchange rate was first introduced, we drew attention to the fact that its enforcement could have significant consequences for our balance sheet. Another appreciation of the Swiss franc would constitute a very substantial threat to the Swiss economy and the risk of deflationary developments coming about. This is why it is necessary to accept an expansion of the balance sheet arising out of the enforcement of the minimum exchange rate. The SNB is in a position to bear the ensuing risks. Even at a level of CHF 1.20 per euro, the Swiss franc is still high, presenting large parts of our economy with a difficult situation. Consequently, we will continue to enforce the minimum exchange rate with the utmost determination and will buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities for this purpose. If necessary, we stand ready to take further measures at any time. Management of foreign currency investments  I will conclude today with a few comments about the management of our foreign currency investments. In the recent period, this topic has returned to the spotlight of public discussion. In particular, the possibility of establishing a sovereign wealth fund with the SNB’s foreign currency holdings has given rise to discussion. In this respect, it is important, first of all, to point out that the SNB does not hold its foreign currency in the form of banknotes or bank deposits. The funds are invested in different investment categories and currencies. For a considerable period, the SNB has held not just the traditional instruments – government bonds of countries with high credit ratings – but also bonds issued by private sector borrowers and shares. Holdings of shares currently make up some 10% of foreign currency investments. In order to diversify its investments further, in 2010, the SNB included additional currencies such as the Australian and Singapore dollars as well as the Swedish krona and Danish krone in its investment universe. Since the first quarter of 2012, the SNB has also been investing in the Korean won. Additional investment opportunities in the advanced and emerging economies are continually being evaluated, both for bonds and for shares, although this is subject to an adequate level of liquidity in the markets in question.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches The idea of a sovereign wealth fund may appear attractive at first glance. However, in the current situation, it does little to assist Switzerland or Swiss monetary policy. The sovereign wealth funds in Norway and the oil states cannot serve as models for the management of the SNB’s currency reserves. All of them invest state income surplus derived from commodity exports. A Swiss sovereign wealth fund funded from SNB foreign exchange, by contrast, would be financed through money creation.  From our point of view, the three following points, in particular, speak against a sovereign wealth fund. First, the creation of such a fund would not help to enforce the minimum exchange rate. The only decisive factor is the SNB’s willingness to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities against Swiss francs. Second, all investments abroad are subject to an exchange rate risk, whether they be government bonds, shares, real estate, commodities or investments in infrastructure, and irrespective of whether they appear on the SNB balance sheet or on that of a separate sovereign wealth fund. Consequently, outsourcing the foreign currency investments would not reduce Switzerland’s exchange rate risk. Third, outsourcing the foreign exchange to a sovereign wealth fund would call into question the independence of monetary policy and the SNB, as well as the freedom of action for monetary policy. The size and composition of the SNB’s balance sheet are a reflection of monetary policy. The SNB must also be in a position to dispose of the assets it has purchased and determine the composition of its balance sheet as required. Only in this way can it conduct an independent and target-oriented monetary policy.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Vítor Constâncio: Financial stability – measurement and policy Speech by Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the high level conference on “Financial stability – methodological advances and policy issues”, Frankfurt am Main, 14 June 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  After a productive day, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to this dinner. Before we get started, let me offer a few thoughts regarding macro-prudential research, the current stage of financial stability analysis at the ECB and policy conduct in Europe.  The sources and the propagation of the financial crisis highlighted the need for putting in place robust policy infrastructures to safeguard financial stability and for macro-prudential policies to address systemic risk. In this light, new institutions have been put in place, such as the European System of Financial Supervision and the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the United States, and regulatory reforms are taking shape, notably Basel III and a host of other initiatives under the leadership of the Financial Stability Board.  This progress notwithstanding, it needs to be kept in mind that in the macro-prudential field we are in a much less comfortable position than in the monetary policy field, in particular concerning widely accepted scientific foundations and long experience with tested policy instruments. Against this background, I will start by providing a brief overview of the recent macro-prudential research. I will then focus on some of the main analytical tools for financial stability analysis at the European Central Bank (ECB). I will conclude by referring to a key aspect of our future regulatory framework in Europe, namely the set of macro-prudential policy instruments embedded in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV, and how these instruments should be made compatible with the requirements for both safeguarding financial stability and further developing the Single Market for financial services. 1. Progress in macro-prudential and financial stability-oriented research  The theoretic foundations in the macro-prudential field are still at a largely rudimentary state compared to other research areas. This notwithstanding, significant advances in macro-prudential research have been made in recent years; in particular fuelled by the lessons learnt during the financial crisis which underscored the need to take a more systemic view to monitoring and assessing risks and vulnerabilities within the financial system and beyond. The papers presented at today and tomorrow’s conference provide some useful snapshots of the recent academic advances in the field of macro-prudential, and more broadly, financial stability analysis. One promising area of research deals with early warning models and systemic risk indicators, which was the theme of Sessions I and II this morning.  In recent years the value of early warning indicators has increased thanks to improved methodologies and the use of less exploited data sources. It should also be added that from a policy perspective the focus has been shifted somewhat from predicting crises to predicting growing imbalances and highlighting underlying vulnerabilities. As I believe was also 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches illustrated by Atish Ghosh this morning, this change of focus has most likely contributed to the greater effectiveness of new early warning tools.1 Recent research shows how the predictive information can be improved by using individual balance sheet data of financial firms combined with traditional macro-financial variables. As for example illustrated by Claudio Borio and co-authors and by Alessi and Detken, the merit of private credit and liquidity gaps and the role of global variables in early warnings has been confirmed, while the performance of bank solvency and liquidity ratios in this regard is still under debate.2 For what concerns systemic risk indicators, valuable information for policy-makers comes from the measurement of the current level of systemic financial stress. A popular means of assessing the systemic importance of a financial institution is to look at the sensitivity of its value at risk (VaR) – i.e. its tail dependence – to shocks to the whole financial system. This has been proposed by the CoVaR approach of Adrian and Brunnermeier or by similar models of cross-sectional measures, like the Co-Risk used by the IMF and based in CDS premia3 or the Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES) predicted by the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) of an institution and its leverage developed by Acharya and co-authors and by Brownless and Engle.4 CoVar calculations are being used by the FSOC in the US. We at the ECB use different types of indicators to try to gage systemic risk as I will explain in a moment.  A key element of this kind of systemic risk indicators is to account for the network relations and clusters of systemic risk spillovers, as for instance demonstrated by Nikolaus Hautsch and Kay Giesecke in their presentations this morning.5 Importantly, allowing for interconnectedness may also help improving the predictive power of early warning models. This is clearly illustrated by the ECB presentation this morning by Peltonen et al6 which shows the usefulness of adding contagion to a regular Early Warning Systems improves the performance of the model proving that it would have been successful in predicting bank distress when the financial crisis was approaching. A second important research area deals precisely with the assessment of contagion risks, which was addressed in Session III. Contagion within the financial system can occur in several ways, as illustrated by Franklin Allen this afternoon.7 Most commonly, shock propagation within the financial system is thought to occur via interbank networks or via                                                  1  See IMF (2010) “The IMF-FSB Early Warning Exercise: Design and Methodologies Toolkit”, September. 2  See e.g. Borio, C. and P.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 common asset exposures. Depending on the structure of the network, even small shocks to central hubs in the network can result in serious propagation throughout the system.  In most cases, during normal times, financial network structures are typically fairly robust to shocks and thus allow for a better diversification of risk. However, this notwithstanding, shocks to particular elements of the network can trigger major contagion within the system. This is a key feature of the so-called “robust yet fragile” complex networks; also alluded to by Doyne Farmer this afternoon.8 From a broader financial stability perspective, it is however not sufficient to be able to monitor systemic risks and their potential spillover effects within the financial system were they to occur. Financial stability analysis, and macro-prudential policy actions, is as much about assessing the implications of ruptures in the financial system on the wider economy. From this viewpoint, the development of macro-financial models linking financial instability and the performance of the economy is of the essence.  The global financial crisis has revealed important deficiencies of the standard macroeconomic models in capturing financial instabilities. Realistic characterisations of such instabilities include bank defaults, financial market illiquidity, extreme events, and related non-linearities. Especially, the modelling of bank defaults within a general equilibrium framework is crucial to allow for a proper characterisation of financial instability. However, none of these elements feature in the macroeconomic models regularly used for forecasting and monetary policy analysis and only recently has more emphasis been given to better developing the role of financial sectors in these models.  Another fundamental link which until recently has been missing in macro-financial models is to allow for heterogeneity, and interlinkages, between the agents within the financial sector . Against this background, efforts by economists such as Gertler and Kiyotaki to incorporate interbank markets within Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are much welcome.9 Also worth noting is the model by Goodhart, Kashyap et al which includes the presence of a shadow banking system holding securitised assets issued by the traditional banking system that are subject to default.10  A lot of attention, for example illustrated in the analysis by Adrian-Shin11, has also been devoted recently to the debt and leverage ratios of financial intermediaries and to their variation over the business cycle. In answering to the question of which financial frictions matter, Adrian, Colla and Shin (2012)12 point to the importance of including in a model with financial-real feedbacks the pro-cyclical leverage cycle and the co-existence of loans and bonds that tend to be substitutes in a recession even if spreads on both tend to increase. Geanakoplos has shown that variations in leverage have a huge impact on asset prices potentially contributing to economic bubbles and busts.13 Leverage cycles have only recently started being incorporated in macro-financial models. One prominent example is the model                                                  8  See Caccioli, F., J.D. Farmer, N. Foti and D.

4 BIS central bankers’ speeches by Brunnermeier and Sannikov which includes time-varying margin requirements set by financial intermediaries and thus exacerbates the impact of asset prices over the business cycle as they trigger “margin spirals” that may cause long-lasting adverse feedback loops between the financial sector and the real economy.14 A final research area which I would like to highlight concerns the interactions between macro-prudential policies, including financial regulation, and other policies such as monetary policy as well as the impact these policies might have on the financial system and the real economy. Monetary policy impacts in a fundamental way financial stability: it affects asset prices; influences liquidity conditions and has a bearing on risk taking since low short term interest rates lead directly to expectation of profitable exploitation of a steeper yield curve and consequently tend to increase leverage with more risk.15 As Adrian and Shin (2009) underline what is significant in this “risk-taking channel” (Borio and Zhu (2008)16) is that the short term interest rate has a direct effect on monetary and financial conditions not waiting for the indirect effect on medium term rates. On the other hand, looking to historical experiences with macro-prudential tools, being dynamic provisions in Spain or loan-to-Value ratios in Korea, or to the implications of different models, one conclusion we can draw is that those instruments are not sufficiently strong to tame the financial cycle. One interesting aspect of the model by Goodhart, Kashyap et al (2012) , that I already quoted, is precisely that its simulations show that none of the analysed instruments (dynamic provisions, loan-to-value ratios, capital requirements, liquidity coverage ratios and margin requirements on repos used by shadow banks), would not be enough, even combining some of them, to smooth the financial cycle. The difficulty comes from the fact that the boom brings large increases in asset prices and this provides a misplaced sense of wealth improvements and a temptation to further leveraging. In this context, they nevertheless conclude that dynamic provisioning and liquidity requirements can be the more effective tools but still insufficient as the Spanish experience shows. Banks became more resilient but the bubble was not prevented. All these points indicate that there must be a role for monetary policy to address financial stability considerations even when the priority target of monetary policy is price stability as this goal is affected in the medium term by financial instability. Traditionally monetary policy is only concerned about price stability, particularly in the inflation targeting regime, even if central banking has since the XIX century cared for financial stability in the form of lender-of-last-resort for banks in times of liquidity distress. This asymmetric policy of only “mopping-up” with liquidity in financial market downturns but ignoring the risks of the upside booms creates moral hazard and provides a significant “liquidity subsidy” to the financial sector.  The arguments against doing otherwise have been centred in the difficulty of “identifying bubbles” or in the danger of “pricking bubbles”. Nevertheless the on-going debate is not anymore about “pricking bubbles” but concerns the inclusion of financial conditions in the optimal monetary rules as in the models developed by Christiano, Motto, Rostagno (2009),                                                  14  See Brunnermeier, M. and N.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 Curdia and Woodford (2010) or Gertler and Karadi (2011)).17 The new models are nevertheless not mature enough and do not include all relevant financial frictions. A pure “leaning against the wind” policy is possible but has limitations although, in any case, monetary policy should become less asymmetric and complement the indispensable regulatory and macro-prudential policies.  While these reflections only provided a snapshot of the plethora of research currently being undertaken in the field of financial stability analysis, in my view these are some of the key elements. It also broadly reflects our own efforts here at the ECB to further develop and implement an appropriate financial stability analytical toolkit. This is the topic to which I now turn.  2. The ECB’s tools for financial stability analysis Beyond the academic research, a lot more analytical macro-prudential work is undertaken here at the ECB, as it’s the case at other central banks. Our main aim with this work is to be in a position to carry out systemic risk assessments in real time, directly and regularly supporting policy discussions. For this purpose, we have at our disposal a number of tools and techniques to help us form a comprehensive view of prevailing systemic risks and to help assessing and quantifying the impact of these risks, were they to materialise, on the banking sector and ultimately on the real economy.  More concretely, we structure our financial stability analysis in the usual way with three broad elements. The first entails an identification of important sources of system-wide vulnerabilities based on an analysis of the individual and collective strength of the different parts of the financial system – institutions, markets and infrastructures. The second is an assessment of the potential costs – to the real economy – should some combination of the identified risks and vulnerabilities materialise. A proper indicator of systemic risk should entail both of these properties, the probability of an adverse event occurring and the potential impact of such an event occurring. A last element is methodologies examining network fragilities and contagion. Starting with the identification of potential sources of systemic risk, our analysis focuses on two broad types of indicators: The first set of indicators characterise the current state of financial stress in the financial system, i.e. indicators that works as “thermometers” of the level of tension in the financial system. As crises tend to exhibit many different manifestations, it is obvious that no single metric can gauge the current level of systemic stress. In practice, we cross-check and report on a variety of complementary indicators. Let me mention a few examples.  One class of approaches employed in practice here at the ECB can be classified as “market based indicators” – that is, with a focus on signals from both financial markets and financial institutions. At least four examples of distinct indicators in this category can be mentioned. First, general financial market stress is quite accurately captured by the so-called coincident indicator of systemic stress, or “CISS”, which succinctly synthesises the interaction of stress across key market segments also taking into account explicitly the correlation structure of different segments.18 A second indicator in this class of measures focuses specifically on systemic stress within the banking sector – examining the onset of systemic stress through                                                  17  See Christiano, L, Motto, R., and Rostagno , M (2010) Financial factors in economic fluctuations” ECB WP n. 1192; Cúrdia, V. and M.

6 BIS central bankers’ speeches the lens of joint probabilities of default on the basis of CDS pricing of financial institutions.19 A third group of market based indicators focus squarely on liquidity conditions – either in specific market segments (e.g. the money market) or across financial market segments.20 Lastly, novel methods such as self-organising financial stability maps provide an alternative means of gauging systemic stress through visual means – thereby providing a useful complement to numerical signalling methodologies.21 Another separate class of indicators we regularly report characterising the current state of financial stability can be classified as “structural indicators” – that is, examining potentially excessive leverage and credit developments – as well as disequilibria in specific asset price segments in specific economies or sectors. Examples of indicators in this category are numerous, but clearly encompass models of credit booms as well as various estimates of valuation in real estate markets.22 Both such sets of indicators can provide indications of buildup of imbalances but suffer from one drawback. Assumptions need to be made about what defines excessive developments. These assumptions, accordingly, must be robust as otherwise they risk being challenged by addressees of policy recommendations.  The second set of indicators more explicitly strives to predict vulnerable states of the financial system, i.e. early warning indicators – be in the form of univariate indicators, multivariate models or early warning systems. The key feature of all the categories of early warning indicators is that their signals are evaluated in an early warning framework, thus historically measuring the performance in terms of correctness and timeliness of the signals, potentially taking into account the relative preferences of the policy maker between type 1 and type 2 errors. This is an active field at the ECB – a representative example in this respect would be the work of Alessi and Detken arguing that the global credit gap is the most robust early warning indicator for costly aggregate asset price booms or the work of Lo Duca and Peltonen building on systemic risks stemming from a combination of domestic and global macrofinancial vulnerabilities.23  Of course, the triggers and exact timings of crises are extremely difficult to predict. However, the underlying vulnerabilities, at least based on past experiences, seem often to be detectable – one needs to at least control for “known knowns” or “known unknowns”. Indeed, many crises follow a very similar pattern featuring excessive leverage. Accordingly, the fact that early warning seems possible has practically become part of the layman’s lexicon – not least given widespread even popular appeal of analyses on historical crises (e.g. Reinhart-Rogoff). Despite these strides, much remains to be done until policymakers can be fully confident enough to implement and make use of robust early warning systems. Let me move to the assessment tools. One of the major tools to perform financial stability assessments is stress testing, primarily of the banking sector, but also conducted for the insurance sector – including sensitivity and scenario analyses. Stress testing tools allow for evaluating the impact on banking sector solvency of severe, but plausible macro-financial                                                  19  See, for instance Box 8 in the June 2012 ECB Financial Stability Review, “Systemic Risk Measure – A portfolio probabilistic perspective on measuring default risk”. 20  See regime-switching methodology in Box 4 of the June 2012 Financial Stability Review, “Addressing stress in interbank markets and the role of unconventional monetary policy measures” and general liquidity indicator in Box 9 in ECB, Financial Stability Review, June 2007, “Understanding financial market liquidity”. 21  See P.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 scenarios that reflect key systemic risks. On this basis, we use our (top-down) stress test tools to rank the impact of prevalent macro-financial risks in order to gauge the resilience of the banking sector. The top-down, or macro-prudential, stress-testing framework developed by the ECB has proven particularly valuable during the financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Systemic risks emerged, intensified and evolved rapidly, calling for a flexible and operational tool that could deliver quantified impact assessments in a timely fashion. The tool is comprehensive enough to cover individual banks and it incorporates real-financial interactions as well as network models to assess contagion risk. These features notwithstanding, and despite its increasing prominence in financial stability analysis and communication, stress testing has its limits. Notably, even state-of-the-art stress testing frameworks are characterised by substantial methodological limitations. The major challenges facing stress testers today range from dealing with the inevitable subjectivity related to scenario building, how to model and integrate in a consistent way within the framework elements, such as endogenous bank responses, interbank spillover and macroeconomic feedback effects. Many of the available models also have difficulties capturing well the often non-linear tail risk effects that the scenarios are typically meant to reflect. Finally, stress test results are only as good as the data available, which in particular for central banks and other macro-prudential authorities without supervisory access is a key deficiency. Finally, let me add that even though our top-down stress testing framework is far from perfect and suffer from many deficiencies, it has proved a useful tool to challenge the more granular bottom-up approaches, such as the EBA EU-wide stress tests, and especially to detect outlier responses by individual banks in the latter case. The last broad element of ECB financial stability analysis is the rapidly burgeoning literature on contagion. I reviewed some ECB work in this area in a speech last October.24 In that speech, I mentioned several analytical perspectives we use to examine contagion in all its forms relevant for the ongoing sovereign crisis in the euro area – highlighting models capturing the interaction between sovereigns, as well as that between sovereigns and banks. Such models make use of multiple techniques to uncover contagion – namely, multivariate frequency decompositions, regime-switching approaches and exploiting generalised measures of risk aversion in entity-specific frameworks. Clearly, the issue of contagion is not distinct from that of network analysis. While work in this area is broad, I can point to some recent ECB work featured in our latest Financial Stability Review – in which tools and results are presented regarding applications of network analysis both for actual collateral holdings and simulated interbank networks.25 Ultimately, work in this field remains still relatively nascent and I am sure more highly relevant applications will follow with time.  3. The macro-prudential policy framework and instruments in the EU Single Market Let me now turn to the design of a macro-prudential policy framework and the definition of a policy toolkit that is expected to be available for authorities to address the identified systemic risks in Europe.                                                  24  See “Contagion and the European debt crisis”, Keynote lecture by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB at the Bocconi University/Intesa Sanpaolo conference on “Bank Competitiveness in the Post-crisis World” Milan, 10 October 2011. 25  See Special Feature C of the June 2012 ECB Financial Stability Review, “Evaluating interconnectedness in the financial system on the basis of actual and simulated networks”. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches Since the outbreak of the financial crisis, policy makers have gradually placed more and more emphasis on a macro-prudential approach of financial regulation. The first step in this process was the establishment of the Financial Stability Board as a global coordinating body which was followed by setting up authorities with explicit macro-prudential mandates at the national level as well. An important milestone in this process was the establishment of the ESRB in Europe last year. Besides its role in facilitating discussion on macro-prudential mandates and institutional set-up at the national level, the ESRB plays a key role in developing a toolkit of macro-prudential policy instruments that national authorities can use within the European legal framework. In this context, a major policy challenge Europe is currently facing is the implementation of the Basel III standards in a way that would allow authorities to use policy tools for macro-prudential purposes as well. I would like to highlight in this regard that Basel III already includes some elements of a specific macro-prudential toolkit, such as the counter-cyclical capital buffer, which requires banks to build up capital buffers in periods of excessive credit growth. These buffers can then be released in stress situations, which would help institutions to avoid becoming constrained by regulatory requirements and may thus enhance their ability to maintain lending activity. However, when having a closer look at the Basel III agreement, we have to acknowledge that most elements of the new framework are traditionally considered as micro-prudential in nature. The capital and liquidity rules are designed so as to address risks at the level of individual institutions. Still, depending on how these instruments are calibrated, they could, in principle, be also used to address macro-prudential concerns and mitigate systemic risks. This is a topical issue from a policy perspective in Europe, given that discussions are at their final phase on the implementation of Basel III through the so called “CRD IV”, which includes a proposal for a directive and a regulation. Importantly, the regulation will introduce a new feature in financial regulation, namely that the prudential standards laid down in this legislative proposal will be directly applicable in all EU member states. You may already be aware of the concerns that have recently been raised by some authorities and member states with regard to their ability to use the policy tools falling under the regulation for macro-prudential purposes. Concretely, they claim that, if capital and liquidity rules and other micro-prudential instruments are introduced as elements of a “single rulebook”, this would imply a “maximum harmonisation” of prudential requirements. Consequently, member states may be legally prevented from adopting more stringent rules, even if systemic risks would justify that. I share these concerns. However, I would also like to highlight some issues that I consider as a prerequisite for the conduct of efficient macro-prudential policy in a single market. First, as regards the “single rulebook”, the ECB has expressed on many occasions its support towards this approach. We have underlined that the “single rulebook” contributes to a consistent implementation of prudential measures in the Single Market, improves transparency and ensures a level playing field for financial institutions. By avoiding regulatory arbitrage and distortions to competition, the “single rulebook” is also beneficial from the perspective of financial integration in Europe. At the same time, however, let me also underline significant risks to financial stability can emerge when systemic risks identified at the national level may impact other jurisdictions through spillover effects and common exposures of financial institutions. It is therefore of paramount importance that national authorities have the possibility to impose, in a well identified subset of instruments, more stringent rules than those defined by the regulation.  Given that member states may well be at different stages of the economic and financial cycle within Europe, and there are also significant differences in the structural features of the financial sector across EU countries, authorities should have the control over an appropriate set of tools to address both the cross-sectional and the time dimension of systemic risks as well. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 In my view, the appropriate macro-prudential regime in a single market should have three main features: First, adjustments in the prudential rules for the identified subset of instruments should only be possible in the direction of strengthening the harmonised minima. These instruments could include capital and liquidity ratios, leverage and limits to large exposures (Loan-to-Value or Debt-to Income ratios are not limited by the CRD IV).  Second, only calibrations should be subject to upward adjustment, while definitions should remain intact so as to ensure that ratios are comparable across institutions and countries, thus respecting the principle of a single EU rulebook.  Third, this macro-prudential regime should be subject to strict safeguards, under the ex-ante coordination of the ESRB in order to avoid, or at least to minimise, possible unintended consequences and spillover effects. These safeguards should include the identification and assessment of the macro-prudential concerns in the respective countries both by national authorities and the ESRB, in particular when spillover effects are expected. Furthermore, the implementation of macro-prudential measures should be subject to close monitoring and regular evaluation by the ESRB as well as to disclosure requirements.  I’m of the view that if these principles are respected, we can set up a framework that would enable us to mitigate the build-up of excessive risks in the financial system and to contribute to the smooth functioning of the financial system and the Single Market in Europe. Against this backdrop, let me finally say a few words about the recent developments in this field in Europe. First, after months of extensive discussion in European bodies and forums, a compromise has been reached at the European Parliament on 14 May and at the last ECOFIN meeting on 15 May on CRD IV. This is a very important development and I look forward to successful trialogues between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission. Rapid progress and agreement on clear rules of the game are crucial also with a view to meeting the G20 commitments on the timely and comprehensive implementation of Basel III. Third, as regard the proposed regulation as approved by the Council, the compromise text now includes elements that would allow national authorities to apply measures falling under the “single rulebook” for macro-prudential purposes. Overall, this is a welcome development. My critical remark in this regard is that the text of the regulation should state clearly that only the calibrations or quantitative limits can be tightened while definitions should remain intact, since this is the only way to ensure direct comparability or prudential ratios across the EU. I also think that the list of measures was enlarged too much and, for instance, in this context I do not agree with the proposal that the risk weights of certain exposures can be changed as this would distort comparability of such ratios across member states. Let me conclude by saying that finding the right balance between the principle of a “single rulebook” and the required flexibility to implement macro-prudential measures at the national level is and remains a key policy challenge for decision makers in Europe. However, looking at the developments in financial markets and the recent policy initiatives in this field, I’m convinced that the establishment of an efficient and well-functioning macro-prudential framework may substantially contribute to the smooth functioning of the single market and the strengthening of the financial stability framework. The latter would be particularly beneficial for the euro area where the risks to financial stability can be transmitted even faster than elsewhere and a lack of trust in part of the financial system can be felt across the entire currency area. Safeguarding financial stability in the euro area demands a euro area-wide perspective where an effective macro-prudential framework – on the preventative side – is accompanied by a well-functioning resolution mechanism – on the crisis management side.  In that respect, as you know, the ECB supports the establishment of a financial union for the euro area, based on three elements: a European deposit insurance scheme, a European 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches Resolution Fund and a euro area banking supervisory authority. Very briefly, this would entail: first, a single deposit insurance scheme that applies to all banks of the euro area so as to avoid unfair completion; second, that a subset of euro area financial institutions that are systemically important or operating significantly cross-border would be subject to a European Resolution Fund; and third, that the same subset of systemically important financial institutions would be subject to a euro area banking supervisory authority. The Resolution Fund would be only for institutions at the point of non-viability that need to be resolved and not for bailouts of “going concerns” so as to minimize the need for public funds. The possible moral hazard risks of having a single deposit guarantee to all banks without many of them being subject to European supervision would have to be addressed, for instance, by imposing that after the need for paying insurance the country where that would have happened would have to contribute at least with 50% of the replenishment of the fund. Besides contributing to a clear commitment to the future of the euro project one key benefit of all these arrangements would be to ensure that the euro area banking and financial system can be separated from the financial situation of the sovereigns. With this a major step would be accomplished to overcome the present European crisis by consolidating in a concrete way the future of our monetary union. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: Banking system and economic development Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the joint press conference with Mr Gani Gërguri, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo, Tirana, 12 June 2012. *      *      * Honourable Governor Gërguri, Honourable participants, I am honoured to take part in the proceedings of this joint activity organised by the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo and the Bank of Albania. It is taking place during the jubilee year that coincides with the 100th Anniversary of Albania’s Declaration of Independence. After a long cavalcade of torments and existential discourses, finally both our countries have entered an irreversible process of transformation and convergence to democracy and market economy standards. The respective financial systems have been part of this process, in which thanks to the dedicated and hard work done by both our institutions, the achievements are numerous. The banking industry of both countries has grown rapidly in recent years, enjoying a stable financial health. It has made a significant contribution to the financing of our economies, leading to a stable economic growth over the years. It is my pleasure to see that the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo is growing day by day, assuming more and more the characteristics of a modern central bank, like its counterparts in the region. Let me take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the commendable work done by the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo’s staff, led by my old friend, Mr. Gani Gerguri. I am fully convinced that we have, and will have even in the future, a responsible and committed institution that aims to successfully fulfil its challenging mission and confront with dignity all the challenges ahead. Distinguished guests, For a long time, our economies are finding themselves under the global crisis pressure. Recently, almost all our trading partners, such as the countries in our region and the euro-area economies are displaying acute symptoms. This situation has induced elevated uncertainties regarding probable macroeconomic implications and contamination of the financial stability of our countries, mainly through the existence of several European banking groups. Despite this international turmoil, our economies have succeeded in maintaining a stable performance. Consumption and private sector investments have continued to play a primary role in expanding the Kosovo’s economic activity, while in Albania, the external demand has played a primary role. The other indicators have remained in check. However, their trends must be monitored scrupulously and constantly.  At present, the maintaining of basic balances, i.e., the macroeconomic balance and the financial one, is our major objective. These two pillars represent our legal mandate. Therefore, we must do the utmost to consolidate the inherited balances, by making cautious analyses and taking appropriate measures to best absorb all the risks posed to the country’s macro-financial stability. Currently, the fulfilment of our legal mission has become a difficult and challenging task, full of surprises. Our countries represent small economies, whose share and influence can not play an active or imposing role in the international arena. Moreover, I am increasingly convinced that our economies are net importers of both material goods and international crisis.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Personally, I think that the moments we are currently experiencing constitute an historic opportunity for all of us, to leave a good name as competent managers in times of the great crisis. As long as things go well, we fail to understand the need for ongoing adaptation, for constant correction. This is the reason that mostly leads to creation of “financial bubbles” in the economy. Apparently, decision-makers lack the ability or the willingness to stop blowing bubbles, and hence they burst. From this viewpoint, I assess that the Bank of Albania’s experience carries over elements of preliminary correction, i.e., preventive elements. Let me be more specific. Since early 2005, we have addressed the interplay between macroeconomic stability and financial stability prudentially. While there was a historic stability in keeping inflation in check, there existed many unclear things in the banking system stability. I would like to remind you, briefly, of the fact that we are talking about a period when the banking system was transformed into a 100% private capital and when credit expansion dominated the banking business. Since 2005, the outstanding credit to the economy has expanded by 7–8 percentage points of GDP. Moreover, 75% of credit was denominated in foreign currency and the hedging against exchange rate risk was frequently overlooked. It was the time when competition for market share increased tremendously among banks, even at the expense of credit quality. Periodic examinations conducted by banking supervision identified several vulnerabilities that could threaten the financial stability of the system. I would mention: lack of an electronic credit register; risk management weaknesses, structural weaknesses in internal audit; lack of transparency in dealing with customers about the supplied products. One of the most important issues worth mentioning is bank management in general, and their managers’ role and integrity in particular. Identification of weaknesses requires investigating, taking administrative measures, and making legal and regulatory changes to solve the problems. To this end, several initiatives were launched, including: establishing a credit register; creating the Financial Stability Department; conducting prudential supervision; creating a regulatory base for protecting Albanian consumers; and, undoubtedly, public education. The latter, in particular, is a very important issue constituting one of the cornerstones of the financial stability and of the central bank’s monetary policy success. A financially educated public makes fewer mistakes in financial decisions and reacts swiftly and predictably to economic developments and policies pursued by a central bank and other authorities. Therefore, financial education of the public has been and remains a priority of the Bank of Albania. Individual decision-making of households and businesses should be assessed as much as the meeting of inflation target or the maintaining of financial stability. This assessment is supported by the fact that individual choice based on financial literacy and good interpretation of economic information provides benefits to the whole society. Financial literacy is essential from the point of view of individuals and social welfare. It should be seen as a public good that contributes to strengthening of stability, efficiency of economic policies, but above all, it increases individual’s financial welfare, and hence the overall economic welfare. This is why the Bank of Albania has adopted the slogan: “Education costs, but it is priceless.” The Bank of Albania’s approach to financial education has been focused on three directions. First, promoting deep knowledge and awareness of basic economic and financial concepts; secondly, knowledge of the Bank of Albania, its role and policies, and its decision-making; third, knowledge of economic information and its interpretation. The Bank of Albania started financial education to the public by communicating openly and actively with various groups of interest.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Our experience shows us that financial education should be an integral part of our national strategy. Consequently, seeking the cooperation and understanding of the Albanian Government (the Ministry of Education and Science), the Bank of Albania has become an initiator for defining financial education strategies, policies and practices in the education system. The Bank of Albania has played an active role in preparing the teaching programs, implementing and coordinating the teaching process, so that students perceive financial education as part of high-school education curriculum. This activity is a special and significant contribution that the Bank of Albania has made to financial education. It is crowned with the publication of the book “Personal finance in your hands”, conceptualised for high schools, incorporated as an elective subject in high-school curriculum, and distributed at schools, training of economics teachers also included. This difficult process has consumed considerable human and financial resources, but the interest aroused fully justify it. Education institutions, and students that will have long term benefits from financial education, have positively expected this initiative. Along with them, the whole economy will also benefit.  Financial education and financial stability are two important issues and two examples of the avant-garde policies pursued by the Bank of Albania. These policies have in common the fact that their effects on changing the behaviour of individuals, businesses and overall economy are gradual and life-long. In both cases, what matters is the side of movement, the direction in which these policies lead the economy. Credibility to institutions, confidence in the financial system and financial literacy help people not only in managing their financial affairs and raising their standard of living, but also in proposing and supporting the right policies. They also contribute to sustainability and efficiency of the financial system for the whole economy. Improved macro-financial management and financial education help each-other for a successful journey. Today’s activity, organised by both central banks of one nation, is also part of this journey.  Currently, we should keep our focus on and harmonise the central banks’ positions to ensure macro-financial stability, as the only way that enhances the credibility of economies in our region and improves the foreign investment climate. Cooperation and coordination of policies of central banks and financial authorities for creating a regional market, will increase the value of existing investments and of our economies in general. Harmonisation of economic agendas to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, increase opportunities for regional cooperation and open new joint projects, is the only way for promoting new private investments and attaining the real convergence of our economies. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me once more congratulate you for organizing this event and for your good work done so far. It is wonderful to see so many individuals and organisations working for one goal, for economic education of Albanians, for boosting confidence in financial institutions, for good management of the economy nation-wide, for making the best choices to ensure future economic prosperity. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  John McDermott: The future of inflation targeting? Comments by Mr John McDermott, Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, prepared for the BIS Research Workshop “Globalisation and inflation dynamics in Asia and the Pacific”, hosted by the Bank for International Settlements, Hong Kong representative office, 19 June 2012. *      *      * Introduction Inflation targeting as a monetary policy framework has been largely successful at keeping inflation in check in the many countries that have adopted it over the past 20 years or so.1 Certainly the inflation performance in New Zealand has been far superior under the inflation targeting regime (figure 1).  I expect inflation targeting is very familiar to most people here but let me briefly recap what that framework entails in the New Zealand context. Then I will use the most recent business cycle in New Zealand to illustrate how the framework coped with some very significant shocks to the New Zealand economy.  Figure 1 Headline CPI inflation  Source: Statistics New Zealand                                                 1  Roger, S (2009) “Inflation targeting at 20: achievements and challenges” IMF working paper, WP/09/236, October. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  What inflation targeting looks like in New Zealand  Inflation targeting frameworks have a number of elements including an explicit numerical target to be met over a defined time horizon, as well as typically specifying a process for how the central bank is to be held accountable for its monetary policy actions and how it is expected to communicate its monetary policy decisions.  In New Zealand, we aim to keep future consumer price inflation between 1 and 3 per cent on average over the medium term.2 Like many other central banks we have a range of publications we can use to provide our view of inflationary pressure and explain our monetary policy actions. The most prominent is the quarterly Monetary Policy Statement. Although the principles of inflation targeting are the same across countries there are some differences in the details. For example, New Zealand has a different accountability structure in that we have a single decision maker rather than a committee for monetary policy decisions. We also differ to most central banks in that we publish an interest rate track that we think would be necessary to achieve our inflation target. These differences do not appear have made a difference in the ability to achieve the inflation target. How did the inflation targeting framework cope with the most recent business cycle in New Zealand? The most recent business cycle in New Zealand was one of the longest and largest in the past 60 years.3 The Reserve Bank has been analysing this cycle to help assess its monetary policy. This analysis provides a useful case study on the use of inflation targeting in a small open economy, like New Zealand’s. An analysis of the drivers of the business cycle was published in the Bank’s March Bulletin while a discussion of monetary policy over the business cycle will be published in the Bank’s June Bulletin in a few weeks.  In summary, that analysis notes that the New Zealand’s economy expanded from 1998 to 2007 and then had a six quarter recession in 2008–09. From 1998 to 2007 there were a number of significant shocks that determined the shape of the business cycle (figure 2). First, there was a strong and unexpected increase in population growth from net immigration in 2002/03. Second, there was a significant boost to the economy from a rising terms of trade from 2000, which accelerated late in the period. Third, oil prices roughly doubled from mid-2007 to mid-2008. Fourth, government spending rose rapidly from 2005. This came at a time of pre-existing excess demand in the economy.                                                  2  In New Zealand, the inflation targeting framework is founded on the Reserve Bank Act 1989 (the Act) and the Policy Targets Agreement (PTA). The Act makes price stability the primary function of monetary policy and gives the Reserve Bank independence in operating monetary policy, subject to an agreement between the Minister of Finance and the Governor (the sole decision maker) specifying the functional target. The PTA defines price stability in the form of an inflation target, currently future annual CPI inflation “...between 1 per cent and 3 per cent on average over the medium term”. The PTA says that in pursuing price stability monetary policy should “seek to avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates and the exchange rate”. 3  For details of the dating for New Zealand’s business cycles see Hall, V B and C J McDermott (2009) “The New Zealand business cycle” Econometric Theory, 25, 1050–1069.

As our forthcoming Bulletin article4 notes, throughout the recent boom we expected the output gap to dissipate rapidly. However, as it turned out the output gap remained positive for an extended period (figure 3).                                                  4  Chetwin, W (2012) “Business cycle review, 1998–2011” Reserve Bank of New Zealand Bulletin 75(1), 14–27.

4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Figure 3 Output gap estimates from June quarter Monetary Policy Statements  (percent of potential output)  Source: Statistics New Zealand, RBNZ calculations With an extended period of excess demand pressure, average inflation tracked in the upper half of our target zone. While the persistent component of inflation was higher than we would have ideally liked during the business cycle expansion, it did remain anchored within the target zone. That outcome was far superior to our experience of the 1970s when inflation was persistently at double-digit levels. The difficulty of anticipating how long an inflationary shock will last is central to the forecasting process required for monetary policy. In many models that are used for monetary policy analysis, the output gap often quickly returns close to zero following a simple aggregate demand shock, and it is natural to think in those terms.5 However, the interaction of a persistent aggregate demand shock and inertia in the economy can considerably prolong the time for which the economy is in a state of excess demand pressure. Figure 4 illustrates this point by showing the response of an aggregate demand shock with a half-life of only two quarters in a stylised model of monetary policy with typical parameter settings. The point is that excess demand can remain material in the economy long after the underlying shock has gone.                                                 5  Here I am referring to the New Keynesian style models as described in, for example, Woodford, M.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Figure 4 Response of output gap and inflation to a persistent aggregate demand shock  RBNZ calculations  Of course, the shocks we face in the economy can be far more complicated than in this simple illustration. Three of the shocks shown in figure 2 delivered ongoing pressure to the economy. Even the relatively short-lived large inflow of migrants in 2002/03 had ongoing impacts. The housing stock cannot be increased as quickly as the changes in migrant flows. Consequently, house prices rose and, even after the boost to population subsided, continued to rise beyond all forecasters’ expectations. Higher house prices in turn stimulated a large construction boom which put further pressure on resources. Private sector credit started to expand well in excess of the nominal growth in the economy (figure 5). In line with conventional wisdom, we put relatively less weight on credit data than on interest rates.6 Had we had a higher weighting on credit growth data, our view of the persistence of pressure on resources would likely have been stronger much earlier in the boom.                                                 6  The academic consensus on monetary policy used to be that there was no independent information for monetary formulation in money and credit numbers over and above that available in interest rates. See for example, Gali, J (2008) Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework, Princeton University Press, Princeton. While this view was never completely accepted at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Bollard, A (2005) “Housing debt, inflation and the exchange rate” Address to the Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) AGM)) money and credit aggregates were never very prominent in the formulation of monetary policy. One of the processes we changed following the global financial crisis was to formally present information on monetary and credit aggregates to the Monetary Policy Committee to assist with the production of the Bank’s forecasting in its Monetary Policy Statement. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Figure 5 Excess of domestic credit growth over nominal GDP growth  Source: Statistics New Zealand, RBNZ calculations Monetary policy in New Zealand is also complicated by exchange rate issues. In a small open economy the inflation target is a complement to a floating exchange rate regime. During the boom period expectations of tight monetary policy to offset the excess demand pressure probably contributed to the persistently high exchange rate throughout the period, causing considerable discomfort and worries about the sustainability of parts of New Zealand’s tradable sector. After the global finance crisis there are new challenges for monetary policy to deal with. The current recovery in the business cycle, both in New Zealand and in other advanced economies, is proving weaker than historical precedents. Our forecasting frameworks need to be expanded so we can examine possible sources of the disappointing recoveries, such as say the impact of the overhang of public and private debt on the economy. Inflation targeting works, and other lessons for the future Despite the challenges and the ongoing shocks to the economy, monetary policy did what it was supposed to do, keep inflation low. The framework maintained the Reserve Bank’s focus on the target and the frequent publication of forecasts forced us to constantly update our views of the economy and the inflation pressure within it. The Bank’s analysis on the recent business cycle underscores that the inflation targeting framework is an effective way to conduct monetary policy under a range of testing circumstances and that the framework is a useful tool for future inflation control. With low inflation and the credibility of inflation targeting came much lower volatility in the general level of prices. That is helpful for resource allocation, affecting longer term performance, and for macroeconomic stability over the medium term. This credibility was 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  very helpful when the global financial crisis hit. To help offset the very large negative shock the Bank started lowering interest rates even while annual inflation was above its 1 to 3 percent target.  Of course, that is not to say the framework cannot be improved in any way. Over the course of the past 20 years or so the framework has evolved to reflect lessons learned and is likely to evolve further in response to new developments. In particular, our monitoring of monetary and credit information has increased in the wake of the global financial crisis. The Reserve Bank has also been looking into the effectiveness of some macroprudential instruments that may limit build-ups of problems in future periods of rapid credit growth.7                                                 7  For details see Spencer (2012) “Prudential lessons from the Global Financial Crisis”, Presentation to Financial Institutions of New Zealand 2012 Remuneration Forum, May. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Gill Marcus: The changing mandates of central banks – the challenges for domestic policy Address by Ms Gill Marcus, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), Johannesburg, 30 May 2012. *      *      * Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to be with you. It is always a pleasure to return to GIBS as I was personally associated with this school after my term of office as a Deputy Governor expired in 2004, and have a great deal of respect for the forums you create for open dialogue.  One would have thought that a return to the South African Reserve Bank would be relatively straightforward because of my previous experience in central banking. However, I found a very different world. Not only had the environment in which central banks operate changed dramatically, the expectations of central banks as reflected in their extended mandates had also changed.  In the early to mid-2000s leading up to the global financial crisis there was an emerging macroeconomic theory and policy consensus. The period was known as the Great Moderation, following an apparent trend towards macroeconomic convergence, particularly in the advanced economies. Business cycles appeared to be more synchronised with lower amplitudes, and low inflation prevailed in most countries. Some went as far as to suggest that both business cycles and inflation were dead. Inflation targeting had become a broadly accepted monetary policy framework, making price stability the overriding objective. The framework was widely credited for contributing to this benign environment. Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, once remarked that a sign of a successful monetary policy was when it became boring, and indeed it seemed that the world was on its way in that direction. Well, all I can say is “bring back boring”. At the same time, while many central banks had implicit financial stability mandates, the evolving trend at that time was for the regulation and supervision of the banking and financial sectors to move out of central banks. Notable examples were in the UK and Australia, and serious consideration was also given to moving bank supervision out of the South African Reserve Bank in the early 2000s. The focus of central banks appeared to be narrowing.  Today things have changed quite dramatically. Monetary policy and central banking in general has become anything but boring, and rather than taking a back seat in the economy, central banks are now at the forefront of attempts to stabilise and repair the damaged global economy. The mandates of central banks have been extended in numerous countries, including in our own, bringing with it new and difficult challenges. In my remarks this evening I will focus on the growth and financial stability aspects of broadened mandates in the South African context. The modern mandate of central banks had focused primarily on price stability, reinforced by the increased adoption of inflation targeting. The simplistic view of inflation targeting is that all a central bank has to do is to conduct policy in such a way as to keep inflation in line with the target. Other possible objectives of monetary policy are seen to be secondary or not the concern of monetary policy. This relates in particular to economic growth, and by extension to employment. Although the Bank has often been criticised for not being sufficiently concerned about growth, we are also criticised by those who believe that we have gone beyond our mandate by focusing on growth. In the wake of the global financial crisis, it is clear that growth and employment became foremost concerns of most central banks, particularly in those economies where the recovery was slow and protracted, and where inflation was not perceived to be a threat. The persistence of the extraordinarily low interest rate environment in the advanced economies 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches attests to that. So is this focus on growth a new mandate for central banks and an undermining of the primary inflation objective? In this respect, inflation targeting has often been misunderstood, or oversimplified. It is important to distinguish between strict and flexible inflation targeting. A strict inflation targeter is one that only focuses on inflation to the exclusion of all other possible objectives. As such, it is a theoretical construct as in reality no central bank acts in this way. A flexible inflation targeter, by contrast, puts some weight on the deviation of output from potential (the output gap), and this weight can change depending on circumstances. In effect this implies that the objective of monetary policy is to achieve the inflation target with output in line with potential. The focus however is on deviations from potential output, as it is generally believed that monetary policy has limited, if any, long run impact on the growth potential of the economy. This is the domain of other policies. The flexibility is manifested when concern for the state of the economy can result in deciding on a longer time horizon for achieving the inflation target, in order to minimise the negative impacts on output growth. It also follows that if inflation is in line with its target and if inflation expectations are well anchored, more weight can be given to stabilising or increasing growth that is below potential, without sacrificing much price stability. This does not imply a change in mandate, and is consistent with a flexible inflation targeting framework, such as we have in South Africa. What does appear to have changed is that the burden of stabilisation and growth stimulus is falling increasingly on central banks, particularly in those countries that no longer have any fiscal space. In many countries, the response to the crisis was initially through both monetary and fiscal policy easing. However, the measures taken did not resolve the crisis and an unanticipated consequence was that, in a many instances, this led to excessive and unsustainable deficits and debt ratios.  For example, in 2007, government debt to GDP ratios in the US and the UK were 62 per cent and 44 per cent. By 2012 they have almost doubled and expected to reach 103 per cent and 87 per cent respectively. In the euro area, the debt ratios of Greece and Ireland increased from 105 per cent and 25 per cent, to 157 per cent and 122 per cent over the same period. Of these four countries, only the US is currently experiencing positive growth. The costs of servicing this debt has also increased significantly, particularly in the peripheral Eurozone countries, as doubts about their sustainability persist. This rapid expansion has resulted in fiscal consolidation or retrenchment becoming the order of the day in many, mainly advanced, countries, even where growth has not fully recovered. In short the global crisis has continued to mutate, and we now face the challenge of systemic banking weakness in a number of countries, for instance Spain, sovereign debt and possible default in parts of the Eurozone, and high and rising unemployment. The unemployment rate in the Eurozone has risen to 10,9 per cent, with Spanish unemployment at 24,1 per cent. Fiscal austerity has reinforced the slow growth, and consequently increased the burden on monetary policy. Although the mandate may be the same, the shared responsibility is no longer there, and more is expected from central banks. At times these expectations may be beyond what monetary policy can reasonably be expected to deliver.  In this context we can consider whether the conduct of monetary policy in South Africa been much different in the post crisis period. Some have argued that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is part of a new mandate, and a deviation from inflation targeting. We would argue that the Bank’s actions have been consistent with the flexible inflation targeting framework. Since the crisis, the economy has been growing at below what we estimate potential output to be (around 3,5 per cent), and the absolute output gap, that is the difference between the level of output and the potential level of output, coincidentally also at around 3,5 per cent, has been persistently negative. It will require a period of above-potential growth to close this gap, unless there has been a destruction of capacity which would reduce the size of the gap. A negative ouput gap also implies less pressure on inflation. Although inflation had moved outside the target, the considered view of the MPC was that inflation would return to within the target, and, given the subdued state of the economy, it was felt 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 inappropriate to speed up this process through a tighter monetary policy stance. This view was also reinforced by the absence of excess demand-side pressures and relatively well-anchored inflation expectations.  In the 2006–08 period, by contrast, when inflation exceeded the target, growth was in excess of the Bank’s estimates of potential, with measured growth at between 5 and 6 per cent per annum, with very high rates of growth in credit extension and household consumption expenditure. Under such circumstances, a tighter monetary policy stance was justifiable or appropriate. It is also important to note that recent central bank interventions have not always been about stimulating growth directly through low interest rates. In the context of the crisis, and again more recently when fiscal policy has been constrained, the focus has at times been on helping dysfunctional parts of the financial markets to work better. This is recognition of the central place that financial markets have in the efficient workings of the real economy. These policies have aimed at preventing a negative feedback loop from financial sector stress to the real economy, and have resulted in a number of significant forms of unconventional monetary policy actions, particularly in countries where interest rates had reached their zero bound. There are a number of illustrations of this. Quantitative easing (or credit easing as it was referred to in the US) was initially aimed primarily at providing liquidity to specific segments of the financial markets that were no longer functioning efficiently. During the crisis the loss of confidence in banks and some financial instruments, and the lack of trust between banks, disrupted some segments of the markets and the interbank markets. Central banks responded by becoming the counterparties and bought unconventional assets on a significant scale. Between 2007 and 2011, central bank balance sheets in the advanced economies increased from around 10 per cent of GDP to in excess of 20 per cent of GDP, a total of almost US$8 trillion. More recently the US Fed initiated its Maturity Extension Programme (more popularly referred to as Operation Twist), whereby the Fed sold short term Treasury securities and bought longer term securities, in an effort to bring down long term interest rates. The aim was to give a boost to the ailing domestic housing market, as mortgages are often priced off long-term rates in the US, as well as to the corporate bond market. The Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) of the ECB, through which Euro1,3 trillion of liquidity was injected into the European banking system that was in danger of seizing up, is another example of such measures. The objective was to keep the banking and interbank system operating, and to cushion the real economy from banking sector stress. Some of these activities were intended to provide additional stimulus to economic growth, but some also had a strong financial stability element. This leads us to the area in which central bank mandates have changed most significantly: that is, responsibility for maintaining financial stability. Prior to the crisis, financial stability was generally an implied mandate for central banks. The fall-out from the crisis has led to an increasing number of central banks being given explicit financial stability macroprudential mandates. This is distinct from microprudential supervision and regulation of the banking system where the focus of the regulator is limited to individual banking institutions and the banking system. A broader macroprudential focus would look at the build-up of financial imbalances and the risks posed by the positions taken by leveraged financial institutions to the broader financial sector and to the economy in general. For example, in a low interest rate environment and high rates of growth of credit extension by banks, these funds can be used to finance purchases of assets and result in the build-up of bubbles in the housing or equity markets.  The issue of how central banks should react to asset prices was the subject of much debate prior to the crisis. The dominant view at the time was that financial imbalances and crises should not occur in a low inflation environment, and where they did, central banks were not in a position to recognise or predict them. Nor did they have appropriate tools to prick incipient 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches bubbles. Interest rates would had to have been raised to unacceptably high levels in a low inflation environment in order to deal with the bubbles that had emerged. The consensus view was that asset prices should be taken into consideration by monetary policy only to the extent they impact on inflation, and that the role of central banks should be confined to cleaning up after the bubble had burst. Unfortunately, as we are all now well aware, five years after some of these bubbles burst central banks are still cleaning up. But there were some influential voices, notably coming out of the Bank for International Settlements, that argued that the low inflation/low interest rate environment of the 2000s was the cause of the asset price bubbles in the first place. In other words, ironically, the successful attainment of low inflation was leading to longer term financial stability problems. This approach argued in favour of monetary policy leaning against these excesses. The view was that too narrow a focus, or too short a time horizon for policy, blinded policy makers to longer term systemic financial stability risks which could take a long time to evolve. Since the crisis, a widely accepted perspective has emerged which sees monetary policy and macroprudential policy having different objectives, and different instruments. This approach attempts to avoid a conflict of objectives or trade-offs in the application of the interest rate instrument. Others however contend that it is not feasible to completely separate the two policies, as interest rates affect financial stability, while macroprudential tools affect credit growth and therefore inflation. While macroprudential oversight has emerged as a distinct policy focus, there is still no unanimity as to the best governance arrangements for such oversight. Some central banks, for example the Bank of England, have established financial stability committees, and this places the mandate for financial stability squarely in the court of central banks. A different approach is expressed by Lars Svensson at the Swedish Rijksbank who argues that as is the case with fiscal policy, financial stability policy is conceptually different from monetary policy, and should be conducted by a completely different institution and different individuals. More significantly, while it is generally agreed that the interest rate should be the main instrument of monetary policy, the choice and efficacy of financial stability instruments is still very much work in progress. Given the different institutional structures in different countries, the type of instruments will also likely differ from country to country. However there are some common themes in the evolving thinking on this topic. It is generally accepted that excessive credit extension is at the heart of most asset price bubbles, and therefore the instruments that are used should be directed at preventing excessive leverage in the relevant markets. Charles Goodhart, for example, has argued that because housing markets are at the epicentre of most financial crises, it is sufficient to focus on instruments that prevent excessive build-up of housing related credit. These include setting maximum loan-to-value ratios on property transactions and borrowing restrictions in relation to disposable income.  Other possible macroprudential instruments include reserve requirements for particular types of loans, contracyclical capital buffers for banks and capital surcharges for systemically important banks. In general these are microprudential tools, some of which had previously been applied in many countries as anti-inflation measures and since jettisoned, but are now being reconsidered with a narrower focus. It is still premature to pronounce on the efficacy or success of such policies, and this remains work in progress. In reality financial stability is generally a shared responsibility as financial crisis resolution often requires fiscal intervention and the application of public money. This has the potential to create challenges for central bank independence. Even if narrow monetary policy independence remains intact, the boundaries between monetary and macroprudential policies are often blurred. However, as Jaime Caruana of the BIS argued in his address at the Bank last year, because there will always be strong opposition to central banks resisting asset price accelerations, or taking away the punchbowl when the party gets going, the arguments for independence apply with even greater force, and such independence will be needed not only from political cycles but also from the financial markets. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 In South Africa, the implicit financial stability mandate of the Bank was made explicit in the letter from the Minister of Finance to the Governor in February 2010. The Bank’s financial stability committee has been reconstituted and meets in alternate months to the MPC. Furthermore, and in recognition of the shared responsibility for financial stability, a Financial Stability Oversight Committee has been established, jointly chaired by the Governor and the Minister of Finance. The focus of the Bank FSC is on crisis prevention, and while the FSOC does review current conditions, the primary purpose of this committee is crisis management and resolution. Furthermore, government has decided that regulation and supervision of the financial sector should move to a “twin peaks” approach. This means that all prudential regulation will become the responsibility of the SARB, while market conduct will be the province of the Financial Services Board. This is a very significant reform and adds to the tasks and responsibilities of the Bank.  Work is ongoing to determine the appropriate policy instruments. To date, while counter-cyclical measures have been introduced to address the fallout of the ongoing global economic crisis, South Africa’s banking system has emerged largely unscathed. While there is no room for complacency, no policy decisions have had to be taken in respect of financial stability. One area of potential concern for financial stability is the acceleration in the growth of unsecured lending by the banking sector, although unsecured lending is not restricted to the banking sector only. This form of lending has been growing at rates in excess of 30 per cent and, at face value, anything growing at such elevated rates must be a cause for concern. But this also needs to be seen in context as total loans and advances, of which unsecured lending forms part, is still growing at relatively moderate levels. Both the FSC of the Bank and the Registrar of Banks are keeping a close eye on these developments, and are trying to understand this phenomenon more fully. Without coming to any definitive conclusion on the issue, a number of points can be raised. Firstly, should we be concerned about this from a financial stability, a microprudential, or a monetary policy perspective? From a monetary policy point of view, we would need to understand the extent to which this lending translates into excessive expenditure with potential inflationary consequences. At this stage, this does not seem to be the case. While it may well be that unsecured lending may have contributed to the growth rate of 5 per cent in household consumption expenditure, this growth was in line with real income growth and not considered unsustainable or excessive. In fact, there are signs of a moderation in the rate of growth of household consumption expenditure in the first quarter of 2012, particularly with respect to durable goods. Furthermore there is little evidence that CPI inflation is being driven in any meaningful way by excess demand pressures.  A microprudential approach would focus on the risk profile and key ratios of the individual institutions. This is part of the function of the Registrar of Banks. At this stage, there are no signs of stress in any of the banks or in the banking system as a whole. To the contrary, the ratio of impaired advances to total loans and advances, which had remained stubbornly high for some time, has declined from 5,8 per cent in March 2011 to 4,6 per cent in March 2012.  From a more systemic perspective, the risks to the banking sector at this stage appear to be limited, as unsecured lending (which includes traditional forms of unsecured lending such as overdrafts, credit cards and loans to SME’s), at around 8 per cent, is a relatively small proportion of total lending although this ratio has been rising. If loans to SME’s, overdrafts and credit cards are excluded, the ratio is 4 per cent. From a financial stability perspective, we also need to consider whether it is likely to lead to asset price bubbles elsewhere in the system. The housing market remains very subdued, with some of the house price indices still reflecting falling prices. Although the equity market reached an all-time high in April before falling back in recent days following increased global risk aversion, it would be difficult to argue that this is a bubble. In any event the link between high rates of growth in unsecured lending and equity or bond price movements is extremely tenuous at best. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Growth in credit extension by banks to the private sector has been relatively muted. Growth over twelve months in private sector credit extension was 7,3 per cent in April, down from to 9,2 per cent in the previous month. It is significant that total loans and advances to households, which includes unsecured lending, is still only growing at annual rates of around 7 per cent. There is a potential concern about the possibility of an excessive burden of household debt. Although the ratio of household debt to disposable income is still high, it has been declining. Having peaked at 82,3 per cent in 2008, the ratio declined to 74,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2011. Household debt is nevertheless still rising, but at a slower pace than that of disposable incomes. So at a macro level, there does not appear to be a cause for concern. The concern, however, could be the distribution of these debts. There is the risk that some households are becoming over-leveraged, but this would suggest that the limits set by the National Credit Act are not being adhered to.  A further concern that is often expressed is: what happens when the interest rate cycle turns and many of these new borrowers may find it difficult to service their loans. Some of these loans are on a fixed interest basis with monthly repayment commitments, thus the servicing of the loans should not be materially affected by interest rate increases. There is also evidence that some of the growth in unsecured loans is as a result of loans with a greater value and longer repayment term being extended to existing clients with a proven repayment record.  It is also possible that we are observing a structural change with respect to bank lending. Mortgage credit extension is subdued and it is more difficult than in the past for households to access their mortgage bonds to finance consumption expenditure. So to some extent, this may be an adjustment away from mortgages and once the adjustment has taken place, more sustainable rates of increase should be observed. But because rates charged on unsecured lending are much higher than on mortgages, consumers are getting access to more expensive credit, although this is not evident yet in the data on the cost of servicing household debt which has declined consistently since the end of 2008.  These developments are being closely monitored for signs of unsustainable increases which could have systemic implications for the banking sector, for financial stability in general or for inflation. But as I have illustrated above, the answer is not simple.  In conclusion, the context that central banks operate in has become increasingly complex. The global growth outlook has deteriorated in recent weeks, and coupled with increasingly volatile and risk averse financial markets in response to uncertainties in the Eurozone, central banks will again be expected to play a core role in helping to manage or resolve the crisis. The scope for fiscal policy to play a meaningful role is limited by the high sovereign debt ratios which are part of the underlying problem. There are also increasing concerns about the sustainability of expanded central bank balance sheets and the abnormally low global interest rates, which are seen by some as already sowing the seeds of the next crisis. At the same time, the financial stability focus, the tightening of banking regulations and the move towards Basel III is having the effect of increasing deleveraging by banks, particularly in Europe, and raising the cost of capital for banks. These developments are focused on ensuring a more stable financial system in the future, but in the process are having a contractionary impact on growth. The potential for conflict between the different mandates are evident.  In South Africa, we have not had to make any exceptional liquidity provision, and monetary policy has been more accommodative than it would have been in the absence of below-potential growth rates and a persistently negative output gap. Inflation is expected to return to within the target range in the near term, and to remain contained over the forecast period. The banking system is stable despite challenges expected in implementing Basel III, especially over the longer term. However, we vigilantly monitor global developments and the possibility of contagion to our economy. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 It is important that, in extending the mandates of central banks, there should be a clear understanding of what central banks can and cannot do, and an appreciation of the possible conflicts between the different objectives. Central banks, in normal times, function in an uncertain environment. In the prevailing difficult global conditions uncertainty is at an even higher level, and many of the actions taken have no precedence. It is therefore incumbent upon central banks to share information and together learn from our collective experiences. As the lines between the various mandates become increasingly blurred, there is a danger that the burden of expectations could be excessive, and ultimately undermine confidence and credibility in central banks themselves. These challenges are being considered by central banks and others, and require that all of us better understand the immediate challenges of the mutating, extremely severe global financial crisis. At the same time we need to appreciate that measures required to deal with the crisis may well have unintended consequences for central banks, their mandates, independence, capacity and role in society. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel Mminele: Taking stock of the global and South African environment Address by Mr Daniel Mminele, Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 6th Annual Cocktail Function of the Financial Markets Department, Pretoria, 10 May 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Financial Markets Department’s annual cocktail function. It is customary for us to take stock every year of what has happened in the global and domestic environment. We last met in April 2011, at a time when adverse developments in the euro zone were gathering momentum and financial stability risks were intensifying, thereby threatening the sustainability of the global recovery. It is a year later, and while much has been done on various fronts to try and resolve the crisis, we continue to face significant global economic and financial market challenges. Downside risks remain elevated and continue to hold back a strong and sustainable global economic recovery. Geopolitical tensions remain a threat, with the potential to again trigger a sharp rise in oil prices. Central banks have continued to play a fundamental role, in an attempt to prevent a collapse of the financial system and continued downward economic adjustments. In the process central banks ventured even deeper into new territory, which Martin Wolf of the Financial Times last week described as the new world of post-financial-crisis central banking, which will create significant institutional and intellectual challenges. In Europe, firewalls were increased after long debates, and under the auspices of the G20 and IMF, countries have also come together to provide additional financial resources to the IMF for purposes of crisis resolution and prevention. Will these measures, beyond ensuring that the global economy does not fall back into recession, be enough to restore the required level of confidence in financial markets? Recent market moves appear to suggest not. Have all these actions not raised the risk of moral hazard, with investors expecting central banks to continue pumping money into the financial system; and will the system become hooked on central bank money? Jaime Caruana1 has pointed out that these actions have bought time, but in so doing, may have actually made it easier to waste that time, increasing the risk that the “balance sheet recession” leads to protracted weakness, and also potentially raising political economy risks. It would indeed be unfortunate if what is essentially a temporary relief were to breed a sense of complacency with regard to the repair work that is still necessary. While we may not be able to answer these questions tonight, let me briefly touch on global and domestic financial market developments, before updating you on the activities of the Financial Markets Department over the past year.  2. Global economic developments and financial markets While volatility in global financial markets declined during the first half of 2011, the third quarter witnessed a renewed rise in tensions, first driven by the congressional debate over the debt ceiling in the United States, and then by renewed concerns about the solvency of peripheral euro area sovereigns. Greece may have been at the forefront of the news flow, but by late 2011, concerns had spread to a number of other sovereign issuers in the euro                                                 1 Central banking in a balance sheet recession. Panel remarks by Mr Jaime Caruana, General Manager of the BIS, at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2012 conference on “Central banking: before, during and after the crisis”, Washington, 23–24 March 2012. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  zone periphery, resulting in a sharp widening in spreads, which in turn spilled over to banks’ funding costs and generally tighter financial conditions in the rest of the world. As already indicated, it again became necessary for central banks to respond in an unconventional manner: the US Federal Reserve lengthened the maturity of its securities portfolios (in what became known as “Operation Twist”); the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan expanded their respective balance-sheets via additional securities purchases; while the ECB for the first time (and in two instalments) supplied banks with almost EUR1 trillion in three-year repo funding. The goals of these measures, however, were broadly similar: stabilizing the funding structure of the banking system, and thereby fending off the risk of a severe credit crunch. These measures helped to limit undue market volatility that risked forcing illiquid but solvent sovereigns into insolvency. At the same time, public and private creditors worked out a voluntary restructuring plan for Greek sovereign debt.  The market’s initial response was positive. Risk indicators declined markedly from December 2011 to March 2012, with the VIX index in particular falling to a level of 15, which was more or less around the lows recorded at the beginning of the financial crisis. Intra-euro zone sovereign spreads underwent a sharp compression, as did bank CDS spreads, while the reduction in risk-aversion spurred a marked rally in equities. Yet many questions remained unanswered. For example, will vulnerable sovereign states take advantage of this “window of opportunity” to implement the necessary strengthening of their public finances and to improve their competitiveness? Will credit to non-financial entities start flowing more strongly again now that banks have been able to secure more solid financing? Will authorities manage to implement fiscal austerity measures without unduly damaging growth prospects in Europe? And then there is the issue of whether geopolitics will push oil to levels that threaten the fragile global recovery. Let me briefly add that Europe is not the only source of risk, as there are, e.g., major fiscal challenges in US, which could come to a head early next year. The jury is still out on these questions, but investor concerns seem to be rising again, especially with respect to the credibility of fiscal consolidation plans in Europe. At the most recent meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors last month, there was some optimism that tail risks faced by the global economy had started to recede. However, the persistence of downside growth risks and the need for on-going structural reform and global rebalancing were also highlighted as needing to be kept firmly on the G20 agenda. 3. Implications for South Africa As has been the case since the beginning of the financial crisis, South Africa has not been immune to these fluctuations in international markets. Our banking system is solid and well-capitalized, our financial markets (including the interbank market) have not experienced any problems that required official intervention, and our external and public finance situation looks far more manageable than in many developed economies. Yet the country’s strong trade links with the European Union; its reliance on commodity exports; and its liquid and sophisticated financial markets provide as many channels for the transmission of external shocks. The past year’s fluctuations in domestic equities, bonds and the exchange rate, as well as the sensitivity of local GDP to the global cycle, bear testimony to this relationship.  Supply-side problems undermined South African growth in 2011. Some of these were external, including disruptions to the automobile sector’s supply chain following the devastation in Japan. Others were internal – and I refer here to safety-related interruptions in mining and industrial action in both the mining and manufacturing sectors. The consequence, however, was that GDP growth only averaged 3,1 per cent in 2011, a lesser increase than what the Reserve Bank had been projecting this time last year. Admittedly, the latter half of the year brought some good news on the domestic demand front. Thus, real GDP accelerated to 3,2 per cent (quarter-on-quarter annualized) in the fourth quarter, driven by sustained solid expansion in consumer spending and an acceleration in both private and 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  public fixed investment. Yet, many factors justify caution – above all the uncertain global environment – and the Reserve Bank’s latest projection for 2012 growth at 3,0 per cent still falls marginally short of the growth rate achieved last year, and of the rate of growth required to put a serious dent into unemployment. In this regard, latest figures show an unfortunate rise in unemployment in the first quarter of 2012.  The past twelve months also saw a mild breach of the Reserve Bank’s 3–6 per cent inflation target, with the headline CPI rate increasing to 6,3 per cent in January before retreating to 6,0 per cent in March. Price pressures over the past year have remained essentially of a cost-push nature. The moderate pace of “core” inflation (4,4 per cent in March when excluding food, petrol and energy) shows that despite some evidence of price pressures becoming more broad-based, these are still expected to remain contained by the relatively subdued state of the domestic economy. In fact, as highlighted by the MPC on March 29, the Reserve Bank expects that CPI inflation will gradually decline from the second quarter of this year onwards, with a projected average of 5,2 per cent by the end of the forecast period at the end of 2013. The behaviour of domestic fixed-income markets over the past twelve months would suggest that investors by and large agree with the Reserve Bank’s interpretation of the inflation acceleration as temporary and largely supply-driven in nature. Despite volatile global markets, rand-denominated bond yields declined over the past year, testing post-recession lows, while breakeven inflation expectations are not markedly different from where they were a year ago. Both the government bond and swap yield curves are flatter up to the ten-year maturity. And while the performance of longer-term bonds appears in part to be dictated by investor expectations of subdued growth both globally and locally, the planned faster reduction in the government budget deficit compared with initial National Treasury targets may also have reassured investors. Activity in the domestic bond market by non-resident investors illustrates their relatively constructive approach towards emerging market debt in general, and South African bonds in particular. Statistics show that net foreign purchases of local bonds were positive in ten of the twelve months to April 2012, and despite a hefty sell-off in September 2011, the cumulated net purchases amounted to R74,5 billion. In comparison, the previous calendar-year record in 2006 stood at R34,3 billion. In recent weeks, the announcement of the possible inclusion of South Africa into the World Government Bond Index later this year, has provided some impetus to the local currency bond market and non-resident inflows. This is a positive development as the criteria for inclusion is based on the level of sophistication of our bond markets with regard to size, credit quality and lack of barriers to entry, as well as on its liquidity and a transparent price discovery process. This represents another endorsement of South Africa’s financial markets as being world-class. Other financial assets, however, have experienced a more volatile environment over the past year. Equity prices, as measured by the JSE all-share index, failed to post any gain over the whole of 2011 despite a recovery in the latter part of the year. Furthermore, a continuation of the late 2011 rally into early 2012 quickly lost steam, bearing testimony to continued investor concerns about any speedy return to solid economic growth. In contrast to positive inflows into bonds, net non-resident activity into local equities has resulted in net sales of R25,4 billion in the twelve months to April 2012. The exchange rate of the rand, while not repeating the wild gyrations of earlier financial crises, has remained vulnerable to shifts in global risk appetite and swings in commodity prices. Following relative stability in the first half of 2011, the currency weakened beyond R8.00/US$ in September as foreign investors sold domestic bonds, and even the resumption of bond purchases in the ensuing months failed to bring the rand back to its previous range. The past few months have again been a period of moderate volatility, with the rand seemingly driven – as with other so-called “commodity currencies” and emerging market currencies – by the countervailing forces of abundant global central bank liquidity, fledgling investor appetite for risk and movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  4. Financial market operations The management of overall money-market liquidity continues to be one of the most important functions of the Financial Markets Department (FMD) as part of the implementation of the monetary policy decisions of the MPC. The Bank continuously reviews its monetary policy operational procedures for appropriateness and effectiveness, and changes are implemented when deemed necessary. As you are aware, various changes were implemented in August 2010 and March 2011 following research conducted within the Bank as well consultations with market participants through the Financial Markets Liaison Group (FMLG). As a result of the changes, the actual daily liquidity requirement increased markedly from a daily average of R10,3 billion in the twelve months before August 2010 to an average of R15 billion in the next twelve months, and further to an average of R16,8 billion from September 2011 to 30 April 2012. The number of banks participating in the main repo auctions has increased from four to a total of six and at times, seven banks, with the combined bid amounts tending to be higher than the announced average weekly liquidity requirement.  The introduction of longer-term foreign exchange swaps with maturities of up to twelve months has improved the Reserve Bank’s open market operations and has led to the more effective management of money-market liquidity. The discontinuation of the practice of announcing the estimated weekly liquidity ranges to the market has significantly reduced the Reserve Bank’s activity in the money-market. Participation in SARB debenture auctions has also improved.  Following further consultations with market participants, another set of enhancements to the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy operational procedures was implemented on 01 March 2012: • When the auction is oversubscribed, the amounts tendered for by commercial banks in the weekly main repo auctions are now allocated on a pro rata basis, up to the announced average daily liquidity requirement for the week; • The Bank now conducts 2- and 5 day main repo auctions during the week of the MPC meetings; and • SARB debentures and reverse repos are now issued with maturities of 7- and 14 days, in addition to the usual 28- and 56 days maturities.  These enhancements have further improved the functioning of the money market, especially the interbank market, have also increased the level of flexibility in the Reserve Bank’s liquidity management operations, and have eliminated the lack of synchronisation between the Reserve Bank’s main repo auctions and the MPC interest rate announcements. This lack of synchronisation had previously led to discrepancies in the market, as interest rates in the interbank market changed when the repo rate was changed, while the interest rate for the main repo remained unchanged for the rest of the week.  Financial market development initiatives remain an important strategic focus area of the Financial Markets Department in cooperation with members of the FMLG, its various working groups and other market participants. The focus for the next period will be on completing projects such as the pricing of the floating rate notes (FRNs) in the secondary market, gaining a better understanding of high-frequency trading in the foreign exchange market and developments in over-the-counter (OTC) market in foreign exchange derivatives and reviewing the calculation reference rates in the money-market.  5. Reserves management In line with stated policy of not targeting a specific level of the exchange rate, the Reserve Bank continues its activities in the foreign exchange market for purposes of building reserves when market conditions are conducive and to execute client transactions. The official gross gold and foreign-exchange reserves increased from US$49,3 billion on 31 March 2011 to US$50,7 billion on 31 March 2012. The change reflected a combination of valuation 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  adjustments, maturing forward transactions, and proceeds of a government foreign bond issue. The international liquidity position improved from US$44,7 billion to US$48,9 billion during this period.  The reserves accumulation strategy continued to be implemented in close consultation with the National Treasury. During the 2011/12 financial year, the Reserve Bank purchased approximately US$4,0 billion for reserve accumulation purposes. These purchases were swapped into the forward market by means of FX swaps in order to sterilise rand liquidity injected into the money market. By end-2011, foreign exchange reserves could comfortably cover a year’s worth of South Africa’s external funding requirements (consisting of the current account deficit and short-term external debt, as per the so called augmented Guidotti Ratio definition).  The Reserve Bank has continued to manage official reserves following prudent risk management and governance principles. The strategic asset allocation is reviewed regularly, compiled in accordance with the Reserve Bank’s investment objectives and determines the structure of the foreign-exchange reserves in terms of currency composition, asset allocation and market risk.  6. Conclusion It is now time for me to conclude, by thanking you for your co-operation over the past financial year as many of you are counterparties in our transactions, participate in information exchanges bilaterally and in fora such as the FMLG, and readily make your research available to us. No doubt, future challenges lie ahead in what remains an unusually uncertain global financial environment. Yet I trust that the spirit of co-operation that we have developed in our financial markets over the years will help us to successfully meet these challenges. I also would like to extend thanks to my own colleagues, the management and staff of the Financial Markets Department. Their hard work and dedication during a rather challenging year for the department has been exemplary. They continue to make the Reserve Bank and the country proud. I would also like to thank colleagues from other departments within the SARB, many of which are present tonight, who work closely with the Financial Markets Department on a daily basis.  Thank you also to the staff of the Reserve Bank’s Conference Centre for once again arranging this function for us.  Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Øystein Olsen: The conduct of monetary policy Introductory statement by Mr Øystein Olsen, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the hearing before the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs of the Storting (Norwegian parliament), Oslo, 29 May 2012. *      *      * Please note that the text below may differ from the actual presentation. The statement is based on Norges Bank’s Annual Report for 2011, Monetary Policy Report 1/12 and the Executive Board’s assessments in the period to the monetary policy meeting on 10 May. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee and thank you for this opportunity to report on the conduct of monetary policy in connection with the Storting’s deliberations on the Government’s Financial Market Report. My statement here today is based on the Bank’s Annual Report, but also on the Executive Board’s assessments for the period to the most recent monetary policy meeting and new information. Norges Bank’s conduct of monetary policy is oriented towards low and stable inflation. The operational target of monetary policy is consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. At the same time, monetary policy shall contribute to stabilising developments in output and employment.  When I was here last year, the key policy rate had just been raised to 2.25 per cent. Inflation was low at around 1¼ per cent, but there were prospects that growth in advanced economies was recovering and that both capacity utilisation and inflation in Norway would pick up. The key policy rate was kept unchanged at the June meeting, but the interest rate forecast implied a likely interest rate increase after summer. Norges Bank did, however, underline the risk of a possible appreciation of the krone and inflation that might become too low as a result of economic divergences between Norway and other countries. In the course of summer and autumn, international growth prospects worsened considerably. Financial market tensions heightened, and market participants’ key rate expectations were lowered appreciably. Yields on government bonds in countries with weak public finances jumped, while equity prices declined. Money market premiums moved up and banks’ funding costs rose. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The turbulence and weaker growth prospects abroad fed through to the Norwegian economy. At the monetary policy meetings in August, September and October, the Executive Board decided to leave the key policy rate unchanged at 2.25 percent. Around the turn of the year, financial turbulence intensified and the risk of a downturn increased, particularly in Europe. The debt crisis in the euro area made it more difficult and expensive for European banks to procure market funding. Norwegian banks were also affected. With a view to countering the higher premiums in the money market and curbing the effects of weaker developments abroad on the Norwegian economy, the key policy rate was reduced to1.75 percent in December. The situation in international financial markets improved in the course of winter. The krone appreciated. On the other hand, growth in advanced economies was weak and euro area GDP fell towards the end of the year. Central banks abroad announced that the key rates would be kept at a low level for a prolonged period. At the monetary policy meeting in March, Norges Bank underlined that weak growth prospects abroad and the strong krone were keeping inflation at a low level and curbing activity in some sectors. The key rate was reduced to 1.5 percent at that meeting.  Europe is now in a downturn. Many countries are struggling with large deficits and mounting government debt. Structural reforms are being implemented, pension schemes are being tightened and tax systems are under review. At the same time, tighter credit standards and increased capital requirements will limit the supply of bank credit. In addition, a number of countries must restore competitiveness after a period of high cost growth prior to the financial crisis. In the short run, the tightening measures pull down activity and push up unemployment. Central banks in other countries are using strong measures to prop up activity and inflation. As shown in the chart, key rates among many of our trading partners are close to zero and are expected to remain low for a long period. In the US, UK and Japan the central banks have made large-scale government bond purchases in order to push down long-term interest rates. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also stretched itself, for example by providing long-term loans to banks. The ECB operations during winter contributed to boosting liquidity and reducing risk premiums in the European banking system and in the sovereign debt market. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3     Financial market turbulence has flared up again recently, with particular focus on the macroeconomic situation and budget developments in Spain and other countries in southern Europe. The political unrest in Greece and growing fears of a Greek government debt default have curbed risk appetite in the markets. Yields on Italian and Spanish government bond have increased, while US, UK and German government bond yields have fallen to historically low levels. International equity indices have declined, particularly in Europe. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Despite a prolonged downturn abroad and financial market turbulence, activity in the Norwegian economy is remains robust. Capacity utilisation has been close to normal over the past year. GDP for mainland Norway expanded by 2.4 per cent in 2011 according to preliminary figures. Prices for Norwegian export goods are favourable relative to import prices. The oil and construction industries are booming and both employment and the supply of labour are on the rise. Unemployment is low and fairly stable. At the same time, house prices are moving up and household debt is still rising faster than household income. On the other hand, some segments of the export industry are feeling the adverse effects of developments in Europe and a strong krone.  Key policy rate is low because inflation is low and because the downturn abroad and a strong krone are dragging down on growth in some sectors in Norway. Very low interest rates abroad and high premiums in money and credit markets reinforce this picture. There are unusually wide differences between various interest rates, reflecting the high level of money 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  market and credit premiums. Many households are paying up to 4 percent on housing loans and interest rates on corporate loans range between 5 and 6 percent. When setting interest rates, the Bank does not give weight exclusively to bringing inflation back to target. Weight is also given to the effects of the interest rate on output and employment. At the same time, weight is given to the risk that a prolonged period of low interest rates can lead to elevated risk-taking and excessive debt accumulation in the household and business sector. Such imbalances may have spillover effects further ahead, with substantial effects on output and employment.  In the March 2012 Monetary Policy Report, Norges Bank clarified how these considerations are expressed in the Bank’s response pattern. In that connection, the Bank adjusted the criteria to which it gives weight in interest rate forecasting. The key policy rate is set so that inflation is brought back to target. At the same time, inflation targeting is flexible, which means that the path for inflation should be weighed against developments in output and employments. Interest rate setting should also be robust. This means that the interest rate should be set so that monetary policy mitigates the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances.  Normally, the key policy rate cannot achieve several objectives simultaneously. In the case of conflicting objectives, the choice of interest rate path will involve a trade-off between different considerations. If monetary policy only took into account the low level of inflation, the key policy rate would be rapidly reduced and kept close to zero for a good while. Inflation might then pick up faster, partly as a result of a weaker krone. In the light of the trade-off against other considerations, however, the Bank does not want to accelerate the pace of inflation. The result would be a pronounced impact on output and employment and increased risk of a buildup of financial 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  imbalances. A prolonged period of low interest rates may increase the risk that debt and asset prices will be driven up to levels that are unsustainable over time. When weight is also given to the two other criteria, the interest rate path therefore becomes higher even though the level of the key policy rate is low from a historical perspective.  The Norwegian economy is well poised to face new shocks and challenges. While many of our trading partners are struggling with low growth, high unemployment and mounting government debt, the Norwegian economy still features buoyant activity, low unemployment and government budget surpluses. The petroleum industry and oil revenues have given us a solid economic foundation compared with other countries. At the same time, the oil revenues and the high cost level pose certain challenges to the Norwegian economy. With today’s high oil prices, petroleum investment is likely to expand sharply in the years ahead. Petroleum-related industries are faring well. Public sector enterprises are also enjoying a favourable and stable environment. Internationally exposed industries are facing sluggish markets and high costs. Norway’s dual economy is coming into clearer evidence. Petroleum activity influences the Norwegian economy partly through actual production activity and partly through government spending of petroleum revenues. In 2011, petroleum revenue spending over the central government budget was below 5 percent of mainland GDP, while demand from the petroleum sector was about 17 percent.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  High oil prices and investment growth are fuelling demand for labour in the oil sector and the supplier industry. In an economy with close to full employment, this leads to intensified competition for skilled labour. The result is reduced profitability in other internationally exposed industries. The phasing in of a new, profitable industry and increased spending over public budgets have the effect of crowding out other activity. Some decline in other industries is an inevitable consequence of domestic spending of oil revenues. For the economy to be sustainable over a longer horizon, it is important to find an appropriate balance and prevent excessive crowding out of exposed sectors. Monetary policy has little to contribute in this regard, whereas fiscal policy and other economic policy instruments are decisive. Rapid wage growth over many years has led to a high domestic cost level. Measured in a common currency, the cost level in Norway relative to our trading partners is 20 percent higher than the historic average for Norway’s oil age. As a result of the high cost level, internationally exposed industries are vulnerable to weaker international growth, a fall in export prices and a stronger krone. The real value of the krone has increased in recent years, reflecting solid domestic economic growth, high oil prices and relatively weak growth among our trading partners. As long as there are no available resources in the Norwegian economy, increased petroleum revenue spending over the central government budget will push up the real value of the krone or undermine competitiveness. This is likely to continue as long as we plough more oil money into the economy. The petroleum fund mechanism and moderate and predictable petroleum revenue spending over the central government budget will nevertheless make a considerable contribution to stabilising economic developments ahead. By limiting petroleum revenue spending to the real return on the Fund, we can also ensure that future generations share the benefits provided by our petroleum wealth.  House prices are at a historically high level. The rapid growth in household income has been a key factor behind the rise in house prices for some time. In recent years, this tendency has been amplified by high immigration and hence strong population growth. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches   In spite of vigorous building activity, the number of completed dwellings is still low in relation to population growth. This housing gap has developed over several years and is pushing up house prices. A tight labour market and low interest rates are pushing in the same direction. The rise in house prices and the rate of debt accumulation are closely linked. Since the mid-1990s household debt in Norway has risen appreciably faster than income. On average, household debt is now twice as high as disposable income. A rising share of households are facing a debt burden that makes them vulnerable when the interest rate again moves up to a normal level or if economic developments in Norway should take a turn for the worse. In such a situation, many households might find it challenging to service their debt and may reduce household spending. A pronounced fall in household demand will have a negative impact on corporate earnings and enterprises’ capacity to service loans from Norwegian banks. The key policy rate influences a number of variables, including the krone exchange rate, debt and house prices. In its interest rate setting, the Bank seeks to take into account all the key relationships in the economy, those that influence the real economy and inflation. But there is a limit to the tasks that can be given to monetary policy. Monetary policy cannot alone prevent financial imbalances or secure the competitiveness of the Norwegian business sector. The objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation and the Bank only has one instrument – the interest rate. Inflation expectations are now firmly anchored, which means that Norges Bank can give weight to stabilising economic developments in interest rate setting. But monetary policy cannot be overburdened. When assessing the various considerations, monetary policy must pursue its primary objective – low and stable inflation. Other economic objectives must be pursued using policy tools such as financial regulation, the tax system and fiscal policy. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Jens Weidmann: Everything flows? The future role of monetary policy Speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 2012 ZEW Economic Forum, Mannheim, 12 June 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Professor Franz, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to speak to you here today at the ZEW Economic Forum. Professor Franz, thank you very much for the invitation. At first glance, the title may have left a few of you slightly puzzled. “Everything flows? The future role of monetary policy” conjures up a number of associations. The title could be alluding to the massive increase in liquidity as a result of non-standard measures taken by many central banks. Some of you may also have thought of the pre-Socratic philosopher, Heraclitus, who is known for his dictum of constant flow and the passing of all things. “Everything flows” thus also refers to changes in the role and general conditions of monetary policy. Both associations are correct and are inter-connected. The central banks’ contribution to combating the crisis is one of the reasons why the current role of monetary policy is being debated so intensely. This is true across the globe, but especially in the euro area with its specific set-up and the unique situation posed by the sovereign debt crisis. There is no doubt that the crisis has delivered important findings for monetary policy and for monetary union. However, my key message today is to make clear that the paradigms that have been valid to date have by no means suddenly lost their validity. On the contrary, given the challenges that we are facing today, we should not recklessly throw long-held principles overboard and turn our backs on the lessons from the past. Ultimately, monetary union in its current institutional form was created as a result of lessons learned from past errors. And by that, I do not so much mean German hyperinflation at the beginning of the 1920s, as is all too often assumed by foreign observers. Instead I mean the monetary policy experience gained in the 1970s and 1980s with the extremely heterogeneous development of inflation in Europe. Countries with politically independent central banks and a clear primary objective of price stability, such as Germany, had much lower inflation rates than countries in which central banks were obliged to follow politicians’ instructions and were additionally called upon to pursue fiscal and economic policy goals. This is one of the reasons why the Bundesbank, with its culture of stability, was chosen as a founding model for the Eurosystem. An independent central bank is necessary for stable prices, but more than that is needed. Price stability is also jeopardised by unsound public finances. If public finances get out of hand, the central bank can come under overwhelming pressure to jump to fiscal policy’s rescue and, in so doing, can undermine its primary objective of price stability.  This lesson is not just derived from theoretical models, it has been evidenced time and time again in the past. A particularly good example from history is the Latin monetary union comprising Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Greece. Even before the treaty of union came into force, Italy’s debt exploded owing to the war with Austria. On 1 May 1866, the government took out a loan with the Banca Nazionale to finance this debt for which Italy departed from the bimetallic standard and imposed an enforced rate of exchange for its 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches banknotes. This enforced monetary financing of war debts triggered the first severe crisis of the Latin monetary union and fuelled a permanent mistrust between the member states. The recent past – notably the financial crisis – also has important lessons for monetary policy. One example is asymmetrical monetary policy, which provides strong counter-measures when speculative bubbles burst. This can inflate the risks for financial stability. In an environment where market participants can pocket the full return on a risky investment if it is successful but only have to bear part of the costs if it is unsuccessful, risk appetite can take on a harmful dimension for the economy. When considering the future role of monetary policy and its relation to other policy areas, we do not have to go back to the drawing board but can draw on a wealth of experience and economically proven evidence. This we can do, and this we should do. Although the outstanding political significance of the monetary union was – and still is – undisputed, a political project must also be economically sustainable; in the long term, it cannot be enforced against economic conditions. Economic mechanisms, such as the risk of moral hazard, may not be laws of nature; however, they are relevant constraints which politicians cannot ignore forever. Thus, in order to overcome the crisis and to prevent it from happening again, it is essential to apply a coherent approach: the short-term emergency measures and institutional changes must not stand in the way of the long-term stability objective. And the interaction between monetary policy, financial stability measures and fiscal policy must be compatible with the special conditions of monetary union.  This coherence is currently not given. However, I do not see the deficits so much in the area of monetary policy. Its commitment to the primary objective of price stability has proven its worth and must therefore be upheld, especially in view of the increasing efforts for the mandate to be expanded. Nevertheless, a deep rift has developed in the fiscal and economic policy foundation of monetary union. This foundation emphasises member states’ individual national responsibility and sovereignty, which is, however, being increasingly undermined as a result of the progressive communitisation of risks. It is here that I see a need for adjustment and the need for Europe to make a pivotal decision, which can no longer be delayed. It is for this reason that the topics of fiscal union, deeper integration and political union are currently on everyone’s lips. In the following, I will therefore be focusing on the fiscal and economic policy foundation of the euro area in particular. But first, I would like to begin by taking a short look at monetary policy and financial stability policy. 2. Core function of monetary policy in relation to financial stability There is currently no lack of suggestions with regard to adjusting the pre-crisis monetary policy consensus to the supposedly new circumstances. The bottom line of much of the advice directed at central banks is that they should raise their inflation target. Although the benefit of low inflation rates is not being questioned as such, it is suggested that, given that other policy areas have been pushed to their limit, monetary policy, too, ought to contribute to reducing debt and the imbalances in the crisis countries by means of higher inflation rates. To cut a long story short: such an approach is completely unsuitable as a solution of these problems. Besides, the price to pay would be far too high, namely the loss of credibility of monetary policy as the precondition for price stability. Placing confidence in central banks is the solution to the time inconsistency problem of monetary policy, and this confidence is like confidence in general: it takes a great deal of time and effort to build up and from a certain point can be easily squandered. However, it is this confidence that forms the basis for public acceptance of monetary union. Discussions on the benefit of higher inflation targets or expanding the monetary policy mandate – as fruitless as they may be – put this confidence at grave risk.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 The commitment of monetary policy to the primary objective of price stability is a historical achievement and it must not be compromised. Instead, monetary policy must combat future upside inflationary risks with tenacity. The steps necessary to achieve this objective must not be impeded or delayed by other considerations that are irrelevant to monetary policy. This applies also, and especially, with regard to ensuring financial stability. An unstable financial system impairs the transmission of monetary policy and can jeopardise price stability without these dangers being reflected in inflation expectations or measured inflation in good time. But as important as financial stability is, what are the implications for monetary policy? I am convinced that the decisive contribution by monetary policy to financial stability is and remains price stability, whereby a longer-term outlook has become even more important. Monetary policy must look beyond the cycle. It must not succumb to a purely short-term crisis logic and thus create new risks to the stability of prices and the financial system. Conversely, financial stability policy requires its own macro-prudential instruments. Previous unsound developments in individual countries of the monetary union show that these macro-prudential measures must also be applicable at the national level – regardless of their compatibility with Europe as a whole. Central banks will play an important institutional role in this area in future. This means specifically that there will be no renationalisation of monetary policy. Instead, a successful financial stability policy takes the burden off monetary policy, allowing it to focus on maintaining price stability. In view of the extent of the risks and the contagion effects in the crisis, there have been loud calls for integration of financial stability policy in Europe to the point of a common deposit insurance and resolution system as well as a banking union. The question is essentially this: if we are all in the same boat with regard to bearing the burden, would it not be better to jointly monitor the risks and to properly regulate the issue of joint liability in advance? Given the cross-border banking structures and contagion effects, it is essentially a good idea to Europeanise financial supervision, and this is already taking place – two of many examples are the European supervisory authority EBA, which has already taken up its work, and the recent Proposal for a Directive made by the European Commission for designing restructuring and resolution regimes. There is more to a banking union than that, however. The aim is not only a better prevention of crises, but also the ability to cope with crises in fiscal terms, which means money – and not a small amount at that. The degree of Europeanisation of financial stability policy is closely linked to the Europeanisation of fiscal control and intervention rights in this connection, if not inseperable. This is where I see the greatest challenges – for monetary policy and the entire monetary union alike. 3. On the financial and economic foundation of monetary union The crisis has exposed the weaknesses of monetary union. Some member states experienced severe unsound developments in their financial system, their national financial policies or their economic structures – unsound developments, which the institutional framework both failed to prevent and underestimated in terms of their impact. The foundation of monetary policy proved to be too weak. For this reason, the foundation must be strengthened and deepened in order for the euro area to remain a stability union and to regain confidence. This requires clarity as to what the objective of monetary union should be and how to achieve it. Clarity especially in terms of the depth of integration we are aiming at and any transfer of responsibilities from the national to the European level that this entails. We must find a framework that is coherent in itself and that clearly allocates responsibilities. Clarity and confidence require political consensus which must, above all, be borne by the approval of the public and the design of the treaties and constitutions. This is the only way in which a solid foundation can be created, upon which a stability union can then be based. If the foundation 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches is incomplete, brittle or threatens to be undermined, confidence is destroyed. Policies can of course try to mend the cracks in the building or support those parts in danger of collapsing. However, nobody will feel safe inside such a building anymore. In principle, there are two approaches to achieving a stable monetary union. First, the member states could return to the principles stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty and their current constitutions, where emphasis must be put on both sides of individual  responsibility – making their own decisions and bearing the consequences themselves. The guiding principles here are national sovereignty and subsidiarity. Fiscal and economic policy thus remains chiefly a national responsibility, as does the stability of national banking and financial systems. A strict framework and interest rate premiums to be paid on the capital markets ensure that incentives are in place for member states to pursue stability-oriented policies. There is no place in such a scenario for far-reaching joint liability. In this approach, the current framework can also be strengthened by intensifying crisis prevention measures. This comprises, in particular, a macroeconomic surveillance procedure, as is currently envisaged, and tighter restrictions for fiscal policy, including improved monitoring and implementation. The aim of lowering deficit and debt quotas has to leave the page and become a reality. This is the only way that public finances can absorb macroeconomic shocks without endangering a state’s solvency. Furthermore, it is essential to make the financial and banking system significantly more robust in order to limit contagion despite ever closer financial ties. This necessitates further improvements to regulation and financial system supervision, and a much greater resilience to crises. If properly designed, a crisis resolution instrument, such as the ESM, can provide a vital contribution to stabilisation. All in all, I do, however, currently see the danger that joint liability is being extended, with the result that the existing institutional framework is being clearly stretched, but with the possibilities for control and intervention lagging behind. This poses an acute threat to the balance between liability and control. Whereas, for instance, the fiscal compact aims to ensure more stringent prevention measures, the clear wish to forego risk premiums if aid programmes are made use of significantly weakens the incentives for sound public finances. The alternative to a “return to Maastricht” is the transition to a true fiscal union, which is currently the subject of intense debate. This idea is nothing new. This issue was a topic of debate at the Bundesbank long before monetary union was even established, and this issue was again raised during the financial crisis. Allow me to make one preliminary remark before I move on to discuss the individual aspects of a possible fiscal union in greater detail. “Fiscal union” is a difficult term to pin down and can take a number of forms. Provided it is adequately structured, a fiscal union can prove to be the cornerstone of a coherent institutional framework for the monetary union. However, even such an ambitious project as a fiscal union can by no means solve the problems that many countries are facing today: high unemployment and a lack of competitiveness are not going to disappear overnight. The need for adjustment would still exist and given the strong interdependencies, it would probably require an even closer oversight with regard to the macroeconomic imbalances in the member states. Above all, however, the transition to a fiscal union would by no means guarantee a stability union. The crucial point here, in addition to an adequate structure, would be that a common European stability structure be developed and actually implemented. Irrespective of all the changes to the regulatory framework, in a fiscal union, those countries which are experiencing macroeconomic or financial imbalances would consequently have to implement structural reforms to put their public finances in order to get the economy back on its feet. Depending on the form that it takes, a fiscal union could contain substantial transfer components. I am, however, convinced that most of the euro-area public would not accept simply glossing over the structural problems in individual countries by means of transfer payments, especially as it is more likely that the problems would just become further entrenched. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 The focus of the debate has quite legitimately been the issue surrounding joint liability. The idea that the introduction of such a measure alone will be the solution to all the current problems is just as delusional as the belief that the introduction of a single currency is an automatic guarantee for economic prosperity in the individual member states. Such measures may well help to cover up unsound economic developments for somewhat longer, yet the underlying economic issues cannot be rectified in this way. On the contrary, an expansion of joint liability is therefore not the answer to the spectre of reform fatigue in Europe. The disciplining effect on the financial markets would consequently be undermined and the incentive for reform would diminish in countries where there is need for adjustment. This would do away with an important corrective for national economic policy, and would be a severe blow to Europe’s economic outlook in a globalised world and to a stability-oriented monetary policy. Furthermore, the creditworthiness of the countries providing assistance would also be put at risk. In addition, political acceptance would be lost in these countries as a result of perceived excessive demands and excessive advantages. The monetary union would consequently lose its anchor and thus its basis for any kind of stability. These medium-term risks must not be brushed aside in favour of a short-term easing of the acute and fragile economic situation. Joint liability can therefore only be introduced at the end of the integration process of a fiscal union and not at the beginning. Rather, it must also succeed, especially in a fiscal union, in maintaining and strengthening the incentives for necessary economic reforms and fiscal consolidation. And this can also succeed if, as I have already mentioned, liability and control are brought back into line and a fiscal union is structured in a manner than is compatible with stability. Not surprisingly, it is precisely in those countries which face acute financing problems and a severe loss of confidence in their own fiscal policies that the cries for joint liability are the loudest and the most emphatic. The support we are seeing from the European institutions, which, by their very nature, advocate greater centralisation at the European level, is just as understandable. It is, however, worth noting that the advocates of joint liability are often in those countries which are the most opposed to surrendering their national sovereignty with regard to financial policy decisions. It is clear that joint liability holds the promise delivering benefits and extending a country’s scope for action, whereas fiscal union could restrict the scope for action at the national level. As understandable as such a stance may be, a stable union cannot be founded on this basis. My impression is that Germany is much more open with regard to the issue of surrendering national sovereignty than many partner countries. In order to establish a stability-oriented fiscal union, it is my firm belief that it is imperative for the euro-area countries to summon up two things  First, the willingness to submit themselves in a binding manner to strict budgetary rules.  Second, the willingness to hand over sovereignty in some areas to a central level that effectively monitors compliance with the rules and, above all, can enforce them. Consequently, although not necessary, it would be acceptable to bear risks to a certain extent jointly. In this context, the sequence in which the steps are taken is crucial. If we were to reverse the order, there would be a risk – if not, in fact, a strong probability – of the second step never being taken or, at least, not being taken properly. But how might a stability-oriented fiscal union be structured? There are, of course, a large number of options for this, all depending on how far competencies are shifted to the European level, revenue and spending powers are centralised and transfer elements are extended. I wish to assume the status quo; in other words, as much subsidiarity as possible in the form of national fiscal responsibility and the fiscal objectives, as set out, for example, in 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches the Stability and Growth Pact and in the fiscal compact. And it is on this basis that I would like to outline a number of minimum requirements for a stability-oriented fiscal union. This minimal approach has the advantage that it allows a broader range of economic policy cultures in the member states, since the further integration advances, the less room there will be for differences in the concept of statehood, the social security systems or pay negotiation structures. Let us not be under any illusions: there still exist major differences in that respect, even between Germany and France. In Germany, government spending is 46% of nominal GDP, whereas the figure for France is 56%. And while Germany has responded to the demographic challenges with a phased increase of the retirement age to 67, a recent increase in the retirement age from 60 to 62 in France is to be reversed again in some cases. The core element of such a fiscal union which is limited to the absolute essentials consists in strict and effective budgetary rules that set a binding ceiling on national borrowing. Given experience of the past few years, this would not be monitored by the European Commission or the Ecofin Council, but ideally by a new, independent euro-area institution. In the event of a country not abiding by the budgetary rules, national sovereignty would be automatically transferred to the European level on a scale that can ensure compliance with the objectives. In a speech at the Petersen Institute, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former President of the ECB, described this aptly as “federalism by exception”. One option, for example, could be the right to make tax increases or proportional cuts in expenditure – and not just the possibility of calling for them. In effect, national sovereignty would be largely retained and fiscal policy decision-making capabilities and room for manoeuvre would be preserved as long as a country in question complies with the limits on borrowing and debt. In that kind of framework, consolidation paths would be safeguarded at the European level even if no majorities were to be found in the relevant national parliament. Along with the credible establishment of such a framework which reliably safeguards compliance with the fiscal rules, a joint liability of the euro-area member states could be introduced, say, by issuing jointly guaranteed or partially guaranteed bonds or by a bank union that comprises key elements of a joint liability. A stringent fiscal union on these lines is fundamentally suited to placing monetary union on a strong, enduring foundation. As time goes on, this union also has to be lived as a stability union. Before arriving at the goal, however, two obstacles, to which I alluded earlier, have to be overcome. First, a fiscal union has to be equipped with comprehensive democratic legitimacy. It is a matter of a quantum leap. European integration would be noticeably extended, and national sovereignty and self-determination would be handed over. What is crucial for this to happen is democratic legitimacy given by a clear manifestation of the will of the general public in all of the affected member states. This is the only way to create the confidence that the new framework has popular acceptance and backing and will therefore endure. The second obstacle, which is linked to the first one, is the far-reaching amendment of the European treaties and national constitutions. This is necessary because fiscal union is not envisaged or is expressly forbidden in the existing legal framework. The aim of the amendments is to create a reliable and stable structure that cannot simply be changed yet again in the short term. An established and respected legal framework is a key precondition for the stronger integration of very different nations. This process requires a certain amount of time, but is indispensable. This is because a fiscal union which lacks transparency, which is introduced by circumventing existing regulations and standards, or which is left to the whims of everyday politics would be built on sand and not be a sustainable basis for a stability union. Democratic legitimacy based on broad public support and amendments to the legal framework are closely linked. While joint liability, for example, is irreversible, changes to the EU fiscal rules might be put up for negotiation at any time. Examples of this are the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 experiences in dealing with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact as well as the concrete design of the fiscal compact, which has fallen short of the goals that were originally set. Above all, Germany will have a perceptible stability contribution to make given a further step in integration. The recent past has shown, however, that, in monetary union, Germany’s interests are protected by existing treaties and a German veto. From a German perspective, it is therefore crucial that there is a consensus in adopting the cornerstones of a stability-oriented fiscal union and that, once they are agreed, they are secured in such a way that they endure and cannot be changed yet again by majority decision. By outlining these caveats, I am by no means arguing against deeper integration, quite the opposite. But just as the existing decentralised framework of the euro area has had its shortcomings, deeper integration by itself is not a guarantee of a stable monetary union – especially not if you take the second step before the first. A stable monetary union does not depend on the “United States of Europe”, but without a stable currency and a matching fiscal framework there will be no permanent stable political union. 4. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen I have covered a broad range of topics in the past half-hour. The role of monetary policy is changing, but it is far removed from having to change fundamentally. It is more the case that it has to resist stronger encroachment – the guiding principle is “course correction, not going into reverse”. The fiscal and economic policy framework of monetary union requires far more amendments. Europe is faced with a pivotal decision on how a stability union is to be preserved, and has to engage in a public debate on precisely the politically unpleasant questions. As in monetary policy, responsible action also means heeding the lessons of the past and not repeating earlier mistakes – especially in times of upheaval. This message may appear simple, perhaps even dull. I nevertheless find it helpful and important. If everything flows, as in the current situation, you should not simply let yourself be carried along by events. It is precisely in times like these that it becomes even clearer what gives support and what has permanent value. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Yaseen Anwar: Managing Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) Speech by Mr Yaseen Anwar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the second meeting of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group for Asia, Kuala Lumpur, 14 May 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Good evening. It is indeed a pleasure to be here in Kuala Lumpur again, and I am grateful to Governor Zeti for inviting me as a lead discussant on one of the key challenges of regulatory reform agenda – “Managing Systemically Important Financial Institutions”. In these few minutes, I will cover the need for specific regulations for SIFIs, progress made so far in designing the policy framework, perspectives of emerging markets in general and Pakistan in particular, regulatory challenges faced by supervisory authorities, and what remains to be done.  In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) 2007–08, the entire supervisory perspective towards financial institutions regulation has taken a U-turn. In the pre crisis era, supervisory authorities, mainly in advanced countries, chose to rely on market discipline and favored somewhat self regulation by the financial industry. The approach stemmed from the perception that financial institutions are in the best position to understand the market and risk associated with financial products. Overly prescriptive regulations were thought to stifle innovation and diversification – both across borders and across activities. The prevailing version of international accord on capital and liquidity standards, Basel II, further reinforced this practice. Most frameworks relied on banks’ own assessment of risks. However the GFC, particularly the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008, triggered problems throughout the financial system across the world and changed supervisory perspective towards financial industry regulations, particularly the so called “Systemically Important Financial institutions (SIFIS1)”. The Lehman bankruptcy with ensuing financial instability and loss of real output brought forth several shortcomings of the international financial architecture that exposed risks resulting from a lack of a policy framework for dealing with SIFIs. In the pre-GFC era it was precisely these institutions that were deemed quite invincible. However, the huge costs of implicit government guarantees of not letting a SIFI to fail and their adverse impact on global financial stability, raised serious concerns on “Too Big to fail” (TBTF) status of SIFIs. Post crisis era witnesses increased discussion on changing TBTF status of SIFIs and for devising a resolution regime as well as safe exit mechanisms for these entities. Resultantly, immediately after the Lehman failure, we saw international financial authorities placing financial sector reforms as their top priority agenda.  Over the last few years, we have seen increased realization among financial authorities that diversification may be beneficial for a large bank against idiosyncratic risk, but similar patterns of diversification by many global banks across the world had actually contributed towards building up of systemic risk. Further, it has also been recognized that the prevailing regulatory framework and polices are not sufficient to address the “negative externalities” that large financial firms create. Supervisory authorities have arrived at a consensus that                                                 1 SIFI DEFINITION: An institution, market or instrument is considered systemically important if its failure or malfunction causes widespread distress, either as a direct impact or as a trigger for broader contagion. The interpretation, however, is nuanced in that some authorities focus on the impact on the financial system, while others consider the ultimate impact on the real economy as key (Financial Stability Board (2009)). Negative externalities are associated with institutions as they are perceived not being allowed to fail due to their size, interconnectedness, complexity key criterion to identify SIFIs. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Box 1: SIFIs can be identified either using model based approaches such as contribution, participation and bottom up approach or using a set of simple indicators such as bank size, interbank lending, interbank borrowing. A BIS article “Systemic Importance: Some Simple Indicators (2011)” empirically tested and found that simple indicators are reliable proxies for model-based measures of systemic importance. Alternatively FSB has proposed three key indicators for identifying SIFIs. These are size, interconnectedness and complexity. Whereas the five indicators used for designating Global-SIFIs by FSB are: size, interconnectedness, complexity, and substitutability and cross jurisdiction activity.  SIFIs require enhanced supervisory focus on account of their relative size, interconnectedness with market(s) and complexity. To reduce the probability of failure of such institution and minimize the risk to financial stability and the real economy, it is imperative to strengthen the regulatory framework and enhance supervisory capacity for dealing with SIFIs. Before expressing my views on the regulatory framework for SIFIs, I would like to appreciate the commendable work done and progress made by the FSB, BCBS and other multilateral agencies on the financial reforms agenda over the last few years. Enhanced international accord on capital and liquidity standards; i.e. BASEL III, has set forth the most critical reforms agenda for improving the solvency and resilience of financial institutions. A number of other policy measures supplement Basel III, which among others, included framework for dealing with global SIFIs (G-SIFIs). Starting from initial “Guidance to Assess the Systemic Importance of Financial Institutions, Markets and Instruments: Initial Considerations” issued in November, 2009 jointly by the IMF, FSB and BIS, substantial progress has been made in tackling the SIFIs challenge. A key development took place in November, 2011, when G-20 leaders at the Cannes Summit endorsed the policy framework on systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs). A multipronged strategy was adopted for addressing the G-SIFIs comprising of a new international standard for resolution regimes, more intensive and effective supervision, and requirements for cross-border cooperation and recovery and resolution planning.  One of the key issues concerning the SIFIs is their identification. The method used for identification of SIFIs varies widely – from complex models to simple indicators (see Box 1 for discussion on methods to identify SIFIs). To facilitate the process, FSB and BCBS have been assigned to determine the G-SIFIs to which the resolution planning and additional loss absorption requirements will apply based on the methodology developed by the BCBS. Accordingly, FSB and BCBS have identified 29 systemically important banks on a global level2 out of a sample of 73 banks. These include 25 banks in the USA and Western European block, 3 in Japan and 1 in China. FSB will update the above list annually based on its assessment which will be publically disclosed.  To address the greater risk posed by the G-SIFIs, intensive regulatory approach is being prescribed for them. They are required to meet the additional loss absorbency requirements ranging from 1% to 2.5% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). These requirements will be applicable in phases starting January 2016 with full implementation by January 2019. As per FSB and BCBS assessment, long term economic benefits in terms of greater resilience of these institutions from additional loss absorbency requirements far exceed the modest temporary decline of GDP over the implementation horizon. Another positive development on this front is that some of the countries, notably Switzerland, United Kingdom and Sweden have already taken action to implement higher capital requirements for banks that are deemed systemically important at the national level. Recently, Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in the USA proposed guidance on the                                                 2 See Annexure 1 for a list of G-SIFIs by FSB

Some jurisdictions have already adopted legislation to improve their resolution regimes like Germany, where supervisory powers have been significantly extended to restructure and resolve banks. On the other hand, many institutions have actively lobbied against being identified as a SIFI, because of the additional and significant regulatory requirements that SIFIs will endure. Emerging markets Emerging economies financial systems remained fairly resilient in the face of recent crisis. It was possible firstly because financial systems in emerging economies have primarily domestically active FIs. This argument can be supported by the fact that out of 29 designated G-SIFIs3 only one bank from Asia; “the Bank of China” could make it on the list. Secondly, financial systems in emerging economies remain relatively conservative – activities are mainly centered on more traditional banking businesses while capital markets and other financial institutions remain relatively underdeveloped. The difference between financial structures and business models of developed and emerging economies have raised concerns regarding relevance of the reforms – which mainly addresses causes of GFC – for emerging economies. Moreover, since the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, financial authorities have not only carried out extensive reforms but are very keen in continuously monitoring and adapting to the changing market conditions. Nonetheless, it is a common understanding that supervisory authorities around the world need to give special attention to SIFIs by focusing on the development of specific, relevant and appropriate regulatory standards. In this regard, Asian economies are quite well aware of the issues involving implementation of such a framework. Firstly, emerging Asia is now at the center of global economic growth. To sustain such growth, the need for financial intermediation is also likely to increase. While there is a global consensus on the use of public funds for resolution of SIFIs as a last resort, there can also be circumstances in which use of public funds may be less costly to the economy than excessively “taxing” of the banking system. Asian economies must weigh the cost of new regulations on institutions, against the perceived benefits that those regulations have for the economy and society. Secondly, international standards must be customized according to Asian economies business models. The regulatory and supervisory regime must target well-defined risks that could have systemic implications.  Pakistan’s perspective on SIFIs Pakistan is a small, open economy, with domestically an active financial sector. In terms of banking concentration, top 5 banks (all locally incorporated) account for 51% of industry assets; while foreign assets of the system are 10.4% of total assets. Moreover locally-incorporated banks and most foreign branches don’t have significant exposures to the complex financial assets that caused financial meltdown in the U.S. and Europe. Apart from the conservative financial structure, i.e. less risky assets on banks’ balance sheets, SBP has always required banks to meet higher capital and liquidity standards, exceeding international norms in several areas. More importantly, we have a strong legal framework, which has been tested for effectiveness during the last decade and a half. SBP has successfully restructured a number of banks successfully demonstrating the problem bank resolution regime.

The supervisory framework includes quarterly reviews of individual banks for off-site surveillance, periodical and special on-site inspections and regular interactions with banks’ aimed at reducing the probability of failure of these institutions. The multi-pronged strategy has proved quite effective so far. SBP has ensured that adequate safeguards are in place to limit the direct impact of externals shocks. Not surprisingly, Pakistan’s financial system withstood the global financial crisis reasonably well. SBP is vigilant towards the changing market dynamics, both locally and abroad, and is already in the process of reviewing Pakistan’s banking industry vis-a-vis Basel III capital and liquidity standards. Regarding dealing with SIFIs, high-frequent monitoring and more in-depth supervision are our main tools for dealing with large banks, which are essentially the so-called SIFIs for us. However, we are looking forward to the development of a framework to identify and deal with domestic SIFIs (D-SIFIs) by FBS, BIS, and IMF. Till such time the framework for global SIFIs may be a useful starting point for countries like ours for dealing with domestic SIFIs. In view of that, we have already initiated an assessment process. Recently, we have conducted an in-house study based on simple indicators approach to assess possibility of domestic SIFIs in Pakistan; our initial assessment suggests that banks with the largest market share in terms of assets – are the most systemically important banks. These findings endorse the earlier held belief regarding the significance of asset size in Pakistan’s banking industry. Regulatory challenges There are multiple challenges faced by regulatory authorities to design and implement the framework for SIFIs identification, implementation and cross border resolution – to accelerate reforms of domestic resolution regimes and tools and of frameworks for cross-border enforcement of resolution actions. One of the major issues highlighted by the crisis has been gaps in the legal framework for dealing with failing financial institutions. Though capital buffers will help build up the resilience, however, it cannot avoid failures. Therefore gaps in legal frameworks must be addressed so that SIFIs, too, must be able to exit the market in an orderly manner without exposing taxpayers to the risk of loss. Emerging economies need to be cautious while adopting the regulatory framework being proposed for SIFIs. A detailed assessment on the possible legal, regulatory and economic implications is imperative before adopting and customizing the SIFI regulatory framework to one’s own financial structure. An important challenge for regulators is to develop a framework that allows financial sector to grow, innovate, and support the needs of the economy, without compromising on the stability of the financial system.  Nonetheless, an effective framework for dealing with SIFIs would include a combination of stronger market discipline; capital buffers; comprehensive recovery and resolution arrangements; and a strengthened market infrastructure to reduce probability of failure. Going forward In the near future we expect to see further developments in the areas of managing SIFIs, particularly the D-SIFIs. As highlighted above, FSB is already working with the Basel Committee for extending the framework to D-SIFIs. The selection criteria is expected to resemble that for the G-SIFIs, with institutions placed in different “buckets” according to their size, interconnectedness, and lack of substitutability. Once the framework is introduced in November this year, we expect to have detailed deliberation on implementation of the new framework in emerging and developing economies. Development of a resolution regime will remain a key element of the D-SIFIs framework, making sure that the critical functions of these financial institutions continue in the event of failure. Given that it will involve legislative processes, the move towards development of a 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  resolution regime may be somewhat slow. Therefore, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDE), taking lead from the proposed framework for G-SIFIs, need to start work on the development of a resolution regime now rather than wait for a final D-SIFIs framework.  Another important issue for the emerging market economies from a stability perspective is on account of the presence of foreign financial institutions. The regulators of emerging markets may not be fully equipped to understand the risk profile of a globally active institution operating in their countries. Risks also arise due to financial interlinkages between emerging and foreign financial markets. For the host emerging economy, an important issue is possible market disruption through an adverse impact on local lending decisions and depositors safeguard as a result of problems at the parent institution level. Regulatory colleges should therefore be encouraged by the home regulators across the regions. The practice of conducting regulatory colleges for systemically important institutions would assist regulators in dealing with the global issues in a coordinated manner.  I would like to point out that regulation and monitoring of SIFIs is just one of the aspects in overall macro-prudential regulations. In order to implement a complete reform agenda, SIFIs framework needs to be dovetailed with other initiatives of financial stability. These may include an elaborate crisis management framework, work on countercyclical measures, framework for effective resolution of problem institutions, legal cover for enforcement etc. Increased coordination among authorities both at top level as well as operational level is critical for successful implementation of a global financial agenda. For the purpose, there is a need to establish working committees under the Regional Consultative Group terms of reference. I therefore propose the establishment of working level committees to be involved in the development of policy level documents on financial stability related issues from the EMDEs perspective.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Peter Praet: Heterogeneity in a monetary union: What have we learned? Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 14th ECB and its Watchers Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 15 June 2012. *      *      * I would like to thank Maarten Dossche and Arthur Saint-Guilhem for their contribution to the preparation of this speech. It is a great pleasure to be speaking here today at what has, over the years, become a prime opportunity for the European Central Bank to exchange views with ECB watchers on the challenges faced by monetary policy in the euro area. My remarks today will focus on the question of how imbalances in terms of competitiveness and private and public sector debt have gradually led to a worrying degree of heterogeneity in the euro area. I will also highlight the effects of the ECB’s liquidity-providing operations, arguing that these contribute to more homogeneous financial conditions across the euro area and allow a smoother adjustment process during the transitional period needed in order to reabsorb accumulated imbalances. I will, however, also argue that these operations can only be regarded as temporary support, as the underlying structural problems and weaknesses require a truly structural response completing the overall architecture of EMU. When the euro was first introduced, many critics claimed that EMU would not work because euro area countries’ business cycles and economic structures were not sufficiently similar. But does economic integration really need to imply economic uniformity? I do not think so. This can clearly be seen in the United States. Regional economies are hit by different economic shocks and perform differently owing to their differing economic structures, even over extended periods. At the same time, institutional safeguards are required in order to ensure that heterogeneous developments do not become self-reinforcing and pose a threat to overall macroeconomic stability. Here in the euro area, we have to acknowledge that economic conditions have, today, become increasingly heterogeneous. But let me state very clearly up front that this does not imply that a common currency cannot succeed in the euro area. To my mind, this means that we need to address the institutional shortcomings and weaknesses of EMU in order to allow the euro area to cope with heterogeneous economic developments and large asymmetric shocks, as is the case in the United States. There, too, economic and monetary union did not occur overnight; it was a long process. Otmar Issing1 argued, more than a decade ago, that “one size must fit all”. Provided that institutions adapt, EMU should be beneficial for all. Since the introduction of the euro, many of us have been aware of institutional deficiencies, both in terms of the prevention of imbalances and as regards the management of such imbalances in the event of a crisis. The crisis is now forcing us to address these deficiencies.  Allow me, in the remainder of my remarks, to look at how and why imbalances arose in the euro area and how the ECB’s monetary policy responded to them.                                                  1 Issing, O., “The single monetary policy of the European Central Bank: One size fits all”, International Finance, 4:3, 2001, pp. 441–462. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  How and why did imbalances arise in the euro area? Financial uniformity with increasing imbalances The situation prior to the financial crisis is best described as one in which euro area countries achieved a very high degree of convergence in terms of financial conditions, while at the same time large macroeconomic and financial imbalances were gradually accumulating. With the advent of the euro, there was significant convergence in terms of the financial conditions in the various euro area countries. Euro area banks were able to trade with one another in a unified money market. Consequently, there was also significant convergence in terms of the interest rates that banks charged households and firms. Indeed, these are necessary conditions for a single monetary policy that affects all economic agents in the same way. However, the sovereign bonds of the various euro area countries were also priced at rates that were very similar, with those rates bearing little relation to the fiscal and macroeconomic fundamentals of the individual countries. With the benefit of hindsight, this is a puzzling outcome. Clearly, a single monetary policy should imply a single money market interest rate, as well as a single long-term risk-free interest rate. And with inflation expectations converging across the euro area, sovereign bond yields could be expected to become less dispersed. However, despite the single monetary policy, differences in the default risk of individual countries, consumers and firms remained. But financial markets were less wary of such risks, thereby establishing improper incentives for public and private sector borrowers. One simple summary indicator of the degree of economic heterogeneity is cross-country inflation differentials. These reflect differences between countries in terms of the business cycle, productivity growth and the functioning of labour and product markets. They also affect countries’ real interest rates, as well as the international price competitiveness of their goods and services. Monetary union resulted in inflation differentials in the euro area falling to a level comparable to the United States. However, although the two had inflation differentials of a similar size, the persistence of those seen in the euro area remained much greater, pointing to the possible existence of macroeconomic imbalances. As a result, since the introduction of the euro, the persistent inflation differentials in the euro area gave rise to a divergence of relative prices that is twice as large as the one observed in the United States. (Slide 2) The main driver of those persistent inflation differentials is related to the cross-country differences observed since the introduction of the euro in the implementation of structural reforms and has little to do with real convergence or so-called “Balassa-Samuelson effects”. In some euro area countries, governments failed to implement the necessary reforms in their product and labour markets. Consequently, wage growth exceeded productivity growth and prices rose faster than in other countries. (Slide 3) These inflation differentials led to divergent developments in international competitiveness and contributed to the accumulation of unprecedented current account positions in the euro area. (Slide 4) In a number of countries, this all led to economic activity gradually shifting away from the more export-oriented manufacturing industry towards the more domestically oriented construction sector. Because sectoral reallocation is typically a slow process, it is very difficult to now readjust those countries’ economies quickly in response to the crisis. In addition, in most countries there is a high degree of downward wage rigidity, which is a further impediment to rapid adjustment. Accumulation of private and public sector debt in some countries Moreover, the persistently higher inflation rates in some countries implied persistently lower real interest rates, particularly in light of the high degree of convergence in terms of nominal lending rates. Countries with lower real interest rates experienced stronger credit growth and housing booms, which placed further pressure on wages and prices. (Slide 5) Lower real 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  interest rates also meant that it was easier for governments to borrow, slowing down fiscal consolidation. Governments did not adopt sufficiently counter-cyclical policies to limit their own accumulation of debt or to counteract the accumulation of debt in the private sector. In fact, because those economic booms were based on stronger domestic consumption and rising property prices, they led to improvements in cyclical fiscal balances as long as the boom went on, so that governments had few incentives to tighten fiscal policy before the bust set in.2 The accumulation of imbalances was exacerbated by institutional deficiencies The question naturally arises as to why this unsustainable degree of heterogeneity occurred in the euro area and not the United States. In the United States, regional imbalances tend to be more mean-reverting, owing to higher levels of labour mobility and more flexible product and labour markets. At the same time, there is also less scope for unsustainable accumulation of debt at state level. Most states have adopted legislation that prevents them from accumulating the levels of debt seen in the euro area.3 The institutional design of the euro area has clearly given rise to moral hazard and lacked the capacity to credibly engage in measures to prevent rising imbalances.4 Although there was an unseen accumulation of debt in some euro area countries, financial markets were allowed to set financial conditions in such a way that private and public sector borrowers in those countries could essentially continue to borrow at the same interest rates as borrowers in countries with much sounder fiscal and macroeconomic fundamentals. As a result, financial flows ran from countries with strong productivity growth to countries with weak productivity growth, fuelling a persistent economic boom based on the accumulation of debt. To be efficient, financial flows should instead have run towards countries with higher levels of productivity growth.  Heterogeneity during the crisis and the ECB’s response The financial crisis has led to a strong increase in heterogeneity within the euro area. The re-emergence of cross-country differentials in terms of financial conditions has contributed to divergence in macroeconomic and financial fundamentals. Conversely, these heterogeneous financial conditions mainly reflect persistent fiscal, macroeconomic and financial imbalances, as well as persistent structural problems in several countries.  The first dimension of heterogeneity concerns real developments. Some countries have recovered well while others continue to be affected by persistent structural problems. But some of the macroeconomic imbalances have begun to adjust. Competitiveness has improved in countries where labour costs used to persistently exceed the euro area average. That being said, such adjustment has remained too limited. Sizeable imbalances persist, particularly high levels of public and private sector debt and vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Looking ahead, it is of the essence that government policies decisively address these various fiscal, financial and structural impediments to growth.  This brings me to the second – and most evident – dimension of heterogeneity, namely the sharp divergence observed in financial conditions in euro area countries. In the course of the crisis, secured and unsecured money markets have become increasingly impaired,                                                 2 See, for instance, Bénétrix, A. and Lane, P., Fiscal cyclicality and EMU, Trinity College Dublin, mimeo, 2012. 3 See, for instance, Henning, R. and Kessler, M., “Fiscal federalism: US history for architects of Europe’s fiscal union”, Bruegel Essay and Lecture Series, 2012. 4 See, for instance, Persson, T. and Tabellini, G., “Federal fiscal constitutions: risk sharing and moral hazard”, Econometrica, 64, 1996, pp. 623–646. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  especially across national borders. Countries’ sovereign bond yields have diverged significantly. Corporate bond markets have also experienced tensions. Overall, there is ample evidence that country-specific factors have become more important in driving yields.  The emergence of fragmented financial markets within the euro area began in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ default and intensified following the onset of the sovereign debt crisis in May 2010. Financial integration came to a halt and was partly reversed, as can be seen from the fact that non-bank debt securities were increasingly purchased domestically, with non-domestic euro area holders selling these bonds. (Slide 6) Euro area countries’ financial sectors retreated within national borders. As a result of those fragmented financial conditions, the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy stance to interest rates was increasingly impaired. Moreover, banks in countries in which government finances were under strain faced restricted access to the money market and other sources of financing, given the interconnectedness between banks and sovereign states. Had this been allowed to continue, these funding restrictions would probably have hampered growth in credit to households and non-financial corporations. This, combined with deleveraging needs, could have resulted in a “credit crunch” in several parts of the euro area, with negative consequences for the economy and price stability in the euro area. In reacting to this exceptional degree of heterogeneity, the ECB’s monetary policy continued to be guided by its objective of ensuring price stability for the euro area as a whole. Key ECB interest rates were reduced significantly. In addition, non-standard measures were adopted in order to support the functioning of the transmission mechanism by bringing back liquidity to dysfunctional markets. For instance, in light of the constraints in funding markets for banks, the maturities of longer-term refinancing operations were successively extended, culminating in the three-year operations conducted in December 2011 and February 2012. Following these operations, funding constraints have eased, with money market spreads declining. (Slides 7 and 8) Moreover, the already broad collateral framework has been extended further, with corresponding risk control measures to mitigate the Eurosystem’s exposure to risk. This has made it easier for collateral-constrained banks to continue to participate in refinancing operations.  Overall, banks’ recourse to refinancing operations has been particularly strong in those countries that have been worst affected by the crisis. While open to all, the ECB’s non-standard measures have been used most intensively in countries facing financial stress. Cross-country differences in the use of non-standard measures have thus largely reflected heterogeneity in financial conditions across the euro area. Our policy measures have helped to reduce heterogeneity in financial conditions thereby ensuring a smoother transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. The extent of the heterogeneity in banks’ financing needs can also be inferred from national central banks’ balances in TARGET2. These balances reflect the national central banks’ net claims or liabilities resulting from commercial banks’ cross-border payments in TARGET2. The increasing net liabilities of some national central banks are a reflection mainly of funding stress in their individual banking systems, with financial outflows being compensated for by increased recourse to Eurosystem refinancing operations. (Slide 9)  Our policy measures have, in particular, increased the ECB’s intermediation between banks. Looking at the interbank market, reduced willingness to lend, especially across borders, has hampered the distribution of liquidity to those banks that are most in need of it, particularly banks in countries facing financial stress. Increases in deposits held with the Eurosystem by banks in financially strong countries can be seen as an indication of the degree of disintermediation in the money market. (Slide 10) Banks in such countries tend to be recipients of cross-border payment flows and therefore need less central bank liquidity than banks in countries facing financial stress.  The surplus of central bank liquidity in banks in financially stronger countries has raised concerns that such liquidity could fuel asset price bubbles in parts of the euro area, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  potentially posing a threat to price stability. These concerns are not warranted at the current juncture. Thus far, only a moderate recovery has been seen in asset prices. As regards the housing market, developments in money and credit – traditionally good leading indicators of booms in house prices – have remained subdued. However, we will continue to pay close attention to such developments.  Conclusion To sum up, the measures adopted by the ECB have contributed to greater homogeneity in the pass-through of policy rates to the economy, with a view to maintaining price stability. However, monetary policy cannot provide a lasting solution to the underlying problems causing this persistent heterogeneity. While the ECB can help to ensure a smooth adjustment process and offer temporary relief, this cannot replace the necessary structural adjustment. Instead, governments need to act in a variety of policy areas – particularly as regards fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and financial stability – within a reinforced governance framework at the European level. This is the only way that we can put the euro area back on a sustainable growth path.  The crisis has highlighted several shortcomings in the institutional framework of EMU, and these need to be addressed. This framework failed to ensure sound fiscal discipline in all euro area countries, as well as to prevent or correct the accumulation of financial and competitiveness imbalances. Crisis management and financial sector repair – such as the rescue and resolution of financial institutions – were left to national authorities, despite considerable cross-border activity in the financial sector. We saw only too clearly that the interconnectedness of banks and sovereign states can lead to adverse feedback loops between sovereign and bank financial conditions, with significant consequences for the macroeconomic stability of the euro area as a whole.  Several steps have already been taken with a view to enhancing the governance framework for EMU and improving the prevention and correction of fiscal, macroeconomic and competitiveness imbalances. At the same time, an overhaul of the framework for financial supervision and regulation has been initiated. Finally, firewalls and crisis management instruments have been established in order to further safeguard financial stability, particularly by addressing the risk of contagion across countries and financial market segments.  Looking ahead, further steps will need to be taken in order to supplement the single monetary policy with a more integrated framework for bank supervision, resolution and deposit insurance, as well as far more extensive coordination of government policies affecting competitiveness. As the President said this morning, if we are to achieve this, euro area countries will inevitably need to surrender more national sovereignty and increase their coordination of national policies. The global economy is becoming increasingly integrated. The importance of national sovereignty has been waning as a result of increasing economic interdependence at the global level. It is an illusion to think that, in an integrated world, countries will be able to decouple themselves from developments in other countries.  Thank you for your attention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Miguel Fernández Ordóñez: Presentation of the 2011 Annual Report Address by Mr Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, Governor of the Bank of Spain, to the Governing Council of the Bank of Spain on the presentation of the 2011 Annual Report, Madrid, 8 June 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, The presentation of the Annual Report for 2011 is taking place in an extremely difficult setting for Europe in general, and for Spain in particular, marked by the acute euro area sovereign debt crisis and the double-dip recession in the Spanish economy.  The year 2011 was characterised by the worsening of the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Initially affecting a small number of countries in a situation of relative vulnerability, it spread to others with sounder economic fundamentals, duly turning systemic. The fresh downturn in the euro zone not only detracted from the area’s recovery but was also one of the main determinants of the halt in the ongoing pick-up in world growth begun a year earlier.  Two main factors lay behind the crisis. First, the insufficient adaptation of domestic economic policies to the demands of monetary union membership, which translated into a build-up of major imbalances that placed some economies in a position of vulnerability. And second, the lack of political consensus at the European level to tackle the weaknesses of the euro’s institutional design, which largely explains the spread of the tensions to countries whose misalignments were on a lesser scale.  Throughout 2011 and in 2012 to date, positive steps have been taken. Several countries have launched ambitious fiscal adjustment programmes and undertaken banking system recapitalisation and restructuring processes. And structural reforms in the labour market and in the services sectors have been approved. Also, on a Europe-wide scale, debt-ceiling monitoring mechanisms have been reinforced, as have the procedures to sanction non-compliance. Further, under the new Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, there have been moves to promote the explicit recognition of the commitment to budgetary stability in national legislations. Along with this progress in the fiscal realm, a new framework has been established to prevent and correct macroeconomic imbalances. This Excessive Imbalance Procedure, as it is known, should be instrumental in the early detection of vulnerability and in setting in place the necessary corrective measures. With the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, there has likewise been headway in creating a permanent crisis-management mechanism.  In sum, there has been significant progress. But frequently these changes have, as the markets say, been “behind the curve”; their implementation has been excessively slow and they have been subject to too many frictions, which has fuelled investor doubts over the ability of European governments to move forward and forge consensus on matters pivotal for governance in the area.  Under these conditions, ECB action has been decisive in preserving stability in the area. When debt market tensions reared again in the second half of 2011, the ECB reacted with various measures. These were geared to confirming the expansionary stance of monetary policy, to restoring the functioning of its transmission mechanism and to breaking the feedback loop between banking system risks and sovereign risk. In addition, significant non-conventional measures were approved. These included most notably the lengthening of the horizon for liquidity loans to a term of three years, in two special auctions held in December 2011 and February 2012.  The three-pronged measures adopted – spanning domestic economic policies, European governance reform and, most notably, ECB action – proved essential in containing the heightening tensions, which might have led to a systemic crisis of unforeseeable 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches consequences. That said, these measures were not a conclusive solution; they simply helped gain valuable time so that governments could continue moving to resolve the challenges outstanding and so that the measures adopted might begin to bear fruit.  To definitively resolve the European sovereign crisis will require major progress in various fields. In the short term, the ongoing reform of governance must be completed and put into practice, including the full start-up of the European Stability Mechanism. A suitable balance must also be struck between two complementary objectives: fiscal consolidation and economic growth. Here, the “fiscal package” agreed at the end of 2011 must be supplemented with a new “growth package”.  Looking more into the medium term, profound reflection is needed on the euro area we want in 10 years’ time. This crisis has highlighted the vulnerabilities that may emerge in a monetary union lacking common fiscal and financial policies. It is thus worth considering a greater transfer of sovereignty in these areas.  On the home front, the challenges the Spanish economy faces are enormous. The latest episode of the sovereign debt crisis is severely impacting agents’ confidence and the economy’s financing conditions, placing it in a position of extreme vulnerability. Following two consecutive quarters of negative growth, our economy is once again in recession and the prospects of recovery are not immediate. Moreover, the prolonged cyclical weakness is preventing swifter headway in redressing public finances and in reducing private-sector debt, and casting doubt on the resilience of the financial system. That has triggered tensions on the debt markets and activated perverse feedback loops.  Lastly, the Spanish economy risks seeing its capacity to obtain external funding severely blocked. While in the short run this does not actually constrain ordinary funding flows (given the banking system’s possibility of resorting to ECB funding), the prolongation of such a situation will be extremely harmful in the medium term.  Spain is in this situation despite the fact that its authorities have implemented far-reaching reforms in recent years to resolve the inefficiencies in its economic functioning, to correct the serious deterioration in public finances and to redress and restructure the financial system, in order to restore financing flows.  Resolving these problems is taking longer than expected, but that should not lead to reform fatigue. It is important to persevere with the economic policy actions undertaken. In this way the levels of competitiveness needed to ensure the smooth functioning of the euro area may be regained, the ordinary funding channels restored and the imbalances built up in recent years, in particular in relation to public finances, finally corrected. These requirements must be met if the economy is to begin to generate employment and to grow. The adjustment continues to fall on domestic demand, weighed down by the correction of imbalances, the fiscal consolidation drive and tighter financing conditions. The external sector continues to soften the impact of domestic spending on activity, due both to the buoyancy of exports and to the slackness of imports from the rest of the world, but its contribution is insufficient to halt the decline in output.  In this setting, job destruction continued apace in 2011 and in 2012 to date. And, owing to the uncertain prospects for the Spanish economy, a turnaround is not expected in the very short term. However, as this episode is progressively overcome, the approved labour market reforms will foreseeably have a favourable impact on employment generation, contribute to adjusting working conditions to firms’ specific circumstances and provide for a more efficient reallocation of productive resources, which should ultimately prompt an increase in productivity levels. The cyclical weakness and the adverse behaviour of the labour market have not fed through sufficiently to the cost and price-formation mechanism, which still shows considerable inertia. The adjustment of unit labour costs is being achieved primarily thanks to the high productivity 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 gains brought about by job destruction, while the easing in inflation has corrected to a lesser extent the gap built up during the upturn. This behaviour highlights the slow and imperfect functioning of the competitiveness channel, which should in principle lead to a containment of prices and costs in those economies that accumulate bigger external misalignments. Indeed, achieving lasting improvements in competitiveness requires greater cost and price adjustments and productivity gains associated with genuine improvements in productive efficiency. However, since 2007 the Spanish economy’s external deficit has been substantially corrected, dipping from 10% of GDP in 2007 to 3.4% of GDP in 2011. Underpinning this narrowing of the deficit has been the buoyancy of exports and the sluggishness of imports, in step with the weakness of domestic demand. Notwithstanding, the culmination of this adjustment is conditional upon certain elements such as the deficit on the energy balance and the magnitude of the investment income payments component, with a negative balance equivalent to 2.7% of GDP in 2011, which is very closely related to the high level of the International Investment Position. These factors all accentuate the importance of those reforms contributing to correcting the deficit through the boosting of sustainable competitive gains in the medium and long term. The correction of this imbalance is particularly pressing in that the reliance on external saving has become a major factor of vulnerability of the Spanish economy during the crisis. The increased dependence on external financing in the pre-crisis period is the consequence of the sizeable accumulation of debt by households and firms, which also led to the Spanish banking system becoming oversized. The need to correct these imbalances poses an added difficulty to recovery in the economy, given that it restricts the headroom available to raise investment and consumption through resort to external financing. It is also crucial to continue with the restructuring of the banking system. Hence, when solvent demand recovers, it may be serviced by a normal flow of financing which, both in Spain and in the rest of continental Europe, is routed essentially through credit institutions. But households and firms still have a relatively lengthy process of debt reduction ahead of them. Accordingly, in the short term, the recovery in growth cannot be credit-led as in the past. Along these lines, credit to the non-financial private sector in 2011 fell by around 4%, although there were significant differences from sector to sector. In the case of households the pace of debt reduction was somewhat slower, whereas in that of firms the reduction in credit was more marked in those sectors, such as construction and real estate development, that had become oversized to a greater extent before the crisis. In contrast, the need for adjustment is less in those large corporations whose growth has largely been based on increased geographical diversification. All the foregoing factors will influence the pattern of exit from the recession. The need to reduce debt levels will, coupled with fiscal consolidation demands, continue to limit the possibilities of expanding domestic spending, meaning that the recovery should turn on net external demand. At the same time, it is necessary to begin to reverse the dynamic of external debt, which will require further progress in attaining a more balanced foreign trade position, overcoming the obstacles posed by the high investment income component and the dependence on energy imports. A pick-up in competitiveness will thus be pivotal if external demand is to stand in for the shortcomings of domestic demand and boost growth on the supply side, which in the current circumstances is the only way forward. To overcome the crisis an economic policy geared to the medium term is needed to help complete the correction of the macroeconomic imbalances still in place, to further the restructuring of all sectors and to allow the structural reforms outstanding to be tackled. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Fiscal consolidation is unavoidable if growth in the medium term is to be restored, despite the fact the scale and timing of the adjustment required may have adverse effects in the short term. This is the only strategy available for restoring market confidence. Compliance with the objectives set requires rigorous budgetary implementation, to which all levels of government should contribute. The strengthening of the budgetary framework under the recent Budgetary Stability Law should assist in this connection. The law sets explicit ceilings on deficit and debt levels in line with demands at the European level, and it includes stricter reporting requirements and new coercive mechanisms to ensure compliance by all tiers of government with fiscal targets.  The fiscal consolidation strategy should also take into account the medium and long-term considerations affecting public finances, in particular those associated with population ageing, namely spending on pensions and health care. Lastly, it should be said that the weakness of the labour market and of growth have been the main factors behind the limited progress in correcting the budget deficit in 2011. Without a recovery in employment and in growth, it will be costlier in the long run to pursue fiscal consolidation, so boosting structural reforms must be a priority. Among these, promoting so-called flexicurity to the full is vital, and should be complemented by a fresh liberalisation drive in the markets for goods and services that is conducive to competition, training in new technologies, innovation and the improvement of human capital.  Another key economic policy priority should be to continue with the ongoing clean-up, recapitalisation and restructuring of the Spanish banking system. Since 2009, the measures in this area have adhered to a set of common principles, although changes in economic conditions and in the markets have meant governments have had to adjust them. These principles include most notably to limit as far as possible use of public funds and to minimise the length of time the State has a stake in the banks; to promote integration and restructuring processes to counter the excessive fragmentation and size of the sector; to pursue the clean-up of bank balance sheets to withstand asset quality impairment; to reinforce bank solvency; to resolve the structural weaknesses of the savings bank model, and to promote transparency. Among the measures adopted in 2011 to which the Annual Report refers is Royal Decree-Law (RDL) 2/2011 on the strengthening of the financial system. This legislation raised core capital requirements to 8% generally, and to 10% for unlisted banks with a high dependence on wholesale funding, which were those on which doubts were greatest. To ensure that all banks could meet these requirements, it was decided that the Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of the Banking Sector (FROB) should act as a backstop. Further, the RDL stipulated the obligation for those institutions requiring public aid to operate as banks, with the aim of reinforcing their fund-raising capacity, and transparency towards investors. These measures, along with pension reform, contributed most positively to the easing of market tensions witnessed in the first half of 2011, with the risk premium falling at one point below 200 bp. Following the approval of the RDL, the banks and the authorities focused on ensuring compliance with this legislation, and on pursuing bank integration processes and on implementing the business model changes arising from the amended regulations governing savings banks. Under the provisions of the RDL, 13 banks had to increase their capital by more than €13 billion, meaning that in the second stress test conducted by the European Banking Authority, further capital increases were not needed. However, as the crisis worsened and spread in summer 2011, the Community authorities demanded a temporary increase in the capital requirements of large banks and the creation of a temporary extraordinary buffer associated with potential sovereign debt portfolio losses. These new requirements were applied to the five largest Spanish banks, for which additional capital needs of somewhat over €26 billion were calculated.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 As a result of all these developments, there was significant progress in the clean-up and restructuring of the Spanish banking system. From the onset of the crisis to the beginning of this year, provisions of around 13% of GDP were set aside, banks shored up their solvency by significantly increasing their capital, most savings banks converted into banks and around 30 institutions disappeared, with their management passing in most cases to other sounder and more efficient banks. As regards the sector’s capacity and the size of banks, staff and office numbers fell by around 12%, standing at similar figures to those as at end-2004, and the average size of banks in terms of their assets increased twofold.  Yet this progress was not enough to restore investors’ confidence in the soundness of our banking system. Given the double-dip recession, the insufficient reduction in the budget deficit and the continuing effects of the sovereign debt crisis, doubts persisted about the quality of construction and real estate development-related assets. In an attempt to dispel this uncertainty, various measures were adopted in the first half of 2012. Furthering the principles that have governed the ongoing restructuring of the financial system, the measures addressed accelerating the clean-up of bank balance sheets, reinforcing their solvency, boosting integration processes and promoting transparency. RDL 2/2012, approved in February, stipulated an increase in provisioning for construction and real estate development-related assets, and the creation of a capital buffer to cover potential losses arising on problem loans associated with land and ongoing developments. More recently, in May 2012, the Government approved RDL 18/2012, on the clean-up and sale of financial-sector real estate assets. The aim was to dispel doubts over the quality of Spanish credit institutions’ non-doubtful real estate portfolio. To do this, provisions for construction and real estate development-related assets not classified as troubled have been raised substantially, bringing forward the impact of potential additional impairment to this portfolio. Banks that undergo a capital shortfall as a result of these new requirements will have to reinforce their capital, resorting to financial aid from the FROB if necessary.  Overall, the clean-up and capital increases arising from the two RDLs approved this year will see a considerable reinforcement of the banking system’s buffer against potential losses. Indeed, once these measures have been fully implemented, the provisions set aside by the Spanish banking sector since early 2008 will amount to close to 19% of GDP. In addition, the legislation demands problem foreclosures be transferred to asset management companies, and a programme for private appraisers to value the entire credit portfolio of the banking sector has been set in train.  Allow me to conclude with some reflections on two issues I consider very important: the restoring of confidence, and the importance of independent regulatory agencies. In the difficult circumstances facing the Spanish economy, the most critical variable is neither growth nor unemployment, no matter how serious recent developments have been, but rather the deterioration in confidence. The priority aim of action by all authorities should be to restore lost confidence, since without it resuming growth and job creation will not be possible. The low level of confidence we have hit in recent months and weeks means that resolving Spain’s fiscal and financial problems has become more difficult and costly.  The potential impact on confidence should, therefore, be a primary determinant of any action by the authorities, political representatives and economic agents. Here a particular effort should be made to explain all the decisions adopted by the different levels of government in Spain that have been well-received and valued by the markets, such as structural reforms, pension reform and the recent Organic Law on Budgetary Stability, among others. There should likewise be a common effort, in the interest of all sectors of the Spanish economy, to disseminate and address in depth the additional measures that should shortly be adopted to tackle the crisis. There is no more important or pressing task in the short term than to restore lost confidence. And here, collaboration is called for by politicians and economic and social agents in positions of responsibility, and by all institutions with economic policymaking responsibilities. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches A fundamental determinant of confidence is the credibility of regulatory and supervisory institutions, based on their ability to exercise their powers professionally and independently. This is always an essential element of a country’s economic reputation, but all the more so when confidence has been called into question and the recovery in growth depends on the external financing of its economy.  Adam Smith observed in his famous work that the wealth of nations was then closely related to how open their trade was. And today we can see how the richest and most democratically sound countries in the world are those that have competent and independent regulatory and supervisory agencies that act as a counterweight to governments potentially succumbing to interventionist temptations. Internationally, it is currently accepted that governments have very important tasks to perform in the financial field. These may include designing restructuring strategies, determining resolution instruments, deciding on the use of public funds, etc. But there is also broad consensus that such tasks should be implemented by independent regulators and supervisors.  By assigning the regulatory and supervisory remit to independent institutions that act using sound technical criteria, the danger of decisions being subject to the vagaries of politics or to lobby group interests is removed to some extent. Reasons of technical capability also come into play. Independent and professional supervisors have the time and resources to build up enormously rich knowledge which, given the particular characteristics of financial activity, is essential for tackling problems in this sector, minimising errors and unwanted side-effects at the same time.  Having independent regulatory and supervisory institutions by no means guarantees that mistakes are not made. But their presence ensures that decisions are not tainted by momentary political considerations. I cannot say that the Banco de España, in its supervisory mission, has not occasionally been mistaken. But I can assure you that the decisions of the Banco de España have always been based on exclusively professional criteria.  This is an important facet of independence. Independence is not something innate. It is not a label or badge conferred by anyone. Independence is demonstrated, and it is exercised or not exercised. Nobody is independent for what they are, but rather for what they do. But another important aspect to ensure the independence of these institutions is to prevent governments or interest groups affecting such independence. In the specific case of the Banco de España, the respect of the authorities for its independence and reputation is crucial for maintaining confidence in our banking system at home and abroad, and for overcoming the major challenges we currently face. Naturally, this respect for the independence of regulatory and supervisory agencies should unavoidably be accompanied by an obligation on their part to account for the performance of their functions before Parliament. Such accountability to the representatives of the nation should not only be an obligation for these agencies but also their right, since the transparency provided by Parliament is a mainstay for safeguarding the independence of the institution from possible interference by authorities and interest groups. Allow me to thank those here, the Deputy Governor, the Governing Council members and the Directors General, and all the Bank’s staff for their collaboration these past six years. I deeply recognise the competence and dedication with which they discharge their important responsibilities.  But I should like to conclude expressing my particular appreciation of those who have participated in the supervisory function of the Banco de España these past years. Banking Supervision, Banking Regulation and our Legal Services have been involved in major actions affecting the most vulnerable institutions, such as, for instance, removing most of the managers from 30 credit institutions, converting savings banks into commercial banks and assessing numerous clean-up and recapitalisation plans, and complying at all times with the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 mandate of different governments to minimise the use of taxpayer funds. It is telling that the image (measured by their ratings) of our major banks has systematically been above that of the world’s 23 biggest banks throughout the crisis until, in recent weeks, a downward spiral of downgrades has ensued and doubts about our banking system as a whole have spread. But this is no time for despondency. I am convinced that, once time puts everybody in their place, your work during these years of crisis will be acknowledged and rightly appreciated by all. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Daniel K Tarullo: Shadow banking after the financial crisis Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Conference on “Challenges in global finance: the role of Asia”, San Francisco, California, 12 June 2012.  *      *      * The three decades preceding the financial crisis were characterized in the United States by the progressive integration of traditional lending and capital markets activities. This trend diminished the importance of deposits as a source of funding for credit extension in favor of capital market instruments sold to institutional investors. It also altered the structure of the financial services industry, both transforming the activities of broker-dealers and fostering the emergence of large financial conglomerates. Although the structure of foreign banking systems was less noticeably changed, many foreign banks drew increasingly on the resulting wholesale funding markets and made significant investments in the mortgage-backed securities that had proliferated in the first decade of this century.  The financial crisis underscored the failure of the American regulatory system to keep pace with these developments and revealed the need for two reform agendas. One must be aimed specifically at the problem of too-big-to-fail institutions. The other must be directed at the so-called shadow banking system, which refers to credit intermediation involving leverage and maturity transformation that is partly or wholly outside the traditional banking system. As I have noted on other occasions, most reforms to date have concentrated on too-big-to-fail institutions, though many of these reforms have yet to be fully implemented. The shadow banking system, on the other hand, has been only obliquely addressed, despite the fact that the most acute phase of the crisis was precipitated by a run on that system. Indeed, as the oversight of regulated institutions is strengthened, opportunities for arbitrage in the shadow banking system may increase.  Today I want to focus on the development of a regulatory reform agenda for the shadow banking system. As those who have been following the academic and policy debates know, there are significant, ongoing disagreements concerning the roles of various factors contributing to the rapid growth of the shadow banking system, the precise dynamics of the runs in 2007 and 2008, and the relative social utility of some elements of this system. Conclusions drawn from these debates will be important in eventually framing a broadly directed regulatory plan for the shadow banking system. However, as it is neither necessary nor wise to await such conclusions in order to begin implementing a regulatory response, I will follow my discussion of the vulnerabilities created by shadow banking with some suggestions for near- and medium-term reforms.  Fragility of the shadow banking system It is not my purpose here today to discuss the history and complex nature of the shadow banking system. There is a rich and growing academic literature devoted to this task. However, I do want to identify some features of shadow banking that are reasonably well-established and particularly salient for reform efforts.  First, and in many respects foremost, it bears noting that the use of the term “shadow banking” refers not simply to the functions of credit intermediation and maturity transformation. Shadow banking also refers to the creation of assets that are thought to be safe, short-term, and liquid, and as such, “cash equivalents” similar to insured deposits in the commercial banking system. Of course, as many financial market actors learned to their dismay, in periods of stress these assets are not the same as insured deposits.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The years preceding the financial crisis saw a surge in the volume of dollar-denominated, seemingly safe, seemingly liquid financial instruments. The causal interplay of factors leading to this surge is still actively debated. But it seems reasonably clear that both a rise in the demand by investors for safe, liquid assets as tools for precautionary or transactional liquidity and a rise in demand for short-term financing by certain borrowers – notably financial intermediaries looking to fund longer-term assets – played important, probably reciprocally reinforcing roles.  Examples of investor demand for safe, liquid assets are not hard to identify. One source has been foreign official investors, mostly emerging market countries, which invested about $1.6 trillion in the United States in the four years preceding the crisis, largely in U.S. Treasury and agency securities. Much of this activity arose from the investment of foreign exchange reserves by countries running large current account surpluses. Some of these reserves were undoubtedly built up as a precautionary measure in light of the financial problems in emerging markets during the late 1990s, while others are attendant to policies of managed exchange rates. This official sector demand for safe assets was largely if not entirely focused on U.S. government securities, rather than cash equivalents. But this source of demand absorbed roughly 80 percent of the increase in U.S. Treasury and agency securities over the four-year period, potentially crowding out other investors and thereby increasing their demand for cash equivalents that appeared to be of comparable safety and liquidity.  A second source of demand has been nonfinancial firms, which responded to the market disruptions associated with defaults by Enron and other firms more than a decade ago by boosting their holdings of cash. The pressure to hold large amounts of cash likely increased when a major ratings agency began publishing liquidity risk assessments of nonfinancial firms.  A third source of demand for cash equivalents resulted from the adoption of more elaborate investment strategies by many institutional investors. For example, as more such investors used derivatives or short-selling as part of their overall strategies, they needed cash or cash-like instruments for margining and other collateral purposes. Moreover, of course, as the amount of assets under professional management increased, the demand for safe, liquid investments also inevitably increased, since intermediaries need a place to park funds that are awaiting investment or needed to meet unexpected withdrawals.  The growing demand for safe and liquid assets was met largely by the shadow banking system’s creation of assets that were seemingly safe and seemingly liquid.1 New varieties of shadow-banking activities were created, some pre-existing types grew larger, and the shadow banking system became much more internationalized. For example, the volume of asset-backed commercial paper, or ABCP, grew enormously. Many ABCP vehicles issued short-term, highly rated liabilities and bought longer-term, highly rated securities, often mortgage-backed securities. Many of the vehicles were sponsored abroad, especially by European banks, which issued dollar-denominated ABCP in the U.S. market and bought dollar-denominated assets in the U.S. market. The overall volume of this activity was very large, although the net flows between the U.S. and Europe were not, leaving European bank sponsors of such ABCP vehicles with a huge exposure when market participants stopped believing that ABCP was risk-free.                                                  1 Insured demand deposits at traditional banks can help meet the needs of large investors, but only to a limited extent. Such accounts are unattractive to large investors because of the limited scale of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance; large deposits are, beyond the insurance cap, effectively unsecured exposures to a single bank, and small deposits at multiple banks are inconvenient. The expansion of FDIC insurance to all noninterest bearing accounts, regardless of size – which occurred in November 2008 and which is scheduled to expire at the end of this year – has made deposits more attractive and more heavily utilized. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  It now seems clear that the tail risk associated with many shadow-banking instruments was not understood by many market actors, including both sellers and buyers. An important contributing factor on the buyers’ side that helped set the stage for the 2007–2008 financial crisis was the widespread acceptance that risk-free assets could be created by augmenting what was already thought to be a low-risk asset with a promise from a large financial institution to provide liquidity or bear credit losses in the unlikely event that such support might be needed. When, in stressed conditions, the credibility of the promise came into question, the susceptibility to runs increased dramatically.  In some cases, there were explicit contractual provisions for liquidity support or credit enhancements, such as were provided to ABCP vehicles by their sponsoring banks. In other cases, the support was more implicit, and was conveyed in the marketing of the assets or through an historical pattern of providing support. Forms of implicit credit support were present in a variety of important funding channels and, to a considerable degree, persist today. Three examples are money market funds, the triparty repo market, and securities lending.  Money market funds aim to maintain a stable net asset value of one dollar per share and to meet redemption requests upon demand. As such they are the very model of a nonbank “deposit” or cash equivalent.2 Unlike other mutual funds, money market funds are allowed to round their net asset values to one dollar per share so long as the underlying value of each share remains within one-half cent of a dollar. But a drop in the unrounded net asset value of more than one-half of one percent causes a money fund to “break the buck”, a scenario in which losses, at least in theory, would be passed along to the fund’s investors.  However, fund sponsors historically have absorbed losses whenever necessary to prevent funds from breaking the buck, with only two exceptions. Even though they had no legal obligation to do so, sponsors voluntarily supported their funds more than 100 times between 1989 and 2003, presumably because allowing a fund to break the buck would have damaged the sponsor’s reputation and franchise. This tendency was well understood by investors. Indeed, a standard reference book on money markets states that a “money fund run by an entity with deep pockets, while it may not have federal insurance, certainly has something akin to private insurance . . . likely to prove adequate to cover any losses sustained by the fund”.3 Many money funds sustained significant capital losses when the market for asset-backed commercial paper collapsed in the summer and fall of 2007. As in previous decades, losses at money funds were absorbed by the funds’ sponsors. Indeed, money funds were seen as highly safe in 2007 and received large net inflows as concerns about other portions of the financial system increased.  But when, in 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund did not provide support for the relatively small losses at its money market fund, the illusion that money funds were effectively as safe as insured bank accounts was shattered. A general run on money funds ensued. Within two days, investors withdrew nearly $200 billion from prime money market funds, about 10 percent of their assets. This contributed to severe funding pressures for issuers of commercial paper. The run ultimately prompted – and was stopped by – unprecedented interventions by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to provide insurance and liquidity support to the industry.                                                  2 See Patrick McCabe (2010), “The Cross Section of Money Market Fund Risks and Financial Crises”, Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2010–51 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September). 3 Anthony Crescenzi and Marcia Stigum (2007), Stigum’s Money Market, 4th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill) p. 1117. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  A second example is the triparty repo market, which had grown to about $2.8 trillion of outstanding financing by early 2007. In general, a repo, or “repurchase agreement”, is the sale of a security with an agreement to repurchase the security at a later date; the economics of repos are similar to that of short-term loans collateralized by longer-term assets. So-called triparty repos, typically used by broker-dealers to raise financing from cash-rich institutions such as money market funds, insurance companies, and some central banks, utilizes a particular settlement mechanism. The third party in this triparty market is a clearing bank, which handles settlement through accounts held at that institution by the broker-dealers who are cash borrowers and the cash lenders. Because the composition and size of broker-dealers’ inventories can change rapidly with the levels of trading activity, broker-dealers find the very flexible and inexpensive short-term financing offered by triparty repos to be extremely attractive. To the extent that this borrowing appeared riskless to lenders, broker-dealers were potential suppliers through triparty repos of the safe, liquid assets that were in such demand.  Broker-dealers who borrow in the triparty repo market want to have access to their securities for routine trading purposes – for example, to make deliveries to clients during the day. To allow for that, the market developed a critical operational feature called the “daily unwind”. Each day, the clearing banks “unwind” all repo trades, returning securities to borrowers and cash to lenders, even for longer-dated term transactions. However, the securities still require financing during the day. To this end, borrowers rely on intraday overdrafts at the two major clearing banks. At the end of the day, the transactions are “re-wound”. Thus, the risks associated with the portfolios of securities are fully transferred twice each day.  The lenders in this market widely believed that the two clearing banks would always unwind their maturing trades in the morning, returning cash to their account, despite no contractual provision requiring that the clearing banks do so. The fact that lenders believed they were protected in this way by the clearing bank helped perpetuate the illusion that, particularly when lending overnight, they were invested in a money-like asset that would always be highly liquid and safe, even though in reality the borrower was usually an entity that could go bankrupt.  This illusion faded as the financial crisis progressed. Significant strains were created by concerns about the financial strength of the broker-dealers, uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, and belated recognition that the clearing banks were not contractually obligated to unwind maturing trades. Only when the prospect of dealer failures became very real – for example, in the case of Countrywide’s broker-dealer affiliate in August 2007 and Bear Stearns in March 2008 – did the lenders appear to see these risks clearly. In addition, the presumed stabilizing function of collateral was weakened, since a default by a dealer or clearing bank could leave lenders with securities posted as collateral that they had no desire, operational capacity, or even, in some cases, legal authority to hold, or at least liquidate in an orderly way. The response at that point was to flee, ignoring the protection putatively afforded by collateral.  Only because of unprecedented official-sector action did the triparty repo market not suffer the same kind of disastrous run as did money market funds. A broad run on triparty repos would have severely impacted all major broker-dealers and thus the U.S. securities industry as a whole. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility – instituted on an emergency basis immediately after the failure of Bear Stearns – provided emergency lending to dealers, injected liquidity into the system, and provided a backstop that reassured markets. This public-sector support prevailed where implicit private-sector support had come into question, and helped stabilize the triparty repo market.  My third example of a funding channel characterized by tacit credit support is the securities lending market, which is driven in large part by demand for securities by financial institutions wanting to establish short positions or needing collateral to support other transactions. Securities lenders in this market are typically owners of large pools of securities such as 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  pension plans, endowments, and insurance companies. The securities borrower posts collateral, usually cash in the United States, which a custodian bank then typically invests on behalf of the securities lender in supposedly safe and liquid investments, including money market funds, triparty repos, and other short-term instruments. The gains from these reinvestment activities provide a significant amount – in some cases, all – of the compensation to the securities lender associated with participating in the lending program.4 The custodian banks all but universally provided a contractual indemnification to the securities lender that required them to absorb any losses to the securities lenders if the securities were not returned. But the investment returns, and risk of loss on the reinvestment of cash collateral that would have to be returned to the borrowers of securities, generally were not covered by such indemnifications. Nonetheless, a number of securities lenders seemed to believe otherwise, and in many cases their expectations were fulfilled as custodian banks agreed during the financial crisis to bear at least some of the losses from cash collateral reinvestment programs.  Although the experiences of money market funds, triparty repos, and securities lending vary in the details, they all share a common underlying pathology: Offering documents with stern warnings notwithstanding, explicit and implicit commitments combined with a history of discretionary support to create an assumption, even among sophisticated investors, that low-risk assets were free of credit and liquidity risk – effectively cash, but with a slightly higher return. This risk illusion led to pervasive underpricing of the risks embedded in these money-like instruments and made them an artificially cheap source of funding. The consequent oversupply of these instruments contributed importantly to systemic risk.  Reliance on private mechanisms to create seemingly riskless assets generally worked in the relatively calm years leading up to the financial crisis and, to some extent, well into the crisis. But, in many cases, discretionary support came into question at the time of acute financial-market stress, precisely when it was needed most, as questions arose about the ability or willingness of large financial institutions to follow through on their implicit commitments. Investors were reminded of their potential exposure, leading to wholesale and sometimes disorderly flight. The unwinding of this risk illusion helped transform a dramatic correction in real estate valuations – which itself would have had serious consequences for the economy – into a crisis that threatened the entire financial system.  Shaping a regulatory response Ideally, a regulatory response to the shadow banking system would be grounded in a full understanding of the dynamics that drove its rapid growth, the social utility of its intermediation activities, and the risks they create. Such a response would be comprehensive, meaning that it would cover in an effective and efficient manner any activities that create these vulnerabilities, without regard to how the activities were denominated, what transaction forms were used, or where they were conducted. Of course, many of the key issues are still being debated, and even those who agree on the desirability of a comprehensive response may differ on its basic form.  We should continue to seek the analytic and policy consensus that must precede the creation of a regulatory program that meets these conditions. More work is needed on fundamental issues such as the implications of private money creation and of intermediaries behaving like banks but without bank-like regulation. These implications are potentially quite profound for central banking and banking regulation, considering that the shadow banking                                                 4 Much of the attention devoted to securities lending in the wake of the crisis focused on the program run by AIG. In addition to general issues involving the reinvestment of cash collateral, AIG’s securities lending program had more specific and fundamental flaws that go beyond the concerns discussed here. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  system has caused the volume of money-like instruments created outside the purview of central bank and regulatory control to grow markedly.  But regulators need not wait for the full resolution of contested issues or the development of comprehensive alternatives, nor would it be prudent for them to do so. We should act now to address some obvious sources of vulnerability in the financial system. I believe that the foregoing discussion of implicit support for various shadow banking instruments helps identify areas where misunderstanding and mispricing of risk are more likely, with the result that destabilizing runs are a real possibility.  Let me then suggest three more-or-less immediate steps that regulators here and abroad should take, as well as a medium-term reform undertaking.  First, we should create greater transparency with respect to the various transactions and markets that comprise the shadow banking system. For example, large segments of the repo market remain opaque today. In fact, at present there is no way that regulators or market participants can precisely determine even the overall volume of bilateral repo transactions – that is, transactions not settled using the triparty mechanism. It is encouraging that the Treasury Department’s new Office of Financial Research is working to improve information about this market, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering approaches to enhanced transparency in the closely related securities lending market.  Second, the risk of runs on money market mutual funds should be further reduced through additional measures to address the structural vulnerabilities that have persisted even after the measures taken by the SEC in 2010 to improve the resilience of those funds. The SEC is currently considering several possible reforms, including a floating net asset value, capital requirements, and restrictions on redemption. Clearly, as suggested by Chairman Schapiro, action by the SEC to address the vulnerabilities that were so evident in 2008, while also preserving the economic role of money market funds, is the preferable route. But in the absence of such action, there are several second-best alternatives, including the recent suggestion by Deputy Governor Tucker of the Bank of England that supervisors consider setting new limits on banks’ reliance on funding provided by money market funds.  A third short-term priority is to address the settlement process for triparty repurchase agreements. Some progress has been made since 2008, but clearly more remains to be done. An industry-led task force established in 2009 orchestrated the implementation of some important improvements to the settlement process. The unwind, with its reliance on vast amounts of discretionary and uncommitted intraday credit from the two clearing banks, was pushed to later in the day, reducing the period during which the intraday credit was extended. In addition, new tools were developed for better intraday collateral management, and an improved confirmation process was instituted.  Though these were useful steps, the key risk reduction goal of the effective elimination of intraday credit has not yet been achieved. A second phase of triparty reform is now underway, with the Federal Reserve using its supervisory authority to press for further action not only by the clearing banks, who of course manage the settlement process, but also by the dealer affiliates of bank holding companies, who are the clearing banks’ largest customers for triparty transactions. But this approach alone will not suffice. All regulators and supervisors with responsibility for overseeing the various entities active in the triparty market will need to work together to ensure that critical enhancements to risk management and settlement processes are implemented uniformly and robustly across the entire market, and to encourage the development of mechanisms for orderly liquidation of collateral, so as to prevent a fire sale of assets in the event that any major triparty market participant faces distress.  In the medium term, a broader reform agenda for shadow banking will first need to address the fact that there is little constraint on the use of leverage in some key types of transactions. One proposal is for a system of haircut and margin requirements that would be uniformly applied across a range of markets, including OTC derivatives, repurchase agreements, and 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  securities lending. Work is ongoing to develop globally uniform margin requirements for OTC derivatives, but there is not yet an agreement to develop globally uniform margin requirements for securities financing transactions. Such a margining system would not only limit leverage, but – to the extent it is in fact uniform – also diminish incentives to use more complicated and less transparent transactional forms to increase leverage or reduce its cost. Some proponents suggest that such systems of uniform haircut and margin requirements could also dampen the observed procyclical character of many collateralized borrowings that results from changes in margins and haircuts following general economic or credit trends.  Conclusion The shadow banking system today is considerably smaller than at the height of the housing bubble six or seven years ago. And it is very likely that some forms of shadow banking most closely associated with that bubble have disappeared forever. But as the economy recovers, it is nearly as likely that, without policy changes, existing channels for shadow banking will grow, and new forms creating new vulnerabilities will arise. That is why I suggest what is, in essence, a two-pronged agenda: first, near-term action to address current channels where mispricing, run risk, and potential moral hazard are evident; and, second, continuation of the academic and policy debate on more fundamental measures to address these issues more broadly and proactively.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Enhancing corporate governance practices in the Malaysian financial sector Keynote address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the official launch of the Financial Institutions’ Directors Education (FIDE) Forum, Sasana Kijang, Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 12 June 2012. *      *      * It is my great pleasure to be here this morning at the launch of the Financial Institutions’ Directors Education (FIDE) Forum. The establishment of this Forum, an initiative by the founding directors of the FIDE program will contribute to further the efforts to enhance corporate governance practices in the Malaysian financial sector. Many of you have made invaluable contributions to the conception and development of the FIDE program and its ongoing refinement. The program is not only unique and highly effective, but it is delivering palpable change and contributing to higher standards of corporate governance in our financial industry. This in turn is supporting stronger, and more resilient financial institutions. Following the recent global financial crisis, corporate governance practices in the financial industry have come under significant scrutiny. There has been increased pressure on the management, boards of financial institutions and on regulators to significantly improve the governance practices in the financial industry notably on the incentive systems, accountability and controls. The problems that led to the build-up to this however, are not new. Issues around misaligned incentives and an over-emphasis on short term performance which encouraged reckless risk-taking, in addition to the lack of transparency, and the pervasive conflict of interests have long been the focus of public attention especially in relation to companies with dispersed shareholding structures. These same issues however, are far more serious when they involve the financial institutions given the significant externalities inflicted on society following the failure of such financial institutions. Banks in particular are especially vulnerable to the consequences of governance failures given the critical importance of public confidence to their very survival. Since the crisis, substantial work on several fronts have been devoted to strengthening the resilience of financial institutions. New capital and liquidity standards have been a key focus of the global regulatory reforms and the work to transpose these global standards into national regulations are now well underway in many countries, including in Malaysia. While this will deliver significantly improved frameworks for risk-taking by financial institutions, they remain, at best, poor substitutes for good governance. Evidence of this can be drawn from the contrast between institutions that operated under the same regulatory framework, but that experienced very different outcomes during and after the crisis.  The comparisons are revealing. Of significance has been the observation – including in the most recent cases of massive bank losses – that behaviour and culture had a more significant part in the recent governance failures. Despite having independent directors and elaborate control structures in place, firms have failed because of decisions by their management and when boards have not effectively performed their oversight role. This has been principally attributed to the lack of sufficient collective knowledge of the board and inadequate competence of individual directors which in turn have led to poor judgements that hampered the ability of the board to rein in excesses at an early stage. Competency gaps generally allow for individuals on boards or from senior management to exert a dominant and undue influence over the decision making process, without being subject to sufficient scrutiny and effective challenge. This occurs when Boards are not able to grasp the risks associated with inordinately complex activities that their institutions are engaged in. This is generally further compounded by the failure to provide an effective countervailing influence to an overzealous risk-taking culture among front-liners who are principally driven by the pressure to deliver short term returns. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Of course, sound processes and structures will continue to have a central role in any good governance framework. This provides the parameters within which decisions can be made. However, the growing significance of behavioural, cultural and ethical issues suggests that governance frameworks must give greater attention to the “softer” aspects of governance. A clear reason for this is that the more challenging and fluid operating environment demands greater exercise of judgement by management. Behavioural, cultural and ethical norms, are likely as a consequence, to assume more importance in defining the boundaries within which management will make such judgements. As institutions become larger and more complex, boards themselves must also have the ability and confidence to assess the nature of the risks to the financial institution’s strategic plan and business direction. This will entail behavioural and cultural changes within the boardroom that will involve changes to the board dynamics and the ability to effectively harness the collective knowledge and expertise of the board. It will involve the courage to break away from the status quos that promotes “group think” over diversity. Developments in supervisory approaches will also reinforce this trend. The bar on corporate governance continues to be raised through more intensive supervision that focuses on board effectiveness. Supervisors are increasingly looking for evidence of a mix of technical and strategic competencies on the board that will support meaningful engagements both within the board, and between the board and management. Assessments are also made on whether boards function in a manner that promotes independence of judgement, and the extent to which boards are able to define the acceptable risk appetite for the institution and to oversee its translation into appropriate policies and behavioural norms.  Following the Asian financial crisis, strengthening the governance of financial institutions was a key priority which culminated in a number of regulatory reforms that established the framework of governance practices that exist today. In many respects, the financial sector in Malaysia has progressed ahead of current developments. A set of governance principles and rules were introduced in the early part of this recent decade. This included the parameters for sound practices with respect to risk-aligned compensations – an issue that has been a focus of the current global regulatory reforms. This was followed closely by the implementation of an improved risk-based supervisory approach which places board and senior management oversight at the centre of an effective control environment within financial institutions. A more rigorous process for assessing individuals nominated to assume the roles of director, chairman and chief executive of financial institutions have also been introduced. As part of the efforts to bring about behavioural and cultural changes to strengthen the governance practices in the financial industry, FIDE was developed and introduced in 2008.  We have been encouraged by the resulting improvements observed in governance and risk management practices among financial institutions in Malaysia. Our supervisory oversight has shown that directors have exercised a more active role in ensuring effective alignment and implementation of risk policies, business strategy and capital management. The quality of engagement between boards and management has also improved substantially in particular, on major strategic decisions and risk developments. Our supervisory engagements with boards have also benefited from the issues raised on areas of concern and material developments. There has also been increased efforts to strengthen the mix of skills, experience and expertise of the Board composition to improve the overall effectiveness of boards. This has resulted in more independent directors being appointed to the boards in most of the financial institutions. The environment confronting financial institutions will continue to be immensely challenging, particularly in the coming years as global financial conditions remain highly volatile and uncertain, and as regulatory reforms start to take effect. In this environment, a number of areas will become more important to reinforce the effectiveness of boards and sound governance. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  First, board-level engagements on risk issues will need to be strengthened further. This can only be achieved if boards have a sound understanding of the institution’s business model, and a strong grasp of the changing complexion of risks in which the institution is exposed. Committed resources should therefore be available to the board to support their understanding of material developments affecting the institution, and to hone their judgement on matters concerning risk strategy. This should include relevant and meaningful management of information flows and risk analysis to the board, the ability to retain talent including external expertise where required, the ability to attract individuals with relevant competencies and experience to serve on boards, and the budget for board development and education.  Second, with the growing expansion of financial institutions in scale and complexity, there is a need to inject greater diversity into boards to enable the board collectively to deal with the broader range of issues across the institution’s activities. This needs to be embedded within the framework for board renewal and succession. As institutions expand across borders, diversity can also enhance the board’s appreciation of regional and global trends, and improve the ability of the board to provide strong leadership in response to cultural nuances and competitive dynamics in different markets. This will also be important for the effective oversight of group-wide risks and strategies.  Third, with increased expectations placed on boards, boards will need to have the means to objectively evaluate their own performance and examine ways in which board effectiveness can be improved. Overcoming cultural norms that impede more formal processes for open and honest engagement among peers remains a challenge. In the same way that a weak process for the evaluation of management performance would be a cause for concern, the same would hold true for the board. Guided self-evaluation frameworks are reinforced by an environment that encourages candour and openness, and supplemented by third-party independent reviews, have worked well for some of our institutions. More progress in these areas for maintaining high-performing boards rather than the more prescriptive approaches, which would most likely yield results that fall short of the desired outcomes.  Let me take this opportunity to discuss some of the key initiatives that are currently being pursued by the Bank in the area of governance of financial institutions. The Bank has made proposals in the new financial services legislation which will augment the general duties and responsibilities of the board under the Companies Act so as to provide emphasis to the specific key considerations in the responsibilities of boards of financial institutions. Boards would now need to have regard to the interests of depositors and policyholders, the long term viability of the institution and to have in place reasonable standards of fair dealings in the oversight of the implementation of the business and risk strategies of the institution. The statutory duties would also include an explicit duty to ensure and oversee the effective design and implementation of a sound control environment.  Work has also commenced to update and streamline the current regulatory guidelines on corporate governance for banks, insurers and takaful operators with a view to reduce the duplication across different standards and to sharpen the focus on the overall responsibility of the board for risk and control. Existing prescriptive rules would give way to broader principles of behaviour. The review will also better align the regulatory framework with the current supervisory approach. A thematic review of the remuneration practices in the financial sector is also planned to take into account how it might influence risk-taking behaviours. Also in train is a review of the supervisory process for assessing the suitability of persons that can serve on boards of financial institutions. This review will leverage on the work by the FIDE Forum. Looking further ahead, the Financial Sector Blueprint sets out additional recommendations to further strengthen incentives and enablers for sound governance and risk management standards in anticipation of the growing complexities of our financial landscape.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Let me draw my remarks to a close. The task of providing stewardship, direction and oversight of financial institutions essentially falls squarely on the board. The responsibilities that go with this are great and I believe that we need the best directors in the financial industry – not just because of the importance of the financial sector to the broader economy, but because financial institutions, through their pervasive role in supporting economic activity, can be a powerful influence in raising the standards of corporate governance across corporate Malaysia. I expect that the FIDE Forum will have an instrumental role is realising this vision by professionalising the role of directors, and showing the way in the best governance practices. On our part, the Bank greatly welcomes this initiative which will facilitate new opportunities for greater engagement with directors in the financial sector as a collective body, on regulatory issues and developments. On that note, it is my great pleasure to officially launch the FIDE Forum. I wish it every success.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stefan Gerlach: Fiscal imbalances and monetary stability Address by Mr Stefan Gerlach, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Dublin, 28 September 2012. *      *      * I am grateful to Laura Weymes for help in preparing these remarks. 1. Introduction I am delighted to be here today. Let me start by acknowledging the important work the Chamber has undertaken since its establishment in 1980 in promoting closer links between Irish and German companies. As you may know, in terms of trade with the EU, Germany ranks jointly as the 2nd largest market for Irish exports, and is the 3rd largest source of Irish imports.1 Our close economic links with Germany are important, particularly in the present environment in which the German economy continues to grow and absorb our exports. Today I will speak on fiscal imbalances and the problems they create for monetary policy. One of the most visible outcomes of the current sovereign debt crisis is that fiscal deficits and public debts have become very large in many countries inside and outside of the euro area. Given the severe economic difficulties that Ireland and a number of other economies in the euro area have been experiencing in the last few years, these issues have been prominent in the public debate. Since it is difficult to reduce fiscal imbalances quickly, it is clear that pubic debts will remain large for the foreseeable future. It is therefore timely to talk about why they matter and what concerns they raise for central banks. In my remarks I hope to shed light on just how large fiscal imbalances currently are in many countries and what concerns such imbalances raise for central banks. I will then review a number of institutional arrangements in force in the euro area that are intended to limit the need for government borrowing and that prohibit the ECB from lending to governments. I will also reflect on how these large debts are likely to be reduced. 2. The state of public finances in Europe and in Ireland Let me start by reviewing how debts and deficits have evolved in Europe over time. Across the euro area, average general government deficits rose from less than 1% of GDP in 2007 on the eve of the crisis to more than 6% of GDP in 2010 (Figure 1). In the same period, the average debt ratio rose from 66% to 87% in 2011 (Figure 2). For some euro area and EU countries (and also for Japan and the US) the deterioration has been even more pronounced. Between 2007 and 2010 increases in debt ratios of 30% of GDP or more were recorded in Ireland, Greece, Latvia, Iceland, the UK, the US and Japan. Annual deficits larger than 7% of GDP have also been recorded in several countries including Greece, Spain, Portugal, the US and the UK. Specifically, Irish general government debt rose from below 25% of GDP in 2007, which was much below the 60% limit of the Maastricht Treaty, to over 106% of GDP in 2011, and is projected to rise until 2013. In the same period, the headline balance deteriorated from a surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2007 to a peak of a staggering 31% of GDP in 2010 (of which about two-thirds was related to banking support measures). In 2011 the deficit was almost                                                 1  Of total exports (goods and services) to the European Union, 17% go to the United Kingdom, and 9% to each of Belgium and Germany. On the imports side, 19% come from the United Kingdom, 9% from the Netherlands and 5% from Germany (based on CSO data). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  13% of GDP.2 Therefore, unfortunately, in spite of nearly 16% of GDP in budgetary adjustment measures undertaken since 2008, a deficit of 8.3% is projected for this year, falling slightly to 7.5% for 2013. Three factors have led to the rapid increase in public debt in the wider European context. First, the large recession triggered by the financial crisis has led tax revenues to be much weaker than projected. To mitigate this effect, governments have raised tax rates and relied on one-off revenues. In spite of these efforts total revenues as a share of GDP have remained relatively flat (Figure 3). Second, the recession has led to higher expenditure on unemployment support and welfare spending. Between 2000 and 2010, social transfers as a share of GDP increased by 4.2% in Ireland, more than the euro area average of 1.8%. Third, governments in some countries have been faced with large bills for rescuing troubled financial institutions. In the euro area at end 2011, spending on banking support measures constituted 4.9% of total gross government liabilities outstanding, with impacts of more than 6% of GDP recorded in Ireland, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium.3 In Ireland the gross debt-worsening impact of bank-related outlays over 2008 to 2011 amount to almost 47 billion euro or 30% of GDP, a truly staggering number. Of course, this figure could have been smaller had loss-sharing with bank bondholders been greater. While burden sharing with subordinated debt-holders eventually totalled over 10% of GDP, further sharing was prevented initially by the breadth of the original government guarantee and subsequently by the Programme agreement. 3. The adverse effects of public debts Why are central banks so concerned about large public debts? There are several reasons. 3.1 Debts and growth First, large public debts tend to reduce economic growth, which in turn means lower future incomes and greater difficulties for governments to finance spending. There is a large body of evidence linking elevated debt levels to subsequent periods of low growth performance.4 In brief, public debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 90% of GDP appear to reduce median real economic growth by 1%.5 While seemingly small, over an extended period of time this effect has a dramatic impact on income levels, and therefore on tax collections and on governments’ ability to finance their spending. Why do high debts reduce growth? As debts grow, governments face increasing interest burdens. To finance these, they may be forced to raise taxes to increasingly high levels that cause the economy to function less efficiently. Moreover, consumers may recognise that large debts imply higher future taxes and therefore cut spending in anticipation of these. Furthermore, historically, governments with large debts have frequently resorted to financial repression, that is, they have regulated the financial system in such a way as to artificially expand the demand for public debt. This reduces the interest rate at which debt is financed, sometimes to such an extent that real interest rates                                                 2  Disregarding the €5.8bn portion of the PCAR 2011 banking injection to AIB/EBS and ILP, the underlying deficit was –9.0% GDP. 3  The largest amounts of general government liabilities outstanding at end 2011 relating to banking injections (as a percentage of GDP) were recorded in Ireland (30%), Germany (11.2%), Netherlands (7.4%), Belgium (6.6%). 4 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2010), Reinhart and Rogoff (2012), Kumar and Woo (2010), Checherita and Rother (2010), Cecchetti et al. (2011) for a review of the evidence. 5  See Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) and Cecchetti et al. (2011). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  has fallen below zero.6 Of course, such regulations are a tax on the financial sector that to make it more difficult and more costly for other borrowers, in particular growing firms, to obtain credit. Furthermore, whenever debts are large, there is always a risk that if some adverse economic event occurred, the debts would become too large, forcing governments to restructure them. As a consequence of the resulting credit risk, the interest rate on public debt tends to increase as the debt-to-GDP ratio rises. This is problematic because yields on treasury bonds frequently serve as a floor for the interest rates at which firms and households can borrow. Large and growing government debts therefore tend to raise the cost at which the private sector can finance itself, slowing growth. In the euro area this has led to a situation in which firms and households in different countries face sharply divergent lending rates and conditions, depending on the fiscal situation of the Sovereign, despite that fact that the ECB sets a single short-term interest rate for the entire monetary union. This is evident in Figure 4 which shows that the increase in interest rates on new loans to households and businesses since the end of 2009 has been greatest in the peripheral euro area countries that have experienced the greatest fiscal difficulties. 3.2 Debts and inflation A further reason why large public debts are worrying is their tendency to end in high inflation.7 Historically, a lack of central bank independence has played a central role in that process. Governments with large deficits and debts in the past all too frequently managed to finance them by borrowing from the central bank, for instance by the central bank participating directly in auctions of new government debt. While this mechanism has played a crucial role in episodes of hyperinflation, it was also operative in the moderate inflation experienced in some European countries as late as in the 1970s and 1980s. But in modern economies there are a number of devices that make inflationary finance of this form impossible. Legal independence and a prohibition on government borrowing from central banks are of crucial importance. Furthermore, central banks operate with high levels of transparency that make it difficult for them to finance governments without the public becoming aware of this. Any attempt to extend credit directly to governments will therefore stoke inflation expectations, causing long interest rates to rise. In turn, this slows the economy, which offsets any benefit that would accrue to governments from such operations. Central bank independence and high levels of transparency thus serve as safeguards against the inflationary booms triggered by weak government finances. Transparency helps in another way. Many central banks communicate to the public what level of inflation they are aiming for. For instance, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England have adopted inflation targeting and announced what their targets for inflation are. Similarly, the ECB and the Swiss National Bank have announced that price stability is the overriding target for monetary policy and defined it numerically.8 Since the inflation objective is public knowledge, public scrutiny will force central banks to tighten monetary policy if inflation rises above target for a protracted period.                                                 6  Periods of negative interest rates were prevalent between 1945 and 1980, and more recently since 2008. Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011) find that real interest rates were negative roughly half of the time between 1945 and 1980. Annual liquidation of debt via negative real interest rates amounted to 3-4% of GDP per annum in the US and the UK. 7  There is a very long literature that establishes the close link between public deficits and inflation, see Sargent and Wallace (1981), Sims (1994), Woodford (1994, 2001), and Catao and Teronnes (2003). For a discussion of fiscal deficits and hyperinflation, see Sargent (1982) and Dornbusch and Fischer (1986). 8  The ECB’s objective for inflation is “below but close to two per cent.” Inflation surveys suggest that financial market participants believe that the ECB aims for inflation of about 1.7 to 1.9 % per annum. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  To my mind, the risk with high levels of public debt is not that average inflation rates will rise, but rather that central banks’ control of inflation will worsen. It is easy to see why. If inflation rises, the central bank must determine whether the increase is likely to be lasting or temporary.9 In the latter case, there is no need to increase interest rates since inflation will return to the previous level on its own. In practice, of course, it is difficult to know whether increases in inflation are permanent or transitory, so policy makers have to judge whether to raise interest rates immediately, or to wait and see how the situation evolves. If public debts are large, monetary policy makers may worry that higher interest rates will worsen the fiscal situation by increasing the cost of debt service and by slowing the economy and therefore dampening tax revenues. As a result, there is a risk that they may delay tightening policy in response to rising inflation, resulting in reduced inflation control and an amplification of the business cycle. It is therefore essential that public debts are reduced from the very high levels they have reached in many countries. 3.3 Some current problems The current difficulties experienced in the euro area illustrate two further reasons why large fiscal imbalances are problematic for monetary policy. The financial crisis has led real economic activity to weaken severely. At the same time, the rapid increase in public debts and the attendant difficulties in financing them have forced governments in a number of countries to tighten fiscal policy sharply to improve debt trajectories, further weakening economic activity.10 To offset the fall in demand, interest rates have been cut to almost zero in several countries. Nevertheless, growth has not returned and some central banks have therefore adopted unconventional monetary policy measures, whose effectiveness is not yet fully established, to support economic activity.11 Needless to say, it would have been natural to use fiscal policy to expand economic activity but that is impossible for the simple reason that the debts are already too large. A further problem is when government debt becomes so large as to trigger perceptions of credit risk, the functioning of financial markets deteriorates. Large government debts worsen the credit worthiness of banks and other holders of government debt. This causes money markets to function poorly, in particular since government debt serves as collateral for secured lending. Furthermore, it raises interest rates in the economy more broadly and raises banks’ funding costs. Finally, it reduces the collateral base of banks, which impairs banks’ access to central bank funding. These problems are evident in the euro area, where government debt levels and interest rates vary sharply between countries. The net effect is a weakening of the transmission of monetary policy and the creation of asymmetries across the monetary union. For this reason the ECB’s Governing Council adopted on September 6 a programme of Outright Monetary Transactions to mitigate these adverse effects.12 4. Institutional limits debts and deficits Since large public debts have highly adverse consequences for the economy, a number of institutional arrangements have been adopted to limit debt accumulation in the euro area and the European Union more broadly. It is useful to distinguish between rules on deficits and                                                 9  Temporary increases in inflation can arise from a wide variety of price level shocks such as increases in energy prices or exchange rate changes. 10  While tighter fiscal policy can in theory be stimulatory, in practice it more likely that it will be contractionary. See the literature on “expansionary fiscal contractions”, e.g., Alesina and Perotti (1995), and Giavazzi and Pagano (1990). 11  Such measures include an increase in the size, frequency and maturity of liquidity providing operations. A number of central banks have also purchased financial instruments issued by the public or private sector. 12  http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  debts and rules embedded in the institutional arrangements underpinning the ECB that are intended to make it impossible for governments to finance themselves by way of privileged access to central bank funding. 4.1 Rules on debts and deficits Since the establishment of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, the EU has introduced a number of fiscal rules. In 1997, the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) introduced rules intended to ensure fiscal discipline. These rules, which essentially limited fiscal deficits to 3% of GDP and public debts to 60% of GDP, however, suffered from poor compliance in the EU, even before the crisis took hold (Figure 5). The onset of the present fiscal crisis has exposed a number of weaknesses in the SGP framework including the lack of a definition of a “satisfactory pace” of debt reduction, poor enforcement mechanisms and the fact that the assessment of compliance was often based on overly optimistic underlying budgetary forecasts. In response to these deficiencies, a much strengthened SGP, known as the Six Pack, entered into force in November 2011, entailing a stronger preventative arm and with stronger corrective action requirements. The Six Pack ensures stricter application of the fiscal rules by defining quantitatively what constitutes a “significant deviation” from the Medium Term Objective (MTO). The MTO is the required structural balance which will ensure sustainability of the public finances, set out in the SGP. Furthermore, an Excessive Deficit Procedure can now be launched when a country’s debt is in excess of 60% of GDP, and not only on the basis of a deficit exceeding 3% of GDP, as was previously the case. Finally, financial sanctions for euro area members can now be imposed at an earlier stage and in a proportionate and graduated manner. Furthermore, the timely imposition of such sanctions is now more likely since the voting rules have been changed. The most recent articulation of EU fiscal rules is the Fiscal Compact (or Treaty on Stability, Governance and Co-ordination, TSGC), which requires countries to ensure convergence with their respective MTOs. It introduces a more explicit Budget Rule, whereby all States must strive for budgetary balance and achieve a structural deficit of no more than –0.5% of GDP.13 In addition, Member States are henceforth required to reduce the excess of their debt over 60% of GDP by an average of 1/20th per annum. Importantly, the Fiscal Compact requires that both budget rules must be implemented in national law, preferably in the constitution, that compliance is monitored by independent institutions and that an automatic correction mechanism is put in place to correct divergences from these rules. It is interesting to note in passing that many of these developments in the fiscal sphere – the introduction of numerical objectives for deficits and debt, written down in law, and with some involvement of independent monitors – that limit governments’ ability to run large deficits are similar to changes introduced to monetary policy frameworks in recent years. Thus, by now it is common for the legal acts that govern central banks to indicate that price stability is the overriding objective for monetary policy and to define it in numerical terms. Moreover, through the adoption of high levels of transparency, central banks have made it easier for outside observers to monitor their conduct of policy. 4.2 Regulations concerning the ECB The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union contains two Articles intended to promote monetary stability. This is achieved by removing any risk of pressure from national governments to force central banks to finance fiscal imbalances. Specifically, Article 123 prohibits “overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the European Central Bank or with the central banks of the Member States … in favour of … central governments, regional, local or other public authorities” and “the purchase directly from them by the                                                 13  This ceiling excludes one-off measures and cyclical effects. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  European Central Bank or national central banks of debt instruments.” Furthermore, Article 124 prohibits any measure, not based on prudential considerations, that grants central governments, regional, local or other public authorities privileged access to financial institutions. However, these articles do not prohibit the ECB from operating in financial markets by buying or selling marketable instruments, including government debt.14 That is of course natural. In pursuing their statutory objectives central banks operate in a range of financial markets, particularly in government debt markets, since these are large and liquid and since government debt has historically been seen as risk free. Such operations of course also augment the demand for public debt, thereby reducing the interest rate on the debt and making it easier for governments to finance themselves. But this effect is entirely incidental to monetary policy. 5. Reducing public debts Public debts are currently very large in many countries and must be reduced. The European Union has adopted a number of measures that restrict governments’ ability to run deficits and require many of them to reduce public debt. But how will these debts be reduced? What mechanism should be relied on? As a preliminary, it is useful to recall that there are many historical examples of episodes in which public debts have risen to very high levels. Both after World War I and World War II public debts reached levels as high or even higher than observed in some countries today. However, these debts were, in many cases, soon reduced sharply. To see how public debts can be reduced, note that the growth of the debt-to-nominal GDP ratio depends on three factors. 1. Interest rates: the higher the interest rate, the greater the cost of debt service. 2. Real GDP growth and inflation: the faster growth of real GDP and the higher the rate of inflation, the greater the growth in nominal GDP and thus tax revenues. 3. Primary (or non-interest) budget deficit: the larger the deficit, the greater the rate of growth of the debt.15 One way to reduce debts is thus to seek to reduce the interest rate on the debt below the market level through regulation. For instance, interest rate ceilings or requirements that increase banks’ and other financial institutions’ demand for public debt can be used to reduce the interest rate burden. Financial repression of this form was common after World War 2 and led to rapid contractions in debt/GDP ratios. Of course, such regulations merely amount to taxation of the holders of public debt. While it may facilitate debt reduction, it will lead financial markets to worry that it may happen again, and therefore cause them to demand higher interest rates to purchase government debt in the future. Thus, reducing the debt in this way may not be desirable. In any case, it presumes a regulatory environment that is very different from that of today. I thus don’t think that it will play much of a role in reducing the current high debt levels. A second strategy is to seek to increase the growth rate of nominal GDP. This mechanism also played an important role in debt reduction after World War 2, as growth picked up sharply in the 1950s and 1960s and inflation was high during the Korean war boom in the                                                 14  See Article 18 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank, Protocol 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). 15  Debts may change even if the deficit is zero, e.g., because of a transfer of local government debt to the national government or a restructuring of the public debt. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  early 1950s. While I expect many governments to adopt structural reforms that increase real GDP growth in the coming decade, large debts tend to reduce growth. It therefore seems unlikely that growth on its own can be relied on to restore fiscal stability. Higher inflation could in theory also reduce debts. However, the adverse consequences for economic performance of high and variable inflation are now better known than during previous periods of high debt. Moreover, inflation is a tax. While parliaments have the power to introduce taxes, central banks should not. Relying on inflation for debt reduction is difficult in a democratic society. Moreover, in the euro area and elsewhere, monetary policy is set with the objective of stabilising inflation at low levels and it would be very undesirable to change that objective. Overall, I therefore do not think that economies can grow or inflate away the debt with the ease to which they may have done so in the past. This leaves the third mechanism, primary surpluses, as the only way in which debts can be reduced. Primary surpluses can be achieved either by reducing spending or by raising taxes. While economic research suggests that fiscal stabilisation efforts that rely on expenditure cuts are more likely to be successful than those that rely on revenue increases16, precisely how the necessary budget surpluses are achieved is entirely a matter for elected parliaments to decide since fiscal policy has large redistributional effects. My point here is simply that debts must be reduced through budgetary surpluses since the other avenues for debt reduction are closed. Of course, the 29 June EU Summit opened another possible avenue for debt reduction through the use of the ESM to directly recapitalise banks.17 A decision to recapitalise banks directly, as opposed to via the sovereign as had previously been the favoured method, would reduce the burden on already stressed sovereigns and avoid the reinforcement of the sovereign-bank link that has been evident in a number of countries. Will monetary policy hinder or facilitate governments’ efforts to reduce debts? While monetary policy is best set independently, I believe that a monetary policy that is focussed on price stability will make it easier for governments to reduce debt. The reason is simple. It seems unavoidable that tighter fiscal policy will restrict overall demand for goods and services in the economy. In turn this will tend to reduce inflation pressures. To prevent inflation from falling too low, it seems likely that many central banks will maintain interest rates at low levels for an extended period of time, which will support growth and debt reduction. 6. Conclusions Public debt in a number of countries has risen sharply during the financial crisis and has now reached very high levels. As a consequence, growth is likely to be lower than it otherwise would have been, in turn making it more difficult to reduce debt. But letting debts remain at this high level is not an option. While the exact path of fiscal adjustment in the immediate future will vary in light of country-specific circumstances, and in the case of Ireland will be agreed with the Troika, not reducing debt levels will have a detrimental effect on income and that effect will grow over time. It may also increase the risk of a deterioration of central banks’ inflation control, and harm the functioning of financial markets. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that the current very high levels of public debts will melt away through low interest rates, rapid growth or inflation. Regardless of any relief that a movement towards banking union and any potential benefits which direct ESM bank recapitalisation could deliver, countries need to restore more stable fiscal balances.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Patrick Honohan: Reflections on corporate restructuring in Ireland Address by Mr Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Corporate Restructuring Summit, Dublin, 27 September 2012. *      *      * It would be an understatement to say that corporate restructuring is a topical issue for Ireland these days, though it is worth remembering that a dynamic economy entails a continuous process of corporate restructuring and not just in bad times. In normal times firms adapt in part through internal reorganisations, including product and process innovation. But the individual firm does not always have what it takes to reinvent itself in response to major changes in technology and competition, and then its survival is subject to takeover, merger, or, in the case it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, to various forms of asset or liability restructuring.  The need for corporate restructuring in Ireland today Right now, though, an extraordinarily large number of firms in Ireland have been experiencing financial distress typically as a result of the deep domestic and (less deep but equally protracted) international downturn in demand, or because of their unwise property investments. An extended period of intensive corporate restructuring has begun. This is most conspicuous for the big property development companies, but there are many others.  Much of this restructuring has so far come through firm exit altogether. CSO surveys covering about half of the economy, and most of the non-agricultural business sector, throw some quantitative light on what’s been happening (Table 1). The number of firms counted by the CSO in the census of Industrial Enterprises fell from about 5600 to under 4800 between 2008 and 2010, the worst period of the crisis and the latest for which data is available. Almost no subsector was spared. This proportionate decline, of over 14% in numbers of industrial firms, is not too far from the decline in aggregate employment in that sector (17%). The story is broadly similar in Construction and in Services, especially if one excludes the large number of very small firms in these sectors. Indeed, the number of construction firms employing more than 20 persons has almost halved, with their employment falling by almost two-thirds.  Broadly speaking, the relatively small change in the average employment per firm seen in the data suggests that the downturn has not favoured large firms over small, and also that the employment decline has been driven more by firm closure than by partial lay-offs. Even after such a big shakeout, many of the remaining firms are in a weakened financial condition, and may need balance sheet as well as organisational restructuring in order to survive and prosper. Recent research1 at the Central Bank has confirmed that stressed balance sheets are clear early warning signs of subsequent loan default. But the research also indicates that some well-run firms can ride these problems out, notably if they are being run by an experienced owner that has been with the firm through other ups and downs.  Many balance sheets are stressed because of unwise property investments made on the side of a viable non-property business. Restructuring these balance sheets without losing the true value of the resources, human, technological and physical, that are now engaged in each firm’s core business, is a key challenge for corporate restructuring in Ireland today. Overall, this is a challenge that will absorb the efforts of banks, law firms, and – that most elusive of professions, well-represented here today – workout specialists.                                                 1 Cf.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The modern economy is driven by firms: they generate the bulk of employment, and the output that supports the wages and salaries, as well as feeding directly and indirectly into the tax revenue needed to support the social and economic infrastructure that underpins all of economic activity. Healthy firms are a prerequisite for a growing economy that creates jobs. Too many of even the surviving Irish firms have not yet recovered from the crash and need restructuring. Corporate failures in the last big downturn in Ireland Restructuring of distressed companies is not a new phenomenon in Ireland or anywhere else. Reflecting on Ireland’s experience with corporate financial distress over the years, many resonant names come to mind. Companies fail in good times as well as bad times, but it is the downturns that see the vast bulk of corporate restructuring business. The last big downturn in Ireland was in the 1980s. And I well remember some of the big names that got into trouble in those days and were either helped or not helped by the Government of the day.  Take Irish Shipping, for example, which got caught up in over-ambitious expansion and over-indebtedness as it built a large fleet of leased vessels well beyond that company’s traditional goal, which aimed at controlling sufficient tonnage to avoid Ireland having to rely on foreign companies to deliver essential supplies in time of war. Though the deficiency of Irish Shipping – probably well under €0.5 billion in today’s money – may seem dwarfed by the banking losses of recent years, it was too much for the Government to take on (even though it owned the firm) and Irish Shipping was liquidated.  Other high profile cases of the 1980s, such as Dublin Gas, Irish Steel, and the two big general insurance companies ICI and PMPA, saw public money poured in to protect what were seen as essential services.  The 1990s saw the even larger failures of the meat concern Goodman International and of the aircraft leasing company GPA. The latter was a huge global operation, owning hundreds of aircraft and exploiting a taxation arbitrage as well as know-how about the demand and supply conditions in the aviation industry. But it became overstretched and over-indebted and was unable to raise the equity capital which would have allowed it to ride out a cyclical downturn: it was dismembered and mainly sold to a US company. Some of these large failures reflected insufficiently controlled over-expansion; others a process of senescence leaving the company prone to bankruptcy as soon as the next economic downturn came along. In each case, it generally fell to the bankers to pull the plug. It is usually they who have to refuse further accommodation, to stop the drain of unrecoverable resources.  Interestingly, in several of the large historic cases mentioned, Irish banks did not find themselves as heavily exposed as one might have expected. Perhaps the Irish banks had a closer view and a better understanding of the potential risks back then, or perhaps there were other reasons, but other creditors, including banks abroad, seem to have absorbed or been exposed to the largest losses in several of these failures. Perhaps that experience was one of the ingredients contributing to embolden the Irish banks to feel invulnerable to downturns. Perhaps one day we will fully understand just how fundamental decision-making in the banks (during the property bubble) ended up so insulated from adequate attention to basic risk-controls – and indeed in the end from common sense! Optimal restructuring When restructuring works well, the assets of the failing firm, along with the human capital embodied in its employees, will find a good alternative use. Receivers and liquidators will certainly have worked to get a good price for the physical assets. Aircraft and ships owned by GPA and Irish Shipping may have been laid-up for a while, but most found employment 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  later. Employees did not always fare as well. The collapses often happened during periods of weak global activity associated with levels of unemployment at home and abroad that make it hard for displaced workers to get a job. The plight of the misfortunate former Irish Shipping workers has rightly been highlighted.  There are inherent conflicts of interest between different stakeholders in a restructuring though, and not all work-outs do contribute to overall economic efficiency. Indeed, sometimes key protagonists may be aiming to build a monopoly or attempting aggressive risk-shifting. That’s why public policy, for example, competition policy, or mergers and monopolies policy, may need to be activated.  In the past, Governments have sometimes got involved more directly. For example, when Irish Steel looked like closing, the prospect of so many workers being displaced into the depressed labour market conditions of the mid-1980s, perhaps to remain on the dole for years, weighed with the Government of the time in its decision to provide funds to keep that firm going for some years more by subsidising its activities. But a greater awareness of the opportunity costs of Government rescues of companies has reduced their frequency over the years. Propping up a doomed company is not always good even for those who seem to benefit. Few now bemoan the demise of the Irish car assembly business. Indeed, a decade after that business collapsed following the Anglo Irish free trade agreement, manufacturers of car parts for export employed more people than the assembly industry did in re-assembling CKD (completely knocked down) car kits. Making sure it’s done well – avoiding delay and dealing with owners Faced with cleaning up the post-crisis mess, procrastination is an ever-present cancer. Hoping something will turn up is a natural reaction when the alternative is facing up to the inevitable and taking steps that crystallize losses and directly affect the stakeholders of firms including the employees and trade creditors. But the hidden consequences of procrastination impose costs elsewhere in the economy – costs that destroy even more jobs elsewhere. That was the experience of Japan in the 1990s, and Ireland can’t afford to suffer a similar protracted delay. An unhealthy firm balance sheet means that access is denied to new funding that can enable expansion, upgrading or innovative investment that could generate output and employment growth. Indeed, especially in the current crisis which is driven by balance sheet problems more than operating account problems, delaying the financial restructuring is likely to threaten jobs in the distressed company itself, as well as imposing indirect costs on those dependent on other companies.  Owners will resist restructuring, especially when it means that they stand to lose control over some or all of the business. They have of course a large financial, and not seldom emotional, interest in retaining their position and may also think that only they have the expertise to make the most of the assets of the company. In some instances, creditors will agree with this proposition. In his book,2 Professor Cahill suggests that the lending banks (most of them foreign) may have found it a “bitter pill” to retain the CEO of Goodman International in executive control and with a sizeable equity stake in the restructured company. Other high-profile cases saw the more conventional presumption that the old shareholders and top management will go. That has been the basic modus operandi of the Government in the current banking crisis as far as the banks are concerned. In the case of NAMA, dealing as they are with a huge number of property-owners and developers, the modus operandi to date appears to reflect a kind of extended triage of their borrowers, with some being kept on, and others eventually not.                                                  2 In refreshing my memory on these cases, I have found Edward Cahill’s Corporate Financial Crisis in Ireland (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1997) of great assistance. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Asset management companies or in-house operation of the banks? Some may find irony in the fact the banks are among the main actors in driving restructuring. After all, they themselves have experienced some of the most far-reaching balance sheet restructuring, with their shareholders wiped-out and subordinated debt-holders also nursing losses, and central bank lending filling the hole left by other departing creditors. That job losses in the banking sector have not to date been as bad as the economy on average reflects the Government’s decision to step in and keep the operations of the banks going because of the services they provided.  (Incurring by far the biggest ever costs seen in corporate restructuring, the Government also tried to avoid a wider financial instability as well as the loss of credit standing that would have accompanied losses hitting depositors and other creditors, but that story, which began exactly four years ago today, has been the main theme on many other occasions and so I will not dwell on it here).  Anyway, despite all of this, the banks have also had to change gear and become heavily involved in loan recovery and the associated task of balance sheet restructuring of many of their distressed corporate (and individual) customers.  But can one improve on having the banks as the engineers of restructuring? This question was widely discussed around the turn of the millennium, as researchers and practitioners tried to draw lessons applicable to the East Asia crisis (which hit half a dozen rapidly growing countries in 1997–8 and left a debris of corporate insolvencies), and from the earlier experience of banking crises in Japan, Scandinavia and the United States, as well as some other developing countries cases. The broad conclusion from this debate3 was that centralised asset management companies, as in Sweden and with the US Resolution Trust Corporation, can work well where what needs to be restructured is mainly a class of property companies. This is because the main assets of the companies are relatively easily transferred and do not depend on a specialised production chain, patents, firm-specific know how and so on. To overstate somewhat, the value of real estate may, especially in a downturn, be pretty much independent of who manages it. In a rising market, the Swedes managed to do well in realizing their property portfolio over time. The international literature also warns, however, that large state-owned AMCs can become vulnerable to improper political pressure, especially where large and prominent firms have become bankrupt. Fortunately there is no evidence of such pressure occurring in respect of NAMA in the current Irish crisis, and indeed the legislation setting up NAMA has built in protections against such pressures.  On the other hand, non-property related distress may (according to the international research) best be managed by the banks themselves. Specific company know-how can help in devising the best solutions for maximising the value of the firm’s assets – provided that the restructuring process can be insulated from the denial and over-optimism that may have contributed to poor loan underwriting in the first place. The banks in turn need to be provided with sufficient capital to allow them to fearlessly accept and crystallise the unavoidable loan-losses, sufficient liquidity to be able to provide further financing to set the restructured firm back onto a healthy growth path, and eventually move it out of the limbo of financial distress. As against all of this, it has to be acknowledged that few bank staff startout with the skill-set needed to implement corporate restructuring: it is a very different business to loan underwriting. And a bank which diverts many of its most effective staff into such activities may not be so effective in fostering new lending relationships.                                                 3 Cf., for example, Marinela E. Dado and Daniela Klingebiel, “Decentralized Creditor-Led Corporate Restructuring: Cross-Country Experience.” World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2901, October 2002. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Ireland’s institutional arrangements for dealing with the situation to date do seem to mirror this international consensus about the most appropriate institutional arrangements: NAMA for the big property loans, the banks for the remaining bad loans, and massive recapitalisation of, and extensive liquidity provision to, the banks. The differences are ones of scale rather than design. In particular, the losses destabilised the finances of the State, limiting its ability to react.  There have been suggestions that further blocks of banking assets could be moved off the balance sheet of the main banks. Certainly the banks have large blocks of hard-to-value and hard-to-sell assets on their balance sheets which are a drag on the investability of the banks because of the tail-risk of further losses that they embody and because they contribute to the over-scaling of the banks.  In practical terms, though, the management of numerous SME assets is a task for a large and decentralised operation. The operational risk of transferring this task to another agency would be very considerable. Even if ultimate ownership of the loan assets might possibly be shifted at some point in order to improve the balance sheets of the banks and hence their standing in wholesale markets, I foresee that they would in practice continue to manage most of the restructurings. One of the recommendations of the literature is that the private sector should be involved as much as practical in the restructuring process. Private sector restructuring specialists can have the high-powered incentives to find quick and profitable solutions. Of course the process is costly. Private-equity firms will buy distressed assets only at a discount to what they think they can achieve when restructured and resold. Their time horizon is relatively short and their return thresholds high. Where it is a question of cleaning up a privately-owned bank, these costs simply imply a transfer within the private sector. But if the private shareholders have already been wiped-out, it is the State that will bear the costs. Its decision on these matters must therefore balance the prospect of a more effective restructuring by private firms against the costs that this will impose. Private sector solutions have not been neglected in the Irish case. To date there has been by considerable deleveraging of the banks to the private sector: asset sales totalling €32 billion in the past three years – most of them abroad.  Finding grand solutions that improve the situation is thus not easy. But that is not a reason for delay. On the contrary, every month that passes for an un-restructured distressed corporate is an energy-sapping lost opportunity for recovery. Urged by the Central Bank as regulator, the banks have been building their internal capacities through hiring, training and education, to deal with the situation. There is now an improved understanding of how best to deal with the numerous cases of distressed SME borrowers. This includes such matters as collecting adequate borrower information: adopting a realistic approach to post-restructuring viability calculations; ensuring time-bound execution in accordance with concrete implementation guidelines; quantified tracking of the progress in processing cases and, procedures for quality assurance. Yet the banks know they have not made sufficient progress in turning that understanding into a robust mechanism at scale for delivering an adequate stream of realistic and viable restructurings.  It’s often not just a question of financial (balance sheet) restructuring, but also the need for operational restructuring, which is something which generally goes well beyond the skill-set of the traditional lender. Often there is a personal guarantee involved, so the owners will not be fully off the hook: the new personal insolvency legislation should provide a backstop for that element. Thousands of cases need to be dealt with decisively in such a manner. This is truly a daunting organisational challenge for the banks, but one to which, encouraged and pressed by the Central Bank, they are now stepping up. But, as I am sure they will themselves acknowledge, there is much work to be done and progress to date has been painfully slow. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Given the large number of firms still under pressure, implementation of an effective and speedy but surgical approach to corporate restructuring could have a big impact. By reinvigorating the Irish business sector, it would ultimately help boost economy-wide employment. Requiring unusual and scarce skills and judgment, this is a task which urgently deserves heightened attention.     
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Josef Bonnici: An alternative model for banking in Malta – a case for setting up a cooperative bank in Maltese economic realities Address by Professor Josef Bonnici, Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, at the Seminar on “Cooperative banking”, Valletta 27 September 2012. *      *      * Honourable Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.  As the previous speakers have shown, cooperative banks, though not often in the news, in these times perhaps thankfully, have a considerable presence in most countries, particularly, but not only, in European countries. Indeed, data for 2010 show that in Europe cooperative banks hold a market share of over 20% of deposits and a similar market share for loans. Their presence is particularly marked in France, where the three cooperative banking groups (Credit Agricole, BPCE and Credit Mutuel) account for some 50% of the market share for loans and 60% of that for deposits. There is also a significant presence in Italy, where they enjoy a market share of 34% of deposits and 30% for loans; in Germany, where they have a market share of 19% for deposits and 16% for loans; in the Netherlands, with a market share of 43% of deposits and 30% for loans; and in Finland, with a market share of 34% for deposits and 32% for loans. They include, apart from the well-known French banks already mentioned, such respected names as Rabobank in Holland and the Raiffeissen banks in Germany. Cooperative banks also have a significant presence in South Korea, Japan, Canada, Morocco, Mexico and Brazil.  So the question immediately arises: how come that no such institution has ever been set up in Malta? After all one would have thought that the idea of cooperation and solidarity, and the spirit of the Seven Basic Principles of the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) would have a strong appeal in Malta. These seven principles consist of: voluntary and open membership; democratic member control; member economic participation; autonomy and independence; education, training and information of members and employees; cooperation with other cooperatives; and, especially, concern for the community. Moreover, we do have cooperatives in other spheres of activity here, and these have been around for some time.  Indeed, the start of the cooperative movement in Malta dates back to the later years of the 19th century (around 1884), and the first form of legislation regulating cooperatives here  – the Cooperative Societies Ordinance 1946 – came into effect on 12th December of that year. Initially the movement took root in the agriculture and fisheries sector, which in those times employed a significant part of the population. But later, as Malta developed socially and economically, the movement continued to flourish and to expand, and new cooperatives were set up in practically every sector of the economy. Indeed, there are currently some 60 cooperatives in Malta, with over 5000 members, spread over a wide range of activities. These include the traditional agriculture and fisheries sector, transport and media, management and marketing consultancy services, wholesale, health, maritime, archaeology, restoration, fair trade, tourism, youth services and community care. Our cooperatives are affiliated with the International Cooperatives Alliance (ICA), and so abide by the Seven Basic Principles established by the Alliance mentioned previously.  Banks too have been with us for a long time. Indeed one can trace the origins of banking in Malta to the times of the Knights of St John, though more rapid development took place under British rule, helped by the island’s strategic and central position in the British Empire. In 1826, the Anglo-Egyptian Bank started operations here, and through a series of mergers and acquisitions this later became Barclay’s Bank DCO (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), which soon established an extensive branch network on the island. A number of smaller Maltese-owned banks were also established, and some of these eventually merged to become the National Bank of Malta, which also established a branch network. There followed a period when these two major banks were nationalised, but following the subsequent 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  liberalisation of the economy they were again privatised, with the Government retaining only a 25% share in Bank of Valletta. More banks began to operate here after Malta joined the European Union, but these were all commercial, joint stock banks. No one, till recently, seems to have thought of setting up a cooperative bank in Malta.  The distinctive characteristic of cooperative banks, as previous speakers have explained, is that they are banking entities that, for the most part, are owned by their members. The latter are both owners and customers of their bank. But this is not their only characteristic. Generally, cooperative banks are deeply rooted in their regions or communities. They are very much involved in local development and contribute to the sustainable development of their communities, because their members and officers generally belong to the communities in which they operate. Their main concern is not to make spectacular short-term gains for a small group of shareholders, but the eradication of poverty and the long-term development of the regions where they operate. Hence they are retail, not wholesale banks, and they abide by that old maxim of banking: know your customer. While helping first time buyers to buy their own homes by granting mortgages, for instance, they do not trade in mortgages.  Perhaps it is precisely because our local banks share so many of these characteristics with the cooperative banks that the need to set up a cooperative bank proper has never so far been felt here. In fact, our established banks are also – almost of necessity, given Malta’s small size – deeply rooted in the local community, and are principally geared to contribute to the sustainable development of that community. They too are predominantly retail, not wholesale banks, operating a very traditional business model, one that has largely shielded them from the problems of the international financial turmoil of these last years. They take deposits from (mainly) small local savers and make loans to (mainly) small or medium-sized local businesses and help people buy their houses by providing mortgages. Their officers, like those of the cooperative banks elsewhere, belong to the community in which they operate and generally know their customers and the local environment. In addition, one of them is involved in the European Investment Fund’s Jeremie programme, a programme designed specifically to help small and medium sized enterprises. The bank in question has committed over EUR 5 million over a period of three years to some 280 local SME beneficiaries under the programme.  Indeed, one could say that it is mainly in their ownership structure that the local commercial banks, which are joint stock (or “shareholder value”) banks, differ from cooperative banks. In all other respects they are not very different. So that leaves us with the question: is there or is there not scope for setting up a cooperative bank in Malta? Is there or isn’t there space for such an institution? Or is the local market too small, while our community is being adequately served by the banks already operating here?  I think it is not for me to answer these questions. But the point has been made, and I think it is a valid point, that competition – so necessary to ensure that customers get the best possible service at the least possible price – depends more heavily on the variety of business models rather than on having a large number of institutions giving roughly the same kind of services in more-or-less the same way. Increased competition does not result from just adding more firms with the same business model, but also, indeed perhaps more, by adding firms with different business models. Where there is more diversity, and where there are more alternatives to choose from, competition is enhanced and its benefits increased.  Perhaps I should point out that several decades ago there were many people, including many of the local business community, who were afraid to approach a bank for a loan. They were prepared to give and receive credit directly to and from each other, believing they were neither charging nor being charged interest, but not to borrow from a bank that explicitly charged interest and made a profit “at their expense”. Never mind that the implicit rate of interest in the credit being given and received in this way was probably higher than that being charged by the banks. I should not be at all surprised if there were still people around, potential entrepreneurs, who still reasoned that way, and who therefore may be “financially 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  excluded” from the economy. Might this perhaps be a niche which a cooperative bank, setting up shop here, might be able to exploit?  Furthermore, I think that perhaps I should modify an observation I made earlier: namely, that the need to set up a cooperative bank in Malta has never so far been felt. On second thoughts, perhaps, this is not entirely true. For one of our smaller banks, one that, not surprisingly, was founded by a Jesuit priest in 1910, actually did begin life as a cooperative society. It was originally called the Lega dell’ Apostolato della Preghiera, and its main aims were the setting up of a number of initiatives, all with an underlying social purpose. These included: a savings bank, intended to instil habits of thrift among the working classes; a mutual benefit society; a printing press; the publication of a Maltese language periodical; an evening school for the teaching of languages, music and crafts; an emigration bureau to help Maltese citizens wishing to settle in other countries; schemes for the free provision of food, medicines and medical care to the needy; a public lotto office; and a recreational club for members. It – or at least the savings bank part of its operations – only became a private limited company as recently as 1970, just before Malta’s first Banking Act was enacted. And this, perhaps, should give us a clue as to why we do not have a Maltese cooperative bank today. Perhaps it is not because there is no scope for one, because there is no niche to be exploited, but because our legislative framework, as it has evolved so far, doesn’t permit it!  For the truth of the matter is that while we have laws governing banking activities and a law governing cooperatives in Malta, we do not have laws governing cooperative banks! In our current legislative framework, the latter seem to fall between two stools. Our Banking Act envisages only joint stock banks, that is banks whose customers are not their owners, while the law governing cooperative societies in Malta, though it provides for the establishment of a fund into which all registered cooperatives are obliged to deposit 5% of their annual operating surplus to help pay for research and the education and training of their members and the general development of the cooperative movement, does not provide for the establishment of cooperative banks – that is institutions that are licensed to accept deposits and make loans. Clearly, for such a bank, or banks, to be able to be established here, either our Banking Act, or the law governing Cooperative Societies, or both, will have to be amended. But this is precisely what Minister Azzopardi said he has proposed to do in his introductory speech: to amend the relevant legislation. Then, once the amendments being proposed by the Minister come into force, we will be in a better position to judge whether or not there is scope for setting up a cooperative bank in Malta. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Paul Fisher: Developments in financial markets, monetary and macroprudential policy Speech by Mr Paul Fisher, Executive Director for Markets of the Bank of England, at Richmond University, London, 25 September 2012. *      *      * When I gave a speech about the state of financial markets in June 2011, I talked about a process of healing as markets recovered from the Great Recession.1 But since then the patient has not regained anything like a full state of health. In this lecture today, I want to offer a second opinion on the condition of financial markets. But also, as a member of both the Monetary Policy Committee and the Financial Policy Committee, I want to talk about aspects of the monetary and macroprudential policies which are part of the medicine. In particular I want to give some background to a recent initiative by the Bank of England and HM Treasury to revive the economy, the Funding for Lending Scheme. Financial markets have continued to be buffeted by global events over the past year. In particular, the sovereign crisis in the euro area became more acute. It suffered a serious lurch in mid-July 2011 when confidence in Italian politics evaporated and Italian and Spanish sovereign yields rocketed to record euro-era highs (Chart 1). What followed was alarming – a growing fragmentation of euro zone markets as participants positioned themselves to minimise risk in the event of euro break-up. And the story has become more focussed on Spain than Italy. But that has not been the only shock markets have had to cope with.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Growth in Europe has been anaemic at best (Chart 2). Growth in the US has been a bit stronger but not enough to reduce an elevated unemployment rate. And we have seen indications of a slowdown in China and other large EMEs. Perhaps the most striking thing about this is the degree of co-movement in GDP growth rates across economies. In reaction to the deteriorating outlook, we have seen a stream of policy actions, mostly by central banks as many fiscal authorities have felt constrained by excessive debt, deficits or both (at least in the western hemisphere). Last November, the ECB announced three-year term repos, in unlimited scale. And more recently details of their proposed Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). In the United States there is to be more quantitative easing (QE), including open-ended purchases of RMBS. In Japan, just last week we saw a large expansion of their asset purchase programme. In the United Kingdom we have been undertaking extra QE since October 2011 and earlier this summer we activated for the first time our new contingent facility of six month repos against a broad range of collateral – what we call the Extended Collateral Term Repo facility or ECTRs. That was intended to act as a backstop should the risks in Europe deepen and crystallise. Usage has declined sharply since the first two operations suggesting that the degree of stress is not that great at the moment. More recently the Bank and HM Treasury jointly launched the Funding for Lending Scheme (the FLS) – of which more later. The full list of policy actions is much, much longer of course. The length of that list reflects the seriousness of the economic situation and the constrained ability of fiscal authorities. In the world of central banking, unconventional policies are the new normal. At least for now. Financial markets have not just been suffering from external shocks. A series of home-made disasters have also rocked the sector. The UBS “rogue trader”, the losses at JP Morgan’s Chief Investment Office, LIBOR manipulation at Barclays (with others under investigation) and the mis-selling of PPI. These scandals have not so far been institution-threatening, but coming on top of the financial and macroeconomic crisis to date, they have helped to suck confidence from the financial sector just when it might otherwise have been recovering. Chart 3 shows a “heat map” of markets generated by colleagues in the Financial Stability area of the Bank. This chart uses indicators such as issuance amounts and bid-ask spreads to monitor market conditions. Red indicates a non-functioning market. The process of “healing” since 2008/09 that I referred to a year ago is clear. But then the improvement plateaus and starts to reverse in mid-2011. A year ago it looked like conditions were starting to revert to those of late 2008. As the managers of the UK’s foreign exchange reserves we experienced some of these deteriorating conditions at first hand. (It is a neglected point that the Bank of England is a significant participant in the market on behalf of HM Treasury through reserves management operations, as well as being the monetary authority for sterling markets.)  In policy meetings during the Autumn of 2011, I started to warn of a growing state of dysfunction as some markets – such as for bank funding – closed completely, others saw bid-offer spreads widen and those firms perceived to be weak found their credit lines from fellow banks being cut. The situation was growing very dangerous. To a large extent it was the ECB three-year LTROs which dealt with that dysfunction – leading to the reopening of bank funding markets in particular.

(b) Updated to end-August 2012.  Market functioning in 2012 has developed in a rather unexpected way. Despite regular crisis points and the fading of the LTRO effect, we have seen (implied) volatility and skews derived from options prices fall to post-crisis lows across a range of markets (Chart 4). One might have thought that the heightened sense of uncertainty about economic developments would lead to the opposite. What has been going on? I think there are several influences pushing down on market volatility. One is the perception that central banks are on permanent standby to deal with tail risks. Another might be a realisation that certain types of financial protection are not worth having: for example if the counterparty selling the insurance (eg options or CDS) might not survive the tail risk it is selling protection against. And it has been seen as better not to take such risks rather than to try and hedge them. So demand for some types of protection may have fallen for that reason. A further observation is that market participants have to some extent grown accustomed to the perpetual state of crisis and decided that the show – albeit a chaste and less spectacular show – must go on. There are large sums of money arising from savings or other cash balances which must be (re-)invested somewhere. Returns from the safest sovereign assets have been driven to very low yields. And even some risky assets – like bank debt – are getting scarcer as a result of policy actions, directly or indirectly. Where are asset managers putting the money?

There has been a renewed search for investible assets going on. Not the old, indiscriminate, invest-in-anything-with-a-high-return-and-ask-no-questions “search-for-yield”. It has so far been a much more calculated hunt. Not so much for return on capital but return of capital. Credit and liquidity risks are now being much more thoroughly appraised. In particular, investment firms have been avoiding the least liquid products. So equity-linked structured notes, for example, have been out of fashion. High yield (non-financial) corporate bonds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have both been in. But since the risks in some ETFs were highlighted – by the UK’s new Financial Policy Committee amongst others – some of the more complicated ETFs and those with opaque securities lending programmes, have faded somewhat. It is not that investors are avoiding all credit risk – where it can be properly assessed and a diversified portfolio is possible. For example, the end-investor demand for corporate credit ex-financials is generally very strong. The announcement of OMTs by the ECB and the other announcements by the US Fed and the Bank of Japan, appear to have led to a collective sigh of relief in recent weeks. Yields on Spanish and Italian debt have fallen since the announcement – by 100bps or so at 10 years – and equity markets are up. I hope that the ECB action lays the foundation for a successful resolution of the European debt crisis. The view of markets so far is positive in that regard. I would caution, however, that we have been here before. Along with every other market participant I hope that this time will be different. But central banks cannot solve fundamental problems in the real economy, even using unconventional measures – they can only give the time and space for governments and private sector agents to do so. There will now be a 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  period of opportunity for the politicians of Europe to get on with making the changes that would really make a long-term difference, such as improving competitiveness in the countries of southern Europe. To summarise my assessment of markets at this point I would no longer say that they are healing. Rather, markets are scarring over – adapting and evolving to the new environment. No one is quite sure where the process will end, but the industry has a job to do, including investing large sums of money here and now. And in some fashion, reflecting the enhanced perceptions of risk, that will continue. Given what happened in financial markets, it is no surprise that there are policy initiatives on financial market regulation everywhere one chooses to look: Dodd-Frank in the US; EMIR, Solvency II and the Crisis Management Directive in the EU; the Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) proposals in the UK; the new Basel 3 rules on capital and liquidity globally (CRD IV in Europe), and numerous initiatives under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board including defining the key attributes for effective resolution regimes. The full list of new rules is much, much longer of course. Despite the variety of authorities involved, I believe there is a common thread behind the policy reactions. Many of the changes have been prompted by perceived excesses in much of the financial sector. But in my view, the motivation is not, and should not be, to seek some kind of public revenge. The simplest way to understand all these initiatives is that their main collective purpose is to avoid public money being needed in future to bail out the financial sector. Even though some bail outs have ultimately led to profits being made, the sense of injustice around this use of public money makes it extremely unpopular. Solving the “too big to fail” problem remains key. Meanwhile a debate has been growing as a result of the slow recovery. Is regulation itself directly responsible for restraining credit and hence limiting economic growth? I have recently argued that this should not be so.2 Safe and sound credit institutions are a necessary part of generating sustainable economic growth. If banks hold more capital than they did pre-crisis and are less levered, then they will be in a more secure position to provide credit to support the real economy. Switzerland has made a practical demonstration of the proposition that making banks hold more capital can actually lead to those banks having higher equity prices and lower funding costs. We have recently witnessed an example where capital raising by a Swiss bank was followed by its equity price rising (and its CDS premium fell) on both a relative and absolute basis. Just as in the debate about output and inflation, there is no clear cut, stable, trade-off between making banks hold a prudent amount of capital and growth in the medium term. A resilient and innovative banking system will support the efficient allocation of capital and therefore technical progress and growth.  Financial markets are fundamentally about risk-taking: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk are basic components of even the safest and soundest banking systems. As a society, we need risk taking as part of the process of allocating capital to competing ends. And people who take risks – at least with their own money or their own careers – need to be rewarded (appropriately!) for that risk or they won’t take it. So we are not in a world where, as a matter of policy, we want to eliminate financial risk. The key is for financial risks to be properly appraised, priced, managed and provisioned. And we should discourage some of the cross-subsidisation of different types of risk taking if we want risk capital to be appropriately allocated. That includes any perceived public subsidy, which is what the ICB recommendations are about. We also want to avoid profits being made                                                 2 The Forum, City AM, page 20, September 14 2012 (http://www.cityam.com/forum/why-britain-s-banking-rules-aren-t-restricting-our-economic-recovery) 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  out of dishonest practices such as insufficient provision of information, the deliberate mis-pricing of risk or other market abuses. The new Financial Conduct Authority will have an important role to play in that. The regulatory reform process will inevitably take time. And while the process is developing there are risks arising from the uncertainty that it brings. We need banks to raise more equity capital. But when we ask potential equity investors in banks what is holding them back, they often cite the uncertainty over the rules which will affect their future risk profiles and profitability. Such uncertainty will add a discount to the price of bank equity (although there are many other important factors too, such as the uncertain valuations of bank assets). Similar concerns about the rules have affected the attitude of debt investors, particularly the debates on “bailing in” senior debt. The rule makers are moving as fast as they can. The good news is that, once there is more certainty, we should expect a positive response from investors. Within, say, a year or so from now, I would expect a lot of progress to have been made such that the outlook for the financial sector is much brighter – at least in this regard. In the short-term, there can be a more explicit trade-off between growth and regulation, particularly with liquidity regulations. Holding extra liquid assets to meet regulatory buffers can compete with other assets such as loans. (That trade off is not the same for capital – capital is not an asset on a bank’s balance sheet and the nature of capital is often misunderstood). But how should the authorities introduce much needed new liquidity regulations in these depressed circumstances? We do not want to see the weakening of new long-term standards because of short-term cyclical concerns. Yet we don’t want the introduction of new regulations to make a bad economic situation worse. One could put off deciding on new rules – but the uncertainty would then still act as a drag. The best course seems to be to design and publish the new frameworks but delay their implementation. Even this isn’t entirely satisfactory – the market will reward firms who meet the rules early as they will be perceived to have the strongest balance sheets. Competitive pressure will encourage weaker firms to accelerate their own process so as to keep up, possibly reducing the benefits of a relaxed timetable. The answer to these practical problems of policy making is perhaps in the following key point: the new regulations should be designed as far as possible to be counter-cyclical so that they are less demanding during a crisis such as now, than at other times. Buffers are there to be used. If capital and liquidity buffers could not be used during the bad times then they serve no purpose: they would just be a deadweight loss on the banking system, shifting the point of failure for a firm to a more expensive and hence less efficient location. Putting this in concrete terms, the Financial Policy Committee recently recommended to the FSA that it make clear that the new liquidity buffers introduced by the FSA in 2010 may be used in part, in the event of a liquidity stress, without regulatory over-reaction. Firms don’t need to treat the FSA guidance as a hard minimum and hold an extra buffer on top. The FSA has also been able to lower micro prudential liquidity requirements because of the extra liquidity backstop being provided by the Bank of England – in particular the ECTR and the Funding for Lending Scheme. This example may be important in a wider sense. One of the challenges facing macroprudential policy is that the instruments may not be symmetric in their impact. Put crudely, we can make firms hold more capital and liquidity when the going is good. We can’t force them to use those buffers when the going is bad, even if the rules are relaxed. Taking away the stick isn’t the same as offering a carrot. Vegetable metaphors are not always welcomed but I think it’s acceptable to suggest that the FLS may be seen as a carrot! And the FPC recommendations are perhaps a first example of macro prudential policy being used in a co-ordinated way (with central bank actions) to support the resilience of the UK financial system, by being counter-cyclical in approach. This ability to co-ordinate may also demonstrate the benefits of some shared membership across the FPC and MPC.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  I want to turn now to the Funding for Lending Scheme in the context of our announcements this morning of the first banks and building societies to have signed up and their stock of sterling lending to UK firms and households at end-June 2012 (Table 1) that will be used as a reference point. Together these banks account for around 73% of the stock of lending to UK households and corporates. I should also note that a significant number of other institutions are close to signing up too and we will update this table in due course. In addition, we will publish the first set of drawdown data in December, although you will have seen that one bank has already announced that it has drawn £1bn and plans to draw more. That said, it will probably take some time for banks to review fully their lending plans, and it is likely that drawings from the FLS will be spread out over the full window to end-2013.

8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The FLS has been implemented in large part because of the developments in financial markets I have described: an example of the important and powerful linkages between the real economy and the financial sector. The continued uncertainties about the future of the Eurozone and about the European banking system meant that during the past two years bank funding markets have had periodic bouts of closure. And when open, spreads of bank debt over risk-free rates have remained elevated. A number of large UK banks still rely on wholesale markets for funding at the margin and higher wholesale funding costs have spilled over into other funding markets – driving up retail deposit rates for example. Prior to the announcement of the FLS, banks were passing on their elevated funding costs to their lending rates. Over the 12 months to mid-2012, we saw lending rates to businesses and for mortgages rising (Chart 5). Furthermore, the Bank of England’s 2012 Q2 Credit Conditions Survey of UK banks suggested that household secured and corporate lending rates were expected to rise further.

Sterling loans to banks and building societies (including related specialist mortgage lenders) to UK resident households and private non-financial corporations.  Although only a small rise in absolute terms, according to our business contacts this increase in interest rates was accompanied by generally tighter lending standards, reflected in broader changes in terms and conditions, and came after two years of flat GDP growth and 3 years of declining credit growth to households and businesses in the UK (Chart 6). And despite this being a period in which the MPC re-launched quantitative easing, helping to bring down longer term yields on gilts to record lows.  Central banks should not normally have to intervene to provide banks with medium-term funding at reasonable spreads. But enough was enough! The FLS will not address any of the underlying problems in the euro area or in the financial sector, but given that many of those problems are outside the UK’s direct control, it became necessary for us to do something innovative. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  I want to use this opportunity today to expound on some of the principles underlying the FLS. It is a deceptively simple scheme and inevitably there will be some misunderstanding about what it is intended to achieve and how it works.3  To begin, I wish to make clear that the FLS has been designed to support the UK economy, not the banks. There were many features of the scheme for which we made different choices because of that over-riding objective – full, quarterly disclosure of usage, bank by bank, being the most obvious. Let me summarise the key features of the FLS for those who have not followed the details. We will reduce the funding costs for banks and building societies by providing them with relatively cheap liquidity. In practice by lending them Treasury Bills for up to four years in exchange for the widest possible range of collateral that the Bank can accept – including pre-positioned portfolios of loans. Those Treasury Bills can be used as liquid assets to support an expansion of lending or turned into cash if necessary. We will charge a fee of just 25 basis points per annum as long as a bank’s stock of lending does not contract over the period to end 2013.  The firms will have that 18 months to draw down the bills. This is essentially a swap of highly liquid assets for illiquid ones and part of a wider programme where the Bank has been extending the range of collateral that it can take in such operations. So portfolios of loans are now eligible collateral for the first time in our market-wide facilities. One of the benefits of this expansion is that our operations are now much more accessible to smaller banks and building societies that don’t have large portfolios of tradable securities.  Every firm that signs up to the FLS will be able to borrow an amount equal to at least 5% of their initial stock of lending on a standard definition for which the Bank already collects data.4 If the firm expands its lending over the period until end-2013, they will be able to borrow an equivalent additional amount too. There are therefore strong incentives for banks to boost lending because every pound of additional lending increases the amount that a bank can borrow cheaply by a pound.5  If a firm’s lending stock contracts, however, they can only access up to that 5% allocation and the price of the scheme will also be higher – rising linearly to a maximum of 150 basis points if their lending contracts by 5% or more. You might reasonably ask some questions: • Why have we set this minimum access amount and complicated pivot in the price? • How can we be sure that any increase in credit flows to where it may be most needed? In particular to SME businesses and to first-time home buyers. • What if there just isn’t sufficient demand for credit? • Won’t the banks just pocket the benefits of the cheap funding? Indeed those are some of the questions I am most often asked and where I want to put some answers on the record today.                                                 3 The Bank published an explanatory note on the FLS, available here: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ markets/Documents/explanatory_notefls120713.pdf 4 Drawn sterling loans to UK private non-financial corporations (PNFCs) and households, by the FLS Group, which includes all UK resident monetary financial institutions and related specialist mortgage lenders within a group. 5 If their lending expands by 7% for example, then they can draw down an amount of treasury bills equal to (7+5=) 12% of their initial stock. 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The first point I want to make in reply is that banking in the UK is far from a perfectly competitive market. The six biggest lenders account for the vast majority of lending to UK businesses and households – and the seventh largest accounts for less than a third as much as number six. In large part the quantitative success of the scheme will depend on what these larger lenders do. But each bank is in a different strategic position to start with. They will all have some portfolios they wish to shrink, and others to expand. But some were planning to reduce their overall stock of lending, given market conditions and their own capital and liquidity positions. And some had been ordered to reduce parts of their lending because they had received state aid. The FLS is not intended to undermine competitive and financial stability objectives by forcing banks to change such strategic decisions. What we do want to encourage is an expansion of their core portfolios. And we want to encourage new entrants to step in and pick up where the major banks cannot.  So the answer to the first question about the minimum allowance and asymmetric pricing structure is that they are designed to encourage more core lending from those banks who nevertheless must shrink their balance sheets in aggregate – the macro impacts of the FLS won’t be sufficient unless those banks have an incentive to participate. And the banks who can expand lending will benefit from the lowest price and greater proportionate access. The scheme is designed so that every firm has the potential to use it to support lending. But what this means is that we cannot expect every bank in the FLS to increase its stock of lending to the real economy over the 18-month period. It is to be expected that some firms still show an overall reduction, even if the FLS is successful. The crucial impact will be whether the FLS enables them to lend more than they would have done in its absence. The Bank cannot give details of an individual firm’s previous or new lending plans. It is for each of them to explain how the FLS enables them to support the economy. Most have already announced reductions in some interest rates or a loosening of other terms and conditions. Some will respond by lending to firms that they would previously not, because they can now earn a return that compensates for the extra risk. All these approaches will help. Of course, one of the big problems facing a macroeconomic policy maker is the difficulty of setting out ex ante success criteria. We can’t perform controlled experiments on the macro economy. What matters is whether policy makes the outcome better than it would otherwise have been – but that alternative reality – the “counterfactual” in economic speak – is always a matter of conjecture and debate. Nevertheless I believe the scheme provides all the right incentives to increase the supply of credit.  A second problem for macroeconomic policy is that we cannot rely on the usual “ceteris paribus” assumption of economic theory – when we make large changes in policy then everything else changes too, including the behaviour and expectations of those very people we are trying to influence. And policy effects which are relatively small can nevertheless be absolutely significant if the policy change is large enough. In fact, the FLS is designed to take advantage of the pressures to change behaviour. The FLS provides strong incentives to banks and building societies themselves – because the more they lend, the more they benefit. Either because of the price effect on those deleveraging and/or quantity effects on those expanding. And we have built in incentives that enhance competitive pressures between the lenders. They cannot afford to miss out on lending opportunities – or their competitors will take advantage. I think this will help answer the second question about whether lending will go to the people who are perceived as most need in need of it. The FLS does not seek to allocate credit to particular parts of the economy directly – the Bank is not taking a view on this matter. But SMEs and first time home buyers in particular are thought to be credit hungry. Banks will collectively need to meet that demand if they are individually to make the most of the FLS. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  Not necessarily every bank will support every sector. But if the big firms don’t then the smaller banks will. We are relying on the pressures of demand and supply, and competition, to ensure that credit flows to where there is demand. The normal business model of a bank is that their lending rates are related to their funding rates. The process for doing so is not immediate and funding from different sources – both retail and wholesale, secured and unsecured, might be used to support lending activities. There is no reason to think that the provision of cheaper funding via the FLS will cause a bank to change its business model in this regard. Indeed the incentives in the scheme are for banks and building societies to cut lending rates and hence lend more to get the cheapest funding. Since the scheme was announced we have seen widespread falls in funding costs across different sources and an equally wide variety of lending rate reductions. The final benefit in terms of lower lending rates is uncertain: I can envisage strategies in which the degree of pass through ends up being less than 100% or greater than 100%. The key point is that if the cost of funds is reduced, the supply of credit expands and hence the quantity of lending should rise. So will the banks make more money as a result of the FLS? Well they should try to! The scheme depends on banks exploiting the opportunity to make more loans and more profitable loans because that is in everyone’s interest. If they don’t respond by lending more than they otherwise would have done, competition will probably mean that they make fewer profits because other firms will take their business. Shareholders should be urging management to take advantage of the opportunity. The fact that, by signing up, banks and building societies agree to the Bank of England publishing details of their usage of the scheme, means that pressure will be more intense. What of the question on the state of demand? I have personally talked to businesses in many different parts of the country. Those SMEs who have got the finance they wanted – and many have, despite the unfavourable public commentary – complain about the length of time it has taken, the bureaucratic processes and the onerous terms and conditions. Few have actually complained to me about the price of their new loans – but many have come under pressure to renegotiate existing cheaper arrangements. So how will the FLS help? Let’s be clear on one thing. It is up to the banks whom they lend to. If a firm goes under, or simply can’t repay its loan, that bank loses money: under the FLS the credit risk stays with the banks. And it is not our intention that banks put themselves at risk by making imprudent loans. Although there are many good quality businesses seeking extra credit, not every one is as good a credit risk as they might make out to their local journalist or MP, so we need to be wary of judgement by anecdote. But the FLS will put the pressure on banks to lend where they profitably can. That may “turn the conversation around” as banks do more to seek out lending opportunities rather than businesses or home buyers struggling to find accommodating banks. If demand for credit turns out to be weak then that will add to the competitive pressures on the supply of credit. In summary, I am confident that the FLS will help the supply of credit. Before its introduction, it was more likely than not that the stock of credit would contract further over the next 18 months. Perhaps it still may. But any return to positive credit growth would be a better outcome than we could have previously hoped for. But I want to underline one thing about the expected outcome: I expect banks’ usage of the scheme to exceed their lending growth. Partly because I know some banks are acting against a base case of contraction. And partly because some of the funding could be used to refinance existing loans at cheaper rates. But also in the first instance, we have set it up so that the funding can be drawn down in advance or as it is needed, not with a delay. That is just one of the features designed with the macroeconomic benefits in mind. At every stage we asked ourselves how the design choice would best support lending growth. I believe we have made the right choices. 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I would like to conclude by noting that one lesson from the crisis is just how important it is to have a properly functioning financial sector, expert in allocating savings to consumption and investment. Financial markets are not there to line the pockets of the participants. They exist because there are social and economic benefits from the services they provide. I believe most of the industry understands and accepts this. We need to focus on policies which encourage those benefits. For policy to be effective, it also needs to be joined up. The FLS, jointly launched by Bank and HM Treasury, and with supporting actions from the MPC, the FPC and the FSA shows that the new arrangements among these authorities can ensure that policies work together to get the economy back on track to meet the objectives of low and stable inflation, sustained growth and financial stability.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Building the bridge to a stable European economy Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the annual event “Day of the German Industries”, organised by the Federation of German Industries, Berlin, 25 September 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a privilege to be invited to address the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie this afternoon.  The BDI in many ways mirrors the strengths of the German economy. It simultaneously represents global multinationals and family-owned small businesses. It is this combination of small, medium and large firms that gives German industry its uniqueness and resilience. And this has been rewarded in recent years through strong growth and high employment. The euro area as a whole has been facing challenging times. Financial markets are fragmented. Economic growth has been broadly flat for the first half of 2012. Growth also remains highly uneven, with some parts of the euro area economy expanding at a solid pace, while others are still in a phase of adjustment.  But my central message to you today is that, provided that all policy-makers persevere with the necessary reforms, we have a number of reasons to be positive about where the euro area is heading. We are seeing signs of improved sentiment in financial markets and we expect the economy to return to growth next year. At the same time, considerable progress is being made on all fronts to strengthen the foundations of the euro area.  Above all, the Member States of the euro area are undertaking determined measures to address the root causes of our current challenges. Individually, governments are implementing the fiscal and structural reforms essential for growth. Collectively, they are reforming the governance of the euro area so as to guarantee sound policies for the future. We at the European Central Bank (ECB) are continuing to maintain price stability, which is the foundation of growth and job creation. We have introduced new measures to ensure price stability by removing unfounded fears about the euro area. These measures are supporting financial market sentiment while deeper reforms are implemented across the euro area. However, our measures can only build a bridge towards a more stable future. It must be completed with decisive measures by governments to address fundamental challenges and complete the euro area’s institutional architecture. They are currently making progress in this direction. The key challenge going forward is to ensure that the immediate upturn strengthens rather than weakens this commitment.  Actions by the Member States to strengthen the euro area’s foundations  Let me begin with the actions being taken by the Member States to strengthen the euro area’s foundations. Across the euro area, strong budgetary consolidation is taking place. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the euro area’s primary budgetary position will be almost in balance this year. This means that, apart from debt service, all other expenditures are covered by current revenues.  This is quite an achievement in an international context: Japan, for example, will have a 9% of GDP primary deficit this year, the U.S. 6% and U.K. more than 5%. And the euro area is not only performing well on average: each individual country will have a primary budget 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  deficit lower than these three countries. It is those countries most in need that are making the largest adjustments. Important improvements are also taking place in competitiveness. For example, the countries under full EU-IMF programmes have seen unit labour costs improve by around 10% since 2008, relative to the euro area average. This has translated into current account deficits that are on average more than five percentage points of GDP lower than they were then. And this is not only due to lower imports, but also rising exports induced by higher competitiveness. At the same time, the Member States are taking significant steps to improve euro area governance. Governance of fiscal policies has been decisively strengthened with the fiscal compact. This agreement is a powerful tool for keeping fiscal policies in balance and reducing debt to sustainable levels.  Governance of financial policies is also now being given proper attention. The European Commission has recently proposed a single supervisor for euro area banks. Single supervision is particularly important in a single currency area where countries are more immediately affected by instability originating from other member countries. Such single supervision should ultimately lead to a more stable financial system.  Taken together, these actions show that clear progress is being made towards addressing the fundamental causes of our current challenges. Deficits are being reduced. Rebalancing is happening. And governance is being reformed.  Actions by the ECB to ensure price stability  Let me turn to the ECB’s recent actions. We have played a role in improving overall confidence by removing unfounded fears about the euro area that were affecting our ability to ensure price stability – notably through our recent announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions, or OMTs. Let me briefly explain the rationale for this decision. The euro area has experienced a very severe fragmentation in its financial markets. In recent months, we have seen highly divergent borrowing costs for the real economy in different parts of the euro area. In our analysis, these differences were larger than justified by individual credit risk. They reflected, to a considerable extent, unfounded fears about the future of the euro area. For example, a loan to a family in Germany for a house purchase with a five- to-ten-year maturity had an interest rate of 3%; the rate for a comparable borrower in Spain was 7.5%. At the same time, the average firm in Germany paid around 3% for a new loan over five years, while the average firm in Italy paid above 5.5%.  In these circumstances, monetary policy cannot work properly. This is because a key channel through which the ECB ensures price stability is through the cost of credit, in particular bank credit. Bank credit accounts for about 70% of external financing of euro area firms, and that ratio is even higher for smaller enterprises.  But if we are unable to influence borrowing costs in some parts of the euro area, this channel is disrupted. Firms and households have less access to financing, economic growth stalls and these regions are faced with a risk of deflation. In other words, our ability to ensure price stability for the whole euro area is compromised. The ECB’s Governing Council therefore faced a choice: to accept this situation and allow the singleness of its monetary policy to be undermined; or to take actions within its mandate to restore the normal transmission of monetary policy across all parts of the euro area. We decided in favour of the latter.  Our actions aim to repair monetary policy transmission through providing a credible backstop in government bond markets that removes unfounded fears and tail risks from the euro area. Insofar as this supports investor confidence, it will help stabilise conditions in other markets, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  such as those for corporate and bank bonds. This ultimately feeds into more even borrowing costs for the real economy across the euro area. Early signs suggest a positive effect. Since the beginning of this month, euro area banks issued about 27 billion euros of new debt – the most since March of this year. Some of these banks had not been able to access the market for almost six months previously. Non-financial corporations have also issued around 43 billion euros of new bonds, the highest figure for five of the last six months. It is too early to tell the full impact of our measures on borrowing conditions for firms and households. It will take time for the effects of our actions to feed through systematically.  But the fact that we have seen positive signs so quickly is revealing. It shows that investors are fundamentally confident in the overall trajectory of the euro area. They are ready to re-invest at the first signs of stabilisation. This underscores my central message today: the euro area is making progress – and investors are recognising that progress. The benefits of stability for the euro area as a whole I have described how the measures taken by both the Member States and the ECB are beginning to improve confidence. This will ultimately lead to greater overall stability. The benefits of this do not accrue only to countries in difficulty. They accrue to the euro area as a whole.  This is particularly true for an open and outward-looking country like Germany. German industry is a sector deeply embedded in the wider European economy. The stability of the euro area is key to its sustained prosperity. For this reason, ECB actions to maintain price stability for the whole euro area are directly in its interests.  As has long been recognised in this country, low inflation and stable exchange rates ensure a level playing field on which German firms can prosper. They can compete based on their sophistication and innovativeness, without unfair distortions. At the same time, being part of a large and stable currency area provides a buffer against external shocks. This will only become more essential in an ever globalising world. These factors have led to real economic benefits for Germany. Its intra-euro area trade increased from around 25% of GDP in 1999 to almost 40% of GDP in 2010, while its extra-euro area trade increase by more than 20 percentage points in the same period. Almost 65% of foreign direct investment in Germany now comes from the euro area – and more than one and a half million jobs depend on that investment.  In other words, a stable euro area supports a strong German economy. And a stable euro area is the objective of the all the measures that I have just described. Moreover, measures that support investor confidence also support the proper functioning of the financial system. For instance, TARGET2 data suggests that balances have now fallen slightly from their peak in August. This highlights the fact that if investors are confident that adverse scenarios will not materialise, they will be more prepared to make cross-border loans. This supports demand across the euro area and the smooth functioning of the Single Market. I understand that some observers in this country have concerns about the medium-term implications of this policy. So let me be clear: we always have a medium-term orientation. We are steadfastly committed to our mandate to maintain price stability. And the measures we have announced fully support this commitment. First of all, our actions are for the sole purpose of ensuring the proper transmission of monetary policy. They do not aim to finance governments, and nor would they if they were activated. Our operations would only take place in the secondary market, which ensures that money would pass to investors holding sovereign bonds, not to governments.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Moreover, we have been explicit that our measures can be only successful if they are accompanied by reforms from governments that address deep-rooted issues. The Governing Council has made a strong commitment to such reforms a pre-requisite to be considered for our operations. This ensures that governments will continue to take essential measures.  Euro area citizens can be certain that we remain alert to any risk to price stability. We have always delivered price stability in the past – indeed, the average rate of inflation in Germany since the launch of the euro has been the lowest since the 1950s. And we will continue to deliver price stability in the future.  The credibility of our commitment is clear. Indicators of inflation expectations show that citizens and financial markets expect inflation to remain low in line with our mandate. We take very seriously the trust that citizens put in us to meet their expectations. We will not let them down. Building a bridge to the long term I have discussed the actions that the ECB has taken to ensure price stability and the positive early impact they are having. Of course the current improvement in sentiment does not mean that everything is solved. The ECB’s actions can only build a bridge to the future. The project must be completed through decisive actions by governments – both individually and collectively – to address the underlying causes of our current challenges. This requires further efforts by governments to restore fiscal sustainability across the euro area. It requires deep structural reforms to achieve long-term competitiveness and growth. Governments must remain firmly committed to their current reform efforts, and not seek to relax them as economic conditions start to improve.  To secure long-term stability also requires a second level of actions. For citizens and investors to fully regain confidence in the euro area, they need to be convinced that its design flaws have been permanently fixed. A concerted effort from governments to complete our economic and monetary union is therefore essential.  This does not require a choice between extreme options. Some observers have argued that long-term stability requires a return to the original Maastricht framework. Others have suggested that we need a full federation, a United States of Europe. In my view, neither approach is necessary. We can ensure future stability by elevating to the European level only those policies that are essential for our union to function effectively. I have been asked to work on identifying these policies under the lead of the President of the European Council and together with the Presidents of the Commission and the Eurogroup. In our view, a stable and prosperous union must be built on four pillars. The first pillar is a financial union that can maintain a stable and integrated financial market. This implies a single supervisor to control risk-taking by banks and reduce regulatory capture – and a single resolution system to ensure that banks can fail without dragging down their sovereigns.  As regards the Commission proposal for a single supervisor that I mentioned earlier, I am confident that governments will find agreement on the appropriate perimeter of supervisory responsibilities, as well as issues related to democratic accountability. For our part, we will guarantee the firm separation of monetary policy from supervisory tasks. We will also ensure close cooperation with national supervisors who have the competence and resources to implement supervision.  The second pillar is a fiscal union that can effectively prevent and correct unsustainable budgets. The consequences of misguided fiscal policies in a monetary union are too severe to remain self-policed. So a stable EMU would ultimately require the establishment of true budgetary oversight at the European level.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The third pillar is an economic union that can guarantee the highest standards for competitiveness. Countries must be able to generate growth and high employment without excessive imbalances. This implies that there must be minimum standards for key economic policies and incentives for continued structural reform.  The fourth pillar is a political union that can engage euro area citizens more deeply and make the other pillars legitimate. This is essential to ensure that where sovereignty in selected policy fields is pooled, democratic participation is deepened in parallel. A firm commitment from governments to complete economic and monetary union is the best complement to the ECB’s actions.  It ensures that, by supporting immediate confidence, we will build the bridge to a more stable and prosperous euro area. And it sends a clear signal to investors that the euro area has a vision for a sustainable future. Conclusion Let me draw to a close. In exceptional times, regaining stability sometimes requires exceptional measures. We cannot always look to the past for answers. We may need to take new steps to achieve longstanding goals.  That is the situation we have been facing. For the Member States, new steps have been needed to restore competitiveness. A sustained commitment to reform efforts is required and a rethinking of the institutional architecture of the euro area. For the ECB, new steps have been needed to maintain price stability in the face of fragmented financial markets. These new steps are not a departure from our mandate. Indeed, they are the only way to ensure that we continue to fulfil our mandate. All the measures I have described today are fundamentally about ensuring stability. In the current circumstances, the greatest risk to stability is not action, but inaction. This is why the ECB has acted. The euro supports the strong industrial sector on which Germany depends. It supports openness, growth and prosperity. And ultimately, it supports peace and stability.  This is why the euro is irreversible.  Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Guy Debelle: Credo et fido – credit and trust Text of the 2012 Richard Searby Oration by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at Deakin, Melbourne, 25 September 2012. *      *      * It is a pleasure to deliver the Richard Searby Oration here at Deakin University. I feel honoured to follow the esteemed speakers who have preceded me. Dr Searby has had a singularly impressive career throughout which he has made a great contribution to the community of Australia in many different arenas. As I read his record, one area with which he has had little direct involvement has been that of finance, perhaps unfortunately, as it could well have benefitted from his guidance. It is the current state of the financial sector that I will talk about today. As you are all aware, the global financial system has been in a state of turmoil for more than five years now. The repercussions of this have been widespread, although thankfully Australia has been spared the worst of the impact. In other parts of the world, most obviously Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom, the fall-out from the financial crisis has seen millions lose their jobs, many for a number of years. This is most stark in Greece and Spain where around one quarter of the workforce is unemployed. Young people entering the workforce in those two countries have little prospect of finding meaningful employment any time soon; an experience that can scar their income prospects over their whole working lives and runs the risk of leading to a dangerous breakdown in social cohesion. The crisis has been very much financial in its genesis but with losses that have extended to all parts of the global economy. Unlike some recent downturns, the recovery in a number of countries has been particularly protracted this time around. In a number of countries, even some five years on, the level of output in 2007 has still not yet been reattained. This represents a sizeable loss of income and wealth. Tonight, I am going to talk about one of the elements that has contributed to this financial crisis being so long-lasting, and which might mean that there is still some way yet for it to run. The issue I want to focus on is the importance of trust in banking, and finance more generally. Hence the title of my talk today. Credo is the Latin for “I believe”, from which we get the word credit, while fido is the Latin for “I trust”, from which we get fiduciary and fidelity.1 So credit is fundamentally an issue of trust. Without trust, we don’t have credit. That lack of credit is a phenomenon which is playing out in a number of countries around the world at the moment, again, thankfully, not here in Australia.  The lack of trust is contributing to the unwillingness of financial institutions to extend credit and the difficulty some governments are having in obtaining funding. In turn, the lack of credit growth is exerting a major restraint on the economic recoveries in a number of countries around the world. In the post-war period, easier monetary policy has invariably helped foster a rebound in economic growth following a recession. An important transmission channel for monetary policy to take effect has almost always been a pick-up in lending to businesses and households. That is clearly not happening in many countries at the moment. Central banks in those countries are reaching deep into their toolkits to revive lending and foster economic recovery. But the lack of trust is significantly curtailing the ability of the normal implementation of macropolicy tools, both monetary and fiscal, to engender a sustainable economic recovery.                                                 1  My high school Latin teachers will be pleased to see some return, if a few decades after the fact,  from their efforts. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The outline of my talk is to firstly discuss the role that the financial sector plays in the economy. Then I will examine the crucial role that trust plays in financial intermediation and in ensuring the financial system runs smoothly. Following that, I will document the breakdown of trust that has occurred over the past five years. To finish on a more positive note, I will outline some of the avenues that might be taken to restore trust in the financial system. Some of these themes were addressed in a speech entitled “Credit is Trust” delivered by my colleague at the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, in September 2009.2 Andy highlighted the reduction in trust that had taken place in the previous two years – what was then the first two years of the financial crisis. But three years on from 2009, the situation is even worse. The lack of trust in the financial system has intensified. Distrust has spread beyond the finance system to other institutions. This is particularly evident in Europe, where there is a lack of trust in some quarters in the longevity of the euro, and a lack of trust by bondholders of some European governments that they will be repaid in full. In the case of Greece, this lack of trust proved to be well-founded. This diminished trust in political and economic institutions is a particularly worrying development. I fear that the path back will be a long one. In all walks of life, including finance, trust takes a long time to build, but can be quickly and easily shattered.  The financial sector and the economy To set the scene, I will start with a brief description of what the financial sector does. I hope I can avoid being too jargonistic, but please forgive me if I lapse into economists’ speak every once in a while. The financial sector plays an important role in the functioning of the economy, primarily through intermediation. Simply put, the financial sector sits between savers and borrowers. It takes the funds it raises from the savers through, for example, deposits, and then lends it to those who wish to borrow, be they businesses, governments, or households. If the system is working well, it allocates the funds to their most productive use. This benefits the savers whose money is being invested profitably, and the economy and society at large.  It is important to note that the financial sector is an intermediate sector. It is not at the end of a production chain producing something which directly generates utility for society. It is a critical link along the way, the oil that keeps the economy ticking over. When the oil dries up, the economic engine starts to malfunction and can ultimately grind to a halt. In that regard the financial sector is different from other parts of the economy. It is one of the reasons it is subject to considerably more regulation and oversight, although clearly the experience of the past few years indicates that in many parts of the world the oversight and regulation were deficient. When the finance sector stops functioning properly it has knock on effects to all parts of the economy in a way that other sectors generally don’t. The experience at the end of 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers demonstrated this point starkly. The contraction in the global economy was breathtaking in its rapidity, but also in its simultaneity, in a way that hadn’t been seen before.  I will now step a bit deeper into the process of financial intermediation to provide a better sense of where trust comes into the process. Again, apologies if this gets a bit too arcane, but hopefully you can bear with me. Why do financial intermediaries exist? Why don’t I as a saver lend directly to you the company?                                                 2 Haldane A (2009), “Credit is Trust”, Speech given at the Association of Corporate Treasurers, Leeds, 14 September. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  One of the main reasons is because of the presence of what economists refer to as asymmetric information. Asymmetric information arises when I know more about my own situation than you do. It would be difficult for individual savers to know whether they were lending to a business that was going to put the funds borrowed to a productive purpose and be in a position to repay the loan when it became due. A financial institution such as a bank that is practised in credit assessment can reduce these information asymmetries. When a bank makes a loan, it does the due diligence on the lender and assesses the capacity of the lender to repay. While the due diligence cannot completely eliminate the information asymmetry, it can allow the bank to make a reasonable assessment of the risk incurred in making the loan. On the basis of that risk assessment, the lender charges the borrower an interest rate to compensate for the risk incurred. With an appropriately diversified portfolio of loans then, the bank should not be overly exposed to any particular development. The risk is mutualised. If there is a problem with one loan, the lender should be earning sufficient interest on the rest of its loan portfolio to cover the loss.  The lender, and thereby the savers who provide the funds to the lender, are compensated for the risk incurred. Relative to lending their own funds directly, the savers are benefiting both from the (hopefully) professional risk assessment that reduces the information asymmetry and the risk mutualisation. One difficulty in this process that is apparent from what I have just said is the possibility that the risks in a portfolio of loans are correlated. In plain English, when one loan goes bad, how likely is it that other loans will go bad at the same time? For example, in an economic downturn where there is a rise in unemployment, a lender might find that more loans are becoming problematic than expected, because they are all being affected by the realisation of the same risk. The interest rate charged may have been sufficient to compensate the lender for one realisation of the risk but may not have been adequate for a large number of simultaneous realisations of risk. In addition to intermediating funds, one can also think of the financial sector intermediating risk. As I’ve just said, a financial institution has a wide range of loans on its books. By holding a diverse portfolio of risk, the institution is, in theory, less vulnerable to the realisation of any of those risks. But a financial institution doesn’t always hold all the risks on its own books. Through channels such as securitisation, a financial institution can also distribute the risk around the financial system to other institutions that are, again at least in theory, better placed to hold that risk. Who might be better placed to take on these risks? Some possible candidates are pension or superannuation funds and insurance companies that should have long horizons and a diversified portfolio of assets.  It is an interesting question as to whether it is better for a bank to pool the risks on its own books or whether it is better for the risk to be off the books of the banks and instead be distributed round the system. If the risks are distributed around the system, the bank making the loan may be less inclined to do the appropriate amount of due diligence, as they are no longer so directly exposed to the consequences. In principle, the entity which buys the risk from the bank should also do an appropriate amount of due diligence. But the experience of the past few years shows that the more chains there are in this process, the more removed the end-holder of the risk is from the originator of the risk and the worse the process of due diligence becomes.  On the other hand, if the bank holds too much risk on its balance sheet, and if too many of those risks crystallise, the bank is likely to find that its ability to continue to intermediate funds is severely curtailed. It will cut back on its lending – what’s commonly referred to as a credit crunch – worsening the economic environment. There are plenty of examples of this through history, including in the current crisis. So conceivably, risk should be intermediated as much as funds. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  These considerations are currently at play in the debate over the Volcker rule in the United States and the “ring-fencing” proposed in the Vickers report on the UK banking system. The conclusion reached in both those cases is that it is better to separate the investment banking (or risk generation) arm of financial institutions from the commercial banking or regular lending arm of the institution. Then, if some risk blows up in the investment arm, there is not a detrimental spillover to the commercial bank that crimps its ability to continue lending, thereby limiting the impact on the economy. Alternatively, one can consider a world of fractional risk banking, analogous to fractional reserve banking. With fractional reserve banking, I refrain from lending some portion of the funds you, and others, deposit with me so that I can repay you, should you decide to withdraw the funds at short notice. As long as all the depositors don’t want their funds back at the same time, that is, as long as there isn’t a bank run, then I am fine. In the case of fractional risk, I would retain some part of the exposure on my own balance sheet rather than pass it all on to you, to give me some incentive to monitor the risk and continue to do due diligence. This is often described as “skin in the game”.  Trust and finance Having spent a bit of time setting the scene by describing how the process of financial intermediation works, I will now focus on the main argument: the role that trust plays in finance. Trust is pervasive at many levels of the financial system, in large part because of asymmetric information. There is the trust between the depositor and the bank. The depositor is trusting that her funds are safe with the bank. This is embodied in Frank Capra’s famous movie, It’s a Wonderful Life, where Jimmy Stewart saves the day with a paean to trust, to stop the run on the bank. Trust of this sort is particularly important because banks undertake maturity transformation, that is, borrow short and lend long. For example, banks are willing to let you deposit your money “at call”, but lend the money for periods considerably longer than that. If depositors all lost trust in a bank at the same time, as in a bank run, the bank would be unlikely to be able to repay the funds immediately. It could not call in all its loans. It would be forced to engage in a fire sale of its assets, which are mostly illiquid loans. To prevent this situation occurring, central banks provide a liquidity backstop, where they stand ready to lend money to banks if needed, against the bank’s assets (collateral). The trust in these arrangements is almost always enough for them not to be needed.  There is trust between the borrower and the bank. The bank is trusting that the borrower will repay the loan. The bank can do a lot of due diligence on the borrower to be reasonably confident that the lender will repay. But ultimately there will be some trust involved. The bank needs to trust that the borrower has provided accurate information and will act in good faith. There will, however, always be a gap between what the bank can learn through its due diligence and what it needs to be completely confident the loan will be repaid in full. Because the process of financial intermediation often has a number of links in the chain, there also needs to be trust between financial institutions. Many financial transactions don’t just involve one bank lending out its deposits to the end-borrower. Often the funds are on-lent to one financial institution after another, before ultimately finding its way to the end-borrower. So trust needs to be present at every stage in the chain. One breakdown in this chain of trust between counterparties can throw a spanner in the works of the whole process. Ultimately there is only so much due diligence that can be done. Risk is always present in the financial system. Information asymmetries will always be present between the two parties in a financial transaction. Transparency can reduce but not eliminate the risk from these asymmetries. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Finally, there has historically been trust between regulators and financial institutions. (I am not sure there is all that much of this trust at the moment, as I will discuss later.) “Trust me, I know what I’m doing”, was the banker’s exhortation for the light touch approach to regulation that was pervasive prior to the crisis in many countries, most obviously the UK. The argument was that banks should be broadly left to their own devices, with the discipline provided by the market deemed sufficient to keep them on track.  The breakdown of trust Having described the critical role that trust plays in the process of financial intermediation, I will now describe how trust has broken down over the course of the financial crisis. The period leading up to the financial crisis saw what might be labelled, in the context of my talk today, the development of lazy trust. Things were generally going along fine, so my due diligence was that I will take you, the lender, at your word. I won’t really bother to verify that what you are telling me is true. I won’t bother to consider the possible circumstances that might hinder your ability to repay me.  Moreover, with long chains of intermediation involved, there was often too much distance between the ultimate holder of the risk and the source of the risk. Too many links means that details get lost or misheard. If the due diligence is necessarily incomplete by the very nature of financial transactions, then that incompleteness is likely to get magnified, the more chains there are in the transaction. The due diligence gets dissipated along the chain. There is a presumption that someone further up the chain did the due diligence. And when times were good, no-one thought to challenge that presumption. So complacency set in, encouraged by the seemingly benign growth in the world economy. That benign environment led to an incorrect pricing of risk. Now this need not be the case, but it does seem to be a trait of human behaviour that has been evidenced many times in financial history. Good times begets complacency.  Let me take a quick detour here. Taken to the extreme, this line of argument leads to a view of the world most famously associated with some Austrian economists. Good times are always setting us up for the next disaster. It is not clear to me what the appropriate policy response should be to this. Certainly one should always remain alert to the possible dangers. And certainly it may be difficult to take away the punchbowl when the party is in full swing. (Maybe that is why central bankers are never invited to good parties…) But surely it doesn’t mean we should never have good times, and instead endure a constantly mediocre performance so that no-one ever gets carried away. Obviously there needs to be a balance. To some extent, one can do the calculus. The large costs of the current financial crisis does make one think hard whether one should have let the previous boom persist for so long, as great as the benefits of it were while they lasted. But another aspect of human nature is the belief that one can avoid the mistakes of the past by learning from them. Inevitably therefore, there is the ubiquitous assertion that this time it is different. And in many aspects, each time it is different. It is easier to assess the differences than the similarities in real time. The similarities only generally become apparent after the fact. Thus, as mentioned earlier, we actually do need some level of distrust, at least initially, for the financial system to function effectively. I shouldn’t take you completely at your word. I should do some background checking to make sure that what you are telling me is true. I should check whether your circumstances have changed so I can be confident that you will still be able to repay me. So back to the breakdown of trust. Some time around 2007, it became clear to many in financial markets that there had been a major mis-assessment of risk in many parts of the financial system. While some had been warning about this mis-assessment of risk prior to this, and some had even positioned themselves to benefit from this mis-assessment, as 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Michael Lewis described in the Big Short, it wasn’t until the middle of 2007 that this became a more widely held opinion. Interestingly, through the second half of 2007, there was a marked disconnect between equity markets and credit markets. Credit markets came to the realisation significantly earlier that something was going badly wrong in the financial markets, but for quite a considerable period of time, equity markets assumed nothing worse than a garden variety economic slowdown was in prospect. Lazy trust evaporated. The financial system switched rapidly from complacency to deep mistrust in a short period of time. In particular, trust broke down between financial institutions, best illustrated by the final days of Bear Stearns in March 2008, and then Lehman Brothers in September of that year (see House of Cards by William Cohan and Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin, that are amongst the many books written about those two events). Both institutions experienced a run on them by their financial counterparties, who were unwilling to roll over their funding because of the concerns that the poor quality of the assets on their balance sheets might render the two institutions insolvent. The crucial distinction between uncertainty and risk came to the fore. I can assess the riskiness of an asset or an institution by assigning a probability to its likely value. I can then manage that risk appropriately. But if I am uncertain and unable to make a firm assessment about the value, the situation is a lot worse. I am likely to pull back and be unwilling to provide any finance to you, except on steep terms and probably only for a short term. Uncertainty is much more pernicious than risk. As I have spoken about earlier,3 the famous Rumsfeld quote very much applies to the financial crisis. Risk is very much about the “known unknowns” but uncertainty is about the “unknown unknowns”. But maybe Mark Twain puts it a lot better: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Financial institutions and investors knew that many assets in the financial system were badly mispriced. In the case of some financial institutions, they knew about the mispricing on their own books and rightly assumed that the same was probably going on with their competitors. But they didn’t know how much.  They did not know what exposure various financial institutions had to these mispriced assets. So what is termed “counterparty risk aversion” became all pervasive. The lack of trust meant that financial institutions were only willing to lend to one another for increasingly shorter periods, ultimately only overnight. A financial markets version of the bank run portrayed in It’s a Wonderful Life took place. In the UK, in the case of Northern Rock, a traditional bank run occurred as depositors became concerned about the safety of their savings. They no longer trusted the institution because they were uncertain about its ability to fund itself, given its reliance on mortgage-backed securities for funding – a market that was no longer functioning at all because of a lack of trust in the value of these securities. This breakdown in trust led to a breakdown in intermediation. Central banks stepped into this hole to play their historical role of intermediary of last resort. Central banks can replace, to a reasonable extent, the decline in the intermediation of funds by the banking sector. But it is considerably more difficult for central banks to replace the lost trust.  The extent to which central banks have needed to be intermediary of last resort is evident in the vast size of central bank balance sheets in major advanced economies: the euro area, the United States, Japan and also the UK. The central banks are standing between financial institutions that are unwilling to lend directly to each other.  The euro area provides a particularly clear example of this. In the second half of 2011, banks in the euro area became increasingly unwilling to lend to each other. First of all, banks would only lend against collateral (secured lending) rather than lending directly to another bank                                                 3 Debelle G (2010), “On Risk and Uncertainty”, Address to Risk Australia Conference, Sydney, 31 August. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  without any security (unsecured lending). In plain English, this means that banks would only lend to another bank if the borrowing bank would provide something like a government security or a portfolio of mortgages as collateral to the loan. Then even if collateral was provided, the length of time they were willing to provide the loan for shortened, because of a concern that the borrower would not survive long enough to repay.  This placed some financial institutions in significant financial difficulty. Concerns mounted as to whether some institutions would be able to fund themselves at all. As a result of this, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it would provide as much funds as banks in Europe required through three year loans. So the European central bank has become the intermediary of last resort for the European banking system because the banks do not trust each other. More recently, as the lack of trust of some of the governments of Europe has intensified, the ECB has had, in effect, indicated its willingness to act as intermediary of last resort to these governments too. One of the main reasons the ECB has decided to do this is because of the lack of trust in the longevity of the euro. Investors are concerned about the possibility of redenomination risk: the possibility they are left holding an asset whose value is markedly decreased, when a country leaves the euro area and re-introduces its own currency.  As a result of this mistrust, we are witnessing a balkanisation of the financial system in Europe. Investors in one European country don’t trust banks or governments in other countries. They pull back from financing across borders, preferring instead to invest their money close to home. This almost certainly is not an optimal allocation of funds to their most productive use. On top of this dangerous state of affairs in Europe, and amplifying the diminution of trust in the financial sector, recent controversies in the banking sector have hardly provided any justification for the public regaining trust in the banking system.  To the extent that trust was slowly being restored in some parts of the banking system over the past few years, it was shattered by the recent revelations surrounding the LIBOR scandal, allegations of money laundering and the like.  The restoration of trust So all in all, the state of the financial system in many parts of the world is not in good shape. So what is to be done about it? As in the old Irish saying, the first response is to say I wouldn’t start from here. But unfortunately, here is where we are. Using the recent experience in Europe as an example, we can consider a number of possible avenues as to what might be needed to rebuild trust. When it comes to the distrust of the state of banks’ balance sheets, transparency about the true nature of the assets on the balance sheet will clearly help. But the transparency and the disclosures clearly need to be credible to reduce the information asymmetries. Stress testing of the balance sheet by a credible independent party such as the prudential regulator (APRA in the case of Australia) can give depositors, and other investors, confidence that their money will be safe. These sorts of actions work to take the solvency risk off the table. For depositors, this is reinforced by the presence of deposit guarantees. But often it is the sovereign who is providing the deposit insurance. So if there is a lack of trust in the solvency of sovereign, this interlinkage between the financial sector and the government can amplify the problem, as has been evident in the case of Ireland and Spain, for example. The willingness of the central bank to provide a liquidity backstop, very evident in Europe at the moment, reduces liquidity risk concerns. Investors are not so concerned that they will be the ones left in the burning building when everyone else has already run to the exit. The quid pro quo for this support is that banks will be subject to more comprehensive regulation and, at least as important, more intensive supervision and scrutiny by their 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  prudential supervisors than was the case before the crisis. The light touch is no longer acceptable. One can make a reasonable case that in Australia’s case, this doesn’t require much change. APRA has long exercised intensive scrutiny over the banks it supervises. But even here in Australia, there are a number of lessons learned through the crisis that are in the process of being applied.  The regulatory regime for financial institutions has tightened considerably. While this might impose some costs on the financial sector and increase the cost of financial intermediation, the benefits are sure to outweigh those costs. This is particularly the case when we see the terrible costs of the high unemployment being experienced in a number of countries around the world at the moment in the aftermath of their financial crises. A change in management practice at financial institutions is surely also necessary in a number of cases, and this must start at the top. The culture around risk management and risk tolerance clearly is an important element of this. The practices that became pervasive throughout the first part of this century that contributed to the excesses need to change. What was considered an acceptable way of doing business will no longer suffice.  Given the role that the financial sector plays in the economy, there is a form of social contract between it and the general public. As I have mentioned earlier, the financial sector enjoys a level of support that is not present for other sectors of the economy, because of the crucial role it plays.  But leverage implies financial institutions are more vulnerable. We need to consider what the safe degree of leverage is. That is a debate that is being had currently. The rate of profitability in the financial sector is also a debate society needs to be having. If financial institutions are perceived to be earning too high a rate of profitability, particularly if the institution is enjoying a degree of support from the public sector, that too will impede the restoration of trust. It will be a long road back to restore trust. Without trust, the process of intermediation and credit provision will be greatly curtailed. In turn, this will impede the path to global economic recovery with costs to all.  We have to lay out the road ahead, put down the road rules in the form of regulations and other curbs on the financial sector. But then the journey still needs to be taken. There are no short cuts.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: Business models and the banking sector seen in terms of financial stability Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 16th Banking Symposium of the European Center for Financial Services “Profile and profitability – are banks’ business models in transition?”, Düsseldorf, 20 September 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Professor Rolfes Ladies and Gentlemen No question: the causes of the financial crisis are manifold. How they all fit together is currently not yet fully known. Perhaps this can never be fully explained – not by practitioners and academics. However, they might be able to achieve an improved understanding of how some of the individual parts interact. This is one of the aims of a symposium like this one, in which practitioners and academics can convene and communicate with one another. This is also why I was very glad to accept your invitation, for which I thank you very much. I would like today to address the distinctly interesting individual elements of the build-up of risk and some elements of the associated financial innovations – key components of a bank’s business model. If a business model can be regarded as a bank’s genetic code, the business models of banks and intermediaries make up the DNA of the financial system. This not just interesting for its own sake. In fact, it is a vital aid in better understanding another debate: that on universal banking systems and specialised banking systems. 2. From unsustainable business models to the financial crisis In key areas in the financial system, several banks’ business models were undergoing a change best described as a departure from traditional commercial banking. What essentially lay behind this? Why was it able to pose such a severe threat to financial stability? Few models have provided as much information in the search for an answer to these questions as that in the seminal work by University of Chicago economist Douglas Diamond. Its bears the somewhat non-descript title “Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring”. And his seemingly more innocuous question is, why do financial intermediaries exist? Put another way: What can intermediaries do better than the markets? And then the question no longer sounds as innocent. Diamond presumes major information asymmetry between creditors and debtors. Only the entrepreneur can freely observe his investment project. Potential lenders have a choice between costly monitoring of the investment project or setting incentives to comply with the contract. If a borrower only stands to lose his house, as was the case with US subprime borrowers, the incentives are quite flawed, indeed. If a bank monitors the status of investment projects, diversification and economies of scale can be achieved. By financing multiple projects simultaneously and monitoring them over a relatively long period of time, banks can reduce their monitoring costs. By contrast, monitoring individual projects is inefficient. This explains the existence of banks – and of intermediaries. And it is probably also for this reason – at least as seen from the assets side – that commercial banking is a wholesale bank’s “natural” business model. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Through credit substitution business, many banks have departed from this model; have surrendered much of the inherent, comparative (says Diamond) advantages of their intermediary function; have left credit assessments to rating agencies; and have, in some cases, delegated monitoring. At the same time, when packaging loans and in lending contracts, they looked not at appropriate incentive structures but, above all, at tradability. If it can be traded, the risk can then be fobbed off on a third party – or, at least, that is how the thinking goes. In effect, securitisation techniques dissolved the link between oversight and the ultimate bearer of risk. The advantages of intermediation were forsaken without creating sustainable contractual solutions at the same time. Even in theory, there was no way that could work. As Warren Buffett famously put it, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.” From that angle, the oft-cited deficiencies in some banks’ risk management practices are not an accident, but instead, seen in that light, the logical outcome of the departure from the traditional business model. In this middle world between intermediation and the market, in which neither worked, there were simply not enough incentives to mitigate risk. Please do not misunderstand me: I firmly believe that those innovations which have created real economic value added will survive in the long term. But that will probably be on a reduced scale, in less complex and more transparent structures, and embedded in supervisory practice. If used prudently and monitored carefully, they can enhance the performance of the financial system without jeopardising financial stability. Another thing should not be overlooked: not every transaction that generates commission income is a complex securitisation. A savings bank or cooperative bank can successfully diversify its earnings side by selling Riester retirement products. It is less dependent on maturity transformation and swings in interest rates. Who could possibly object to that? In and of itself, this is good for financial stability. And not every trading transaction with modern financial products is driven by the search for maximum yields in proprietary trading. If a bank closes a currency hedge deal for a customer who is active in international trade, this has a sound real economic basis. In that case, investment banking serves the customer’s interests. Nobody can really have object to that, either. A bank whose business model is targeted at export-oriented customers will have to provide this kind of service, otherwise its business model will not work. And it will obtain commission income that should be in reasonable proportion to the services rendered. The same is also true, for example, of M&A consultancy services. However, the non-interest earnings components are generally more volatile, especially if generated by proprietary trading in complex investment banking products. Such earnings components evaporate quickly in a crisis and can put a strain on profitability. This is shown by many empirical studies. We therefore have to assess the relationship between profitability and resistance differently than in the pre-crisis era. Back then, there were many – but not among supervisors or academics – who believed that there was a one-to-one relationship between profit and risk. We now know this: sustainability is what counts. And sustainability cannot exist in an environment of very high volatility. Those who desire more sustainable profitability and business models have to put stricter limits on proprietary trading. The Basel III rules governing market risk serve this objective and, in my opinion, point in the right direction. They are set up to reduce the volatility of profitability. Volatility, the close interrelationships with other players in the financial system and the high financial leverage are all reasons for the systemic importance of investment banks. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  On the liability side, too, quite a few institutions departed from the commercial banking model. The significance of market-based funding instruments has increased enormously, while the role of customer deposits has shrunk. This has increased banks’ dependency on market-based funding and made such funding more vulnerable to market pricing and market movements. And this has been accompanied by a tendency towards short-term funding. This should actually lead to an increase in interest rate risk and liquidity risk. However, empirical studies by the Bundesbank show that the major systemically important banks – at least in Germany – largely shield themselves from interest rate risk. On balance, they have hedged a large percentage of their positions. Interest income risk is therefore not affected. However, there is still liquidity risk – in other words, refinancing risk. This was seen by many as irrelevant during the boom cycle. Market liquidity dried out quickly during the financial crisis, though. It became ever-more difficult to roll over loans, even though central banks were doing all they could to help. It used to be true that “liquidity followed creditworthiness” or that “liquidity followed solvency”. The financial crisis has shown that this is not the case all the time. Even institutions with a “healthy” asset portfolio were capable of running into distress – not least because, at first, nobody was entirely sure who was holding how much in “toxic assets” on their balance sheets – and also, and especially, off their balance sheets in the “shadow banking system”. Spun-off SPVs meant that now everyone was a suspect. 3. Specialised banking versus universal banks: missing the point One of the main concerns in the aftermath of the crisis has been making the banking system safer overall and protecting taxpayers, and thus the general public, from having to pay the price for banks’ mistakes – and quite rightly so. Some observers who are “in the know” believe that divorcing investment banking from commercial banking is the perfect way to limit the social costs of ailing banks. A high-level Expert Group of the European Commission, headed by Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, is studying these issues. I therefore now only want to go into some aspects which I think are particularly important. As I said at the beginning, investment banking does, indeed, involve very specific risks. By contrast, traditional banking, with its deposit and lending business, is often – but not necessarily always – characterised by a less risky business model. Some argue that separating the two types of banking activities would protect the macroeconomically vital task of supplying the real economy with credit and, at the same time, shielding it from investment banking’s inherent risks. They also claim that this would make bank resolution easier. What I’m wondering, however, is if such a specialised banking system can truly fulfil all the hopes invested in it. Unfortunately, in practice it is not always possible simply to put the good ones into the pot and the bad ones into the crop, to paraphrase the Grimm Brothers. For one thing, we cannot ignore the problems of where to draw the line and how to put this into practice. In particular with regard to corporate services, it is not quite that easy to make a clear distinction between traditional banking services and investment banking services. And, problems in drawing a clear boundary generally result in loopholes. In terms of financial stability, however, a much more serious issue is at stake. One of the proposals for a specialised banking system currently on the table – the Vickers blueprint – would distinctly reduce interlinkages, which is welcome as far as its effects on financial stability are concerned. However, that would probably not close off every possible contagion channel. Banks are interlinked through all sorts of other channels. Not least, during the financial crisis, in order to prevent contagion, in particular, governments also gave support and assistance to many investment banks or – as I would call them – quasi-investment banks. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy caused precisely such contagion, but not because customer deposits were at risk. Rather, it had many connections to other financial institutions including, and above all, as counterparty in derivative transactions, in which Lehman Brothers was particularly heavily exposed. Essentially the same applied to AIG – which was not even a bank, but an insurer. AIG was also a major counterparty. In this case, too, the government rescue package was intended to keep further shock waves from buffeting the financial system. And in the case of the largest rescue operation in Germany, that to save Hypo Real Estate, customer deposits were not the main issue, either, but rather the danger of wide-ranging domino effects – on other banks; on the Pfandbrief market, for which the affected institution was a major issuer; and for insurers, for whom Pfandbriefe are key investments. Not everything is rosy even in classical banking business. The very large banks – those deemed “too big to fail” – are not the sole sources of systemic risk. The Spanish case has made this abundantly clear. Here, banks were destabilised by their exposure to the real-estate market. These vulnerabilities were created in traditional lending business. Proponents of specialised banking systems believe this will produce a better solution to the “too big to fail” problem. And, the wisdom of introducing a system of specialised banks has to be judged in terms of whether it makes it easier to supervise large, complex financial institutions. Even more important, as I see it, is whether such banks can, in a crisis, be more easily resolved if they do not have an investment banking arm. After all, a break-up leads to the creation of smaller banks. This much I believe: the best regulatory solution for the “too big to fail” problem is the credible threat of an institution’s orderly market exit. This is well within the tradition of standard insolvency law, if you will. And in cases where standard insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings cannot be applied precisely because of this “too big to fail” problem, other resolution regimes – and credible regimes at that – are needed. Developing cross-border, harmonised resolution regimes is therefore also at the core of international reform efforts. Shareholders and creditors of distressed banks are to bear the losses, wherever possible, without passing them on to taxpayers and without posing a threat to financial stability. In a crisis, it should be possible to transfer an institution’s critical functions to third parties or government bridge banks – even without the prior consent of the institution, shareholders or creditors. These critical functions have to be maintained; otherwise financial stability would be at risk. The decisive factor – as always when it comes to money and finances – is credibility. Is it possible to introduce a credible resolution regime with the existing structures? Or are these structures too complex for a realistic market exit? The TBTF problem desperately requires a solution. If a solution can be found through credible resolution regimes, the advantages of universal banking do not need to be sacrificed. Let me repeat: credible resolution systems are the much better option for regulatory purposes. I do see where the proponents of specialised banking are coming from. However, do not be fooled: simply ring-fencing investment banking from banks’ core business will not be enough to prevent future systemic crises. We therefore need to focus more strongly on the underlying sources of systemic risk in banks’ business models and then effectively mitigate them. This will involve subjecting activities such as banks’ proprietary trading to critical examination. As it is difficult to draw a clear line, it would be better for us, here, to focus less on whether or not to permit its very existence and more on capital adequacy. I am fully in agreement with Mr Schmitz, President of the Association of German banks, when he says that “the decisive factor is that the risk incurred is commensurate with risk buffers. To that extent, imposing greater restrictions on some areas of proprietary trading than existed before the crisis makes sense and is the right move.” 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  4. Capital adequacy: a key element Solvency is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for financial stability. What is crucial for solvency, besides the quality of the asset portfolio, is the amount of capital. This is a key element in restoring confidence. That is just as relevant now as it was in 2008 and 2009. In its 2011 Financial Stability Review, for example, the Bundesbank had the following to say, “However, in times of systemic stress, markets cease to make broad-based distinctions because, supposing an exogenous shock actually triggers a systemic crisis, it is almost impossible ex ante to forecast the position of an individual bank. In such a scenario, the task of restoring confidence is not merely the responsibility of an individual bank but also a call to arms for the system as a whole.” Injections of capital can be one weapon in that cause. Capital adequacy is not everything. But without adequate capital, it all comes to nothing. Capital acts as a substantial internal buffer. Such buffers have to be large enough to cushion any stresses and strains. Provided they are put in place in good time, lending does not have to be cut back straightaway, even in the event of a systemic shock. The institutions gain some respite and do not have to launch fire-sale auctions to shed their risky assets all at the same time, which can bring about a cumulative decline in the value of those assets. Here I can see many practitioners objecting on the grounds that capital is too scarce and expensive. Most economists doubt that or – like the Bonn economist, Martin Hellwig – they do not accept it as a reason for forgoing stricter regulatory capital requirements. The reason is that, at this point, practitioners like to argue implicitly using a ceteris paribus clause, in other words, all other things being equal. In this line of reasoning, the capital donors have a certain idea about the return on the capital they have put in. If the capital share is increased, expenditures are greater than in a situation with higher borrowed capital. The crux of the matter is this: all other things are not equal. That is because the required return on capital contains a risk premium. This compensates the shareholders for the entrepreneurial risk. And the risk premium falls if the capital is increased, which means that the entrepreneurial risk is spread over more capital. Under certain assumptions, it is even possible to show by how much the risk premium is reduced: and that is by precisely the amount that the overall capital costs remain unchanged. This is the substance of the Modigliani-Miller theorems. And to anyone saying this is nothing but dry theory and that everything is quite different in investment banking practice, I would reply that this can be proved by precisely the same means used in investment banking for valuing options. And even if complete neutrality of financing is not guaranteed, there is no way round the fact that the risk premium and the required return on capital have to go down if the capital share goes up. It is simply a matter of economic logic. That fact alone puts the notion of “expensive capital” into some sort of perspective. The neutrality of funds applies as long as there are no distortions which affect the two types of capital differently. Even so, outside capital is given preferential tax treatment over equity capital by way of the tax deductibility of interest payments. Tax breaks for servicing debt thus lower the costs of borrowed capital. And what is perhaps even more significant: during the financial crisis, explicit and implicit guarantees for systemically important institutions meant that borrowing was, eventually, being subsidised. From the point of view of a big bank, loan capital becomes cheaper than equity capital. Is the practitioners’ view that equity capital leads to higher costs is therefore right in this context after all? No, because the implicit guarantee on loan capital means that, in the event of a crisis, the costs are transferred to the general public or, in other words, the 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  taxpayer. This results in a disconnect between microeconomic and macroeconomic costs and benefits, as was pointed out by the German Council of Economic Experts. There was fallout from this, of course. It set the wrong incentives. It favoured highly leveraged business models. It gave an excessive stimulus to risk-taking. In short, it created moral hazard. Thus, if a higher input of borrowed capital was or is cheaper for the bank, this was only because the costs of this were or are payable elsewhere. Conversely, the business costs of higher capital requirements are offset by relief elsewhere, namely for the taxpayer – quite apart from the stabilising effects which larger capital buffers have for financial stability. From a microeconomic perspective, one can, of course, well understand that there is resistance to higher capital requirements. That does not mean that such resistance is justified in macroeconomic terms, far from it. Or, as Mr Hellwig put it, “Given these negative externalities from banks using debt rather than equity, there is no reason to refrain from requiring banks to have more capital on the grounds that equity is expensive and the regulation would raise bank’s cost of capital. Quite the contrary, such a regulation would merely counteract the perverse incentives that are created by the corporate tax system and by the inability of government to commit to not bailing out banks.” 5. Conclusion Allow me to summarise my thoughts as four basic propositions. First: the business models of a number of banks underwent a fundamental transformation associated with turning away from traditional business towards investment banking. Second: this meant that profitability was subject to a high degree of volatility. Third: if we solve the “too big to fail” problem, there will then be no reason to forgo the advantages of universal banks. Fourth: adequate capital is a key element in achieving financial stability. These propositions might not cover everything, but I see them as vital elements. If these lessons are applied in the reform efforts, we shall already have achieved a great deal. I, at least, shall do my utmost to make this happen. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  B Mahapatra: Underlying concepts and principles of dynamic provisioning Keynote address by Mr B Mahapatra, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Conference on “Introduction of dynamic provisioning framework for banks in India”, organised by the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL), Mumbai, 21 September 2012. *      *      * The contributions made by Mrs Usha Janakiraman and Mrs Tariqa Singh are gratefully acknowledged. Thank you very much for inviting me to this conference to share with you my understanding of the underlying concepts and principles of dynamic provisioning. A discussion paper on the subject was brought out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March 2012. We are still in the process of examining the comments received from banks and other stakeholders and it may take us a while to finalise anything in this regard. Why make provisions? Let me start the discussion with a question: why make provisions? To my mind provision is an accounting concept. Accounting standards define provision as a liability of uncertain timing or amount which can be measured only by using a substantial degree of estimation. The term “provision” is also used in the context of items such as depreciation, impairment of assets and doubtful debts: these are adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets. It is a requirement for any entity to assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that any asset has been impaired as also whether a liability needs to be recognised in settlement of an obligation involving an outflow of resources. When such is the case, the amount is required to be recognised in the profit or loss account for the reporting period. This enables presenting a “true and fair” financial position of the entity for the period, which is the raison d’être of accounting. Entities have strong incentives for under-provisioning, because: • It is generally not fully tax deductible in many jurisdictions; and • Many business executives take a short term view of showing enhanced profits. High provisioning reduces profits, and hence dividend distribution and share price; and more importantly, bonus payment to top management and staff. The same holds good for banks also. However, banking business adds another dimension to the issue, that is, of pro-cyclicality. Banks are more prone to business cycles. In good times, there is demand for credit and banks become aggressive loosening credit standards. Debtors also do well and service the loans in time. Loan loss rates are below the long-run average, and need for loan loss provisions are less. Therefore, loan loss provisions are usually under-funded during a boom period. When the business cycle turns and economic conditions deteriorate, borrowers’ credit quality tends to worsen leading to a higher probability towards default in servicing interest and principal payment. These loans become non-performing assets (NPAs). Banks’ profits go down but at the same time they are required to make higher loan loss provisions for the non-performing loans. This is the cyclical property of credit losses. This results in banks becoming cautious and restricts lending; as a result the risk spills over to the real sector of the economy. Procyclicality thus has the impact of amplifying business cycles. In terms of the accounting standard for recognizing credit losses, the IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, a financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  or more events (i.e., loss event/s) that occurred after the initial recognition of the assets, and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated. This approach to provisioning, also known as “incurred loss” based approach waits for certain events to happen such as default, delinquency in interest or principal payments, significant financial difficulty of the borrower, etc., before losses can be recognized. Provision for losses can only be made after the loss event has been identified, or loss has been incurred, and not in a proactive manner ex ante before the event, based on “expected losses”. The incurred loss model came under severe criticism after the recent global financial crisis for delaying loss recognition. There is a view that earlier recognition of loan losses based on “expected losses” could have potentially reduced the cyclical impacts of the recent crisis. However, accountants were not comfortable with the expected loss based provisioning on the fear that it could foster earnings management by profit smoothening and compromise the raison d’être of accounting to give a “true and fair” or transparent picture of the financials of an entity as on the reporting date. Improvements in credit risk models have supported the concept of expected losses and unexpected losses. From a conceptual point of view, loan loss provisions should cover expected losses while capital provides an adequate buffer for unexpected losses. The internal rating based (IRB) model approach under Basel II credit risk capital computation gave a fillip to the expected loss based provisioning and unexpected loss based capitalisation. In the immediate aftermath of the crisis, in April 2009, the G20 leaders called upon the accounting standard setters to work urgently with banking supervisors and regulators to improve standards on valuation and provisioning and achieve a single set of high quality global accounting standards. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) took it forward by publishing a document in August 2009 titled Guiding principles for replacement of IAS 39 that was also sent to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These principles state that loan loss provisioning should be robust and based on sound methodologies that reflect expected credit losses in the banks’ existing loan portfolio over the life of the portfolio. The accounting model for provisioning should allow early identification and recognition of losses by incorporating a broader range of available credit information than presently included in the incurred loss model. For the purpose of these principles, expected credit losses are estimated losses on a loan portfolio over the life of the loans and considering the loss experience over the complete economic cycle. Post-crisis, there is convergence of views among the prudential regulators and accounting standard setters on the desirability of a forward looking expected loss approach to loan loss provisioning. In reality, financial results do objectively worsen in an economic downturn in a way similar to the rise in unemployment rates. Therefore applying an impairment model based on expected losses is arguably a faithful representation of current conditions. The IASB, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as well as the BCBS are actively engaged in finding a solution to this complex problem. In this context, the expected loss based provisioning approach is a topic of significant interest for the global financial markets. Even when banks and accountants were making incurred loss based provisioning for identified losses, called “specific” provisions, they also voluntarily did make some sort of “general” provisions or “floating” provisions. These “general” provisions are not based on any expected loss model, but as a prudent practice to strengthen the balance sheets. The Basel Committee also incentivises general provision up to 1.25% of credit risk weighted assets by counting towards Tier 2 capital. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Concepts and principles Dynamic provisioning is a technique that allows banks to build up loan loss provisions when their profits are growing to draw on these provisions during an economic downturn. There are several variants of dynamic provisioning. However, the underlying principle behind dynamic provisioning is that provisions should be set in line with estimates of long-run, or through-the-cycle expected losses. This will help in breaking pro-cyclicality and creating countercyclical provision buffers. Dynamic provisioning builds on this and can be generally expressed as: Dynamic provision = Expected loss provision – Specific provision, or Dynamic provisions = Through-the-cycle loss ratio * Flow of new loans – Flow of specific provision, where specific provisions correspond to realised or incurred losses, or simply put: Dynamic provisions = Expected loss provisions – Incurred loss provisions. ----- (1) 17. A close look at the formula shows that during good times dynamic provisions are positive and add to loss provisions as realised or incurred losses, that is, specific provisions are lower than their through-the-cycle estimates. During bad times, the opposite takes place and negative dynamic provisions deplete the loss provision buffer. Therefore, provisioning, instead of becoming pro-cyclical, becomes countercyclical. The Spanish model Let me now talk about the dynamic provisioning as implemented in Spain. Prior to introduction of dynamic provisioning in Spain, the Spanish banks’ provisioning patterns were close to those that currently prevail in most countries. According to the standard system, banks were required to make two types of provisions for loan losses. First, a general provision was made as a fixed percentage of credit growth. This intends to account for losses incurred on an average on a homogeneous portfolio without specifically identifying the suspect loans. Second, specific provisions for delinquent assets i.e., incurred losses on individual loans were made which depended on the level of risk of the loan and on the time overdue. Dynamic provisioning system was put in place in Spain by its Central Bank, Bank of Spain in July 2000 to cope with a sharp increase in credit risk on Spanish banks’ balance sheets following a period of significant credit growth during the late 1990s. Intense competition among banks had resulted in inadequate loan pricing. Moral suasion also proved to be inadequate in inducing banks to become more conservative. There was a significant reduction in non-performing loans in the second half of the 1990s indicating very low specific provisions. In fact, in 1999 Spain had the lowest ratio of loan loss provisions to total loans among OECD countries. It also had the highest correlation between the provisioning ratio and the GDP growth rate (–0.97) for the period 1991–1999. Thus loan loss provisions were very pro-cyclical in Spain: they were very low during periods of expansion and very high during recessions, while credit risk and under-pricing of risk spread during the boom period. Under the new system (2000 regime) in addition to specific and general provision, statistical provision was added which was the difference between the latent risk (risk parameter dependent upon the credit growth) and the specific provision. The statistical provision was charged quarterly. This implied that statistical provisions for a given period could be positive or negative, depending on credit growth and contemporary bad loans. When statistical provisions accumulate they generate a fund called statistical provision fund. The fund had an upper and lower limit. After the introduction of the statistical provision, the upswing of the economic cycle turned out to be much stronger and longer than anticipated. This, together with an initial design of the limits of the fund that was based on very rough estimates led to a rapid increase in the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  statistical provision fund, whereas specific provisions were kept to a minimum, in an environment of historically low non-performing loans. In 2004 it became evident that the accumulation of statistical provisions was probably excessive. At the same time, the Bank of Spain was being increasingly criticised in international accounting fora for applying a mechanism that appeared to favour profit smoothing, which was considered contrary to the “fair value” principles and International Accounting Standards. To correct this excessive accumulation and to counter the criticisms of accountants, a new accounting regulation was adopted in 2004. The changes involved reverting to only two types of loan loss provisions, viz., general and specific provisions. General provision was the sum of two components based on two important parameters, alpha and beta. Alpha was the average estimate of credit losses, say expected losses based on past experience and beta was the historical average of specific provisions. The underlying principles behind dynamic provisions in Spain was to build up general provisions that account for (i) expected losses in new loans extended in a given period; and (ii) historical average losses on the outstanding stock of loans at the end of that period after netting off specific provisions incurred during the period. Formula-wise: General provisions during a period = [alpha * incremental loans] + [(beta – delta specific provision / outstanding loans) * (outstanding loans)] or General provisions during a period = [alpha * incremental loans] + [(beta * outstanding loans) – (delta specific provision)] -------- (2) The first component of the general provision was alpha times the incremental loans granted by a bank. This component therefore recognised the credit risk expected during expansions although the loan losses have not yet been identified in a specific loan. The second component was beta times the stock of outstanding loans reduced by specific provisions made during the period. One can observe that in the second component, beta which is historical average specific provision is compared with the current level of specific provision. This difference would be positive during periods of boom when the current levels of specific provisions are lower than the historical average and thus adds towards the balance of general provision. Similarly, in periods of downturns/recession, the current level of specific provision may be higher than the historical average of specific provision; in that case, the second component becomes negative and this component is subtracted from the first component and may cause the general provision fund to be drawn down. Thus the second component is countercyclical in nature which builds up during upturns and is drawn during downturns. The second component is also reflective of the strength and weakness of the lending cycle depending upon the addition/drawals made from the general provision. Alpha and beta were calibrated by Bank of Spain for six homogeneous risk categories ranging from zero risk (cash, public sector debt, etc.) to high risk (credit cards and overdrafts). An option was also given to banks to use their own calibrated parameters based on their own credit histories and experiences, subject to supervisory approval. Let me give an example to make things clearer. Assume outstanding stock of loans in a bank X to be Rs. 1000 and the previous year balance of loans to be Rs. 800, thus assuming the incremental growth in credit to be Rs. 200. Further assume that the alpha and beta component as given by the supervisor to be 2% and 1% respectively. Assume the specific provision required for the current year to be Rs. 8. For the first year, bank X would make a general provision equal to alpha times incremental loans i.e. 2% of Rs. 200 i.e., Rs. 4 plus difference between beta times outstanding loans and specific provision which in this case works out to 1% of Rs. 1000 – Rs. 8 = Rs. 2. Thus, a total general provision of Rs. 6 (4+2) would be made by the bank X during the year. Total provision made during the year would be the sum of general provision and specific provision i.e., Rs. 6 + Rs. 8 = Rs. 14. To avoid under provisioning and excess provisioning and to satisfy the accountants, the general provisions had a floor of 33% and a cap of 125% of alpha times outstanding loans. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  These limits were placed in 2004 when most banks were already at the new upper limit at the time of the application of this regulation. In general, excess provisioning would occur in a long expansionary phase as specific provisions remain below the betas and the alphas also contribute positively. The cap is intended to avoid loan loss provisions growing for too long a period, producing coverage ratios (ratios of provisions to non-performing loans) that are unrealistic. The total provisions under the dynamic provisioning model viz., summation of general provisions and specific provision thus worked out to alpha times incremental loans plus beta times outstanding credit. The Spanish model is conservative as it creates general provision equal to alpha times incremental credit growth i.e., the general provision still increases due to the first component even if the current level of specific provisions are equal to historical average specific provision. However, during economic downturns the second component is solely responsible for reduction in the stock of provisions. The FSA model Having explained the basic tenets behind the Spanish dynamic provisioning model, it is also important to briefly cover the FSA, UK model of dynamic provisioning suggested in the Turner Review of March 2009. Under the FSA model, dynamic provisions are the difference between long term loan loss estimate and incremental specific provision. Thus, dynamic provisions will be created when the incremental specific provision will be lower than the long term loan loss estimate which is akin to expected losses. The total provisions required during a year under the model viz., dynamic and specific works out to long term loan loss estimate. Under the FSA model, the flow of dynamic provisions is calculated using the stock of loans outstanding at the beginning of each year and is set as under: Dynamic provisions (to be made during the year) = Long term loan loss estimate – Incremental specific provisions ---- (3) I have taken the following example from the RBI’s discussion paper: 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Key assumptions in the example are: i. Ten-year economic cycle, ii. An average long-run loss rate of 0.8% of loans, an unchanged mix of loans within the portfolio, and iii. An average risk weight of 60% for the loans. It is also assumed that, mainly through the application of a variable scalar approach to Probability of Default (PDs), this risk weight does not itself vary with the cycle. The example starts with a loan book of Rs. 100 during the downturn, but before a dynamic provisioning approach has been implemented. In the early years, the dynamic provisioning reserve has no impact. Because it had not been set up in the good part of the cycle, prior to the downturn, there is no balance that may be run down in those years when actual credit losses exceed the long-run average. As the economy reverts to more normal conditions, growth starts to return and credit losses fall. During years 4 to 9 the latter are less than the long run average, and this allows a dynamic provisioning reserve to be built up. This can then be automatically reduced in years 11 and 12 in order to provide substantial coverage of the above average losses of the next downturn. The example shows how a dynamic approach would operate to build up a buffer in the good part of the cycle, and which could then be used up when the downturn materializes. It is based upon the existing Spanish approach; however, there is no separate alpha factor covering growth in the stock of loans. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  The Peruvian model Some South American countries have also introduced dynamic provisioning, the notable one is Peru. Peru has introduced cyclical provisioning in the form of general provisions, linked to the rate of growth of GDP. When GDP growth exceeds a certain threshold rate (i.e., booming period), the cyclical provisioning is activated; and when GDP growth rate falls below a threshold level, cyclical provisioning is deactivated. It is assumed that GDP growth precedes credit growth and GDP is a better systemic growth indicator than credit. Proposed Indian framework Let me now come to the need for introduction of a dynamic provisioning framework in India and the theoretical model suggested in the discussion paper of March 2012. Although RBI has been following a policy of countercyclical variation of standard asset provisioning rates based on available data and judgement, the current provisioning framework does not have any inbuilt countercyclical or cycle smoothening element based on an analysis of credit cycles and loss history. The need for introducing a countercyclical provisioning framework was long recognized by RBI. However, the lessons from global financial crisis further strengthened the need to introduce such a framework. In December 2009, a minimum provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) was introduced by RBI to ensure build up of provisioning buffer when banks in general were making good profits. However, the same was intended to be an interim measure till the time any comprehensive scientific study based on credit history of our banks was attempted by RBI. As mentioned above, the concept of dynamic provisioning generated a lot of interest from supervisors world over as most of the Spanish banks remained profitable during the global financial crisis. As we in India were already thinking about implementing a countercyclical approach, dynamic provisioning as a concept came handy in starting further work in the area. After studying various approaches of dynamic provisioning implemented by various countries viz. Spain, Peru, etc, a dynamic provisioning framework was designed by RBI keeping in view the uniqueness of Indian banking system. Let me now briefly talk about the theoretical model discussed by RBI in its discussion paper of March 2012. Dynamic provisioning framework in India is more or less based on the FSA model. The theoretical formula is as under: Delta dynamic provisions = Expected losses – incremental specific provisions = alpha * outstanding loans – incremental specific provisions ----- (4) The provisioning framework suggested by RBI has two components viz. (i) specific provisions and (ii) dynamic provisions. While specific provisions would be as per the RBI guidelines on NPA provisioning, dynamic provisions would be the difference between the long run average expected loss of the portfolio for one year and specific provisions made during the year. Thus, this will ensure that every year the charge to profit and loss account on account of specific provisions and dynamic provisions is maintained at a level of alpha times outstanding loans i.e., expected losses. As is observed from above, dynamic provisions are created only when the specific provisions are lesser than the expected losses. The framework thus ensures that at any point of time, provisioning equivalent to expected losses should be made. Thus, the objective of the dynamic provisioning framework is to smoothen the impact of incurred losses on the profit and loss account through the cycle, and not to provide general provisioning cushion for expected losses. That is the essence of Indian dynamic provision framework. Let me now discuss some of the important aspects relating to the proposed framework of dynamic provisioning. Although these are still being reviewed in light of the suggestions and feedback received from banks, I will briefly touch upon some of the important aspects of the framework: 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Loss given default (LGD) used in the calculation of expected loss is based on downturn LGD (instead of normal LGD) as used in the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk (IRB) of Basel II. However, this was moderated by putting a cap on this. In India, we have not really seen a severe downturn/cycle. The parameters calibrated by us are based on a data of 5–10 years. Calibration of loss parameters based on say 10 years of data may not adequately reflect the severity of probable losses which may occur if there is a downturn in the current cycle. In order to make a sound estimation, the actual loss data of at least 2–3 cycles, say 20–25 years is generally required. Therefore, there is risk in calibrating the dynamic provisioning rates based on average loss rate of just 10 years, and a reasonable element of conservatism is required to be added to the calibration. It was therefore felt that the downturn LGD rates based on the data for last 10 years could be a good measure of the required conservatism. However, to ensure that banks are not unnecessarily burdened, a cap is put in place. When the dynamic provisioning framework is first implemented, banks will transfer the entire amount of general provisions and floating provisions to the balance of dynamic provisions. Thereafter, dynamic provisions will grow with an amount equal to the difference between expected losses and specific provisions made during the year. For the purpose of determining the provisions that may be counted towards capital, in addition to calculation of dynamic provisions based on downturn LGD, banks would also be required to compute dynamic provisions based on normal LGD on notional basis. The difference between the two would be treated as general provisions counting towards Tier 2 capital, while dynamic provisions based on normal LGD would be treated as specific provisions. In order to ensure that banks do not draw down from dynamic provisions to absorb higher losses due to their own credit appraisal and credit supervision weaknesses and deplete it before the slowdown occurs, its draw down is proposed to be allowed specifically by RBI based on evidence of a slowdown. A suitable framework for release of dynamic provisions will be formulated by RBI. In times when dynamic provisions have not been released by RBI, banks will not be allowed to dip into dynamic provisions if their profitability is not sufficient to accommodate the specific provisions. Methodology adopted for calibration of alpha (expected losses) Expected losses over next one year was calculated using Basel II IRB formula i.e., PD*LGD. Movement of NPA data over 5–10 years was used to calibrate PD and LGD. Alpha was calculated on a system wide basis for all the banks as well as for four asset classes, viz., Housing, Retail, Corporates (other than Infrastructure and SME) and Others based on a sample of 9 banks comprising 32.53% of gross advances of scheduled commercial banks as on March 31, 2010. Impact of the proposed framework While the impact of the proposed framework on individual banks was not assessed, on system wide basis, the provisioning charge on profit and loss account stood at 1.37% of gross advances annually. From the system-wide data collected at RBI, the average annual charge on profit and loss account on account of standard asset provision and specified provisions (including write offs) over the 8 year period (from 2003 to 2010) amounted to 1.04% of gross advances. The additional charge is mainly attributed to calibration of alpha based on downturn LGD. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Issues Some of the issues worth debating and considering while implementing dynamic provisioning are the following: Data challenges For the calibration of alpha, apart from the “bank as a whole” data, data was called from all the banks in respect of 8 segments viz. Infrastructure, Commercial Real Estate (CRE), Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), Other Corporate, Retail, Housing, Credit cards and Others. However, useful data for the purpose of this study could be submitted only by 9 banks for Retail, Housing and Other Corporate (corporate excluding infrastructure, SME and CRE). Due to this, the study was limited to Retail, Housing, Other Corporate (corporates excluding infrastructure, SME and CRE) and Others (which was a residual category). Ideally, alpha (expected loss) should be calculated for different loan segments which may exhibit different levels of riskiness and thus warrant a higher provisioning. Calibration of alpha should be based on forward-looking through-the-cycle probability of default of various asset classes/rating classes and should be based on the credit history of individual banks and reflect their own credit risk profile. However, it is not possible for all banks to have alpha calibrated based on their individual credit histories at this stage as the requisite data is not captured by them. Further, system-level alpha could not be calculated at this stage for all important segments requiring a separate alpha factor owing to the data issue. However, to ensure improved calibration, the discussion paper proposes to increase the number of segments apart from increasing the number of years of data and size of the sample in due course. Calibration of parameters Requiring banks to make provisioning based on standardized parameters calculated on system wide basis may penalize some banks which manage their credit portfolio in a better manner and has the risk of under-provisioning in case of riskier banks having poor credit portfolio. However, this may be addressed by requiring banks to gradually move over to calculation of alpha based on their own credit history. Timing of implementation It is argued that dynamic provisioning should be implemented in an upturn so that the same can ensure build up of some cushion which may be used during a downturn. With Indian economy and banking system experiencing some asset quality stress presently, a conscious call will be taken to implement dynamic provisioning at this stage of cycle. Lending cycle effect A dynamic provisioning system is usually designed using information on credit losses over the previous lending cycle. But there is no guarantee that a system designed in this way will be enough to cope with all the credit losses of the next downturn. Even in Spain, where the period used for the calibration included the worst recession in 40 years, it is not clear that the system will be enough to cover all credit losses. Profit smoothing There is widespread criticism that the dynamic provisions disguises crucial information by lumping together provisioning costs for incurred and expected losses in the income statement and is therefore counter to the objective of ensuring availability of timely and reliable information on bank performance. This can, however, be overcome by adequate disclosures about the extent of both specific and dynamic provisions. Such disclosures signal to the users of financial statements the differences between dynamic provisions representing 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  loss expectations based on historical data and specific provisions for losses actually identified in the loan portfolio. Interaction with the accounting standards One question which will invariably arise on implementing dynamic provisions would be whether the concept is in accordance with the international accounting standards? Thus far, the answer is negative since the concept of dynamic provisions deviates from the principle of incurred losses as followed currently in accounting. However, in the wake of the crisis, the two major global standard setters the IASB and the FASB have agreed in principle that the incurred loss model has its limitations and needs to be replaced by an expected loss model. The “trigger events” that is required for loans to be written down under the current incurred loss model of IAS 39 is proposed to be replaced by a forward looking expected loss based provisioning approach in the new IFRS 9 which is set to replace IAS 39. As per the current update on IFRS 9, it is proposed that in implementing an expected loss model, entities shall take into account information about past loss events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts of economic conditions and future events. It is therefore doubtful whether the dynamic provisioning system will fully be in accordance with the principles in the forthcoming IFRS 9 since it is exclusively based on historical loss experience. We need to carefully watch the developments on the accounting front to figure out how to dovetail the dynamic provisioning concept with the accounting principles. However, the progress made by IASB and FASB in developing an expected loss based provisioning standard is very slow. Why Spanish banks face problem now? The Spanish banking system was credited as one of the most equipped among western economies to cope up with the global financial crisis and was appreciated for its conservative and prudent banking rules – specially the dynamic provisioning which was seen in policy making circles as a model for the rest of the world. However, the crisis presently faced by the banking system in Spain mainly due to the real estate bubble that burst in 2007 has become the focal point of interest for supervisors and regulators. Apprehensions have been raised about whether Spanish banks actually faced the crisis or they merely postponed their losses, making it even worse for the banking sector. It is now apparent that banks in Spain were not reporting all their losses. This thinking was given a boost when Bankia, the largest mortgage lender of Spain, revised its earnings for 2011 from €309 million profit to €4.3 billion loss. There were newspaper reports stating that by exploiting the terms such as dynamic provisioning which became a euphemism for an old accounting trick called cookie jar accounting, Spanish banks understated past profits, and shifted them to later periods to mask future losses. Spanish banks claimed to have excess reserves long after they were depleted and in effect there was profit smoothing and earnings management, which made banks look healthy when they were in fact, quite the opposite. The Spanish case exemplifies the limitations of any provisioning framework in preventing exuberance in bank lending to inherently risky sectors of the economy. Economic cycles can be too powerful to negate the impact of prudential rules to some extent if there is serial underestimation of risks. While partial recognition of loan losses can buy some time in the short run, in the long run it leads to more problems due to loss of credibility. With specific reference to Spain again, the loan loss reserves proved insufficient for the housing collapse. In 2004, the Spanish Central Bank put a cap of 125% on the general provisions reportedly under pressure from banks. Also, the floor of 33% placed in 2004 was later removed. From that time onwards, Spanish bank lending which was already growing at 14 per cent annually went into a further boom, growing over 25% in 2005 and 2006. The reserves naturally proved insufficient when crisis struck. This further strengthens the belief that economic cycles which are harsher and deeper than previous ones can wipe out the provisions based on earlier cycles. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  It should be noted that dynamic provisions are no panacea for all ills plaguing the financial system. It needs to be accompanied by other macro-prudential tools aimed at mitigating pro-cyclicality and systemic risks. Further, while calibrating a dynamic provisioning system, care needs to be taken to maintain countercyclical reserves in line with expected losses so as to avoid both insufficient buffers and excessive provision coverage. There is no guarantee that dynamic provisions will be enough to cope with all the credit losses of a downturn if the cycle turns out to be deeper than anticipated. Conclusion The crisis experienced by Spain cannot dilute the efficacy of the concept of dynamic provisioning. Dynamic provisioning is a tool that certainly deserves attention from policy makers and regulators for it distributes the loan losses evenly over the credit cycle and so applies the breaks on an important source of pro-cyclicality in banking. No prudential rules/regulations can help save a banking system if there is failure of corporate governance. To avoid the pitfalls observed in the Spanish model, RBI has preferred to take downturn LGD in calibrating expected losses or alpha. This is a prudent approach. Let me now conclude. We discussed about the need for provisioning; drawbacks of an incurred loss based provisioning model; post-crisis, the need for countercyclical provisioning tools based on expected losses; the underlying concepts and principles of dynamic provisioning; the framework as implemented in Spain; and the proposed framework in India; issues in implementation and the lessons from the recent crisis in Spain. Dynamic or expected loan loss provisioning can contribute to financial stability by recognizing the losses early in the cycle at the time of loan origination by building up buffers in good times that can be used in bad times, thereby limiting the consequences during a downturn. While there is no guarantee that dynamic provisions will be enough to cope with all the credit losses of a downturn and therefore may not tame credit cycles by itself, the time has come for forward looking provisions which when properly calibrated can act as a dependable macro-prudential policy instrument, to hedge against risks in banks’ balance sheets thereby enhancing the resilience of both individual banks as well as banking system as a whole. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  DeLisle Worrell: The economic and financial system in Barbados Welcome remarks by Dr DeLisle Worrell, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at the Domestic Financial Institutions Conference, Bridgetown, 20 September 2012. *      *      * The time we spend together here today is an opportunity to reflect on the nature and effects of financial transactions in our economy, in an effort to better understand how the financial system works. We do well always to remember how imperfect is our understanding of the economic and financial system. In economics, as in many other areas of life, we often speak as though we are sure of the consequences of this or that policy, when in fact there are so many factors at work in every case that the outcome is always uncertain. That is why, from time to time, it is essential that we step back from the action and examine in some depth how things have turned out, and what that tells us about how things work. It is important that the Central Bank and the Financial Services Commission, the regulators, do this in collaboration with you, the private financial institutions. The economy works to our benefit only when all actors, the Central Bank, Government, financial institutions, firms and households all share an understanding of how the actions of each affects the others and the economy as a whole. A great strength of the Barbadian economy, and one which we should celebrate, is the quality of the institutions which inform the discussion of our economy. Our social partnership is celebrated around the world, and we need to pay tribute to the quality and comprehensiveness of our media’s coverage of economic issues. Today’s conference is a contribution to the study and discussion of our financial system, so that we can improve the way it works, in the interests of our national development. Our agenda today includes an update on the stability of our financial system, which we continue to monitor closely. In January we published a comprehensive report on the financial system, and we published an update in July. Our system is sound and our major institutions have adequate capital and reserves, but we continue to see the adverse effects of the prolonged recession on credit quality. The process of resolving the Clico insolvency is on-going, managed by the judicial managers, under the supervision of the courts. Other insurance companies are profitable. Our Financial Services Commission is now into its second year, and there have been changes of substance in the regulation of nonbanks. The financial system as a whole, banks, other financial institutions, the FSC, Government and the Central Bank, are all preparing for the next Financial Stability Assessment Programme (FSAP), planned for next year. The FSAP, which is conducted jointly by the IMF and World Bank, takes a comprehensive and in depth overview of the financial systems of their member countries, on a periodic basis. Our programme includes papers on interest rate policy and foreign exchange transactions, both areas where we have revisited past experience in search of fresh insight about the nature and effects of these variables. In the case of interest rates we are suggesting a refinement of policy, to reflect the strong links between Barbados’ financial system and North America in a more systematic way. In the case of the foreign exchange market, it is unclear whether any change is warranted, and we look forward to your views on our presentation. We are happy to have as our luncheon speaker today Dr Arnold McIntyre, Co-ordinator of the Caribbean Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), among the most useful of organisations of its kind in the world. CARTAC’s strengths include the fact that it has effectively leveraged the expertise which the Caribbean already has in individual countries, and made it available to the region as a whole. The Centre has also been able to respond rapidly and in a targetted way to the perceived technical assistance needs of the Caribbean. Arnold will speak to us about the Centre’s work. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  We have set aside much of our agenda for opportunities to hear from the financial institutions that we serve. Mr Roger Archer will offer a perspective on how regulations might be crafted, and we have two panels. The first is on the changes that have taken place and are continuing, in the practice of banking and related financial transactions. I am particularly looking forward to the second, on investing in Barbados, because investment is the key to development and growth, and I believe we should always seek ways to ensure that finance is directed to activities that are profitable, and will enhance the growth potential of our economy. The outcome of today’s session will be food for thought. This is not a decision making forum. It is true that we will be discussing past decisions and their effects, and we will be outlining the framework of forthcoming decision making in at least one area, that of interest rates. However, the importance of today’s meeting is not to be found in decisions taken, but in the exchange of views among ourselves on the matters we will discuss, so that we can all go away with ideas on how to do our jobs better. Thank you all for coming and enjoy today’s deliberations. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Brief update on Fiji’s economy Address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the opening of HFC Lautoka Branch, Suva, 20 September 2012. *      *      * The Chairman of the HFC Board, Mr. Tom Ricketts  Board of Directors  Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Isikeli Tikoduadua  Management and Staff of HFC  Distinguished Guests  Ladies and Gentlemen  Introductory comments  Good evening and bula vinaka to you all.  I am honoured to be here this evening for the opening of HFC’s new Lautoka Branch and offer my warm congratulations on the company achieving 50 years of service to Fiji.  I thought to begin with a bit of history as this year marks HFC’s Golden Jubilee year.  Just over fifty years ago the British Overseas Development Corporation, through its locally incorporated company, the Fiji Development Corporation, partnered with the Fijian Colonial Government to form Home Finance Company Limited. The institution, which was registered on 30 June 1962, was reportedly set up primarily to provide Government guaranteed assistance for housing to civil servants.  Coincidentally, it was also in the 1960s that I spent some of my formative years in these very surroundings while my dad served as the Post Master, Lautoka. Needless to say, I have many fond memories of this City and its neighborhood areas.  HFC – Home Finance Company Limited  With such a rich history dating back to our colonial days, Home Finance can lay claim to its fair share of credit for playing a role in advancing Fiji’s financial system and economic development. Three milestones are worth mentioning in the Company’s history to bridge the past with the present: –  • 33 years ago in 1979 the Fiji National Provident Fund first acquired a partial ownership,  • 17 years ago in 1995, the Government divested its partial ownership in the company and  • A decade ago in 2002, Home Finance Company Limited rebranded as HFC, launching the vibrant colours we are familiar with today and also diversified markedly from its traditional objective of home loan provider.  I have watched the growth of the company with interest over the years, particularly since 2004 when I headed the Supervision function at the Reserve Bank.  A decade ago, primarily as a consequence of competitive pressures, HFC rebranded, diversified and repositioned itself. Invariably, as is so often seen in various facets of life, as we adapt, change and successfully address a set of challenges, new ones arise. Understandably therefore, HFC has faced some difficult years, but I am pleased to say that 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  they have persevered and pulled through well. HFC today has a well entrenched market presence and, I am happy to say, complies with all Reserve Bank requirements.  Currently, HFC boasts an asset base of a little over $247 million; a lending book in excess of $196 million and deposits totalling approximately $157 million. These figures have grown threefold in the past decade. Apart from its Headoffice, there are four branches: in Suva; Namaka; Labasa; and this one in Lautoka. An agency was recently opened in Ba and I understand a fifth branch will be added soon in Nakasi. The number of employees has grown to 82 officers managing a total of over 1,300 deposit accounts and approximately 2,500 loan accounts. HFC’s products have expanded and now include Term Deposits, Home Loans, Personal Loans, and Asset Finance Loans, Investment and Commercial Loans.  However, I reiterate that as challenges occur and are addressed, new ones inevitably arise. With increased growth comes increased risks and responsibilities.  HFC has experienced strong growth and, in line with its vision to serve the people with innovative financial products, recently branched out concertedly into commercial lending. This alters the institution’s risk profile and necessitates deviations from the norm. In this regard, we have seen HFC strengthen its corporate governance and risk management framework significantly over the past few years. The Reserve Bank will continue to work closely with HFC, as we do with all licensed financial institutions, to ensure inherent risks are adequately mitigated with the required buffers and oversight systems and processes.  Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to meet with the Senior Management of HFC with regard to its business performance, views on the general business environment, products and services and the overall strategic intent of the Company. Let me just say that there are bold commitments in the offing. The relocation and refurbishment of this branch underlines HFC’s commitment and dedication to its strategic goals and meeting the needs of its customers both current and potential.  HFC is proud of its local management and local ownership. I am sure you will all agree with me that they back this up with being an exemplary corporate citizen. We often open the daily newspapers to read about HFC being involved in some community project:- flood supplies distribution; hospital ward upgrades; involvement with Senior Citizens; the WOWS Cancer initiative, just to name a few. And yes the name HFC cropped up recently pitching in to reward Fiji’s first Olympic Champion, Iliesa Delana.  In addition to all this, HFC has introduced products to support the Reserve Bank’s initiatives towards Export and Import Substitution and Flood Rehabilitation.  I am told that there are a few more innovative products in the pipeline to be launched soon. I commend the Board and Management of HFC for their empathy and support of nation building initiatives, not only in terms of the facilities I have mentioned, but also in our financial inclusion initiatives.  The Fiji economy  Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me say a few words about our economy. You would be aware that our latest forecast has growth pegged at 2.7 percent this year, the strongest for some time. The forecast is currently being reviewed by the Macroeconomic Policy and Technical Committees as we gear up for the 2013 National Budget announcement. However, all indicators are generally moving in line with expectations. Real sector growth has been broad based. While some sectors are exhibiting lower growth than forecasted, others are exceeding forecasts. Investment is picking up and consumption is strong. There are extremely positive signs that we are on the cusp of strong economic growth going forward. This is underpinned by the ongoing reforms by Government, including the fiscal measures put in place in the 2012 Budget, which are fueling the positive sentiments. Our key threats are any deterioration to global growth which could impact on our trading partners, hikes in commodity or oil prices and of course natural disasters.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In terms of the Reserve Bank’s twin statutory objectives, inflation is trending down; the year-end inflation forecast remains unchanged at 3.5 percent, and foreign reserves are comfortable at just under $1.6 billion or the equivalent of 5 months of retained imports. Given this scenario, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative.  Concluding remarks  Coming back to the business at hand, it is investment like HFC has put in place here today, that will fuel and drive the increasing positive sentiment in the economy. There have been a number of new investments noted in this city and we certainly hope the trend will continue.  I would like to again thank Isikeli for his kind invitation. I reiterate my thanks to the Board, management and staff of HFC for their support and cooperation with the Reserve Bank’s policies and guidelines. I also salute this institution on achieving its Golden Jubilee Year of existence and for the role that it has played in Fiji’s economic development. Congratulations on this new branch and all the very best in your future endeavours.  Official Opening  I now have much pleasure in declaring the new HFC Lautoka Branch open.  Vinaka vaka levu.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: Global rules for global financial markets Speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, as a response to the Note of the Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace, Frankfurt am Main, 19 September 2012. *      *      * I was asked to share my views today on the note of the Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace on reforming the international financial and monetary system. Lack of global financial regulation I highly welcome the general tone of the Pontifical Council’s note which stresses the need for the financial sector to serve the overall economy and, accordingly, the common good. With respect to financial regulation, the note rightly points to the lack of truly global regulation for global financial markets as a key factor for the financial crisis that started in 2007. While financial markets around the globe became more and more integrated and interconnected over past decades, financial regulation remained largely national – despite of ongoing coordination efforts in international committees and groupings. The crisis highlighted some inefficiencies of international coordination in financial regulation and necessitated numerous ad-hoc interventions by public authorities. Those events made clear that although rules and regulations were partly agreed on internationally, their transition into national rules and legislation was fragmented and, at times, even inconsistent. Not surprisingly, financial institutions had a strong incentive to engage in regulatory arbitrage. An internationally coordinated regulatory response is therefore warranted.  Minimum body of internationally agreed rules I agree with the conclusion of the Pontifical Council that we need a minimum, shared body of rules and regulations for global financial markets. But one size does not fit all. Accordingly, and in line with the principle of subsidiarity, the rules should be set at the international level but allow for sufficient flexibility to adapt them to peculiarities of national financial systems. However, I do not see the need to create a new “global authority” for that purpose. Over the past years, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has emerged as the central body coordinating the international financial sector reform agenda set in train by G20 Leaders at their Washington Summit in 2008 and further developed at subsequent meetings. The FSB brings together international institutions and standard-setting bodies as well as regulators, central bankers and finance ministers from advanced and emerging economies with the most important financial sectors globally. In the meantime, the FSB has gained a track record and several important cornerstones of the reform agenda have been set in place. Take the policy framework for dealing with systemically important financial institutions or the new regulatory standard for bank capital adequacy and liquidity – commonly termed as Basel III – as examples. G20 Leaders, in late 2011, agreed to further strengthen the FSB’s role in order to enable it to keep pace with its growing role in promoting the development and implementation of regulation. Accordingly, in June 2012, G20 Leaders endorsed the FSB’s recommendations on strengthening its capacity, resources and governance. I strongly support the further development of the FSB because I am convinced that it will further improve the elaboration of international rules and regulations as well as international cooperation in regulation and supervision and help to achieve an international level playing field. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Rigorous monitoring of national implementation While rule-making at the international level is a necessary condition for financial stability, it is by no means sufficient. For the rules to be effective, they have to be translated in national laws and regulations in a timely and consistent manner. Therefore, we need to strictly monitor implementation, disclose the respective findings, and let peer pressure work its magic. The FSB and international standard-setting bodies have jointly developed a coordination framework for implementation monitoring to ensure consistent implementation of the reform agenda. As another important part of implementation monitoring, the International Monetary Fund together with the World Bank is regularly assessing the adherence of its member countries to international standards. Thereby, the Fund is promoting international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability. In response to weaknesses detected during the financial crisis, the Fund initiated various reforms with the aim of strengthening its internal governance as well as its analytical capabilities. I highly welcome those reforms which will further improve the Fund’s work. To sum up, I regard strengthening existing bodies in the field of global financial regulation and the international monetary system as the right way forward for two main reasons. Firstly, it allows building upon the substantial expertise gathered in existing institutions. Secondly, jurisdictions are obviously reluctant to further cede national sovereignty to a supra-national level. The enduring debate about the creation of a fiscal union in Europe is providing just one vivid example in this regard. Accordingly, the creation of a global regulatory authority does not seem to be practical at this point in time. Moreover, I regard the current practice of setting rules for the global financial markets as appropriate. In a first step, set the rules at the international level. As a second step, rigorously monitor their translation in national laws and regulations to ensure consistency and a global level playing field. As I have pointed out, we have adequate institutions at the global level to fulfill these tasks, so currently I do not see the need to create new authorities for that purpose. Thank you for your attention! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Managing risks in a financial stability world – how different is this prudential world? Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank of the Philippines), at the Joint General Assembly of ACI Phils, FMAP, IHAP, MART, NASBI and TOAP, Makati City, 19 September 2012. *      *      * The Officers and Members of ACI Phils led by Coco Martin, FMAP led by Mike Ferrer, IHAP led by Manny Tordesillas, MART led by Raul Victor Tan, NASBI led by Roderick Dones, and TOAP led by Raffy Ayuste, colleagues from the BSP, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. It is a pleasure to be joining here tonight six (6) organizations… Since your last General Membership Meeting, I am told two organizations have been added to the Meeting. In other words, the “Clan” has gotten bigger. Among your six organizations, you cover a very broad spectrum of the market activities which we oversee… from the cash market, to the foreign exchange market, to securities underwriting and brokering and then to trust.  This gathering is impressive for its sheer breadth of operating interests, all falling under the purview of the banking regulator…This Assembly therefore presents a unique opportunity for the BSP to share its views with several different organizations at the same time. I would therefore like to thank you for the invitation.  The operating environment As I have done for a few years now during your General Membership Meeting, I shall begin my remarks by touching on our targets and expectations over our policy horizon.  If you attended our Mid-Year Economic Briefing last Monday (17 September) at the PICC, I think you would agree with me that, as in the immediately preceding Economic Briefing hosted by the BSP-IRO, the public’s interest in our economy is palpable. The excitement about our economic prospects remains high. The presenters on the government side were optimistic, while the reactors on the private sector side were upbeat.  Our current growth rate is already at the doorstep of the National Government’s announced real GDP growth target for 2013 of 6–7 pct…Inflation is expected to be benign with the targets for headline inflation still set at 3–5 pct through 2014… The country’s external position is seen to remain robust. In fact, our current BOP and GIR are already at levels where they are forecast to be by 2013, if not higher.  Indeed, it would seem that the economic policies and reforms we have invested in over the years are converging towards solid high economic performance…But, in taking all these in, we need to be prudent… Let us not overvalue these better prospects lest we become complacent… You in the markets, of all, are most familiar with the still fragile global environment we operate in.  Over the past two weeks, both the ECB and the Fed announced new asset purchase programs – the OMT (although with some conditionality) and the QE3…Central bankers do know how to use acronyms also, don’t we? Both of these were much awaited by the market…both seemingly open-ended… both signalling prolonged easy monetary policy in the advanced economies…And, your reaction has so far been, as expected… To take on added risk, as layers of policy uncertainty are peeled away.  At the BSP, we are watchful of these developments. If these programs still don’t produce the desired effects on growth and unemployment in the US and Europe, the risks are clearly to the downside. Of particular concern to us is the adverse feedback loop between the financial 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  sector and the real sector due to 1) the interlocking sovereign debt and banking crisis in the euro zone…2) the overhang of the fiscal cliff in the US, and…3) the softening Chinese economy.  The 2007/08 financial crisis graphically illustrated to us that this feedback loop can be very strong and could take a non-trivial length of time to unwind…It also taught us that although focus on price stability is necessary, it is not a sufficient condition to protect economic growth… Furthermore, we should remember the lesson that looking only at the health of individual financial entities would not safeguard the system as a whole…Indeed, the recent crisis has taught us many things – but most importantly, it taught us that policies to ensure monetary stability and financial stability must go hand in hand.  I know that when market players listen to a speech from the BSP Governor, you have your radars up, hoping to hear “directionals”… On the peso you hope to hear about where the peso is going. Have we hit the top yet?... On interest rates, you hope to hear where these are headed. Have we hit the bottom yet?... Are we at the top? bottom? Is the BSP holding steady?... These are important concerns, of course, because where the peso is and where interest rates are, feed directly and quite concretely into the everyday lives of Filipinos.  But, I don’t have to speak about directionals tonight… Everyday you come across some quote from me on these financial prices… So I am certain you already know the stance of the BSP… One, that, the exchange rate will remain market-determined… although, Folks, be very aware that the BSP is watching how you conduct yourselves in the market… Two, that the policy interest rates will always primarily be dictated by the inflation outlook…but balanced off against concerns on excesses in other segments in the market such as real assets and capital flows. You know that our current assessment is – that inflation over the policy horizon will remain well within our target range of 3–5 percent. You must also know that the implication of this on interest rates is that interest rates will remain low over this period.  Many of you already have a good handle on how the BSP conducts monetary policy and our exchange rate policy. I can say that we have had some success in communicating monetary policy to the market. But we still need to work on conveying the nuances when it comes to financial stability.  So, instead of one-dimensional directionals, I would like us to spend the next few minutes discussing financial stability.  In the BSP, we believe it is important to pursue financial stability because financial stability makes the transmission of other policies (including monetary policy) more effective… Moreover, we pursue it because financial stability helps financial institutions better allocate resources. When the risk/return tradeoffs are known and steady, returns are more “predictable” even when the risks are relatively higher. In other words, financial stability benefits both the policy makers and the market.  So what’s new about financial stability?  The original draft of this speech contained the BSP financial stability framework…Our definition of financial stability…The governance framework in the BSP…And how we are pushing the agenda to go past the BSP borders.  But in the interest of time, let me just focus on a couple of points (well, five points to be precise) to help you better appreciate what we mean in the BSP when we talk about financial stability, and hopefully along the way, this discussion will help you also understand what all these mean for you and the institutions you represent.  Let me begin with capital. The BSP is now more “focused” on capital adequacy – but from the perspective of strengthening the ability of capital to absorb losses. Lest I be misunderstood, I want to emphasize that our regulations in the past were never just simply 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  about exacting compliance to a specific ratio. What is different today is the focus. Now the goal is to make capital more efficient in mitigating potential losses from the type of bailouts we saw in other jurisdictions. Today, we are (in a sense) being “stricter” about what goes (or does not go) into both the numerator and the denominator of that ratio. By doing this, we are broadening the risks that are accounted for by such capital. This is the BSP view on CAR from a financial stability perspective.  The CAR should not keep only your compliance officer awake at night… It should concern everyone here, including you who are in the confines of your trading rooms…. Ladies and gentlemen, the types of transactions and risks you can undertake will now be defined by the amount and kind of capital your institutions have… But you already know that… from the example of the 15pct risk weight on NDF. It is this kind of policy framework that drives the new regulations we have been putting out… And this is my second point…We now view regulation using the “systemic” lens. After the additional NDF risk weight, you must have noted that the BSP has become more visibly concerned with issues that have systemic implications. These are reflected in, among others, the refinements to SDA trading, which have been intended to contain possible carry trades funding SDAs, and initiatives to improve reporting on real estate exposures, which are expected to ensure that all possible exposures are contained in the net and accounted for in the limits set. These reforms are some of the most recent that we put out… but many more lie ahead – from the money market to the capital market and to the derivative market. Some in the pipeline are 1) defining the benchmark yield curve so that pricing is transparent and independent of one large market participant’s rejections (I meant actions) in the auction market, 2) awakening the moribund repo markets so that liquidity is improved and one-sided quotes will be a thing of the past, 3) standardizing OTC derivatives so that structured products would have more legs to stand on, and 4) obtaining the components of shadow banking so that the unregulated activities are brought to the surface. While I am listing forthcoming reforms, let me also share with you that there are talks in the regulatory circle that consumer protection will be elevated to a core banking function and not simply an advocacy… You should keep this in mind because when this happens, it would materially impact your product development, disclosure practices and marketing efforts, on one hand, and trading and settlement infrastructure, on the other.  This brings me to my third point. Market infrastructure … The perennial elephant in the room… Friends, new international guidelines are being introduced. Let me rattle off a few more acronyms. I am afraid it’s not only central bankers who love acronyms. Regulators have an even bigger penchant for these!… CSDs (for central securities depositories), SSS (for securities settlement systems), CCPs (for central counterparties) and TRs (for trade repositories). I am not saying BSP will take all these in…. But once these guidelines are in place, we will have to consider how we can adopt these best practice guidelines to our domestic operating context. I assure you, the BSP will be consultative in rolling out the guidelines... but at the same time, the BSP will not allow parochial motivations to cloud what is best for the market and financial stability. Moving on to my fourth point… In considering financial stability, the BSP has pushed changes in the financial governance framework so it starts with the financial institution itself. I realize this point may seem at odds with what I just said about parochial motivations…. But having solid governance structures in the banks would precisely help the institution veer away from such insular thinking.  Governance was never meant to be the reactive function of the regulator. Our recently released revised compliance framework highlights the accountability of banks with actions and processes that they undertake. We have also just issued the new corporate governance and risk management guidelines for trusts (I am told the latter had undergone considerable discussion and coordination…Is this is indicative of how tough Trust practitioners are?) 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Finally, it would be a serious oversight if I do not touch on the monetary policy aspects of financial stability. Our calibration of monetary policy rates is towards price stability but it clearly will have real economy implications. In addition, the interest rate benchmarks that monetary policy sets will directly impact the cost of leverage and the volume of credit exposures. Obviously, the use of one policy lever (in this case, policy interest rates) would not always be able to address – at the same time – two policy objectives (price stability vs. financial stability) without conflict. Hence, the use of enhanced policy tool kit and policy coordination are imperative.  To operationalize all these at the BSP, we have recently created the BSP Financial Stability Committee (or FSComm) in addition to the BSP Advisory Committee (which recommends monetary policy to the Monetary Board).  From the five items I enumerated earlier, it is clear that financial stability crosses the three pillars of central banking. To close that “divide”, the FSComm is set at the highest level at the BSP, with the main committee manned by the three deputy governors and 3 of the most senior officers of the BSP… I have the pleasure of directly overseeing this committee. Closing remarks: market conduct ensures reform success I have given you some of the guideposts, or mile markers on the road to financial stability – as we see it in the BSP.  The BSP can put out regulations and create the enabling regulatory environment… but, after everything is said and done, it is the market that will execute transactions.  A wise man once warned that when dealing with the market, one should anticipate that it is not so much about the destination, as it is about the ride itself. Financial targets tell us where we want to go but it is risk-taking and risk management that get us there. No doubt, the ride can be enjoyable and give you a high, but if you don’t manage the risks well, then you – dragging everyone else with you – might end up in one big traffic jam, if not in the gutter.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am not about to ask everyone here – for lack of a better term – to “behave”… As Michael Corleone said to Sonny, “It’s not personal, it’s strictly business.” Acceptable behaviour is a given because that is what collective responsibility requires. And our collective responsibility are prudential concerns. Turned on its head, prudential concerns are our collective responsibility because the gains (as well as the losses) are always shared.  This applies as much to the cash market, to the foreign exchange market, to securities underwriting and brokering, to trusts and other fiduciary activities and certainly to banking.  I therefore ask the organizations and institutions here tonight, let us effectively partner with one another because... the stakes are far too great for the bottom line of any single balance sheet… the stakes far outweigh the high of the ride….  Ladies and gentlemen, we are in this together.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jörg Asmussen: New ECB premises topping out ceremony Welcome address by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the New ECB premises topping out ceremony, Frankfurt am Main, 20 September 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Fellow members of the Governing Council and General Council, Sehr geehrter Herr Oberbürgermeister Feldmann, Sehr geehrter Herr Pöllath, Sehr geehrter Herr Professor Prix, Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, Today’s ceremony marks another significant milestone for the ECB’s new home and for the city of Frankfurt. The last time we came together here, for the ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone in spring 2010, the Grossmarkthalle and a large pit were the dominant features of the construction site, with the works not yet having begun. The ECB’s then President, Jean-Claude Trichet, warmly welcomed the construction companies and their workers. Today, two years and four months later, the site looks quite different. We owe this remarkable achievement to the many people who have been involved in this enormous project.  On behalf of all my colleagues on the Governing Council, I would like to congratulate all of you who have helped to create this unique building complex.  Im Namen aller meiner Kollegen des EZB-Rats möchte ich allen gratulieren, die dazu beigetragen haben, diesen einzigartigen Gebäudekomplex zu errichten. Some of you have been involved in this project from the very beginning, others joined at the planning stage and then, once the construction companies and their workers arrived on site, the number of project participants doubled. And yet more new partners will join us between now and when the new ECB premises are complete. I am impressed to see how COOP HIMMELB(L)AU’s vision has become reality over the last two years of intensive construction works. It was by the time I became member of the ECB’s Executive Board that the high-rise structure began to rise above the buildings around it. Looking eastward from my office in the Eurotower, I have been able to watch the towers grow, and now the high-rise can be seen from many locations within the city and even from outside the city. The main structural works for the high-rise have now been completed, and we are already one step closer to moving to the Ostend, the ECB’s new neighbourhood.  Special thanks go to the construction companies, especially to all members of Züblin and Spannverbund and their subcontractors. Their continuous work and strong commitment to delivering the required quality on time has made it possible for us to have this celebration here today and to be able to gaze up at this impressive structure. It is a great achievement that we can already use all three of the main elements of the building complex:  • entering here via the entrance building, the future main entrance of the ECB, and  • celebrating the topping out in the Grossmarkthalle, actually in the future cafeteria,  • while enjoying the view of the double office tower.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The vision of the architect Mr Wolf Prix and his team was to create a new and unique landmark, combining “old and new” and his vision has now come to fruition for the ECB, a truly European institution.  Let us look back on some of the milestones that have been accomplished so far.  The double office tower has almost reached its final height of 185 metres. The last office floor was laid a few weeks ago, while the various platforms and steel structures within the atrium are currently being completed.  The restoration of the Grossmarkthalle is another remarkable element of the ongoing construction works. The former splendour of the facades and the concrete roof shell structure is slowly being restored, evoking again the vision of its architect, Martin Elsaesser. I would like to thank the company Torkret, which built the original market hall in the 1920s, for their excellent work and for being able to find suitable solutions – together with the architects and planners – for any surprise the old building fabric threw up. The next steps will also be important. Since the beginning of this year a myriad of technical equipment has been on site and hundreds of workers are busy installing the necessary technical infrastructure to ensure everything runs smoothly from an operational perspective once we move to our new premises. Fit-out works and the installation of walls and floors are also continuing in parallel, all taking place behind the newly completed facades of the high-rise and the restored Grossmarkthalle. Most visibly, the antenna and the technical areas will be installed at the top of the double office tower by the end of this year. We are monitoring the construction progress, costs and price developments very closely, adjusting and adapting where necessary. As a public institution, we are committed to using our resources responsibly. This is essential. So far the ECB has spent approximately €530 million in construction and other costs, including the purchase of the site. In 2005 the overall investment cost was estimated at €850 million at 2005 constant prices. It is anticipated that increases in the price of construction materials and construction activities from 2005 until the completion of the project in 2014 will lead to a €200 million increase in the overall investment cost.  In addition, there have been a number of unforeseen challenges that needed to be dealt with. The two major challenges unforeseen in 2005 were, first, that the original tender for a general contractor did not yield a satisfactory result and the ECB had to change to a different contractor model, and second, that the Grossmarkthalle – a large industrial heritage building from 1928 – presented a number of challenges that were not detected in the initial examination conducted prior to the acquisition:  • the foundations turned out to be insufficient and required additional support;  • the roof coverage was found to be contaminated and therefore could not be disposed of as envisaged;  • and parts of the concrete construction had insufficient steel support.  These factors are likely to account for additional costs of about €100–150 million, or a 10–14% increase in the overall investment cost. The resulting delay in the construction works on the Grossmarkthalle, as well as the entrance building, has been incorporated into the existing time schedule. I took on this project in the middle of the construction phase being aware that challenging projects as this face many obstacles. I hope that, as in the past, any future issues will be successfully overcome and that the result will fulfil our requirements.  My thanks go to the entire team of the New ECB Premises Project Office, for their continuous commitment and relentless efforts. It is very impressive to see what all of you working on this project have achieved together so far, not only our Project Office, but also the architects, planners, project management experts and construction managers as well as the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  construction companies, their subcontractors and all experts and workers! I have full trust in all of you that the good cooperation and commitment to this European project will lead to a successful completion and a functional headquarters for the ECB and for all its staff and visitors. The end product will meet our objective to provide the ECB with energy-efficient, functional and safe headquarters, while allowing for the necessary flexibility to foster interaction and communication – not only among staff, but also with our colleagues of the Eurosystem, the European Systemic Risk Board and other institutions. In addition, the new premises will reflect the values – integrity, excellence, efficiency and transparency – that are essential to our activities.  Ich bin sehr froh darüber, dass ich heute hier stehen und sagen kann, dass bisher kein schwerer Unfall auf der Baustelle geschehen ist – und dass, obwohl Hunderte von Menschen gleichzeitig auf der Baustelle arbeiten. Ich wünsche mir und hoffe sehr, dass dies auch für die restliche Bauzeit so bleiben wird. Ihnen allen hier auf der Baustelle viel Glück und alles Gute. Bleiben Sie gesund und passen Sie gut auf sich auf.  I am grateful that I can stand here today and say that there have been no major accidents on the construction site – even though hundreds of people are working here at the same time. I very much wish that this will continue to be the case for the remainder of the construction process and extend my best wishes to all of you working here on the site. Stay healthy and safe. Ich hoffe, dass die Menschen hier in Frankfurt und andernorts unseren Neubau als Bereicherung der Frankfurter Skyline und der europäischen Landschaft ansehen. Wir in der EZB freuen uns, Sie und alle Besucher aus Frankfurt, Europa und der übrigen Welt 2014 in unserem neuen Gebäude willkommen heißen zu dürfen. I hope that our new premises will be viewed by the people of Frankfurt, and beyond, as an enrichment of Frankfurt’s skyline and the landscape of Europe. We at the ECB look forward to welcoming all of you and all our visitors from Frankfurt, Europe and the world to our new home in 2014. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Singapore’s dynamically changing landscape Speech by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the opening of One Raffles Place Tower Two, Singapore, 18 September 2012. *      *      * Wee Ee Cheong, Chairman, OUB Centre Limited,  Mr Henry Kok, General Manager, OUB Centre Limited,  Distinguished guests,  Good evening. It is my pleasure to be invited to officiate the opening of a new twin skyscraper in Raffles Place – One Raffles Place Tower Two. It is part of the continuing rejuvenation of the cityscape at Raffles Place, which continues to be at the heart of businesses and commerce in Singapore.  Raffles Place – a continuing history of new blended in old  Raffles Place has indeed been a continuous story of the new inserted in the old, as it emerged from being a humble docking location for small boats and ships in the early 1800s, to become a thriving centre of regional commerce and now a global business and financial centre.  On 8th August 1988, OUB Centre, now called One Raffles Place Tower One, was opened by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who was then Prime Minister. He had noted the building’s quality design and distinctive workmanship. It was also an icon for Singapore at the time, as the building went on to be recognised as the tallest building in the world outside of the United States. Designed by Kenzo Tange, One Raffles Tower One still remains amongst the tallest three skyscrapers in Singapore.  This evening, One Raffles Place continues this evolution with the addition of a second tower. How interesting too, that the new tower is designed by Mr Paul Noritaka Tange, son of the architect for the original Tower One.  I am told that One Raffles Place Tower Two has two distinctive features which differentiate it from its predecessor.  First, One Raffles Place Tower Two is a certified BCA Green Mark Platinum Development. Some of the building’s environmentally-friendly features include solar cells and tools to harvest rainwater. With these sustainable features, the new tower will achieve an overall energy savings of 32% each year. I applaud OUB Centre on this effort.  Second, One Raffles Place Tower Two will not only provide an additional 360,000 square feet of grade A premium office space but has floor plates which are column-free. They grant offices the flexibility to apportion their office space efficiently.  Singapore – charting history as a global financial centre  While the outlook for US and European economies continues to be uncertain, Asia continues to offer growth opportunities.  Asian banks, which are moderately leveraged, largely deposit-funded and generally conservative in lending, have in recent times, stepped-up their financing activities. As traditional European lenders continue to deleverage, there are opportunities in corporate funding, trade finance and infrastructure finance which Asian banks are well placed to take hold of.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Asia has also seen rising affluence amongst its population and increased interest from international investors as an investment destination. This has presented greater investor demand, paving the way for the growth of Asia’s capital markets and asset management sectors. These developments will help drive a new chapter in Asian finance.  We will continue to ensure that we have adequate supply of premium infrastructure to support the sustained growth of the business financial centre here.  Our office rental rates in Singapore remain competitive. Based on CBRE’s Q1 2012 Singapore Market View, the average monthly rental for Grade A office space dipped by 4.7% quarter-on-quarter to $10.10 per square feet (compared to the 3.6 % fall in Q1 2012). (This is well priced compared to premium office space in Hong Kong and Tokyo, at about 50% and 70% of their costs, respectively. Occupancy rates for Core CBD in Singapore remain healthy at about 92% (in Q2 2012).  The increase in premium office space at competitive rental rates bodes well for Singapore, and will strengthen our role as a competitive business hub in Asia and globally.  Conclusion  I congratulate all those who have played a role in making this new development possible. I am optimistic that the two towers of One Raffles Place will remain as one of the most recognised business addresses in the historic Raffles Place and will continue to contribute to Singapore’s success story.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Internationalisation of Islamic finance – bridging economies Welcoming address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Global Islamic Finance Forum 2012, Kuala Lumpur, 19 September 2012. *      *      * This is a decade of profound change in the global financial landscape. The world is also being confronted by the repercussions of the ongoing global financial crisis. Despite this more challenging global financial and economic environment, Islamic finance has continued to remain on its growth trajectory. For Islamic finance, it has been a defining period. Its rapid growth and the intensification of its internationalisation in this decade is now enhancing its role in strengthening international economic linkages between different parts of the world. It is my great pleasure and honour to welcome you this morning to this third Global Islamic Finance Forum (GIFF) 2012. First of all, let me express our gratitude to the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, His Excellency Mr. Ali Babacan for accepting our invitation to deliver the Public Lecture at our gathering here today. We are most honoured by your presence and we immensely look forward to your address. Islamic finance: fostering global linkages In this new era, in which the international dimension of Islamic finance has gained significance, Islamic finance has continued to demonstrate its viability and competitiveness in this more liberalised and globalised financial environment. The total Islamic financial assets size now has surpassed US$1 trillion – following unabated growth from the mid-1990s. There are now more than 600 Islamic financial institutions operating in more than 75 countries. Increasingly, existing Islamic banking institutions are expanding their operations with presence in new jurisdictions. This is resulting in increased cross border financial flows. There has also been increased international participation in Islamic financial markets. Since the late 1990s the Sukuk market has emerged as an important form of intermediation in Islamic finance. It has been instrumental in the financing structures for infrastructure projects, investments in the utilities sectors, in particular for water and power projects, and in the services sector, in education, healthcare and transportation. Islamic finance essentially offers clear value propositions to both global issuers and investors. For issuers, there is access to new sources of funds and liquidity. And in introducing a new asset class, investors gain from portfolio diversification and new investment opportunities that are aligned to productive investment activities. Internationalisation of Islamic finance: mutually-reinforcing benefits Islamic finance draws its strength from serving the real economy. An important feature of Islamic finance is that it involves financial transactions that must be accompanied by an underlying economic transaction. And when it is cross border, it will facilitate financial flows that will support international trade and investment flows. It will contribute towards bridging economies and enhancing our economic connectivity with each other. In this current global environment in which emerging economies are demonstrating their resilience with the ability to sustain growth despite the moderation in global expansion, there is tremendous prospects for mutually reinforcing growth from increased economic connectivity. Trade among the expanding emerging economies now account for more than half of the world trade. This growing demand in emerging economies is also generating investment opportunities. In this environment, Islamic finance has an important potential to facilitate trade and investment flows that will be mutually reinforcing. In evolving Malaysia as 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  an Islamic financial hub, our aspiration is to be a hub that is linked to a network of other financial hubs. In so doing, it will enhance our economic linkages with other parts of the world. The increased internationalisation of Islamic finance would thus influence the patterns of global financial and economic integration, and in particular facilitate the revival of financial and economic integration between the countries along the old silk road from Asia to Turkey and the Middle East, and Africa and to the more established financial markets and developed economies. The start of this decade has already witnessed the shifting of trade activities to the emerging economies, which now account for 63 percent or US$37 trillion of world trade as at end-2011, an increase of 17 percent from a decade ago. While the Islamic banking sector has been important in intermediating cross border financial flows, the sukuk market has become an important segment of Islamic finance that offers a distinct platform upon which international inter-linkages are fostered. The sukuk market has demonstrated its ability to effectively intermediate funds across borders, contributing towards the efficient allocation of funds in the global financial system. The sukuk epitomises a truly global product for international fund raising and investment activities. An increasing number of multilateral agencies, sovereigns, Government agencies and corporations, including multinational corporations have relied on the sukuk market as a source of financing. And the diverse composition of the sukuk investors across continents has added further depth to the international dimension of the sukuk market. In Malaysia, the sukuk market has evolved into a multi-currency denominated sukuk market with pioneering sukuk issuances in U.S dollars, Singapore dollar and the Renminbi. Internationalisation of Islamic finance: key success factors The new horizon that is emerging is the rapid internationalisation in Islamic finance which needs to be strongly underpinned by three key factors to ensure its sustainability. Firstly, the wide range of global supply of high-quality Islamic financial products and services that are able to meet the requirements of international businesses. In this phase of growing international transactions, Islamic finance needs to be dynamic and innovative, with an emphasis on the development of diversified and comprehensive Shariah-compliant financial solutions to meet the differentiated needs of various businesses, including the requirements of international businesses and thus facilitate cross-border investments. Secondly, is having diverse and dynamic intermediaries and market participants that have a global focus. This includes having Islamic banking, takaful and capital market players that venture beyond domestic boundaries to tap global opportunities. Global ancillary services that are proficient in the Shariah, also have an important role in providing supportive professional services for such intermediaries and market players to effectively embark on such cross-border activities. In addition, having the required talent is another imperative in steering the Islamic financial sector towards increased internationalisation. The new financial landscape will require world-class business talent and boards with knowledge of the risks associated with internationalisation. Greater collaboration between the industry and education service providers will be important in supporting the talent requirements of the industry in its new phase of development. Today, we will witness the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between an industry player and an academic institution for the establishment of an Islamic wealth management research centre. This commendable effort is dedicated to producing applied research in the area of Islamic wealth management. It is envisaged to spur innovation that will bring with it global benefits and that would also contribute towards setting industry standards in this key component of the Islamic financial industry. Thirdly, effective linkages and connections between global financial markets will be facilitated by business enablers, particularly in the area of legislation, taxation and regulation. The new global landscape of growing cross-border financial flows between regions that have national 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and cultural differences also underscores the need for enhanced recognition and understanding of practices in the different jurisdictions. This imperative translates into high demands on the use of standardised documents and agreements among financial market players, so as to increase market efficiency, transparency and uniformity, as well as to reduce the cost of transactions as we strive towards seamless global inter-linkages. Standardised documentation and practices for a number of products have already been adopted between jurisdictions through bilateral and multilateral agreements. This has facilitated issuance of financial market instruments, contributing towards enhanced liquidity in Islamic financial markets and greater inter-market linkages. Greater understanding and clarity on Shariah matters, will also contribute towards convergence and harmonisation of such interpretations across jurisdictions and thus contribute towards the development of Islamic financial products and services. Realising cross-border potentials and bridging economies With its international outreach and ability to provide comprehensive financial solutions, Islamic finance beckons us with a new frontier that presents new opportunities. As we enter into a more uncertain global environment, it also promptsus to revisit strategies to enhance the resilience of Islamic finance. The theme of this year’s Global Islamic Finance Forum 2012, “Internationalisation of Islamic Finance: Bridging Economies” focuses on the international prospects surrounding the Islamic finance industry and its tremendous potential role in strengthening cross-border economic linkages. More than 500 participants from over 50 countries across the continents gather today in this Forum to explore this prospect. In its featured plenary and multi-track programmes which include the Regulators Forum, the International Shariah Scholars Forum, the Global Islamic Liquidity Management Conference and the Global Islamic Finance Taxation Forum, a new highlight is the Bridging Economies Forum that aims to discuss the Islamic finance prospects and opportunities across regions, and to explore possible market linkages that can be generated through Islamic finance. Several important signings of MoUs will also be taking place during this Forum, highlighting increased commitment and international cooperation. Let me now conclude with an extension of our appreciation to the panel of distinguished speakers for their contribution to GIFF 2012. I would also like to once again, express our gratitude to the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, His Excellency Mr. Ali Babacan for being with us today to speak at this event. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Tukiya Kankasa-Mabula: Bank of Zambia’s key policy initiatives Speech by Dr Tukiya Kankasa-Mabula, Deputy Governor (Administration) of the Bank of Zambia, at the Bankers Association of Zambia Bankers Annual Ball, Lusaka, 14 September 2012. *      *      * • The Chairperson, Bankers Association of Zambia, Mr Friday Ndhlovu,  • Managing Directors and Chief Executive Officers of Member Banks,  • Managing Directors and Chief Executive Officers of Various Institutions & Associations,  • Management and Staff of Member Banks,  • Distinguished Invited Guests,  • Members of the Press,  • Ladies and Gentlemen.  Good evening,  Before I deliver my speech this evening, I would like us to observe a minute of silence in honour of the Late Mrs Margaret Ndhlovu, wife of Mr Friday Ndhlovu who passed on late last month. As the saying goes, behind every successful man, there is a woman. Our prayers and thoughts go out to the Ndhlovu family as they come to terms with the loss.  Distinguished invited guests, it is my honour and privilege to officiate at this year’s Bankers Annual Ball for the Bankers Association of Zambia. It is also my pleasure to warmly welcome Mr Friday Ndhlovu, the Managing Director of Investrust Bank Plc and the In-coming Chairperson of the Association who is taking over from Ms Charity Lumpa who will be assuming a new role within the Ecobank Group in Lome, Togo. Join me in wishing Mr Ndhlovu well in his new role and I have every confidence that he will perform to distinction. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Ms Lumpa for her able stewardship of the Association and wish her well in her new appointment. I have every confidence that she will excel. Ladies and gentlemen, the banking industry plays an important role in any economy, particularly the role of intermediating funds between savers and borrowers. It also plays an equally important role in providing payment system platform where economic agents can settle their transactions. You will also note that the performance of these functions also attracts numerous risks which have potential to compromise the stability and the efficient operations of the banking industry. The regulatory environment therefore requires adjusting appropriately in response to developments in the financial system. Chairperson, you will note that the Bank of Zambia has, in the most recent past, introduced a number of measures aimed at enhancing stability of the banking industry in Zambia as well as to enhance the transparency and efficiency in the allocation of resource in the economy. Allow me to briefly highlight some of the key policy initiatives that the Bank of Zambia has recently introduced:  1) Reduction of statutory reserve ratios: in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Bank of Zambia reduced both the statutory and core liquid asset ratios by 3 percentage points to 5.0% and 6.0% respectively. The policy measure was intended to loosen liquidity for commercial banks to enable them increase their lending to productive 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  sectors of the economy. The measure was also aimed at influencing the pricing of the loans especially in light of high lending rates prevailing in the economy; 2)  Increase in capital: a robust banking industry is indispensable for supporting investments in the economy. A lower capital base entails limited participation in the financing of investments in addition to increased vulnerability of the banking industry. From the last quarter of 2011, the banking sector saw significant regulatory reform as the capital thresholds for banks were increased. Local owned banks are now required to have a capital base of K104 billion whilst foreign owned banks are required to have a minimum capital base of K520 billion. The revised thresholds are aimed at ensuring that we have the best possible environment in which banks can carry out these key functions. As I stated earlier, banks are specialised institutions and they are fundamental to the working of the economy and linked to all parts of the financial system. But the consequence is that if banks fail, the external effects can have an adverse impact on the financial system and the economy. That is why banks are required to maintain a certain level of minimum capital. In this regard, the central bank provides oversight through prudential supervision.  Therefore, the measures to revise the capital adequacy framework for Zambia enhances the resilience of the sector to both internal and external shocks by improving the quality and quantity of the capital available for commercial banks;  3)  Introduction of the policy rate: the policy rate was introduced in order to provide a benchmark rate for the banking industry on which pricing for lending products can be based. It also promotes transparency in the price discovery mechanisms in the banking sector while minimizing information asymmetry particularly that associated with the credit markets;  4)  Statutory Instrument No. 33 on Bank of Zambia currency regulations: This measure was introduced with a view to reinforcing the use of the Zambian Kwacha as the legal tender in the Republic of Zambia. The increased use of foreign currency cash in our economy has implications for the effectiveness of the conduct of monetary policy given that foreign currency cash is outside the control of the central bank; and  5)  Currency rebasing: Since 2006, (except in 2008 when there were challenges arising from the global financial crisis) Zambia has enjoyed positive economic variables. For instance, overall inflation has been single digit and the country has continued to record favourable balance of payments surplus. During the recent past, inflation has declined to single digit levels such that in December 2011 it closed at 7.2%. This low level of inflation, coupled with favorable macroeconomic conditions, provided an opportune time to rebase the Zambian currency. Given the improved economic performance, it has become necessary to re-align and configure our currency in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The currency rebasing exercise will have implications on businesses in the economy including changes to accounting software, tax aspects, ATMs, cash registers, etc. The success of the currency rebasing exercise will largely depend on our partnership with the commercial banks.  Ladies and gentlemen, as you will note all these measures are aimed at improving efficiency conduct of business in our economy and commercial banks have a very crucial role to play in all these. The expectation is that all of you represented here will support the central bank to ensure that collectively, we build a financial sector that is modern and responsive to the needs of our economy.  Chairperson, as a central bank, we will continue to foster an environment where dialogue between all key stakeholders can be promoted both at individual bank level as well as at Industry level. Despite the policy changes embarked on, there remains a lot to be done in the areas of financial inclusion, financial education and consumer protection in the banking 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  industry. In this regard, the Bank of Zambia has developed branchless banking frameworks and a national strategy for financial education in partnership with other stakeholders. As a regulator, we are committed to ensure an open and competitive banking environment. This is, in my view, the best way to allow banks to play their full role in the economy and ensure a fair deal for businesses and consumers.  Recently, we have signed an MOU with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission aimed at enhancing the competition arrangements in the banking sector. We hope to strengthen capacity to tackle anti-competitive behaviour in the sector.  I would therefore, like to encourage you to start viewing these areas as an intricate part of your overall business strategies in order to enable us as an industry to consolidate the gains so far achieved.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me acknowledge the commitments that the Bankers Association has made in the revised Code of Banking Practice relating to the provision of “No Frills Account” to certain segments of our population. As the central bank we will be interested to receive information on how you are performing in this important area for financial inclusion. On our part, we have issued a “Practice Note” to assist commercial banks overcome some of the Know Your Customer challenges faced with when dealing with some segments of our society.  Chairperson, let me conclude by reiterating the important role that a healthy and stable financial system plays in an economy. This objective cannot be achieved by the Bank of Zambia alone but through collective efforts including the Government and yourselves. My expectations are that although the role of Chairperson has changed, the Association will remain true and steadfast to its values and objectives. We look forward to continuing working with the Association on many issues that still require attention and on-going dialogue.  I Thank You. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  William C Dudley: Regional and national economic conditions Remarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chairman of the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), before the Morris County Chamber of Commerce, Florham Park, New Jersey, 18 September 2012. *      *      * Good afternoon, I am pleased to be in northern New Jersey to address the 8th Morris County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC) Business Growth Forum – an annual event organized by the Morris County Chamber of Commerce. It is always a pleasure to speak with the business community and I thank you for inviting me here today. I get out of my office in New York City regularly to inform myself – first-hand – about economic conditions and challenges across the second Federal Reserve District. Each visit within the region helps me to strengthen relationships with the diverse people of this District and build a deeper understanding of the economic challenges that we face. Today, I want to talk a bit about the Fed – what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the national and local economic outlook. Normally in these regional outreach speeches I say little about monetary policy. But since the Federal Reserve made some meaningful decisions last week and it is important for people to understand the reasons and motivations for our actions. I will conclude with a brief discussion of policy. After that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC. What the new York Fed does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed. The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank. The Federal Reserve is independent within government. By law, we are charged with managing the nation’s monetary policy – taking actions that raise or lower interest rates to promote full employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is also charged with promoting financial stability, without which we cannot achieve our economic objectives. We play an important role in the nation’s payments and settlements system, which you might think of as the plumbing of the financial system. And we have a specific mandate to promote economic development in each of our regions. As president of the New York Fed, I serve as the vice chair of the FOMC, the Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to achieve our statutory mandate. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choices at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions – particularly during difficult economic circumstances such as we face today. In fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don’t all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability and in our belief that preserving the independence of the Federal Reserve in making monetary policy decisions is very much in the public interest. That independence allows us to make tough decisions based on data and analysis insulated from short-term political pressures. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  At FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and for the nation. In formulating these assessments, we consult with many sources – our boards of directors, regional advisory councils, community leaders and other key stakeholders. My meeting with you and others today is part of this systematic effort to understand what is going on in the grassroots of our economy. To help me gather more information about our region, I met this morning with Fox Valve, a small business in Dover that manufactures specialized, highly engineered industrial parts. After that, I had the pleasure of participating in a roundtable discussion with members of the local Mexican-American business community. After this lunch, I will travel to Picatinny Arsenal to learn about its role in the state’s economic activity. I’ll also meet with the leaders of New Jersey Community Capital to learn about their cutting-edge programs for helping distressed homeowners and then I’ll speak to the students, faculty and alumni at Montclair State University. In addition, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces indices of economic activity for New York City, New York State and New Jersey. We also track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way. We also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the region. In our latest poll of several hundred firms, many report that they did not apply for credit because they were “discouraged.” Perhaps surprisingly, many of these non-applicants have credit profiles similar to other firms who successfully sought credit. This finding suggests that the demand for credit could pick up as some “discouraged” firms learn that they might be able to obtain credit now. If you, as a representative of a small business, would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent. To promote economic development in our local communities, we publish a lot of data and analysis on the local economy, including our small business poll findings. In addition we provide education outreach initiatives to help small businesses. For example, in October, we will host a workshop in Newark to help local businesses learn about export credit facilities and new tools for marketing. At the same time, we will launch our annual financial awareness video competition aimed at helping young adults make sound personal financial decisions. As you know, even states as wealthy as New Jersey have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. This work is informed by analysis that suggests that high levels of foreclosures affect the value of neighboring homes, the local tax base and economic vitality more broadly. We have provided housing counselors and community development groups with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters – including an interactive tool on our website that shows monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions at the local level. This fall we will host a conference on distressed residential real estate to share what we and leading experts have learned with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the United States. All in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy. Regional economic conditions So how is our region doing? Let me start by saying that New Jersey is well-positioned to prosper. New Jersey is the 11th largest state – with a population of 8.8 million and this population is well-educated. Roughly 35 percent of adults over 24 years old have a college degree, well over the national average. Here in Morris County, that figure is almost 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  50 percent. The state is also quite ethnically diverse: roughly 20 percent of New Jersey residents were born abroad. The state’s economy is industrially diverse, resembling the nation. New Jersey employs many people in healthcare, professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and leisure and hospitality. In the northern part of the state, we see a disproportionate share of jobs in a few industries: finance, particularly in Hudson County; goods distribution, related to the ports, rail lines and trucking and warehousing activities that are prominent here; pharmaceuticals manufacturing and R&D; and private education. The area obviously benefits from its important links to New York City. In particular, many residents of this area, including myself, commute each day to the city. So how is the recovery proceeding here? Based on the New York Fed’s indices, economic activity in the state did not begin to recover until November 2010, more than a year after the nation and New York City. Since then, activity has recovered at a moderate pace, although we are still operating below our previous peak. Employment in New Jersey declined substantially during the downturn. Our employers cut about 250,000 jobs. This represents a 6 percent loss – roughly on par with the loss nationwide. Less than one in four of those jobs have been recovered to date, slightly weaker than the nationwide recovery and, of course, much weaker than I would like to see. Over the past year, the private sector has seen moderate job gains led by some of the key sectors I mentioned earlier, particularly professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality. But the state continues to shed jobs in manufacturing and there has been little recovery in construction. State and local government cut back employment substantially during 2010, though there has been a modest pick up over the past year. Unemployment among New Jersey residents remains high. July’s reading of 9.8 percent puts the state’s rate well above the U.S. average. More broadly, how are the state’s families faring financially? While the median household income among New Jersey families is the second highest in the nation – at about $69,400 – roughly a tenth of residents live in families with incomes below the poverty line. Although this rate is below the national rate of 14 percent, it varies considerably by county across the state, and is particularly high in Essex, Hudson and Passaic counties. Reducing poverty is a major challenge for policymakers. The New York Fed’s measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here. As of the second quarter of 2012, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person in New Jersey was about $63,000, roughly unchanged over the past several years. Delinquency rates on that debt are high: 8.4 percent of all debt in the state is seriously delinquent, up from 7.4 percent in 2011 and above the national rate of 6.7 percent. So, many New Jersey households are still struggling with their finances. Although there are some recent signs that home prices in the state are starting to firm, nevertheless, the housing crisis continues to take a toll on our homeowners. As of June, 9.3 percent of all mortgage debt in New Jersey was 90-plus days delinquent, three percentage points above the national rate. And that delinquency rate is actually a little higher here in northern New Jersey. National economic conditions The performance of the U.S. economy since the end of the recession in 2009 has been disappointing. Real GDP has grown at an annual rate of just over 2 percent over this period, and it was even slower in the first half of 2012. As a result, employment gains have been modest, unemployment remains above 8 percent – an unacceptably high level – and participation in the jobs market remains depressed. Moreover, about 5 million workers have been unemployed for six months or more. This is important because long-term 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unemployment can cause job skills to atrophy making it more difficult for such people to find jobs in the future. While the good news is that the job-finding rates of the long-term unemployed have not yet deteriorated as many feared, we ought not to take this for granted going forward. Although energy prices have begun to rise again, total inflation, as measured by year-over-year changes of the Consumer Price Index, is still around 1¾ percent – less than half the rate in September of 2011. In recent months, core inflation has also slowed and it is now also under 2 percent. Higher energy and grain prices mean that headline inflation will likely edge somewhat higher for a few months before moving slightly lower again. But measures of the underlying rate of inflation are moderate, wage gains remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations are fully consistent with our longer run inflation objective of 2 per cent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. Near term, the economic outlook is that the growth pace is likely to remain disappointing. On the positive side, motor vehicle sales in August increased solidly. Nevertheless, retail sales outside of autos and gasoline were soft in August as households continue to be cautious. One brighter spot has been the housing market. Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have stabilized and begun to rise modestly after falling roughly 30 percent from their 2006 peak. Housing market conditions still vary significantly across the country with the worst performing counties experiencing annual house price declines of 8 percent or more. This sector is just getting back on its feet, so that even strong gains in the residential investment sector from its current tiny base will provide only a modest contribution to overall GDP growth. In addition, homeowner net worth remains much below its pre-crisis level. The near-term outlook for the business sector is particularly worrisome right now. New orders for nondefense capital goods and information on business plans for spending on new structures both suggest weakness in business fixed investment. Also, many indicators point to sluggish manufacturing activity, including the ISM manufacturing composite index, several regional manufacturing surveys, and August industrial production. Our own Empire State Manufacturing Survey fell deeper into negative territory in September. This manufacturing slowdown stems from several factors, including the slowdown in the pace of growth abroad and uncertainties about how the fiscal cliff in Washington will be resolved. So why has the economy grown so slowly since the official end of the “Great Recession?” There are many reasons, but I would cite five factors as particularly important: • Access to credit. Although credit availability is slowly improving, it remains impaired, especially for households with less-than-sterling credit histories and for some small businesses.  • Balance sheet repair. Although substantial progress has been made, many households still need to rebuild their net worth following the housing bust. More than 20 percent of homeowners with a mortgage are “underwater” – meaning they owe more on their home than it can be sold for.  • Fiscal drag. State and local governments have been cutting spending for over two and half years and federal government spending is also contracting. While fiscal consolidation is essential over the medium to long term, spending cuts reduce demand and are a drag on near-term growth.  • Risks relating to Europe. The crisis in the euro area has reduced the demand for U.S. exports and weighed on financial markets.  • Fiscal uncertainty at home. Families and firms face elevated uncertainty relating to future taxes and government spending, in particular from the so-called “fiscal cliff” – 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  the prospect of sharp increases in taxes and cuts in spending at the start of 2013 if Congress and the White House cannot agree on an alternative fiscal plan.  Given the signs of improvement in some of these areas, including the slow but steady progress in healing balance sheets and restoring the supply of credit, I anticipate that the pace of economic growth will gradually pick up, supported by very low interest rates. But heading into the FOMC meeting last week, I judged that, if we did not ease monetary policy further, the pace of improvement would be unacceptably slow. Monetary policy Last week the FOMC took additional action to promote a more robust recovery in a context of price stability. In order to ease policy, the FOMC deployed two complementary tools: asset purchases and forward guidance on interest rates. With respect to asset purchases, the Committee said it would start buying additional mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $40 billion a month. In terms of rate guidance, the Committee said it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate would likely be warranted “at least through mid-2015.” As Chairman Bernanke explained in the press conference that followed the meeting, the Committee also took two steps to underscore its commitment to ongoing support for the recovery. First, the Committee said that if it did not see substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, it will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional asset purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until it does. Second, the Committee emphasized that it expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. As usual, the Committee will publish minutes of the meeting three weeks after it took place. In the interim, however, I thought it might be useful to provide my own perspective on these actions. In my view, the decision to ease policy further is fully consistent with our dual mandate and policy framework. As I mentioned earlier, we have two goals – to promote maximum employment and price stability. We therefore seek to minimize how far employment is from its long run normal level and inflation is from our longer-run goal of 2 percent on the PCE measure. Because monetary policy works with a time lag, we base policy not just on where the economy is today but where we expect it to be in the future. To do this, we make economic forecasts, based on data and insights from a broad range of economic models. We also take into account the balance of risks around our base case outlook. Looking ahead, in the absence of further monetary easing, I concluded that growth would remain too subdued over the next several years to make big inroads into the spare capacity that remains from the Great Recession. As a result, unemployment would remain unacceptably high, with economic risks skewed to the downside. Meanwhile, with substantial slack in labor markets and inflation expectations stable, inflation was likely to remain a bit below our 2 per cent longer-run objective. In this situation, I concluded that our policy framework means that further monetary policy easing was appropriate provided that the benefits of using the tools available outweighed the costs. In my judgment, this standard has been satisfied here. I am confident that the costs are manageable, based in part on the experience we have of using the tools these past four years and that the benefits substantially exceed the costs, recognizing, of course, that our actions are not so powerful that they will instantly transform the economic outlook. So how do our actions support economic activity? Buying assets and extending interest rate guidance puts downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, so they are lower than they would otherwise be for any given economic outlook. This supports the price of assets such as equities and homes. Buying mortgage-backed securities has the additional effect of 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  narrowing the interest rate spread between these assets and Treasuries, which further reduces mortgage rates. Moreover, to the extent that our actions are seen as supporting the recovery and providing some insurance against adverse shocks, confidence in the medium-term economic outlook should also increase, making businesses and households more willing to invest, hire and spend. If we are successful, long-term Treasury yields could actually rise as confidence in a sustainable recovery increases. At the same time, the expected returns on private assets should rise and risk premia decline. This matters because such shifts would provide support to the economic recovery. Now it is true that some of the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy may be partially impaired at the moment. For example, because of ongoing restrictions in the supply of mortgage credit to customers with less than perfect credit records, the impact of lower mortgage rates on housing is probably less powerful than normal. While this restraint should slowly ease as house prices stabilize, the difficulties of households with lower credit scores in obtaining mortgage credit warrants ongoing attention. However, it is also worth noting other channels through which monetary policy affects economic activity are not impaired, including the impact on spending that is generated by rising wealth, declining risk premia and improving confidence. It is important to recognize that our tools are not all-powerful – monetary policy is not a panacea for all that ails our economy. But, at the margin, firms facing lower borrowing costs for any given economic outlook will invest and hire more. People who refinance at lower rates, or see the value of their homes and 401K pension plans go up, will spend more. I believe that a nudge in the right direction will move us closer to a self-reinforcing cycle of more hiring, more spending, more growth, and more investment. This is the type of virtuous cycle that we should seek and one that is consistent with a self-sustaining and improving economy. I believe our latest statement provides greater clarity about how we intend to use the tools we have to promote our statutory objectives. As Chairman Bernanke said at his press conference, the idea is to make it “more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more obvious that the Fed will do what’s needed to provide the support for the economy.” In particular, the amount of asset purchases that we undertake will be a function of how the economy evolves. If the economy is weaker, we’ll do more. If the economy is stronger, and we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market sooner, we’ll end up doing less. From my perspective, linking our purchases more closely to economic outcomes underlines our determination to generate the kind of recovery that will deliver more rapid progress toward maximum employment in the context of price stability. So what does “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” mean to me? Note that I will be focusing on the outlook, not just the current state of labor market conditions. In that context, it wouldn’t be enough for me just to see the unemployment rate decline a bit. It would also matter why the unemployment rate is declining and whether that improvement is likely to be sustained in the future. For example, higher payroll growth that was not supported by stronger economic growth, or falling unemployment rates that were due mainly to declining participation in the labor market, would not likely meet my test. Therefore, to gauge how substantial the improvement in the outlook for the labor market is, I will be looking at a range of indicators, including the unemployment rate, payrolls, the participation rate, the employment to population ratio and job finding rates, as well as the growth momentum within the economy. As we approach year-end, the maturity extension program in which we are increasing our holdings of long-dated Treasuries will be coming to an end. I’ll be taking stock on how we are doing with respect to our employment and inflation goals and whether it will be appropriate to continue purchasing longer-dated Treasuries when that program concludes. I think that this will depend on whether we have seen a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  in the interim and any further evidence about the costs and benefits of continuing such purchases. In terms of our monetary policy regime, the FOMC statement noted that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy “for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.” This is important because in situations such as the one we find ourselves in today, when monetary policy is somewhat constrained because we cannot lower the federal funds rate below zero, one of the most powerful things a central bank can do is to provide guidance as to how it will behave in the future. In this respect, I am pleased that we have drawn a sharper distinction between what we expect the economy to look like in a few years time and how we expect to set policy based on that outlook. In particular, when the Committee extended the period for which it anticipates keeping the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels – which I interpret to mean the current range of zero to 25 basis points – to “at least through mid-2015,” I don’t think this was due to greater pessimism about the economic outlook. In fact, when you look at the September Summary of Economic Projections of the Committee members – the medium-term growth outlook was upgraded a bit relative to prior July projections. In my judgment, combining the statement and our projections, the proper inference is that we were acting to secure a better outcome – more rapid progress toward full employment and price stability. Conclusion To sum up, too many people remain without the jobs that they need to help support their families and themselves, and while the economic expansion is continuing, we aren’t yet growing fast enough to put back to work many of the idle workers and business facilities that represent the productive potential of our economy. Meanwhile analysis of the inflation outlook suggests that price increases are likely to be close to our 2 per cent longer run objective over the coming years. Not all of the factors that are holding back growth are directly amenable to monetary policy. Our nation’s economic challenges cannot be solved and our economic fortunes restored by the Federal Reserve alone. Others – notably the next Congress and White House – will have to step up to the plate. But I am confident that the Fed will promote maximum employment and price stability to the greatest extent our tools permit, and we will stay the course. We are setting policy to achieve a stronger recovery in the context of price stability. When that finally materializes, I’ll view it as consistent with the result we are trying to achieve, and not a reason to pull back our policies prematurely. If you’re trying to get a car moving that is stuck in the mud, you don’t stop pushing the moment the wheels start turning – you keep pushing until the car is rolling and is clearly free. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Guy Debelle: Regulatory reforms and their implications for financial markets, funding costs and monetary policy Address by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Financial Services Institute of Australia, Adelaide, 18 September 2012. *      *      * Matt Boge provided invaluable help in the preparation of this speech. It is a pleasure to speak here today in my home town. Neil Grummitt has spoken about some of the details of the regulatory reform process currently underway in Australia and globally. My aim is to consider some of the broader implications of the reforms. Before doing so, there is an important point to make. The changes we all see the banking and financial system undergoing are not purely the result of regulatory changes. Rather there are a number of forces all pushing in the same direction. Some of the changes we see are self-imposed, as financial institutions look at the lessons learned over recent years and seek to increase their own resiliency to future developments. Some are being imposed by the market in terms of the availability of both the quantity and price of particular channels of financing. Others reflect pressure from rating agencies.  Currently, all of these forces are generally aligned in changing the structure of the financial system in the same direction, although they may vary in terms of degree. In that sense, the impact of regulation may not be as large as it appears on the surface. Rather regulation is, in many cases, serving to reinforce the other forces at work. But the regulatory changes will be more binding when these other forces are no longer all pushing in the same direction. The experience over many years is that some of these forces are certain to wane when the credit cycle is in full upswing. In the good times, self-discipline can falter under the weight of competitive pressures, as can market discipline. Hopefully in those circumstances, the regulatory framework will continue to impart the necessary restraint. Today, I’m going to focus on the Basel III reforms. Other reforms, such as those around central clearing and OTC derivatives are also having a significant impact on the way many of you do business, but I will leave them for another time. The Basel III measures will strengthen the requirements for financial institutions’ liquidity and capital. It is the impact of some of these reforms on financial markets and on funding costs that I would like to address today.  In thinking about this issue, it is important to remember that the intent of the regulatory reforms is to alter the incentives for financial institutions and thereby bring about changes in behaviour. The prices of various financial products will change from their pre-crisis levels. This is not an “unintended consequence” (a phrase which personally I think is overused) but a desired outcome.  So let me give a quick summary of the Basel liquidity reforms. The 40 or so largest deposit-taking intermediaries in Australia will be required to hold high-quality liquid assets in quantities sufficient to withstand a 30-day period of stress. This liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is a much tougher metric than that used in the past, both in terms of the severity and length of the stress period for which sufficient liquid assets need to be available, and in the criteria for what qualifies an asset as liquid.  The test of whether an asset is liquid and of high quality is whether the asset would be able to maintain its value in the private markets during periods of severe stress. The financial crisis revealed that the universe of such assets was a lot smaller than banks (and some of their regulators) had previously assumed. In particular, the liquidity-generating capacity of private sector debt deteriorated significantly during periods of market stress, even where such debt had been highly rated. This was the case for both securitised assets – such as asset-backed commercial paper and residential mortgage-backed securities – as well as 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  unsecured paper. For many of these assets, the only source of liquidity proved to be the central bank. This was true in the Australian market as well as internationally.  In recognition of this, the intent of regulatory reform globally is to require financial institutions to hold more of their liquidity in debt securities issued by sovereigns or other official sector bodies, subject to the requirement that these issuers are themselves highly rated and their securities are liquid. All else equal, this would be expected to widen the spreads between the yields on high-quality sovereign debt and the yields on private debt securities. However, to a large extent, such repricing occurred globally during the financial crisis as the market itself reached the same conclusion as to what constituted a liquid asset. That is, the self-evident lesser liquidity of much private sector debt prompted financial market participants themselves to adjust the liquidity risk premia they required on this debt, quite independently of any direction from regulators.  Within the Australian market, a reassessment of risk and changes in investors’ tolerances for assuming such risk have been important in driving the spreads between Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) and yields on highly rated private debt securities. Since the financial crisis, there has been a considerable widening in these spreads (Graph 1).  Graph 1  It is unlikely that any regulatory initiatives, and certainly not those related to Basel III liquidity requirements, have been behind the strong demand for CGS we have seen in recent years. Indeed, the major source of demand for CGS has come from foreign investors, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds and pension funds attracted by the comparative strength of the Australian economy and the sovereign’s credit standing. Non-resident investors now hold more than three-quarters of outstanding CGS. In contrast, the Australian banks own very few CGS (Graph 2).  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Graph 2  Within the Australian market, the only assets deemed to meet the Basel standard for liquidity are CGS, semi-government securities, cash and exchange settlement balances at the Reserve Bank. As is well known, under any conceivable scenario, the supply of CGS and semis in Australia will be insufficient for ADIs’ liquidity requirements. For this reason, the Reserve Bank has announced it will establish a committed liquidity facility (CLF).1 On the payment of a 15 basis point fee, ADIs will be able to obtain a commitment from the Reserve Bank to provide liquidity against a broad range of assets under repurchase agreement. Eligible assets will include a range of highly rated private debt securities, including an ADI’s self-securitisations. The Bank’s commitments to ADIs to provide liquidity against these assets will be recognised by APRA for the purposes of compliance with the Basel III liquidity standards. Central bank committed liquidity facilities will also be used to meet the Basel standards in certain other jurisdictions with insufficient liquid assets.  As I have said before, this arrangement is, to a large extent, the formalisation of the pre-existing liquidity arrangements in Australia and is very much consistent with the principles of central banking described by Bagehot.  The imposition of the fee ensures that the intent of the Basel standard will be met. By charging ADIs for the liquidity insurance the central bank provides, the appropriate incentive is established for ADIs to manage their liquidity risk. At the same time, the design of the CLF will contain the impact of regulatory-induced demand for liquid assets, in an environment where so few outside assets exist.2  As noted already, CGS yields have fallen well beyond levels that could have been induced by the liquidity regulations. This is evidenced by the fact that banks own so few of them. For banks, the spreads to interbank rates at which many CGS currently trade implies that                                                 1 See RBA (2011), “The RBA Committed Liquidity Facility”, Media Release No 2011-25, 16 November, and Debelle G (2011), “The Committed Liquidity Facility”, Speech to the APRA Basel III Implementation Workshop, Sydney, 23 November. 2 Outside assets are those not issued by the banking system. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  settlement balances at the Reserve Bank would be a higher yielding investment and at least as free of risk. Similarly, the large negative spread to swap is confirmatory evidence of the shortage of CGS relative to the strong demand for the asset.3  Recent trends within the Kangaroo bond market also illustrate that broader market dynamics have had a greater influence on the relative prices of debt securities than prospective regulatory developments.  When APRA was making its initial assessment of what securities would qualify as liquid assets for the Basel III framework, there was concern expressed in some quarters about the consequences for the Kangaroo market if supranational and foreign agency debt were not considered level 1 assets. Seen from the perspective of today, it is apparent that these concerns were overstated. As AAA rated Kangaroo debt will be eligible for the CLF, it is only the payment of the fee, or liquidity premium, that distinguishes these securities from CGS and semis for regulatory purposes. The subsequent repricing of much Kangaroo debt far exceeds the size of the fee. In many cases, this repricing has rather been due to altered perceptions of their creditworthiness by ratings agencies and market participants.  More generally, great store is often placed in terms of whether an asset is eligible for repo with the central bank or not. Reliance on repo eligibility does not strike me as the cornerstone of a resilient issuance program. But in recent months, we have seen a number of non repo-eligible Kangaroo issues come to market, including from some first-time issuers. This indicates that there are other more important elements that determine investor demand than being considered a level 1 asset or repo eligibility. In addition to the issue of which securities can be held as liquid assets, the other dimension to liquidity regulation is how many of these assets need to be held. In this regard, the Basel III liquidity framework makes certain assumptions about the likely calls on liquidity that a bank would experience during a 30-day period of stress.  One assumption, based strongly on the experience of the past five years, is that any liquidity commitments ADIs have made to other financial institutions, including structured investment vehicles and conduits, will be called upon in full during the stress scenario. This has significantly lessened the incentives for structures designed to exploit opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, such as the conduits that issued asset-backed commercial paper. Again, though, the decline of many of these structures can hardly be attributed solely to regulatory change. Their viability was undermined when investors and ratings agencies also came to the view that the quality of such instruments was largely tied to the quality of the supporting institution.  This has also seen a decline in the number of mortgage warehouses, as the providers of the warehouses have significantly increased the price to account for the much greater liquidity risk. Most non ADI mortgage providers don’t really have a balance sheet to warehouse the mortgages on, so we have seen a marked decline in their number and market share over the past five years. In terms of the support that an ADI provides to its internal business units, changes to the regulatory framework will alter how ADIs price liquidity and capital usage across the different components of their businesses. By their nature, these internal prices are rarely transparent to outside observers, but the incentives created by such transfer prices can have significant implications for financial markets. This repricing across all product lines is going on currently and still has some way to run. We have already seen its effect on the pricing of undrawn lines of credit, for example, where the increase in the price resulting from their increased liquidity cost has seen a marked reduction in their prevalence.                                                 3 Heath A and M Manning (2012), “Financial Regulation and Australian Dollar Liquid Assets”, RBA Bulletin, September, pp 43–52. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Another example, observed by the RBA through our market operations, has been the tendency for government bond dealers to fund their positions at rates that exceed the unsecured borrowing rates in the interbank cash market. To the extent that unnecessarily high internal funding rates on these trading desks have fostered such an outcome, the new liquidity regulations may well encourage some revision to these practices.  Calls on a bank’s liquidity will also arise when they are unable to roll over or maintain their existing funding. Assumptions regarding the likelihood of this are based on the regulators’ views about what forms of funding are more stable than others. Going forward, these “run-off” assumptions should be expected to influence the funding strategies adopted by ADIs.  To give one example: the incentive for ADIs to issue short-term debt to other financial institutions will be considerably reduced under Basel III, as funds borrowed with less than 31 days to maturity would need to be invested entirely in liquid assets. Thus there will be a marked decline in the provision of such debt by banks. At the same time, the demand for liquid bank debt from other financial institutions, such as insurance companies and pension funds, is increasing, in part as a result of regulatory developments in those sectors.  So there is a decrease in supply and an increase in demand for liquidity. Normally, in economics, such a situation would result in a change in the price (of liquidity in this case) to clear the market. My concern is that it is not clear that the demand and supply curve for liquidity provided by the regulated financial system will intersect at any reasonable price. How this is resolved is not entirely clear. If it were to push the supply of liquidity outside the regulated system, that would not be a good development. In any case, it is quite probable that new funding instruments will emerge that seek to accommodate the new regulations. In some other jurisdictions, a greater reliance on debt with 31-day notice periods (given the 30-day liquidity stress scenario) has already been observed. Regulators and financial institutions will need to ensure that this does not create a new stress point at 31 days as funding piles up at that maturity. One product where we are yet to see the effect of the new liquidity regulation on pricing is at-call deposits. Relative to other types of deposits, these products are very expensive from a liquidity point of view, but they still offer interest rates that are a large spread above the cash rate. As banks focus on the liquidity costs of such products, I would expect to see these rates decline relative to those on other types of deposits. Indeed, it would be surprising if the repricing doesn’t occur fairly soon given the liquidity regulations take full effect at the beginning of 2015.  However, our liaison with banks suggests that these deposits are particularly sensitive to changes in pricing, so there is a big disadvantage in terms of losing deposits to your competitors if you are the first to reprice for the new regulations. But if an institution has a large reliance on this source of funding, it won’t be able to change that reliance overnight on the 31st December 2014. Just like supertankers, funding structures take a long time to change direction, and that change of course needs to be occurring around now. On the subject of funding, one notable feature of banks’ funding over the past three or four years has been the shift away from short-term debt securities toward deposits, in particular, term deposits (Graph 3). This shift has been a deliberate strategy on the part of the banks and has been brought about by significant changes to their pricing structure. The interest rates offered on term deposits to both retail and wholesale customers are now priced well above the rates at which the banks issue equivalent maturity debt securities, such as certificates of deposit (Graph 4).  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Graph 3  Graph 4  Given the forthcoming liquidity regulations, a shift toward deposits certainly makes sense. The Basel III framework views deposits as a much more stable source of funding, and has lower run-off assumptions for most types of deposits than it does for wholesale debt securities.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  However, as with the relative price of liquid assets, one can’t explain all of the movement in deposit pricing in terms of prospective liquidity regulations. The intensity of the competition and the rates paid on some of these deposits far exceed the implied regulatory incentive.  Why, then, are banks willing to pay such high rates for this type of funding? To a large extent, the impetus has come from an internal reassessment of funding resiliency, the rating agencies and the broader market, where a bank’s ability to attract deposits has received greater attention since the financial crisis. Quite possibly, some of the focus on deposit-to-loan ratios and similar metrics is misplaced. Regardless, while term deposits appear to be a very expensive source of funding, in the current environment, banks presumably believe the alternatives would be even more expensive for their overall cost of funds.  Nevertheless, the effects of changes in funding composition on the total change in funding costs for ADIs in the past five years has been fairly marginal. The increase in the cost of funding for banks and, ultimately, their customers, has been driven considerably more by a fundamental reassessment within financial markets of the risks associated with credit and liquidity exposures.  The regulatory effort towards promoting more stable sources of debt funding and greater capital buffers for financial institutions is driven by a desire to foster financial system stability. As has been noted before, and as is apparent from the intense competition for deposits, changes in this direction have also been pursued by the banks on their own initiative, presumably in the belief that this will lower their overall cost of funding in the market. To the extent that regulations push ADIs to adopt a funding structure that market discipline would not make them otherwise adopt, the difference is likely to be small and the effect on overall funding costs would be smaller still. Moreover, as both APRA and the Reserve Bank have argued, any costs of this magnitude are well worth paying for a more stable financial system.4  As regards the broader macroeconomic impact of the increase in ADIs’ funding costs, it is important to remember that in the setting of monetary policy, the Reserve Bank Board is conscious of the various rates at which credit is being priced. Consequently, where there has been an overall rise in the funding cost structure for intermediaries, the Board is able to set its cash rate target to appropriately take into account the effect on lending rates. In the current environment, there has been ample scope to lower the cash rate sufficiently so as to bring these other rates to where they need to be to achieve the desired stance of monetary policy, be they mortgage rates or business lending rates.  In this regard, it is important to stress that the transmission of monetary policy is still very effective in Australia. Not only do lending rates respond to changes in the Board’s cash rate target, there is no sense in which the aggregate supply of credit appears to have been constrained by the ongoing changes in ADIs’ funding patterns.  Finally, it has been suggested that while the regulations may not have a large impact on the supply of credit in the current environment, banks may have difficulty funding an increased demand for credit. However, I think this concern is misplaced. In an environment where the demand for credit has picked up because the world is a better place, funding conditions for intermediaries are also likely to be much easier. Moreover, from a macro perspective, there is unlikely to be a funding problem for the system as a whole when the world is a happier place, even if an individual institution is not 100 per cent sure where the next funding dollar is coming from.                                                 4  See, for example, Laker J (2012), “Bank Regulation and the Future of Banking”, Remarks to the 41st Australian Conference of Economists, Melbourne, 11 July. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  So, to conclude. There have been a number of significant changes to the structure of financial markets over the past five years, in terms of pricing as well as the composition of funding and lending. Regulatory reforms have certainly played a role in those changes, but one of the main points I hope to leave you with today is that the regulatory reforms have often served to reinforce changes resulting from a self-reassessment or resulting from market pressures. While these forces have all been working in the same direction in the current environment, the regulatory reforms will aim to ensure that these changes to a more stable financial structure endure when the environment is less conducive to self-discipline and as market pressures abate.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Andreas Dombret: The role of the state in the financial system Dinner speech by Dr Andreas Dombret, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the ifo/ CESifo/ Bundesbank Conference, Munich, 14 September 2012. *      *      * Of scientists and drivers Ladies and gentlemen, Please let me welcome you to tonight’s conference dinner. Having discussed complex issues all day, you now really deserve the opportunity to socialise with one another. But before you do so, and before we start enjoying our dinner, please let me tell you a short anecdote: In 1919, the physicist Max Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on the quantum theory. As a consequence, he toured Germany, having to give countless speeches about quantum physics. It is said that he complained about these many talks to his driver. The driver therefore suggested: “By now, I have heard your talk so often that I can give it myself. Why don’t we change places? I’ll pretend to be the physicist and give the talk while you pretend to be the driver.” Next time, the driver gave the talk – and his performance was quite convincing – while Planck sat in the audience. All went well until someone from the audience posed a question. Naturally, the driver was unable to answer it. But instead of admitting this, he replied: “Your question seems ridiculously easy to me. I believe, even my driver can answer your question.” And his “chauffeur” did so. Please, do not misunderstand me: Considering the first-class participants list of this conference and the high quality of the papers selected, I am convinced that the academics at this conference will speak with the authority of people who absolutely know their trade. I have no doubt whatsoever on this score. However, I have to admit that when following the discussion in the media about the European debt crisis it is sometimes hard to separate the “drivers” from the real academics. I get the impression that everyone has an opinion on these topics – and that everyone has stated that opinion at least once. Take, for instance, the discussion about a banking union in Europe. This topic has stirred – quite understandably, I may add – quite some unrest in the German economic community. Petitions were launched, and provocative counter-petitions were issued, in some cases endorsed by some of the exact same academics. This seems striking, given that they were signed by well-respected academics. However, these petitions are perhaps not as incompatible as it might appear. Obviously, one comes to different conclusions if the reasoning is based on different assumptions. And the different assumptions stem from the various interpretations of the results of the European summit in June. The core statements of the petitions about the banking union are not disputed. For me, these core statements are: “There should not be unconditional collective accountability for the debts in the euro area” and “Banking supervision in Europe needs to be harmonised and improved.” And although not everybody may agree with the style and details of the different petitions, most people probably concur with these two main messages. I, for my part, concur with both statements. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Both messages are related to a question which is central in economics – and which is also a topic for our conference: What role should we assign to the state? And what role should markets play? The Role of the state Ten or even five years ago, the opinion in the academic world was relatively unanimous with respect to the role of the state in the banking sector: The state and regulators were seen as an obstacle to economic growth, and state-owned banks were perceived as the flotsam and jetsam of free market economies. “Let the market deal with the issues of the financial sector, and capital and risks will be efficiently allocated,” most academics argued. A saying attributed to the well-respected former Bavarian prime minister Franz-Josef Strauss comes to mind: “A dog is more likely to put away a sausage for a rainy day than the state is to save money.” Then came the financial crisis. The distrust in the state among mainstream academics has remained. However, there is now distrust in markets as well, perhaps surpassing distrust in the state. In the academic community and the media, there has been a debate about excessive bonuses for bankers, about distorted incentives for risk-taking in banks and, last but not least, about the role of rating agencies. To my mind, the crisis has shown that, like it or not, the state is needed as the ultimate guarantor of systemically important functions of the banking sector. In a systemic crisis, deposit insurance schemes can succeed only if the state, and thus the taxpayer, credibly guarantees the liabilities, as illustrated, for example, by the TV appearance by Chancellor Merkel and Finance Minister Steinbrück in 2008, in which they guaranteed all banking deposits in Germany. At that time there were fears of a self-fulfilling run on private deposits – clearly a case of market failure – which were discussed at length in economic literature. So there was a good reason for government to step in. The government also had the power to impose restrictions on the banks’ actions, if necessary. And the unity of liability and control represents an important condition to limit the moral hazard implications of such a guarantee. Another example is the international discussion on large banks. Due to their systemic importance and interconnectedness, no state can afford to let them descend into disorderly default. Therefore, resolution regimes are currently being discussed by international fora, so that, in principle, also large banks can exit the market without causing systemic disruptions. In this respect, i.e. by establishing a clear framework to limit financial stability risks, I believe the state has its role. This is exactly where regulation comes in: An appropriate, internationally harmonised regulation as well as resolution schemes endeavour to ensure that “too-big-to-fail” banks do not abuse their status. There are some parallels between these considerations and the challenges of the debt crisis. Nowadays, views such as: “Markets help to discipline fiscal policies, which is what we urgently need to resolve the crisis” do not seem to be very popular. However, popular or not, what matters is whether or not this statement is true. It may well not be true all the time. However, to me there seems to be more truth in this view than in many so-called “solutions” implying ever-increasing unconditional financial “assistance”. Many of these proposals ignore moral hazard implications and might therefore simply postpone solutions. They might even increase the problems they are meant to tackle in the long run. Financial assistance is necessary to buy time – nothing more and nothing less. It cannot be a long-term solution. Such a long-term solution can only be achieved through fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. As with banks, we cannot ignore or deny the systemic importance of certain countries within the euro area. And in the same manner, it is vital to ensure that politicians cannot use this status to delay necessary steps simply because these steps are unpopular. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  To reach an appropriate assessment, it is also essential to know whether we are currently still in a situation in which markets can successfully exercise their disciplinary powers – or whether we already have moved to a full-blown systemic crisis in which the threat of self-fulfilling downward spirals calls for massive intervention. But even if this were the case – and let me make this very clear – it would be up to democratically elected governments, and not up to central banks, to take the necessary action. Central banks can give advice – but only governments have the authority, conferred by their democratic legitimacy, to make changes to regulatory systems. I am sure that the programme of this conference so far has provided enough material for interesting discussions tonight and for the rest of what will undoubtedly be a fruitful, productive and successful conference tomorrow. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Interview in Süddeutsche Zeitung Interview with Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, in Süddeutsche Zeitung, conducted by Mr Alexander Hagelüken and Mr Markus Zydra on 11 September 2012, published on 14 September 2012. *      *      * SZ: After the decision to buy bonds of troubled euro area countries without any limitations, did fellow Italians congratulate you for opening up the wallets of taxpayers in Germany and other countries? Draghi: No! Actually, the reactions were diverse. In parts of Germany, the echo was negative; in parts of southern Europe, it was not entirely positive either, because of the strict and effective conditionality. The rest of the world complimented us.  SZ: The Secretary General of the conservative CSU has called you a “forger of coins”. Draghi: I trust that he will change his opinion, when he sees the results. There have already been positive results. The announcement of the facility has contributed to raising confidence in the euro area, and in the euro across the world. Fund managers are bringing their money back to Europe. This is good for the euro area economy.  SZ: Are you really optimistic that the euro area debt crisis will be resolved? Draghi: We are certainly on a good path. We see extraordinary progress in reforms in Spain and Italy, particularly if you consider what they have done over the last six months in comparison with what they did not do for many years. The direction of policies in many countries was flawed and needed to be corrected. This process is currently under way. But much still needs to be done. And this is also why adherence to strict and effective conditionality is a prerequisite for the Governing Council to consider outright monetary transactions. SZ: Many Germans fear the risk of a central bank spending money on an unprecedented scale. Draghi: What was the situation? The risk of self-fulfilling prophecies was increasing: rising sovereign bond yields were seen as aggravating the situation, which was driving yields even higher. There was a risk of a vicious circle that warranted central bank action because good economic policies alone may not necessarily be enough for countries to free themselves from what we call a “bad equilibrium”. SZ: To a lot of people, "unlimited bond buying" sounds like unlimited risk that they will have to pay for sooner or later.  Draghi: The obligations that the countries have to meet are the best insurance against risk. The risks are well managed. And, in our assessment, doing nothing poses even greater risks.  SZ: If a country defaults on its bonds, the ECB and thus the tax payers lose a lot of money. Draghi: This is why conditionality is so important. Moreover, the Outright Monetary Transactions will focus only on the shorter term, in particular on bonds with a maturity of one to three years. SZ: But 42% of the German population distrust you as the ECB’s President. Draghi: That is a hindrance for our work. I will have to do more to explain our actions. We will start with this interview. But you always have to weigh the options. SZ: Which are? 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Draghi: Of course, you could say “Nein zu allem”, but that is not constructive. For example, if we had not decided to conduct the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), we would have seen a severe credit crunch across large parts of the euro area. Under such conditions, and I have said this time and again, we would not be able to deliver what everybody expects us to deliver: price stability over the medium term. So, we have to help avoid such conditions. SZ: How serious is your threat? It is hard to believe that you would stop buying bonds and let Spain or Italy plunge into disaster. Draghi: If a given country does not comply with conditionality, the ECB cannot improve the monetary policy transmission in that country. Any attempt to do so in such a situation would be ineffective because it would be offset by the country’s policy failure.  SZ: Why didn’t you make it mandatory that ESM/EFSF first buy bonds on the primary market before the ECB steps in? Draghi: The key for us is strict conditionality and effective monitoring. The possibility of primary market purchases by the EFSF/ESM should be sufficient to ensure that.  SZ: Can the euro area now be saved after the ruling of the German constitutional court on the ESM?  Draghi: The ESM is an important measure in the crisis management toolbox. However, coping with the crisis does not depend only on having a stabilisation mechanism in place; in particular, we need determined actions at the level of individual Member States. And, collectively, Member States have to complete Economic and Monetary Union. We at the ECB will conduct monetary policy independently so as to safeguard price stability.  SZ: You keep saying the euro is irreversible. Mr Draghi, you speak like the Chancellor of Europe. Draghi: I am communicating this message as the President of the ECB to all stakeholders, citizens, businesses and markets. Investors need a long-term vision because they undertake long-term commitments. For them, it is very important that our leaders and governments are determined to keep the euro irreversible. So, if I say this, I am saying what our political leaders are fundamentally saying.  SZ: So you are covering up the failure of politics? Draghi: Again, I am saying it because it is important to do so. Markets should know that the euro is irreversible. That helps them to properly price euro area assets and it helps us in the conduct of our monetary policy.  SZ: Have you ever wanted to become a politician? Draghi (laughs): No. SZ: Why not? Draghi: Because you do the things you like to do. SZ: Before us, you had a visit from the Greek Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras. Greece has not met the deficit limit of 3% of GDP even once. How can such a country stay in the euro area?  Draghi: By changing. The country has to fundamentally change its policies. And this is what everybody is telling them to do.  SZ: But Greece is seeking further help, after all the help it has already received. It is said that Samaras wants a cut on the billions of euro due on the Greek bonds the ECB holds. Draghi: We haven’t discussed this, but – anyway – I’m against it.  SZ: Your new bond purchasing programme reminds us of Italy in the 1970s, when the central bank helped the state out in its financing, which only increased the problems. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Draghi: That was something completely different. It took place decades ago, when the Italian central bank wasn’t independent from the state. In Italy things have changed completely since then. Banca d’Italia has now been independent for decades, and has not financed any government deficit. We have to move away from clichés of the past if we want to address the future!  SZ: The Bundesbank has a different view: Jens Weidmann fears that the ECB’s monetary policy is financing fiscal deficits. Draghi: No, the Governing Council disagreed with that view. What has been decided is a monetary policy measure. There is a fundamental difference between buying on the primary market, which is forbidden because the money would go to the government, and buying on the secondary market where the money does not go to the government but to bond holders. Article 18 of the Statute states that the ECB may “buy and sell […] marketable instruments” as part of its mandate, if necessary to achieve price stability, of course always respecting the Treaty’s Article 123 on the prohibition of monetary financing.  SZ: Where does the German opposition come from? Draghi: It comes from the history of the country and the fear of inflation. But it has to be clear that in the case of EFSF/ESM support, the parliaments of the euro area countries will be involved.  SZ: But the parliaments do not decide on the amounts that the ECB is going to risk …  Draghi: No, because monetary policy has to remain independent, and it is a prerequisite for the Governing Council to consider the specific monetary policy measures.  SZ: Many Germans were against the euro, because they had doubts about the economic policies of countries like Greece or Italy. Now they feel that they were right. Draghi: The euro has delivered price stability to an entire continent. It has removed exchange rate risk, fostered economic cohesion, employment and growth. Germany has benefited greatly from all these accomplishments, as well as from price stability that is greater than in the years before the euro. SZ: The ECB will be getting even more power by supervising the European banking industry. So, will the ECB always bail out ailing banks by printing money? Draghi: No, we have to organise ourselves and keep banking supervision and monetary policy strictly separate. This has been done in many central banks. We are not mixing anything; fundamentally, there will be a Chinese wall. SZ: Chinese walls in regular banks have collapsed. Draghi: Not in central banks.  SZ: How can the ECB do a better job than the German Bafin? Draghi: It is not about doing a better job; it is about making sure that uniform supervisory practices are applied across the whole single currency area. The more detached you are from national government, the more objective you will be in your decision-making. We don’t want to control every small bank directly; we will work together with national supervisors.  SZ: According to the plans, the ECB will have to report on its supervision business to the European Parliament once a year. Is that enough? Draghi: We surely need substantial democratic accountability here, and it is up to the legislators to establish what they consider necessary.  SZ: Do you personally know people who have suffered from the euro crisis? Draghi: I have visited many SMEs whose credit was cut in the crisis and who have gone out of business. And I am not talking about only Italian businesses.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  SZ: How uncomfortable do you feel in the country of the Bundesbank? Draghi: I have often said that the Bundesbank is a great institution, and I respect it very much. It would be great if we could always work together. We have done that many times, but at the moment, we have different opinions on the best way to react to the crisis. We all share the same objective of delivering on price stability, but we are not in full agreement about the best way to achieve that. SZ: And the German people? Draghi: We need to explain what we do better in Germany, which our intentions are and what precautions we are taking.  SZ: You could speak to the Bundestag. Draghi: It would be an opportunity to explain what we do in greater detail. If I am invited, I would be very happy to go there. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Karolina Ekholm: How can financial crises be avoided in Sweden? Speech by Ms Karolina Ekholm, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a meeting at Handelsbanken, Stockholm, 27 September 2012. *      *      * The views expressed in this speech are my own and are not necessarily shared by the other members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank. I would like to thank Jill Billborn, Johanna Fager Wettergren and Per Åsberg-Sommar for their great assistance in the writing of this speech. Four years after the financial crisis broke out, we are still living with its consequences: a sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, sluggish recovery in the United States and United Kingdom, with unemployment entrenched at high levels and a world beyond Europe and the United States that is finding it hard to adjust to the fact that their most important export markets are faltering. The realisation that the costs of financial crises are dreadfully high has led to a general understanding that economic policy must focus much more on preventing such crises. Here in Sweden, we have coped relatively well through the recent turbulent years. But, even here, unemployment remains on a high level – and part of the high Swedish growth rate has merely been a recovery from the great fall in GDP in 2008 and 2009. It is well-known that I have advocated a lower repo rate to push down unemployment faster and to push up an inflation rate that is currently below our target of two per cent. As there is a broad opinion that low interest rates form a risk to financial stability, it may seem as though I am taking the risk of a financial crisis breaking out in Sweden too lightly. But I am not. I share the opinion that economic policy needs to focus on counteracting financial crises. But I do not think that this is primarily a task for monetary policy. On the contrary, it is a task for macroprudential policy, and it is this topical policy area that I will be talking about today. I have previously spoken on how macroprudential supervision could be organised in Sweden, and on how responsibility for the tools in question could be allocated.1 The question of the allocation of responsibility and mandates is also being investigated just now by the Financial Crisis Commission. In my opinion, it is important that there are clear targets and mandates for macroprudential policy in the same way as there are for monetary policy. If this is the case, each policy area can take the other for granted. Macroprudential policy is aimed at counteracting risks in the financial system as a whole, and is a policy area for which many countries are now trying to set the framework.2 Exactly how these frameworks will look is still somewhat unclear, but a few general principles have crystallised as regards both appropriate institutional structures and which instruments it may be appropriate to use.3 Finansinspektionen already has instruments at its disposal that are focused on the health and behaviour of individual participants and companies. But one important lesson of the crisis is that this is not enough. Our toolkit needs to be complemented with tools that can focus on the system as a whole. Today, I will discuss what such a Swedish toolbox for macroprudential supervision could include.                                                 1 The speech “Macroprudential policy and clear communication contribute to financial stability” was held at the Swedish Bankers’ Association on 30 March 2012. See www.riksbank.se. 2 For more detailed analyses of macroprudential policy and its ability to counteract systemic risk, see, for example, Borio (2010), Galati and Moessner (2011) and Viñals (2010 and 2011). 3 See, for example Lim, C., et al., (2011),”Macroprudential Policy: What Instruments and How to Use Them? Lessons from Country Experiences”, IMF Working Paper, 11/238. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Different types of risk… Before I go into the different types of tools that could be used to manage systemic risks, I will explain what is meant by systemic risk. The Riksbank usually defines systemic risk as the risk that a shock will occur in the financial system, leading to substantial costs for society.4 Such risks can arise for various reasons. The crisis and the period before the crisis clearly illustrate the tendencies towards exaggerated cyclical behaviour that often characterise the financial markets. In periods of strong growth, there is usually an increase in demand for loans for corporate investments and property purchases. It also seems to be common for awareness of risks to decrease during such an upturn. Lenders often relax requirements for creditworthiness at the same time as they often take on too much debt themselves. When problems subsequently arise as a result of some borrowers finding it difficult to repay their loans, there can be an overreaction in the other direction, with severe credit tightening as a consequence. But systemic risk is not just a matter of a tendency towards exaggerated cyclical behaviour in credit granting. It is also a matter of how the concentration of risk and the links between different parts of the financial system at any given time affect the risk of a crisis hitting the system as whole. For example, several banks can take the same kind of risk or be dependent on the same funding sources. The high degree of interconnectedness in the financial system – between different institutions and between different markets– increases the risk of contagion when financial problems arise.5 Circumstances that need not constitute a risk on the micro level can thus become risks on the macro level. Not knowing which risks will trigger systemic crises is in the nature of things. Of course, this is because the financial system is constantly changing – new instruments and markets arise and technology develops. And, as the financial system changes, the risk outlook changes too. What at first seems to be uncomplicated and “risk-free” need not be so in reality. This suggests that a broad set of macroprudential supervision instruments is needed to tackle systemic risks. … suggest a broad toolkit for macroprudential supervision So what should we bear in mind when selecting and designing tools for macroprudential supervision? Firstly, we need to be able to counteract different types of systemic risk and, for this, we clearly need different types of tool. The principle used in dealing with problems involving a tendency towards exaggerated cyclical behaviour is to variously make it more expensive and less attractive to allow risks to build up when times are good, at the same time as buffers are created that can be used when times are bad. Problems caused by the financial system’s structure should instead be approached by managing individual institutions’ contributions to total systemic risk, for example by way of specific requirements for capital buffers, strengthened requirements for transparency, or limitations on certain types of activity. Secondly, there is probably a need both for tools with a wide area of effect and for those aimed at a particular sub-market or activity. Countercyclical capital buffers are an example of a tool with a relatively wide area of effect. These are based on the total expansion in credit and cover all banks. I will return to this instrument shortly. However, such broadly-acting tools                                                 4 The Riksbank has defined financial stability as meaning that the financial system can maintain its basic functions while also having resilience to disruptions that threaten these functions. The Riksbank and financial stability (2010). See also Nordh-Berntsson and Molin (2012), “A Swedish framework for macroprudential policy”, Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review 2012:1. 5 Rajan (2005) argues that the element of distorted incentives for managers of financial assets to take serious risks has increased as a result of structural changes to the financial sector, in which the banks’ significance has decreased and the role of other players, such as securities funds, insurance companies, pension funds etc., has increased. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  have the disadvantage that they risk having unforeseen effects in sectors that have not had problems. If the problems are clearly concentrated on a specific sector, tools with a narrower area of effect are thus to be preferred. If, for example, the problem is a rapid build-up of housing loans in combination with rapidly rising housing prices, it may be better to focus specifically on the housing market. A more narrowly-acting tool in this case could be an increase of risk weights specifically on housing loans. However, it is not certain that there will always be narrowly-acting tools that are sufficiently effective. Thirdly, there may be a need for tools that can be focused on different types of participant. This is primarily a matter of using tools aimed at financial companies, as it is within these companies that problems that may ultimately lead to a financial crisis can arise. But there may also be reason to use tools aimed at households and non-financial companies. Such tools can form important complements, for example by dampening demand for credit. Naturally, there are already policy areas that directly or indirectly influence financial stability. As regards the housing market, which is a sector that is creating a great deal of unease in Sweden due to high indebtedness and high prices, this is influenced by factors such as regulations for tax deductions for interest payments, changes to property tax, rent control and other regulations that affect incentives for housing construction. But decisions on measures in these areas are primarily taken on the basis of other goals than safeguarding the stability of the financial system. In micro supervision, which is the kind of supervision carried out by Finansinspektionen in Sweden, a series of different tools is also used to influence financial stability. However, at present, Finansinspektionen’s remit is focused on dampening risks among individual institutions, not in the system as a whole. What we need, quite simply, are specific tools for macroprudential supervision that can be used with the direct aim of promoting stability in the system. This will make it possible to counteract the systemic risks created by policies in other areas so that the system as a whole remains stable. The housing market is a good example of this. Politically, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to carry out changes to the taxation system making mortgage borrowing significantly more expensive, even if this would be the most effective way of reducing the risks associated with high indebtedness among households. This means we need tools that can counteract this kind of indebtedness and which can be used with the aim of promoting the stability of the financial system. There is a great need for such tools in Sweden The Swedish banking system is large and closely interwoven, which means that problems in one bank can easily spread to the other banks. The costs to society can thus be extensive in the event of a crisis. Increasing the safety margins in the financial system is therefore highly important. It can be enough for one bank to be impacted by problems for confidence in all banks to be dealt a blow. The important role of confidence in the financial markets became clear in the autumn of 2008, when the lack of confidence led to many banks rapidly encountering liquidity problems and being forced to rely on the Riksbank’s measures for their funding. In this regard, the Swedish banks are also particularly sensitive to shocks on the financial markets as they largely obtain funding in foreign currency. Funding in foreign currency is often for shorter durations than funding in Swedish currency and has been seen to disappear abruptly in times of stress. Important steps have already been taken… A series of important steps have already been taken to make the financial system more robust. A large part of this work is taking place within the framework of the Basel III regulations. Higher demands for more and higher quality capital will contribute towards strengthening confidence in the individual banks and thereby also in the system as a whole. In addition, more capital will lead confidence in the banks on the financial markets to increase, which will make it easier for the banks to obtain access to market funding. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The new regulations also bring with them a few “pure” macroprudential policy instruments in the form of countercyclical buffers and special capital supplements for global systemically-important financial institutions (SIFIs). I will return to this shortly, but allow me first to say a few words on the new capital adequacy rules. At the moment, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament are negotiating procedures for the incorporation of the new capital adequacy rules into EU law. These discussions have broadly focused on whether individual member states should be able to place higher capital requirements than the minimum. I consider that we should be allowed to do this. In Sweden, we need to set capital requirements on the basis of the prevailing circumstances on the Swedish banking market. In my opinion, this must be the guiding principle as long as it is Swedish taxpayers’ money that would ultimately be at stake in the event that Sweden were to be impacted by a financial crisis. The Ministry of Finance, Finansinspektionen and the Riksbank have signalled that the capital adequacy of the major Swedish banks needs to be increased considerably. According to the plan, capital adequacy is to increase to at least 10 per cent by 2013 and at least 12 per cent by 1 January 2015.6 The Swedish banks have every chance of meeting these requirements due to their high earning capacities and their low loan losses. The four major banks are systemically important on a national level and, additionally, Nordea is systemically important on a global level.7 The supplement for systemic importance is included in the capital levels that I have just cited. This is thus a measure linked to risks of a structural character. For the same reasons, there may be a need for Sweden to introduce tougher requirements for the Swedish banks’ liquidity reserves than are advocated by the Basel III regulations. The banks need to become better at themselves managing the liquidity problems to which their activities give rise, particularly as regards liquidity in foreign currency. If the banks match the maturities of assets and liabilities better and maintain sufficient liquidity reserves in foreign currency, they will be less sensitive to shocks on the financial markets. The Basel III Accord intends that two quantitative liquidity requirements be introduced, one short-term and one long-term. The short-term measure liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is intended to ensure that the banks have enough liquidity to cope for 30 days under stressed market conditions. The long-term measure net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is aimed at reducing the maturity difference between assets and liabilities. The Basel Committee’s plan is for the LCR to be introduced in 2015 but, as the Swedish banks largely use short-term market funding in foreign currency, the Riksbank and Finansinspektionen consider that Sweden should go in advance and introduce the LCR in January 2013.8 In addition to this, the Swedish banks will also need to have the LCR at 100 per cent in the foreign currencies euro and US dollar. So, even here, we consider that higher requirements should be placed on the Swedish banks than the Basel III regulations do. Countercyclical capital requirements, a macroprudential policy instrument in focus One of the macroprudential policy instruments being discussed most in Europe at present is countercyclical capital requirements. These are included as a part of the new Basel regulations. Consequently, this is an instrument that we know we will be able to use in Sweden in a number of years. The principle is simple: when the financial risks increase, the banks will successively be forced to increase their countercyclical buffers; when the risks recede, they will be permitted to decrease them. However, in practice, the instrument is not entirely so simple to design. The level of the countercyclical capital buffers will be determined                                                 6 This refers to Core Tier 1 capital in relation to risk-weighted assets. 7 FSB (2011), “Policy Measures to Address Systemically Important Financial Institutions”, 4 November 2011. 8 See, for example, Financial Stability Report 2012:1, Sveriges Riksbank. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  by the relevant authorities on the basis of quantitative and qualitative assessments. Among other data, the quantitative assessment will take into account the so-called credit gap, which is how far credit growth deviates from an estimated trend. But this is a fairly rough measure of the degree of risk in the system, and other measures and assessments may also be fairly important. The aim of the countercyclical capital buffers is primarily to strengthen the banks and the resilience of the financial system. One effect of introducing the buffers will be to moderate the fluctuations of the credit cycle. In an upturn, substantial credit expansion will activate the buffers, which means that the banks will gradually have to hold more capital. This will restrict lending and thus reduce the risk of exaggerated credit growth and rising asset prices. In a situation in which lending is being tightened, the banks’ capital will be freed up as the buffer requirement is reduced. The banks will therefore not need to reduce their lending to the same extent, which would otherwise reinforce the downturn. Here, it may be worth emphasising that the credit cycle does not typically coincide with the business cycle (the fluctuations of which we, at the Riksbank, attempt to dampen with the use of monetary policy), but has a longer course. But once again, the primary purpose of the countercyclical capital buffers is to increase the resilience of the financial system by ensuring that the banks have enough capital in periods when risks are accumulating. Negotiations are underway on the EU level regarding the implementation of Basel III, and thus also the countercyclical buffer. Who will be responsible for the instrument – an existing authority, several authorities together or a newly- formed authority – is an open question in Sweden and many other countries. The Swedish government has appointed a commission to investigate the implementation of countercyclical capital buffers in Sweden.9 …but the Basel regulations do not capture all risks in Sweden The Basel III Accord will also place requirements on the banks’ leverage ratio, which is the minimum amount of capital that the banks must retain regardless of the risk class of the assets.10 The fact that a requirement for the leverage ratio sets a ceiling for indebtedness in the banking system is very attractive. It guarantees a kind of minimum level for resilience. At the same time, the banks will no longer have to rely upon the risk weights correctly reflecting the actual risk in lending. My assessment is that leverage ratios and countercyclical buffers are good instruments for the management of systemic risks which will help us strengthen the financial system when the need arises. But they have their limitations. Both of these instruments are indiscriminate and it will be difficult to determine when it will be appropriate to increase or decrease the countercyclical capital buffers. If we are to be able to combat risks efficiently, we will also need instruments that can be directed towards the areas in which the problems exist. Variable risk weighting – a usable instrument One instrument that a growing group of countries is choosing to introduce is variable risk weighting for lending.11 These can be seen as a complement to countercyclical capital buffers and are aimed at counteracting the build-up of risks in lending to specific sectors. Varying risk weighting is thus a more focused instrument than countercyclical capital buffers.                                                 9 This work is being conducted within the framework of the government’s inquiry Fi 2012:05 “Inquiry on capital adequacy regulations”, to be concluded in the spring of 2013. 10 This capital conservation buffer is to be held in the form of core Tier 1 capital and is to consist of 2.5 per cent of the risk-weighted assets. 11 In the United Kingdom, the Financial Policy Committee has been given a mandate to introduce risk weighting, so-called sectoral capital requirements, see Financial Policy Committee statement, March 2012. See also Bank of England Instruments of macroprudential policy, a discussion paper, December 2011. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The banks’ capital ratios are determined by their capital and assets and by the risk weights used for calculating the risk-weighted assets. If the risk weightings on lending to sectors considered as higher risk are increased, the banks must allocate more capital per loan. This could dampen lending to higher risk sectors. Our domestic banking crisis at the start of the 1990s provides one example of how systemic risks can build up and become concentrated upon a single sector – in this case, commercial properties. An increase of the risk weighting on loans to commercial properties might have been able to alleviate the crisis that we went through then. In Sweden, recent discussions have, above all, dealt with risk weightings on mortgage loans, which are among the lowest in Europe due to the historically- low loan losses. But there is reason to question these low risk weightings, as they do not account for recent years’ increases in household indebtedness. Consequently, Finansinspektionen has also started work on reviewing the risk weights with the aim of increasing them. I consider that variable risk weighting is a macroprudential policy instrument that it would be advantageous to include in a toolbox for Sweden. It could both strengthen the banks’ resilience against systemic risks in a broad sense, and reduce the risks associated with lending to a specific sector. Such a tool would reduce the pressure on monetary policy as an instrument for managing risks on the Swedish housing market, something that I personally would very much welcome. This would allow influence to be exerted on the expansion of credit in the household sector and on housing prices, without simultaneously impeding credit granting in other sectors and possibly influencing the krona exchange rate in a direction that would impede exports. A ceiling on household borrowing Another way of counteracting systemic risks is to use loan ceilings as a macroprudential policy instrument. These can certainly be focused on all categories of borrower in society, but, in the countries in which they have so far been applied, they have been directed at households and their indebtedness.12 These instruments have usually been formulated as a limit on the amount of the loan in relation to the household’s income or the value of the household’s assets that form the collateral for the loan. There is no internationally harmonised definition of these instruments, allowing them to be defined differently as regards loan amount, income and value of underlying collateral. In Sweden, Finansinspektionen issued a recommendation almost two years ago regarding a limit on how much borrowers may borrow, the so-called mortgage ceiling. According to this, household loans should not exceed 85 per cent of the property’s market value when the loan is granted. Lending above this threshold is still possible, but should be granted without residential collateral and therefore at higher interest rates. Even if Finansinspektionen’s justification for the mortgage ceiling was to protect consumers, the measure can also be used for macroprudential supervision. From a stability perspective, the credit risks in the banks’ credit portfolios could be reduced if the rule contributes towards reducing the economic vulnerability of households. The loan ceiling may also contribute towards more stable price formation on the housing market, as the rules influence how much money households are willing to put into purchasing housing. If this counteracts excessive price variations on the housing market and the unsustainable accumulation of debt among households, it will also likewise contribute towards reducing the risk of loan losses in the banking system.                                                 12 See, for example Lim, C., et al., (2011), “Macroprudential Policy: What Instruments and How to Use Them? Lessons from Country Experiences”, IMF Working Paper, 11/238. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  A loan ceiling based on income would have largely the same characteristics as one based on the value of housing, but may have certain advantages. If debts are not linked to price movements on the housing markets, this avoids the problem of price increases and indebtedness reciprocally being pushed upwards in a rising spiral. Effectively combating future financial crises will require flexibility An efficient financial system is a prerequisite for a modern economy. A shock leading to the breakdown of any of the financial system’s functions can have major economic costs in the form of sharp falls in GDP and high unemployment. Central government finances can be weakened so much that the country enters a debt crisis. From this point of view, it may be considered justifiable to make every effort to increase the resilience of the financial system. At the same time, it is important to always compare the cost of various types of measure with their benefit, so that we can design the most efficient system possible. I have presented a long list of possible instruments that could be used to conduct macroprudential supervision. By necessity, this list will include most tools, as different tools are needed to counteract different systemic risks. But we are discussing something that is relatively new. At present, we only have limited experience of conducting macroprudential supervision in practice. This means that the process of introducing macroprudential supervision will entail a certain degree of trial and error. Quite simply, we will have to test our way forward, while constantly doing our best to assess the efficiency of the instruments being employed.13 The financial system is complex and dynamic, and the risk outlook is changing all the time. This means that it can never be determined with certainty where a financial crisis may arise. Bearing this in mind, it is important that we, in Sweden, construct a framework for macroprudential supervision that is flexible and that we do not limit our possibilities in terms of the instruments that can be used. It is also important to establish a process to evaluate and later develop and modify the toolbox. I consider that a clear but, at the same time, flexible framework for macroprudential supervision will create the best conditions to counteract future financial crises. But this is not to say that this would be enough to ensure that no financial crisis ever occurs again. The crises of tomorrow will probably have completely different causes to the crises of yesterday, making them difficult to protect ourselves against. However, the scale of the costs of a financial crisis justify making every effort to protect ourselves. As regards the question of where responsibility for macroprudential policy ought to lie, it is clear that this area is closely linked to both the Riksbank’s and Finansinspektionen’s activities. The Riksbank has been analysing the stability of the financial system for fifteen years and also currently provides recommendations for safeguarding it in its Financial Stability Reports. Finansinspektionen also works for the stability of the financial system but with a focus on individual institutions. The competence and experience of both authorities will have to be utilised if macroprudential policy is to be effective in Sweden. While awaiting a more long-term solution for Swedish macroprudential supervision, the Riksbank and Finansinspektionen have set up a temporary council for cooperation. In addition to consulting and exchanging information on assessments of risks and possible countermeasures, one task of the council is to discuss the development of instruments and methods within macroprudential supervision. The joint communication of our assessments in connection with this council for cooperation is a benefit in itself. However, over the long term,                                                 13 In the absence of empirical experience of conducting macroprudential supervision, theoretical analyses can provide guidance to the consequences that can be expected. However, academic research into this area is still in its infancy and it is therefore difficult to draw any unequivocal conclusions from it at present. Goodhart et al. (2012) is one example of a study investigating the interplay of a number of macroprudential policy instruments, which is to say whether these complement or substitute each other. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  something more than a qualified discussion forum will be needed. To become really effective, macroprudential policy needs to acquire the distinct status of an independent policy area with its own tools for promoting stability in the financial system as a whole and a clear allocation of responsibility. Assessing and demanding responsibility demands a clear allocation of responsibility. Another benefit of establishing a clear and effective framework for macroprudential policy is that this will allow monetary policy to be relieved of taking account of financial stability. In my opinion, this consideration is creating a risk that monetary policy will become unclear and unpredictable. A functioning macroprudential policy will thus let us both reduce the risk of financial crises and give us a monetary policy that can more efficiently stabilise inflation around the inflation target and resource utilisation around a sustainable level.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Duvvuri Subbarao: Achieving inclusive growth – the challenge of a new era Welcome remarks by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 13th L.K. Jha Memorial Lecture, Mumbai, 27 September 2012. *      *      * On behalf of the Reserve Bank of India, I have great pleasure in welcoming Hon’ble Mr. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, who will shortly be delivering the L.K. Jha Memorial Lecture. I also have pleasure in acknowledging the presence here of members of the family of late Dr. L.K. Jha – Smt. Dipika Maharaj Singh, Smt. Sharika Glover and Kiron Glover. Your presence here means a lot to us. Thank you very much. A warm welcome, of course, to all our distinguished invitees who have made time and to be here for this lecture. Dr. L. K. Jha History will remember Dr. L.K. Jha as one of India’s most distinguished civil servants. With a remarkable career as an economic administrator and several impressive accomplishments to his credit, he has been a role model for generations of civil servants. After graduating from the Banaras Hindu University, “LK”, as he was popularly known, went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge where he was a student of legendary economists such as A.C. Pigou, J.M. Keynes and D.H. Robertson. He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1936. After an early career in Bihar, he was seconded to Government of India in 1942 where he served in several important positions, and ended up in the pivotal job of Secretary to the Prime Minister. Dr. Jha was Governor of the Reserve Bank from July 1967 to May 1970, at a time when our economy was going through one of its most challenging phases. The country was shaken by food security concerns, and initiatives to redress them resulted in the much celebrated “Green Revolution”. Through his leadership, Governor Jha made the Reserve Bank an influential force in shaping these initiatives. The distress suffered by the poor because of the overall scarcity situation resulted in poverty reduction becoming the overarching consideration of all policy. The Reserve Bank, under Dr. Jha’s stewardship, contributed to designing and implementing many of these anti-poverty policies. After his tenure in the Reserve Bank, Dr. Jha served as India’s Ambassador to the United States and as Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. He was also a member of the widely acclaimed Brandt Commission which made a persuasive case for North-South cooperation. Global cooperation, which is now so much a part of our daily discourse, draws its intellectual origins from the Brandt Commission report of the 1970s to which Dr. Jha contributed. This lecture series in his name honours Dr. Jha’s outstanding service to the nation and his leadership of the Reserve Bank during a very critical period. So far, there have been 12 lectures. The last one was given by Prof. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California last year, in December 2011. The lecture by Hon’ble Mr. Shanmugaratnam this evening will be the 13th in the series. The distinguished speaker – Mr. Shanmugaratnam Hon’ble Mr. Shanmugaratnam is the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, of course. But he is also the Chairman of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, the IMFC, a position which puts him in the top echelons of global leadership in the field of finance and economics – a leadership that is playing an important role in steering us through the biggest financial crisis of our generation. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Mr. Shanmugaratnam has impressive academic credentials – an MS in Economics from the London School of Economics followed by a Masters in Public Administration from Harvard. At Harvard, he also received the Lucius N. Littauer Fellowship for outstanding performance and leadership potential, a potential that he fully demonstrated in later career. Tharman started his career with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) rising to the position of Chief Executive of that prestigious institution. He quit that job in 2001 to join politics, and has held cabinet appointments variously for education, economic administration and manpower. Currently, he is Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. I have had the privilege of watching Mr. Shamugaratnam perform in various international forums including the G-20 and the IMF-World Bank meetings. He is widely respected for his intelligence and wisdom and for his uncommon ability to see the big picture even as we grapple with the pressures of immediacy. Globally, he is seen as the principal interlocutor on Asian economic values and aspirations. Achieving inclusive growth: the challenge of a new era Mr. Shanmugaratnam will be speaking to us this evening on: “Achieving Inclusive Growth: The Challenge of a New Era”, a topic he is very well qualified to address because of the combination of perspective he brings to it – Asian values and ethos combined with wide ranging international study and experience. Inclusive growth is of course a topic of undoubtedly great interest to us in India – but also of interest, I believe, to every country in the world – rich and poor alike. The quest for inclusive growth draws from a powerful lesson of development experience – that growth has no meaning, or indeed even no legitimacy, if those at the bottom of the pyramid get left behind. But consensus, if any, breaks down right at that point. Beyond the basic premise that inclusive growth is desirable, virtually every issue and nuance – starting from what constitutes inclusive growth to how it is to be achieved and sustained – is up for a contentious, and oftentimes acrimonious, debate. This debate, like several others in development economics, is one that has frowned on moderation. At one extreme is the “trickle down” theory which holds that the benefits of growth would automatically trickle down to the bottom; that the trickle down is a process that must be left to its natural pace and path, and forcing it down will be counterproductive. At the other extreme is the activist view that rubbishes trickle down and holds that redistributive policies must be part of the development paradigm, even if it means compromising on the quality and pace of growth. As we all realize, inclusive growth is a deeply emotive issue that has transcended economics to enter into political discourse and electoral platforms. In the era of globalization, the debate on inclusive growth has quite naturally acquired international dimensions too. Is a world order in which some countries prosper while others get left behind sustainable? If not, what are the obligations and responsibilities of rich countries, and of poor countries? And in a world dominated by nation states, how do we build a constituency for the global economy? The concerns about inclusive growth are not unique to emerging and developing economies. They are resonating in the rich world as well. Last year, we saw a massive demonstration of popular discontent around the world. The “Occupy Wall Street” movement in New York’s Zuccotti Park was the most prominent, but by no means the only one. Despite its amorphous nature, and its refusal to articulate a set of demands, the protest campaigns across the world were shaped by a simple but powerful idea – that the well-off cannot go on doing obscenely well even as the rest keeps moving backwards. The message from this collective rage is that growth itself can be destabilizing if it is not inclusive.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Renminbi trade settlement and investment in Malaysia  – future prospects Keynote address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Seminar on “Renminbi trade settlement and investment in Malaysia – future prospects”, Kuala Lumpur, 27 September 2012. *      *      * This decade has seen significant change in the configuration of the global economy. In this evolving global landscape, Asia is emerging as an increasingly important component of the world economy. During this period, most of the Asian economies have experienced remarkable growth, despite a most challenging environment. With rising incomes in the region, Asia has also become a huge cumulative market. This trend has in turn prompted greater intra-regional trade and investment activities. A more recent trend in the Asian region is the greater regional financial integration that is facilitating greater cross-border financial flows in the region that is funding productive investment activities in the region. Following the recent global financial crisis, the most pressing challenge for the world economy is to achieve economic strength that is sustainable. While most national economies have implemented wide ranging policy measures to promote growth, equally important are the efforts to sustain world trade which will be mutually reinforcing to global growth. China’s economic journey in this global shift and the growing influence of renminbi ushers us into a new exciting era. China, by its sheer size and its economic performance has significant potential to contribute to world growth. Its demand, trade and cross-border investment activities will reinforce this potential. The recent trend for the use of the renminbi for settlement of trade and cross-border investment activities will facilitate this potential. It is my pleasure to welcome you to this Seminar on “Renminbi Trade Settlement and Investment”. I would like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to our guest speakers from the People’s Bank of China and the Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) of the People’s Republic of China. I also wish to welcome our panellists from the financial industry and the corporate sector that are here today to share their experiences in operating in the current challenging economic and financial environment. The economic relationship between Malaysia and China is longstanding and grounded on strong foundations. Today, China is Malaysia’s largest trading partner accounting for 14% of our country’s total trade. Malaysia also ranks as China’s most significant trading partner in the Asean region. Our trade with China has continued to expand, increasing by 20% annually, in this recent two decades. Our bilateral trade with China is now seven times higher than the level in the early 1990’s. Our economic relations have also evolved and expanded beyond the area of trade – into the services sector, particularly the financial sector, tourism and education. China is among the top five tourism markets for Malaysia and Chinese nationals represent the largest foreign student population in Malaysia’s private universities and colleges. Bilateral investment is also gaining importance, notably with the two recent Government-to-Government agreements, involving the establishment of an industrial park in both countries. The cornerstone to the strength of our bilateral economic relations is the ability to continually harness the synergies and economic complementarities that exists between our economies. The use of renminbi for trade settlement provides a natural hedge for businesses with renminbi obligations. It also generates cost savings and minimises exchange rate risks, in particular, it reduces the exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of a third currency. While the dollar will continue to remain an important currency for settlement of trade obligations, the availability of renminbi would provide companies an additional currency for such trade settlement. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The benefits to be gained can be significant given the large and increasing trade base with China which stood at RM167 billion in 2011. By undertaking the transactions in local currency, exporters and importers in China would be able to eliminate the hedging and conversion costs. The reduction in transaction costs for the exporters and importers will contribute towards more competitive pricing for both exporters and importers. The full potential benefits are however expected to be realised in stages. The benefits will rise as the trade volume settled in renminbi increases and reaches a critical volume in terms of size which will in turn allow for the realisation of economies of scale. For the renminbi to be considered an option for both exporters and importers to settle their trade obligations in addition to the major currencies. There needs to be an efficient and cost-competitive source of financing in renminbi and a diversified investment avenue. In particular, it is recognised that discernible progress in three areas are needed to be put in place at an early stage to support the use of renminbi, that is, to improve access to renminbi liquidity, to have the supporting infrastructure and framework and to provide information on the use of the renminbi for trade and productive investment transactions. More than three years ago, in early 2009, the Bank entered into a Currency Swap Arrangement (CSA) Agreement with the People’s Bank of China, which was renewed early this year with an expanded amount of Renminbi 180 billion. The objective is to ensure a ready supply of renminbi in the domestic financial markets to meet the demand by businesses. An important piece of the infrastructure that was put in place in 2010 was the provision of direct quotes between renminbi and ringgit in the interbank foreign exchange market on the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS). Efforts were also made to enhance the transparency in the exchange rate between renminbi and ringgit for the trade-related settlement transactions. In March this year, the real time gross settlement system in Malaysia was expanded to include settlement services in renminbi. This serves to provide a safe and efficient clearing and settlement platform that supports trade and investment flows in renminbi. A nationwide awareness program by the banking institutions and the business chambers is also creating greater awareness on renminbi for trade settlement and investment. The Bank has also participated in the Chinese interbank bond market. In 2011 alone, the size of renminbi trade settlement in Malaysia expanded by four times from the level a year ago, reflecting a growing interest in renminbi as a settlement currency. The expansion in renminbi usage has also been underpinned by a diffusion of corporate players, both in size and across the sectors. Not only has the number of corporate players increased, but there has been a shift in relative significance in the use of renminbi as a trade settlement currency from the smaller to the larger corporations. There has also been more widespread corporate participation from a larger cross-segment of economic activities, namely the commodity based industries, manufacturing and services sectors that also includes tourism and education. There has also been an increase in the number of financial institutions participating in renminbi trade settlements. There are now 19 financial institutions that facilitated such trade settlements, double the number in 2009. More recently, there has been an increase in the use of the renminbi as an investment and funding currency. In the first seven months of this year, renminbi deposits in the banking system had tripled. Also evident is the growing interest in raising financing in renminbi to meet funding requirements, with two issuances of offshore renminbi sukuk out of Malaysia and a renminbi bond issuance by Malaysian corporations. The progress made thus far, while modest, has significant potential given the significant volume of the bilateral cross-border trade and foreign direct investment between our economies. Trade settled in renminbi currently only represents slightly above 1% of Malaysia’s bilateral trade with China. There is therefore potential for this to increase. In addition, funding and foreign direct investment activities in renminbi have also increased with 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  the greater awareness on the use of renminbi for the settlement of trade and direct investment transactions and on the potential to raise financing by businesses. Important to this initiative is the access to a wider array of portfolio investment avenues in renminbi. The availability of renminbi bonds and sukuk as well as other financial products for portfolio investment will not only encourage renminbi receivables, but it will also help to build a pool of trade-driven renminbi liquidity in the Malaysian market. Another important channel that would support the use of renminbi in trade and investment is repatriation as foreign direct investment in real sector activities in China increases. Raising funding in renminbi has also emerged as a further form of business in the Malaysian financial system. This has been the conventional channels by the banking institutions and the issuance of renminbi instruments in the bond and sukuk market in Malaysia. Malaysia is well positioned to realise this growth potential in renminbi bond and sukuk, given our market size and supporting infrastructure. Malaysia not only has the largest debt securities market in Southeast Asia, but it is also a leading international centre for sukuk issuance. Both markets are evolving as a multi-currency bond and sukuk market. As the renminbi market expands, more information would be needed to provide awareness on market developments. As we transition to using other currencies for trade settlement it will also require businesses to gain new expertise, develop new arrangements and to build new networks. Let me now conclude my remarks. As Asia, and in particular, China’s greater prominence in the global economy, a dynamic response is required in this new operating environment that is now upon us. One of the changes that will shape the international financial system in the years to come is the wider role of the renminbi in trade and finance. While existing international reserve currencies will remain to be important, this will represent an additional currency in the international financial system. This is an expected development as the world economy becomes increasingly multi-polar. In a more complex and more challenging economic and financial environment that is prone to greater volatility and increased uncertainty, there will be a greater trend to diversify risks. This will also contribute to overall global stability in the international financial system. On our part, the Bank is committed to collaborate with the Chinese authorities to facilitate the use of renminbi that is anchored on real sector activities for the mutual benefit of our countries. Today’s seminar will discuss the issues concerning the use of renminbi in trade and investment. On this note, I wish you all a productive and successful engagement. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Timothy Lane: Financing commodities markets Remarks by Mr Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the CFA Society of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, 25 September 2012. *      *      * Introduction Good afternoon. I want to thank the CFA Society of Calgary for inviting me to speak to you today. I would like to take this opportunity to share some thoughts on the role of the financial system in our natural resource economy. In particular, I would like to focus on the changing relationship between the financial system and commodities markets. Natural resources are of central importance to Canada’s economy and financial system, and nowhere is that more apparent than here in Calgary. The development of these natural resources has been powering much of Calgary’s – and Canada’s – recent economic growth. Natural resource industries – including farming, forestry, mining, oil and gas extraction and related industries – are a key element of the Canadian economy, accounting for roughly one fifth of our gross domestic product.1 That share is roughly twice the share of natural resource industries in the United States economy and higher than in most other advanced economies.2 Resources are an even more important feature of Canada’s international trade, accounting for roughly half of our exports. We all have a strong stake, therefore, in ensuring that these resources are developed wisely and sustainably for the benefit of all Canadians. Doing that requires several elements: an appropriate policy environment, flexible labour markets and a reliable transportation network. It also requires a sound and efficient financial system that meets the needs of the resource economy. The financial system is connected to resource development in two main ways. First, it channels the financing needed to develop those resources. Canada’s equity markets in particular are heavily weighted toward resources: the TSX Venture Exchange is one of the world’s primary listing destinations for resource firms, and even the Toronto Stock Exchange is sometimes referred to as “the world’s mining exchange.” Bank lending and other financing flows also play an important part. Many of you are directly involved in some aspect of this financing. Second, the financial system is linked with the commodities markets. Here, I mean the intricate web of global markets in which commodities are bought and sold, prices determined, and the producers and end-users of commodities hedge against unexpected movements in those prices. These markets are very important in determining the returns that Canadian producers earn for their output, as well as the risks they face. In my remarks today, I would like to address this second aspect: the commodities market and its nexus with the financial system. My focus is the key trends related to financial innovation, deleveraging and regulation.                                                 1 Natural resource industries include the following: agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing; mining and oil and gas extraction; wood products; paper manufacturing; printing and related support activities; petroleum and coal products; chemicals, excluding pharmaceuticals; non-metallic mineral products; primary and fabricated metals; and utilities. 2 J. Murray, “Commodity Prices: The Long and the Short of It,” speech to the Johnson/Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, Regina, Saskatchewan, 10 February 2011. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Complex global commodities markets The commodities markets are complex in several ways. There are spot markets and forward transactions, as well as other derivatives contracts such as options. There are organized exchanges and over-the-counter markets. There are physical and financial aspects. Trading takes place in many different geographical locations and many different commodities and grades of those commodities are traded. There are also many players in these markets: producers; end-users; major commodity trading houses; the commodity trading operations of the large global investment banks; exchange-traded funds (ETFs); various institutional and individual investors and, in some cases, government agencies. So what makes these markets global? Arbitrage is the glue that binds together markets that are separated by distance and time, as well as markets for different but related products. Arbitrageurs take advantage of price differences, buying low and selling high, and thus driving those prices together. They can also take advantage of differences between physical and financial commodity markets, tying together prices across those markets. Various market-makers hold inventories and stand ready to buy and sell commodities, connecting suppliers and end-users. These arbitrage and market-making activities are often undertaken by the same firms and are difficult to disentangle. Of course, there are limits to the extent to which prices converge in global commodities markets. The recent behaviour of oil prices is a particularly telling example of these limits. Western Canadian crude oil has been selling at a deep and varying discount compared with the world price. This discount is due to the limitations of our transport network as well as differences in grade. As a result, Western Canadian producers of heavy oil have recently been obliged to sell their output at as much as $54 per barrel below the world price of oil – while Eastern Canadian consumers continue to pay the world price.3 This illustrates the point that when prices in different parts of the global commodities market diverge, Canadians may not reap the full benefits of their natural resources. Commodity prices I’ve stressed that arbitrage and market-making are critical to tying global commodities markets together. These activities provide significant liquidity to commodities markets and, when they work properly, they also help bring commodity prices into line with the fundamentals of supply and demand – by which I mean, not just current supply and demand, but expectations of how supply and demand will evolve in the future. There is strong evidence that broad movements in commodity prices over the longer term indeed reflect these fundamentals at a global level. Beginning in the 1990s, the robust resource-intensive growth of emerging market economies (EMEs) has propelled commodity markets into a supercycle. The number of people living in cities in China and India has risen by roughly 500 million since 1990. In parallel, the global middle class has been growing by 70 million people each year. These trends are widely expected to continue, with profound ramifications for a broad range of commodities.4  Of course, there have been significant variations around the upward trend in commodity prices. On average, commodity prices have declined over the past year, as the growth in emerging-market economies has been moderating. Nonetheless, commodity prices as a whole are still about 25 per cent above their historical averages in real terms. In particular, real prices for energy and metals have been well above their long-term averages for more                                                 3 World oil price refers to the price of Brent crude. 4 M. Carney, “Dutch Disease,” speech to the Spruce Meadows Round Table, Calgary, Alberta, 7 September 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  than seven years now, and real food prices are now at their highest level in 35 years (Chart 1). Financing commodities trading I have stressed the role of commodities markets – and in particular market-making and arbitrage – in tying together the global markets and bringing prices into line with fundamentals. These activities inevitably require financing – and the form of that financing has changed considerably over the past couple of decades. I would like to talk now about how that financing has changed and discuss the implications for the commodities markets and the financial system. There have been two countervailing trends: a strengthening of the links between the financial system and commodities markets during the decade or so before the 2008 global financial crisis, and an element of retrenchment and restructuring since then. Let me describe each of those trends in turn. A central element in the financing of commodities leading up to the 2008 crisis was the increasing participation of major global investment banks. Because of their access to wholesale funding markets, which provided them with cheaper funding than was available to other participants in commodity markets, the large banks became increasingly important in a range of commodity-related activities. They provided a large share of the lending to commodity dealers. They also themselves came to play a central role as dealers in over-the-counter derivatives markets in commodities. More recently, they have become more and more involved in the physical trading of commodities: holding physical inventories, making markets in commodities and even creating supply chains by providing shipping and commodity storage. In parallel, the globally active commodity trading houses assumed a large and expanding role. These institutions hold inventories of commodities, store them over time, move them around the world, and make markets in both physical commodities and their derivatives. As these trading houses grew, they played an increasingly important role in facilitating the trade in commodities. They are not financial institutions, but they do require large amounts of financing. Traditionally, this financing was mostly in the form of syndicated bank lending secured by their commodities inventories, but recently that financing model has been shifting, as I will discuss. Alongside the increasing role of these large institutions was the trend toward the “financialization” of commodities. Investors – both individuals and institutions such as pension funds and hedge funds – stepped up their interest in commodities (Chart 2). A combination of factors may have contributed to this trend. To some extent, investors may have been seeking higher returns associated with the commodity-price supercycle. They may also have sought to diversify their portfolios by including commodities as a distinct asset class. Whatever the reason, this movement of investors into commodities was facilitated by financial innovations – notably, the emergence of index funds and, later, a variety of exchange-traded funds (Chart 3). More recently, high-frequency trading has also become a feature of commodity markets, as it has in financial markets. These developments together helped turn commodities into increasingly liquid financial assets, accessible to a wider range of investors. In turn, the flood of investment funds into commodities helped spur further innovation. There is no clear evidence that this trend toward greater financialization has been a significant determinant of the overall level of commodity prices. As I have already discussed, the preponderance of evidence indicates instead that commodity prices have been driven by fundamentals – primarily by rising demand from EMEs. Research – including work at the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Bank of Canada – that looked for a possible link between prices and the volume of financial activity in commodities markets showed that it is difficult to identify such a relationship.5  It is possible that, under some circumstances, financial forces may have amplified price movements that were primarily driven by other forces and may thus have contributed to volatility – for example, by exaggerating spikes in oil prices. In contrast, some have argued that financialization has improved the efficiency of commodities markets. But no simple pattern emerges from the evidence. There is still a range of views on whether financial forces have, on the whole, contributed to or dampened volatility in commodity prices.6  It does appear, however, that financialization has been associated with closer ties between commodity markets and financial markets. One indication of this relationship is the greater correlation between short-run movements in commodity prices and the prices of other risky assets, including stock price indexes and currencies (Chart 4). In part, this no doubt reflects common macroeconomic factors driving the prices of a number of risky assets – particularly, changing market assessments of the prospects for global growth. But it is also plausible that such movements partly reflect investors’ changing perceptions of risk and, in some cases, changes in the availability of liquid financing for their investment positions. (Ironically, the increasing correlation between commodity prices and the prices of other assets such as equities diminishes the benefits of diversification that investors sought by investing in commodities in the first place.) Developments in the wake of the crisis I have been describing stronger links between the financial system and commodity markets during the decade or two prior to the global financial crisis that came to a head in 2008. But in the wake of that crisis, the global financial system has been undergoing a sea change. This in turn has introduced further important changes to the financing of commodities trading. Deleveraging has been the most significant trend in the global financial system since the crisis – one that is likely to continue for some time to come.7 Particularly pronounced in the United States and Europe, the deleveraging process is being driven partly by the need for financial institutions to restore their balance sheets after the losses they incurred during the crisis and the ensuing worldwide recession. It also reflects the tightening of financial regulations to make the system more resilient, with a view to preventing a new crisis. Under the terms of Basel III, the minimum amount of capital that banks must hold has increased by about five times. The largest, most complex firms must hold even more.8 Finally, deleveraging also reflects the shrinking of the shadow banking system – the complex web of securitized products, non-bank financial institutions, funding markets and other markets that created large amounts of leverage in some countries in the years preceding the crisis. On the whole, this deleveraging is a welcome correction – both by financial institutions and the regulatory authorities – to the excessive leverage that had built up in the global financial system before the crisis. As this process is completed, it should result in a more resilient global financial system. But it is also protracted and painful, with pervasive effects on the                                                 5 R. Alquist and O.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  global financial system and economy. Indeed, deleveraging by financial institutions as well as by households and governments is the main force that is keeping the global economy on its current path of gradual and unbalanced growth. How has this deleveraging affected commodities trading? Banks have been pulling back from the commodities sector, both in terms of their lending to commodities traders and their own market-making and proprietary trading activities. Until recently, European banks provided up to 80 per cent of the financing for the trading of commodities worldwide. But, as those banks have had to repair their balance sheets, they have scaled back their lending, bringing their share down to about 50 per cent. To some extent, U.S. and Asian banks as well as banks in the Middle East have stepped into the breach: they have increased their share of financing for commodity houses. However, in the current climate, that financing is more limited and has come at an increasing cost. For banks doing business in the United States, the anticipated impact of the Dodd-Frank legislation on their commodity trading operations has been an important additional reason for curtailing these operations. The involvement of banks in the financial trading of commodities, including derivatives, has declined and some have pulled out of the sector altogether. We have also seen a marked decline in the commodity assets that banks have under management. As banks have been scaling back their commodities-related lending, they have scaled back their commodities operations – for instance, reducing bonuses and remuneration for their commodity specialists. One area, however, in which some banks have been maintaining, or even expanding, their activities is in the physical side of the commodity business, increasing holdings of physical products and investments in the supply chain. These activities are more akin to those traditionally being undertaken by the commodity trading houses themselves. Recently, investors have also grown more cautious, pulling back their commodity-related investments. Commodity-related assets under management have declined, reducing another financing flow into commodities trading (Chart 5). As banks have scaled back their involvement in commodities, commodity trading houses have grown in importance and have changed their funding models. Some commodity companies have begun tapping the capital markets for the first time. Sales of investment-grade bonds by commodity companies are up 90 per cent over last year, and commodity-linked junk bonds have risen by an estimated 40 per cent so far this year. As commodity traders have increasingly been funding themselves directly through the capital markets, they have been making greater use of innovative financing tools. Some have used hybrid or convertible structures, and (particularly in Asia) have been making broader use of collateralized financing. In Europe, some banks are using structured trade credit insurance as a means of deleveraging while also remaining active in the commodity trade in emerging markets.9  Another development that partially reflects these changes in financing conditions is the wave of mergers and acquisitions that has been sweeping the commodity-trading sector. In a number of cases, the logic of these transactions is to bring trading houses and producers together. That’s not a new business model – indeed, the oil majors have had their trading operations for many years. But it is an increasingly attractive one in the current climate of dwindling bank financing for commodities.                                                 9 The latter shift has also been encouraged by regulation: many European countries allow such insurance to count as regulatory capital under the Basel III rules. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Implications So far, I have given you a thumbnail sketch of the changing trends in the financing of commodities markets. But why do these developments matter for the world economy, and particularly for Canada? Here, I would like briefly to highlight three sets of issues. First, there may be implications for the pricing of commodities. As I have stressed, the broad trends in commodity prices is determined by the fundamentals of supply and demand – notably the long-term growth in demand from Asian emerging-market economies. But the functioning of the markets in which commodities are traded has the potential to influence pricing in several ways. The flows of financing for commodity trading activities can affect the liquidity and efficiency of these markets and thus the extent to which prices reflect those fundamentals. As well, the financialization of commodities has the potential to affect the degree of short-term volatility of the markets. Although it is too early to assess the implications of the recent changes in financing patterns I have been describing, these developments bear watching. A second set of issues pertains to systemic risk. In particular, the large trading houses, together with the physical trading operations of some large investment banks, are playing an increasingly prominent role in a number of commodity markets. This raises the possibility that some of these institutions are becoming systemically important. Just as the 2008 financial crisis revealed the need to assess the systemic importance of institutions that play a central role in particular financial markets, we should be asking the same questions about institutions that are interconnected with various commodity markets. Here, I have two general questions in mind: Could the failure of one of the large trading houses cause serious disruption in the commodities markets in which it played a market-making role? And, could the losses that a trading house incurs through the positions it has taken in commodities have significant knock-on effects on the financial system? We are far from having answers to those questions, but they need to be addressed. Third, commodities trading can potentially be an important link between the financial system and the real economy. With the financialization of commodities, financial system stress has the potential to affect commodities markets. Commodities markets, in turn, have an important influence on the economic outlook of a commodity-rich country such as Canada. Moreover, movements in commodity prices may pose risks to the financial institutions that channel funding to commodity-trading activities. While it is possible that the recent trends toward deleveraging are actually diminishing the links between the financial system and commodities markets, this is a development that it will take time to assess. Conclusion Allow me to conclude. A sound and efficient financial system – both in Canada and globally – is essential for developing natural resources for the benefit of all Canadians. As I have discussed, the relationship between the financial system and the commodity markets has strengthened over the past couple of decades. However, in the wake of the global financial crisis, new trends have emerged that are associated with the broad trend toward deleveraging by financial institutions. The overall level of commodity prices is driven by supply and demand, particularly the rising demand from emerging-market economies. But financialization may have important implications for the short-term volatility of prices and their co-movements with the prices of other financial assets; for systemic risk; and for the channels through which stresses in the financial system can affect the real economy and vice versa. Given the importance of commodities to the Canadian economy, the Bank of Canada is monitoring these developments, with a view to safeguarding the economic well-being of all Canadians.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Erdem Başçi: Financial stability and Turkey’s achievements to date Welcome speech by Mr Erdem Başçi, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, for the 17th International Conference of Banking Supervisors, Istanbul, 13 September 2012. *      *      * Distinguished Deputy Prime Minister, Esteemed Guests and Distinguished Members of the Media,  Welcome to Istanbul and to the 17th International Conference of Banking Supervisors jointly hosted by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency of Turkey.  In my speech, I will try to summarize the importance we attach to financial stability and the achievements we have made up to date.  Dear Guests,  There are three essential factors that determine the growth potential of a country; these are price stability, financial stability and productivity. Any weakness in any of these three factors may cause considerable damage to growth. The history of economics is teeming with examples of this.  The social costs of loss of price stability are now very well known by economists. Academic studies indicate that an inflation rate that is on average higher by 10 percentage points leads to a reduction in the GDP growth rate an average of a quarter point.1  Meanwhile, the loss of financial stability has deep and long-term impacts on growth and employment.2 The cost of preventing a financial crisis is much lower than the cost of the crisis itself. Turkey’s recent history is a very good example of this statement. The economic crisis, which Turkey went through in 2001, increased the country’s sovereign debt by 30 percentage points, and severely affected growth and employment prospects. As of 2002, Turkey focused on establishing price stability, financial stability and introducing structural reforms aimed at increasing productivity. As a result, while the country’s economic prosperity grew at a rapid pace, the financial sector gained a structure resilient to external shocks.  The steps taken towards fostering financial stability helped Turkey recover rapidly after the 2008–2009 global financial crisis and it weathered the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011–2012 with minimum damage.  Distinguished Guests,  The primary objective of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is to achieve and maintain price stability. Besides price stability, contributing to financial stability within the limits of its purview has been also listed among the primary duties of the Bank.  Comprehending the importance of systemic risk along with macroprudential measures to mitigate this risk to ensure financial stability has necessitated reconsideration of the regulatory framework at global level. The enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in Europe as well as new regulations introduced in other countries aim to mitigate systemic risk by means of macroprudential measures. In                                                 1 Barro, Robert J. (1995). “Inflation and Economic Growth.” NBER Working Paper Series, No: 5326. 2 Reinhart, C. M. and Rogoff, K. S.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  this context, Turkey established the Financial Stability Committee in 2011. Along with the Central Bank, the Committee is composed of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey, the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund and the Undersecretariat of Treasury.  Distinguished Guests,  Now I would like to briefly mention Turkey’s contributions to global financial stability. Turkey became a member of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2009. In 2014, Turkey will participate in G20 Troika and assume Presidency of the G20 in 2015. During the period from 2014 to 2016, when Turkey will be taking part in G20 Troika, our representative from the Undersecretariat of Treasury will be assigned to the FSB Steering Committee.  Turkey became a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) in 2009. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will participate in the FSB Steering Committee during the period  2013–2015 when it will be chairing FSB Regional Consultative Group for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).  The New Constituency group, formed upon an agreement signed within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reform framework, includes Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Belarus and Kosovo along with Turkey. According to this agreement, during the periods of 2014–2016 and 2018–2020, Turkey will assume the Executive Director position on behalf of the group for two-year terms.  At the latest G-20 meeting held in Los Cabos, a number of emerging market countries including Turkey declared their intention to contribute to global financial stability by increasing the resources of the IMF. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will contribute to IMF resources up to USD 5 billion, to be counted as part of its international reserves.  Distinguished Guests,  The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will continue to play its part in order to achieve and maintain price stability and to contribute to financial stability in the upcoming period.  I believe that this two-day-meeting will be both fruitful and beneficial in terms of contributing to global financial stability. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome once more all distinguished participants to Istanbul. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Choongsoo Kim: Challenges and policy responses to the euro crisis Opening remarks by Mr Choongsoo Kim, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the SEACEN-BIS Executive Seminar, Busan, 24 September 2012. *      *      * Distinguished Deputy Governors, delegates of SEACEN member central banks! Ladies and gentlemen! I would like to welcome you once again for coming to Busan to attend the SEACEN-BIS Executive Seminar. In particular, my special thanks go to Mr. Francesco Papadia (Director General of Market Operations and Adviser to the Executive Board, ECB), Professor Takahashi ITO of Tokyo University and Chief Economist Changyong Rhee of the ADB for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend the SEACEN-BIS Executive Seminar as Speakers. Let me also express my appreciation to lead discussants and session chairs. Taking this opportunity, I would also like to express my gratitude to Dr. Eli Remolona and his staffs from the BIS Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific and the SEACEN Center for your efforts and hard work to organize this seminar. We are holding the seminar today on Challenges and Policy Responses to the Euro Crisis under the theme of Dealing with Financial Contagion with leading experts in each field. I hope particularly that this seminar will be a good chance to further elucidate the causes and the prognosis for the euro crisis and its effects on EMEs, and share our experiences and wisdom on the future policy challenges.  The most notable characteristic of the recent global crisis is that the shocks from a certain sector have spread rapidly and been amplified to the global real sector through the high level of global financial inter-connectedness that has been built up over the past few years. That said, it seems to me that the cross-border adverse spillovers and excessive global liquidity and the resulting capital flow management difficulties, deemed to be at the root of the crisis, have, to a large extent, failed to be resolved when we look at the international coordination efforts so far to deal with the crisis and what they have involved.  Therefore I believe there is a good case for us to conduct a critical review at this point as to whether the active policy implementation efforts made by major advanced nations including the US in coping with the crisis have been effective to some extent but have so far fallen short in terms of the global spillover effects of the crisis, and, furthermore, whether the various policy tools used during the crisis have worked as they should. As various views and assessments concerning this are expected at today’s seminar, I would like to make several points about a future global economic recovery from slightly different perspective and the practical part the EMEs can play in this.  I would like to begin my speech by arguing that the global economy has already entered into a state of multiple equilibria, where bad and good equilibrium coexist. My working hypothesis is that an equilibrium that eurozone area economies attempts to achieve is likely to be a local, not a global equilibrium. Furthermore, it can be a bad equilibrium in that it may incur negative spillover effects on the EMEs. Such equilibria tend to remain unstable and we expect that knife-edge equilibrium cannot be sustainable. I believe a global equilibrium can only be attained with the concerted policy efforts by advanced and emerging market economies.  Let me be a little more specific about my argument.  The eurozone sovereign debt crisis poses a threat to a global economic recovery and financial stability, and the upshot may be that it is hard to rule out the possibility of it affecting the EMEs unstable due to excessive provision of capital and thus making the capital market 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  of EMEs highly volatile. The chances are also slim that the sovereign debt problems of major economies including European countries can be resolved smoothly without achieving global economic growth.  I believe therefore that it is high time for us to concern ourselves with how best to revive the global economy, while consolidating the achievements of the financial reforms implemented by the policy authorities of individual countries in the wake of the global financial crisis from a medium and long- term perspective. Of course, since the tasks and challenges that we should deal with in order to escape from the current crisis and get back to a sustainable growth track are multifaceted and highly interconnected, the solution should not be limited to a single country or a certain region but be sought at the global level.  In this context, I think the key here is to maximize the positive knock-on effects of growth running between EMEs and advanced nations. And I am convinced that EMEs will play a bigger role in this process going forward. Specific figures also bear this out as well. EMEs accounted for 54% of the growth of the global economy from 2000 to 2005 and their growth contribution rose to 72% from 2006 to 2011. In addition, while EMEs contributed just 37% of the global GDP in 1999, their share went up to 49% in 2011, hard on the heels of the advanced nations. The IMF recently estimated in its global economic outlook that while the contribution of EMEs to the global economic growth is expected to remain about 70% for the next five years as in the late 2000s, their share in the global GDP is forecast to continue to increase to 54% in 2016. For more specific details, you may refer to the results of the study conducted by the Bank of Korea recently in order to examine to what extent EMEs could drive the economic growth of advanced nations. According to the study, there are similar positive growth repercussions between EMEs and advanced economies, when controlling conventional macro and institutional factors. To put it another way, a 1% increase of per capita GDP of advanced nations will lead to a 0.4%p per capita GDP growth in EMEs, and a 1% increase in per capita GDP in EMEs will be translated into 0.3%p per capita GDP growth in advanced economies.  Given that the positive knock-on effects of growth between emerging and advanced economies are higher than a certain level, one country’s structural reform could have a positive impact on other countries’ growth through such knock-on effects. If advanced and emerging economies carry out the structural reforms and expand market openness at the same time, the world economy will grow faster and more robustly.  As we can learn from Asian countries’ experience in overcoming the late 1990s Asian financial crisis very fast on the back of major advanced nations’ robust economic growth, if EMEs can sustain their relatively high growth rates as at present, this will be greatly helpful to advanced nations in breaking free from the current dilemma of reducing sovereign debt or achieving economic growth. To catapult the world economy onto a sustainable growth trajectory, what would be the most desirable policies to be taken by major advanced and emerging economies? I cannot explain this in great detail, but I think that roughly five requirements should be met in order for the global economic recovery.1  First, major advanced economies should establish a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan and put it into practice to put their sovereign finances on an even keel.                                                  1 Excerpt from Governor Choongsoo Kim’s speech on “Out of the Great Recession: An EME’s Perspective” as part of the Distinguished Lecture held by IMFS (Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability) of Goethe University. (April 16, 2012) 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Second, the negative spillover effects through financial channels should be minimized. To this end, eurozone member states should build a strong firewall ensuring financial stability, while providing sufficient public funds to banks that they can be recpaitalized to fend off contagion effects.  Third, trade and financial protectionism should be completely rejected. Fourth, even though implementation of a new international financial regulatory framework is desirable for global financial stability, we need more thorough analyses and studies on whether there is a possibility that the framework could undermine the incentives for appropriate risk sharing needed for productive investment.  Last but not least, global financial safety nets should also be strengthened. This poses the question, what kind of role should central banks play in seeking such global solutions? I think that above all central banks need to remain faithful to their original mandate. They should contribute to economic growth by maintaining price stability and financial stability and establishing an effective macroprudential policy framework to manage systemic risks. In particular, major advanced nations’ central banks need to bear in mind that their monetary policies could have negative spillover effects on emerging market countries. I think even from advanced nations’ standpoint, the benefits from precluding the possibility of adverse effects would far outweigh the ex-post costs caused by conducting monetary policies in consideration of their own conditions alone.  Let me conclude. As I am sure you are all too well aware, it has been four years since the global financial crisis broke out in September 2008. There is an urgent need for policy responses commensurate with the changing conditions in line with the most severe global financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s. As I mentioned earlier, to overcome the challenges facing us, we need above all to consider the measures at the global level. To that end, close cooperation in the global community is required, bearing in mind the growing role of EMEs. The world economy nowadays seems to be waiting for a sage like the philosopher Aristotle who claimed that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That is because, in this increasingly multipolarized environment, global leadership which can envision “the whole” future of the human being is becoming more important than ever before so as to address transnational issues, including global policy cooperation and coordination for global financial regulation and global sustainable growth.  In the face of the unprecedented Great Depression in the 1930s, our august predecessors in office were bold enough to change their conventional wisdom and recast the academic framework of the macroeconomy from a new perspective. For our part, we also similarly need to further push back and advance the horizon of a new explanatory paradigm that will stand for the next twenty or thirty years, through the historic impetus of the outbreak and resolution of this global financial crisis.  Noting that “the ever-changing nature of the challenges calls for vigilance and an on-going willingness to re-examine critically even well-honed convictions” in his speech, former BIS General Manager Sir Andrew Crockett, who passed away in early September, emphasized the importance of overcoming the ever-increasing challenges through “vigilance” and “willingness”.2                                                  2 Sir Andrew Crockett’s speech on “Central banking under test?”: conference on “ Monetary stability, financial stability and business cycle”, Basel, Switzerland (2003.3.28.) 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  We need to exercise our wisdom to overcome such challenges through creative responses in the face of the historic challenges. To this end, I think all economic players should stop looking back and start looking forward. Brief though this seminar is, I hope that it will be useful for us broadening our perceptions of the new intellectual paradigm.  Once again I would like to extend my gratitude to all participants and hope that this seminar will serve as a forum for lively and productive discussions with the active participation of all of you who are attending this seminar on behalf of SEACEN members. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: Completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Palestinian Public Finance Institute, Ramallah, 23 September 2012. *      *      * I would like to thank Stefan Huemer for his contributions to the speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions expressed herein. Mr Governor, Mr Consul General, Mr Vice President of the Board of the Palestinian Institute for Fiscal Policy, Deputy Ministers, Heads of Public Administration, Directors General, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to speak at the Palestinian Public finance Institute. The establishment of the Institute marks an important step in the development of the economic governance framework in the Palestinian Territories. I wish this project every success. It relies on the commitment of so many dedicated people in the Ministry of Finance and in Adetef. As Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, once put it: “Nothing is possible without men; nothing is lasting without institutions.” His words related to Europe but in fact they are relevant worldwide. The Middle East and Europe have always had close ties. They are both part of the Mediterranean region, which is economically and financially interlinked. And currently, both are experiencing an institutional transformation. In this part of the world it has come to be called the “Arab Spring”. In Europe, it is the consequence of an economic and financial crisis resulting from weaknesses in the architecture of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).  Institution-building takes time. Even though European integration started over six decades ago, the building of those institutions remains a work in progress. But to understand the challenges that Europe is currently facing, we should take a step back and look briefly at the origins of the Europe’s integration process. I will then share with you my thoughts on what I believe to be the main shortcomings in the current EMU framework. Finally, I will give you my views on the short- and longer-term measures that the euro area should take to overcome the crisis. 1. Building Europe after World War II: the path towards economic and monetary union In 1945, Europe emerged from the Second World War as a devastated continent, economically broken and politically divided. But even during the darkest days of the war, there were some Europeans who were convinced that Europe would eventually overcome its divisions and unite in peace.  One of them was Robert Schuman, a French statesman, who in 1950 made a declaration that became a rallying cry: he proposed that Europe should aim for closer economic and political cooperation. The declaration was well received, also by West Germany. This was a crucial point because Germany and France had been rivals in a century-long quest for dominance over the European continent. The Schuman Declaration paved the way for a new era of peaceful cooperation between the two nations, as well as with other countries.  A new type of Europe began to emerge from the wasteland of World War II. What was about to take shape was indeed “revolutionary” – because the fathers of a united Europe moved beyond the concept of the nation-state with a jealously guarded sovereignty. They placed coal and steel production – the two industries which were crucial to the war effort – under a new supranational authority. Six European countries – France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg – took this first and important step towards closer 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  cooperation in 1951. A process towards creating durable conditions for peace in Europe had been set in motion.  The six founding countries came to realise that there were substantial benefits in closer cooperation and agreed to deepen it further. In 1957, they signed the Treaty of Rome, which created a customs union and established the European Economic Community. Its overall aim was to promote harmonious economic development, raise living standards and develop a common market.  However, the founding fathers of Europe saw European integration as more than just an exercise in economic cooperation. They shared a larger vision for the future of Europe. Thus, in the Treaty’s preamble, the signatories committed to lay the foundations for an “ever closer union” among the peoples of Europe. This commitment has become the leitmotif of the continent’s integration. Indeed, the initial group of six countries that started this process has now expanded to become a group of 27 countries, with another one, Croatia, joining next year. Others are currently negotiating to become members.  Proposals for deeper monetary integration date back to the Werner Report of 1970 and gained political momentum in the second half of the 1980s. At that time, Member States were taking steps towards establishing a single market. This included also the liberalisation of capital movements. As a consequence, Europe became captive to what Robert Mundell and other economists have called the “impossible trinity” – in other words, the impossibility of simultaneously achieving the three goals of financial liberalisation, exchange rate stability, and national monetary policy. One of the three goals had to be abandoned. The choice as to which one became increasingly clear after the failed attempt to secure exchange rate stability through the Exchange Rate Mechanism.1 Given that a single market, including capital account liberalisation, had been a stated goal since the Treaty of Rome, and given that exchange rate stability was needed to reap the full benefits of the single market, Member States agreed to renounce monetary sovereignty. Moreover, sharing a currency makes sense for countries with close trade ties. This is especially true for the euro area countries which, since the start of EMU, have conducted almost half of their overall trade among themselves. The Maastricht Treaty, which was signed in 1992, made monetary policy a euro area competence but left economic and fiscal policies under the responsibility of national governments. The concept of economic union relied essentially on the single market, with few binding constraints on economic and fiscal policies. Over time, this turned out to be a significant institutional shortcoming. Moreover, the transfer of a core sovereign prerogative like monetary policy to the supranational level is a highly political act which entails important political commitments for the future. In particular, the participating countries must undertake to conduct fiscal and economic policies in a way that allows monetary union to work properly. This is a responsibility that the euro area countries share, a responsibility that governments have to fulfil vis-à-vis their peers and vis-à-vis their own citizens. Seen from this perspective, it is clear that the concept of EMU goes beyond economic and monetary integration. Let me add that the single market itself has a political dimension as the proper functioning of markets requires strong institutional underpinnings, such as enforcement of contracts, consumer protection and competition policy. It has mandated the creation of a federal executive (the European Commission), legislative (the European                                                 1 In the late 1970s, European countries agreed on closer exchange rate cooperation by setting standard fluctuation bands of plus/minus 2.25% for their bilateral exchange rates. This Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) functioned well for a decade or so but it ultimately fell apart due to the divergences in the economic and fiscal policies of the participating countries. Speculative attacks ensued and ultimately triggered a crisis that forced two large countries – the United Kingdom and Italy – to leave the ERM in 1992.

Under the Maastricht Treaty the European Economic Community became the European Union, a proper reflection of the fact that the ultimate aim – the finalité, as we say in French – of the European project is more than just economic. The EU is a real, albeit limited, political union. 2. The Maastricht framework and its shortcomings Let me now review briefly what I consider to be the three most important shortcomings of the Maastricht framework – the ones on which we need to achieve progress urgently: i) stronger fiscal institutions; ii) real convergence across the euro area; and iii) the establishment of a financial market union. The Maastricht Treaty created the European Central Bank (ECB), which took up its monetary operations on 1 January 1999. The monetary dimension of the Maastricht Treaty has worked very well. Since the start of EMU, the ECB has kept annual inflation rates on average very close to 2%. As regards economic policies however, no new institutions or competences were created. The Maastricht Treaty includes a general clause that economic policies should be treated as a matter of common concern and coordinated within the EU Council of Ministers. Member States are also required to run their economic policies in accordance with ECB’s primary goal of maintaining price stability. The underlying philosophy was to prevent what economists call “fiscal dominance”: namely, that the misguided policies of governments force the hand of the central bank, and hinder it from pursuing its objective: safeguarding price stability.  However, surveillance of economic policies rested chiefly on non-binding guidelines and recommendations. In 1997, this architecture was complemented by the Stability and Growth Pact, which foresaw binding commitments to fiscal rules, backed up by sanctions. These were however not enforced when cases of fiscal slippage arose later on, and not backed by sufficiently strong national fiscal institutions.  Outside the realm of fiscal policies, coordination was sought but no specific rules were foreseen. This is another weakness of the Maastricht framework: the absence of a surveillance mechanism for the timely detection of macroeconomic imbalances and their resolution. Those countries with a history of elevated inflation rates and exchange rate devaluations benefited, at the start of EMU, from unprecedented low levels of real interest rates. Over time, these led to wage and price increases that undermined competitiveness. This development showed up in increasingly deteriorating current account positions as well as in bubbles, particularly in the financial and real estate sectors, fuelled by capital flowing from countries with current account surpluses. When the bubbles burst after the global financial crisis of 2007, governments stepped in to support growth and some of them were called to rescue ailing banks. In this way, private indebtedness turned into public indebtedness, with disastrous fiscal consequences even for countries that had run fiscal surpluses prior to the crisis, such as Ireland and Spain, and even more for those that had not, such as Greece. A further shortcoming of the Maastricht framework was the inability to deal with what is now being called the “bank-sovereign nexus”. When systemically important banks run into trouble, governments are expected to step in and provide fiscal support to contain the spillovers. Beyond that, banks are typically the largest holders of government debt from their respective sovereigns. These ties, or nexus, between banks and their governments can lead to a dangerous downward spiral Another effect of this downward spiral, under way since the euro area crisis erupted in 2010, is the fragmentation of capital markets. The bank-sovereign nexus has led to a situation whereby cross-border lending of banks has gone down significantly, as banks retreat more and more to their domestic markets, encouraged by their shareholders and, sometimes, by 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  national banking supervisors. The crisis is undermining a key achievement of the euro, the integration of capital markets.  A fundamental problem of the Maastricht Treaty was its over-reliance on the assumption that market discipline and peer pressure would provide sufficient incentives for national policy-makers to conduct sound fiscal and economic policies. This did not prove to be the case. As Jacques de Larosière, the former IMF Managing Director, once remarked, what was supposed to be a system of “peer pressure” too often turned into a system of “peer concessions” or “peer arrangements”. On the whole, the Maastricht framework proved unable to deal adequately with the high degree of economic and financial integration in the euro area. It was not fully understood that sharing a currency means much more than sharing the same monetary policy. It is a commitment to ensuring sound fiscal, economic and financial conditions. Euro area countries largely overlooked the substantial spillover effects that national policy decisions would have on their fellow countries in EMU euro area partners. The ongoing crisis has brought these shortcomings into sharp focus. 3.  Short and longer-term solutions to the crisis: going beyond the Maastricht framework 3.1. The ECB’s contribution to resolving the crisis  Let me now turn to Europe’s policy response to the crisis. The EMU framework relies on a strict separation between monetary policy on the one hand, and fiscal and economic policies on the other. The monetary policy function is carried out by the ECB under a clear mandate: maintaining price stability over the medium term in the euro area. To achieve this goal, the ECB has been given full political and operational independence.  Since the start of the crisis, the ECB has reacted forcefully. Since 2008, it has lowered its policy rate from 4.25% to 0.75% now. However, the increasing fragmentation of capital markets which I described above, and which sometimes has led to a complete drying-up of certain financial market segments, has impaired the monetary transmission channel in the euro area. Monetary policy signals are no longer being transmitted properly to the real sector.  The divergence in bank funding conditions is certainly a key factor, in addition to the country-specific economic situation, in explaining the differences in bank lending rates to non-financial corporations across euro area countries. These divergences are leading to a weakening of the pass-through of monetary policy decisions in some euro area countries. For example, among the five largest euro area countries, the maximum difference between short-term lending rates to non-financial corporations (for short-term loans over €1 million) reached more than 100 basis points in recent months. Across all euro area countries, the dispersion of such lending rates is greater now than it has ever been. In other words, conventional monetary policy has lost its effectiveness in some parts of the euro area. For the ECB, the singleness of its monetary policy has been at stake. Against this background, the ECB has resorted to so-called non-standard measures to ensure the effective transmission of its monetary policy across the euro area. Without a properly functioning transmission channel for its monetary policy, the ECB’s capability to maintain price stability is at risk. The ECB has modified its allotment procedures and its collateral policy. It has also lowered the rate of the minimum reserve requirements and introduced very longer-term refinancing operations. Importantly, the ECB has also decided to resort to outright purchases of bonds on secondary markets. Following the so-called Securities Market Programme, which has now been terminated, the Governing Council of the ECB agreed at its meeting on 6 September on the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  modalities for undertaking Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in secondary markets for sovereign bonds in the euro area.  The OMTs will enable the ECB to address severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro. Monetary union is sometimes misunderstood as an exchange rate system which the participating countries can enter and leave, as was the case with the ERM. Such a perception of reversibility would imply that, ultimately, one euro would not be worth the same in different euro area countries. In other words, the single currency would no longer be single. This perception is fundamentally flawed. Let me be very clear: the Maastricht Treaty refers to the “irrevocable fixing of exchange rates” when a country enters monetary union. The euro is irrevocable. With the OMTs, under appropriate conditions, EMU will now have a fully effective backstop to avoid destructive scenarios with potentially severe consequences for price stability in the euro area. A necessary condition for the OMTs is that the country concerned adheres to strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate programme under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). IMF involvement will be sought for the design and monitoring of conditionality. The OMTs are an instrument in the ECB’s toolbox to help it fulfil its mandate, maintaining price stability. They will be conducive to the monetary authority restoring its power to control credit conditions in the euro area and, through that channel, inflation in the medium term. 3.2.  Government actions to fight the crisis Ultimately, however, the current crisis is the result of the lack of incentives in the Maastricht Treaty to pursue sound fiscal, economic and financial market policies. This can only be amended by the Member States, not by the ECB. The key to resolving the crisis thus lies first and foremost with governments, individually and jointly. Since the start of the crisis, the Member States have adopted a number of important measures to strengthen the institutional framework of EMU. A procedure for the surveillance of excessive macroeconomic imbalances has been established in order to detect and correct divergences at an early stage. In the case of non-adherence to agreed fiscal and economic rules, sanctions will be applied in a more automatic manner to reduce the potential for political interference and delay in the process. Further improvements are currently under consideration, such as the mandatory submission of draft national budgets to the group of euro area finance ministers – the so-called “Eurogroup” – for vetting before those budgets are submitted to national parliaments for adoption. The vetting should ensure that divergences from the fiscal rules can be identified and corrected at a very early stage. Moreover, earlier this year, 25 out of 27 EU Member States signed the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, more generally known as the Fiscal Compact. The Compact further improves the EMU framework by introducing a cyclically adjusted balanced-budget rule which the participating countries need to transpose into national legislation. Finally, a temporary crisis resolution mechanism was created, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which will remain active until July 2013 despite being replaced by a permanent organisation this autumn, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). With a combined maximum firepower of €700 billion, these two mechanisms will help to build effective firewalls to stem contagion from the crisis.  What has been achieved so far is impressive. Prior to the crisis, very few would have expected that Member States would reach a consensus on such fundamental changes in the way EMU works. But these changes are not enough. EMU now needs a longer-term vision to confront its challenges.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  3.3. The way ahead – deeper integration  In order to restore confidence, policy-makers in the euro area need to resolutely push ahead with fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and European institution-building. Recently, the President of the European Council, in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Eurogroup, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, put forward proposals for a genuine EMU.  The four Presidents are proposing that a genuine EMU should be built on integrated frameworks for budgetary policies, economic policies and financial market policies, which in turn must be underpinned by greater democratic legitimacy and accountability.  When we look at the options to establish budgetary policies in a monetary union, and exclude any uncoordinated conduct of fiscal policy by Member States, three possible models come to mind. First, there could be a fully-fledged fiscal union, with a central budget and federal debt issuance. It is not on the cards in the short run as important steps would need to be taken to establish the necessary euro area-wide political legitimacy and governance. The second model would involve sharing sovereignty on national fiscal policies, with reciprocal control of public expenditures serving as a basis for common debt issuance by governments. Such reciprocal control would also require strong democratic legitimacy, involving national parliaments. The third model would only rely on unqualified adherence to fiscal discipline by Member States, without risk-sharing. None of these three models alone is possible in the short run. There will be a combination of the three. The desirable mix has to be decided upon by the people of Europe with the appropriate democratic checks. EMU is a unique construct, tailored to European specificities, and it need not resemble any existing federation. Let me give some examples. First and foremost, euro area countries should regain their ability to save money for a rainy day by adhering to their fiscal commitments in the new framework of the Fiscal Compact. They have already agreed to limited mutual insurance through the EFSF/ESM. A centralised fiscal capacity could be considered too, provided it is not the basis for permanent transfers but is used to promote market integration and better resilience to economic shocks. For instance, a euro area unemployment insurance scheme could be set up, which would support much-needed cross-country labour mobility.  Indeed, an integrated economic policy framework is needed to boost economic integration and ensure that unsustainable policies do not jeopardise the stability of EMU. The framework should provide for a better enforcement of commitments to structural reforms, i.e. measures to increase a country’s competitiveness and its capacity to adjust to economic shocks. Structural reforms make EMU more robust. In addition, an integrated financial market framework is required in order to break the bank-sovereign nexus that threatens financial integration. This is another important element to make market-based risk sharing work effectively. While many euro area banks have benefited from the single currency, and significantly expanded their European business activities, they are still supervised at national level. Financial fragmentation, as I described above, has led to the perception that banks’ liabilities, even though they are nominally the same, are in fact different from one euro area country to another. This is not acceptable: the currency union has thus to be complemented by a banking union. At their summit in June, EU Member States entered into a political commitment, and the European Commission is now proposing to create a single supervisory mechanism for banks in the euro area and to entrust this task to the ECB. This single supervisory mechanism should be implemented in a way that does not compromise the ECB’s independence and does not constrain monetary policy. It should be complemented by a single regime to wind down failed banks and by a single resolution fund at euro area level. Finally, building a deeper EMU requires a strengthening of democratic legitimacy and accountability. The people of Europe will only accept a further pooling of competences at European level if European policy-makers are subject to high standards of accountability. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  The European Parliament, whose representatives are directly elected by citizens, already plays a central role in holding the ECB and other EU institutions to account. As a consequence of deeper economic and political integration in EMU, the euro area will become, in my view, more and more a “political space” in its own right and, as such, it will require proper euro area accountability mechanisms. Political legitimacy is vital to build popular support for further integration. 4. Conclusion  Ladies and Gentlemen, When Robert Schuman drafted the declaration that started the European integration process, he predicted that “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity”. When looking at Europe’s progress since the Second World War and the step-by-step building of EMU, we can indeed see that what holds Europe together, what has been its engine, and the reason for its success, is the notion of solidarity.  Solidarity is sometimes narrowed down to mean one-way support, from donor to recipient. Of course this has always been a key consideration in the European construction. The EU structural funds, which go to Europe’s poorer regions, are a very tangible measure of this kind of solidarity. Likewise, the European crisis mechanisms EFSF and ESM are a symbol of euro area solidarity. Solidarity is not just a catch-phrase in EMU; it is essential for all. Let me come back to Schuman’s insight that “concrete achievements first create a de facto solidarity”. We have reached a point in the history of Europe where de facto solidarity has created a need for concrete achievements. In recent years we have made impressive progress in putting EMU’s architecture on a sounder footing. The euro area countries now need to continue on their path of policy reform and to strengthen their governance. The report of the four Presidents in October will provide further guidance in this regard. If these efforts are maintained, I am confident that the crisis will be overcome. Thank you for your attention.

Shri Kailash Singh, Managing Director, Tefla’s, Shri Ramesh Abhishek, Chairman, Forward Market Commission, Dr. D. Bhalla, Joint Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India, Shri. Sushil Goenka and Vijay Datta of the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India, Shri. Sandeep Bajoria, Chairman, Globoil Organising Committee, Shri. Dinesh Shahra, Dr. B. V. Mehta and other leaders from the edible oil and agri-commodity trade industries, and distinguished delegates, both from India and abroad. It is indeed a pleasure to interact with people from the agribusiness world, especially at a time when the demand for food items are rising and is expected to continue to rise for several years from now. I am sure people here who have greater exposure and expertise can elucidate in much better way the ground level facts about the current rise in food prices, particularly that of edible oil and challenges that lie ahead in countries like India which are net importers of edible oil. I thank both Globoil India and Tefla’s for inviting me. I wish to congratulate Globoil India on its 16th Anniversary – a long enough period for an organisation to grow out from infancy and reach adulthood. Around 50 per cent of India’s domestic consumption of edible oil is met through imports and India has an import share of more than 15 per cent in the world market. Given this, Globoil has an important role to play and I wish them all the best in their efforts. I hope the proceedings of this event would help in improving domestic productivity, availability and marketing efficiency of edible oils.  Taking a broader and generalised view of your industry, I shall be looking at the role of agribusiness in growth of the economy as well as inflation management. In particular, I would be discussing the importance and potential of supply chain management in the evolving scenario.  Growth and inflation – role of agribusiness Before discussing the role of agribusiness in growth and inflation, it would be apposite to define and understand the concept of agribusiness. Way back in 1957, Davis and Goldberg1 had defined agribusiness very lucidly as the sum total of all operations involved in the manufacture and distribution of farm supplies; production operations on the farm; and the storage, processing and distribution of farm commodities and items made from them. Thus, agribusiness essentially encompasses today, the functions which the term agriculture denoted 150 years ago and agriculture now is a subset of the larger superset called agribusiness.  As far as growth and inflation is concerned, you may be aware that the weights attached to objective of growth vis-à-vis that of price stability in choice of policy measures vary according to the extant macroeconomic environment. For example, during the Great Moderation, the policies all over the world were focussed on growth enhancing measures. Presently, in view of the continuance of low inflation and low or negative growth in the developed economies, the policy measures, mainly in the form of liquidity enhancement and low interest rates, continue to focus on augmentation of growth.                                                 1 Quoted from King, Robert P., Michael Boehlje, Michael Cook, and Steven T. Sonka (2010) “Agribusiness Economics and Management”, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Special Issue Commemorating the Centennial of the AAEA, Vol.92, No.2, April 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In India, however, the conditions are very different. Along with economic slowdown, inflation is ruling significantly above the threshold level, beyond which inflation turns inimical to growth. Under the current macroeconomic environment, Indian policy makers have to think of various measures that can simultaneously achieve the twin objectives of higher growth and lower inflation. Opinions differ on the utility of different policy measures at the current juncture and you all may be familiar with the current debate on the timing, sequencing and complementarity of various measures. There is, however, near unanimity, amongst all that agriculture and agribusiness growth is a necessary prerequisite for moderation of inflation, particularly food inflation, as well as for acceleration and sustenance of inclusive growth.  The impact of agribusiness on inflation is also both direct and indirect. The direct impact of agribusiness is visible in the form of food inflation. With demand arising from increasing population and prosperity outstripping the growth of agricultural output, food inflation is likely to persist at the global level for the next several years. OECD-FAO has predicted that a grim global food inflation outlook could continue in the next ten years. The OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2011–20 indicates that food prices may be higher in real terms over the five years 2015–20. For example, prices of oil seeds are projected to be higher by 36 per cent relative to the levels prevailed during the five year period 1998–2003.2 High prices at global level limit the use of imports as a tool for our domestic inflation management. Even when global prices are low, the import option is limited as mere news of entry of a large consumer like India entering the global market can spike up prices. Further, higher imports would only add to the pressure on our already high current account deficit. The indirect impact of agribusiness on inflation is reflected in the rise in cost of living arising from high food inflation leading to higher wages, which, in turn, contributes to generalised inflation through higher cost of production. This may trigger a wage-price spiral. Hence, though food inflation or at least spike in food inflation is normally a supply side phenomenon, it is monitored very closely and remains one of the most difficult challenges for the central banks. The Reserve Bank is presently grappling with this challenge of high food inflation as often monetary policy has to act as the first line of defence, even if it is a persistent supply side issue. However, managing food inflation from a medium-term perspective would include measures to increase production, improve productivity and enhance efficiency of supply chain management.  On the growth front, while service sector has been driving growth for the past several years, acceleration of growth of the economy and its sustenance at higher level critically hinges on the performance of agriculture sector in terms of supply of food and food products, employment of large section of population and providing a large and growing demand base for the other segments of the economy, viz., industry and services. Given the strong backward and forward linkages of agribusiness with both the industrial and services sector, this sector not only directly contributes to growth but also facilitates growth in the rest of the economy. Also, the growth of agribusiness has the potential to generate gainful employment within the farm sector, which could help in reducing the incidence of underemployment and disguised unemployment in agriculture. The role of agribusiness has become even more important in the context of the challenges that global economy faces in enhancing food production to cater to increasing demand for food, fuel and feed. OECD-FAO estimates3 suggest that with world population touching 9 billion by 2050, agricultural production will need to increase by 60 per cent over the next 40 years to meet the rising demand for food. Additional one billion tonnes of cereals and 200 million tonnes of meat a year has to be produced by the year 2050 as compared with 2005–07 levels. The demand for bio-fuel production is also expected to double. Increased                                                 2 OECD-FAO Agricultural Price Outlook: http://www.oecd.org/site/oecd-faoagriculturaloutlook/ 3 OECD FAO Food and Agricultural Outlook: 2012–2021 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  demand for meat and meat products also require additional agricultural feedstocks. Given the limited scope for expanding farmland area around the world and problems of soil degradation and water scarcity, apart from over exploitation of fish stocks, augmenting agricultural production has become a major challenge. Global warming, climate change and extreme weather conditions have added further uncertainties. Increases in food prices across the globe have become a major issue in recent years. The spike in global food prices that was witnessed during the period 2004–08 had significant welfare consequences in terms of millions of people pushed into poverty and hunger. The increase in prices was witnessed in almost all the major commodities and edible oils have been no exception. Though prices have been volatile in recent period, the forecasts suggest that the prices could continue a secular upward trend, which could put pressure on inflation (Chart 1). This is a critical issue for a country like India which is a major importer of edible oils. Also, it has been observed that in India, the domestic prices are significantly impacted by the trends in global prices of edible oils.  Incidentally, during the current year so far, inflation at the retail level in oils and fats has been higher than at the wholesale level (Chart 2). While this phenomenon can be attributed to a number of factors, improvement in supply change management will certainly help in narrowing the gap. Also, the price trends at retail level indicate that the price paid by final consumer for the edible oil differs significantly across major cities within the country (Chart 3). While some part of this divergence could be attributed to factors like transportation cost and state specific taxes as well as quality of product, the difference of such magnitude also point towards issues related to supply chain which is critical in a country like India which has a large domestic market.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches     Hence, I shall now turn to the supply chain through which farm products move to reach the final consumers and need to be upgraded in view of the growing challenges mentioned earlier.  Supply chain management and agribusiness It has been observed that there is a wide divergence between the farm gate prices and retail prices of various food items. The usual reference to 1-2-3-4 in supply chain is quite well known, where what the producer sells for one rupee, by the time it reaches the final 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  consumer fetches four rupees due to the presence of intermediaries. The recently appointed Inter-Ministerial Group4 on Inflation has emphasised on the need to cut down the margin between farm gate prices and retail price. Improving supply chain is beneficial both for the producer and final consumer as producers would get remunerative price for his produce and consumer would be benefitted from the lower price. Therefore, increasing efficiency of supply chain could help in bringing food inflation down and increase the efficiency of our food markets and make our agriculture sector sustainable and viable.  A well-known feature of current structure of food inflation is the sharp rise in prices of protein food items. These comprise perishable items such as milk, eggs, meat, fish, vegetables and fruits – all of which require advanced and effective supply chain management.  Different aspects of agribusiness and the supply chain are undergoing transformation which is likely to continue in future. Emphasis on processing, trading and marketing is going to increase over time. Demand for protein rich and other high value food like fruits, vegetables, edible oil and livestock products are increasing. Demand for high quality, safe and convenient (frozen, pre-cut, pre-cooked and ready-to-eat) foods is rising. Meeting these demands emanating from within the country and from the growing Indian diaspora through more efficient supply chain management is expected to facilitate growth and moderate inflation.  Supply chain management and agricultural business are integral part of agricultural marketing system. Efficient supply chain and business models are necessary for creating efficient agricultural market which delivers agricultural produce from the farmer to the consumer in the most efficient way. While output and productivity are supply side factors, markets provide an intermediate link between producers and final demand by consumers. Efficiently functioning markets add to welfare of producers as well as consumers. Efficient agricultural markets can also be a potent tool for poverty reduction.  Agricultural markets in India, in particular the supply chain management and business models, are inefficient. In India, farmers’ produce is generally disposed of in the village, rural/primary market or secondary agricultural market. The challenges facing supply-chain management and agribusiness in India can be broadly classified into three, namely, 1) lack of accessibility to regulated markets, 2) lack of competitition under the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, and 3) absence of a nationwide common agriculture market. These are challenges that run across the various channels through which the supply-chain and agribusiness models operate. These channels are (i) Producer-Consumer, (ii) Producer-Retailer-Consumer, (iii) Producer-Wholesaler-Retailer-Consumer, (iv) Producer-Commission agent-Wholesaler-Retailer-Consumer and (v) Producer-Village Merchant-Wholesaler-Retailer-Consumer. Agriculture markets in India are regulated through the model APMC Acts. The number of regulated (secondary) agricultural markets stood at 7,157 as of March 2010 as compared to just 286 in 1950. There are also about 22,221 rural periodical markets, about 15 per cent of which function under the ambit of APMC regulation.5 The model APMC Act allows States to collect market fees from the buyers/traders on the sale of notified agricultural produce which are generally high. The high incidence of commission charges on agricultural/horticultural produce renders marketing cost high. There are other charges like entry tax/octroi tax that vary across states as well as across commodities. These charges prevent the emergence of a nationwide common market for agricultural produce. Moreover, restrictions on the movement of goods under the Essential Commodities Act remain in place in various states.                                                 4  Position Paper No.1 from the IMG on Inflation http://finmin.nic.in/workingpaper/IMG%20on%20Inflation.pdf 5 Average area served by a market is 115 sq. km while an average area served by a regulated market is 454 sq km. According to recommendations by National Farmers Commission, availability of Markets should be within 5 km radius (approx. 80 sq km). 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  These had inhibited free access of agriculture markets. Most of the agricultural markets are also characterised by dominance of cash based transactions where issues of cash management also become important. Also, there are issues of weights and measurements as well as the presence of brokers and commission agents. There is reason to believe that regulatory barriers have constrained investments in development of storage and processing facilities, hampered the development of effective institutions, and lowered the capacity of agricultural producers to be internationally competitive. India, for example, is the world’s largest producer of fruit and vegetables but it has been estimated that inadequate post-harvest storage and transportation cause losses of around 30–40 per cent, only 7 per cent value addition takes place, and only about 2 per cent of production is processed commercially. Road connectivity, development of horticulture, dairying & other animal husbandry activities and expansion of cash crops, which provide the necessary wherewithal for greater access of the farm sector to market oriented agriculture are still lacking in the country. This is particularly important for the segment of “high value” agriculture, where demand pressures are going to be most intense in the coming years, and major investments will be needed in the development of efficient value chains to save on high wastages and intermediation costs. The inadequate facilities for storage of products also results in considerable seasonal fluctuations in the prices of products.  The country needs a single point market fee system for facilitating free movement of produce, bringing price stabilization, and reducing price differences between the producer and consumer market segments. Use of Information & Communications Technology (ICT) solutions (for example, pre-paid card based payments at octroi posts) would facilitate easy movement of agricultural produce. Besides boosting productivity on a sustained basis, cleaning, grading and packaging of agricultural produce, would have to be popularized for greater market penetration. The current fragmented marketing system and lack of infrastructure are the serious constraints to the efficient functioning and competitiveness of supply chains in India. An efficient supply chain would need to integrate the supply chain with the value chain wherein at each stage within the chain, significant value addition takes place. It is essential to link the farmers with the markets with state-of-art infrastructure. Effective linkage can help remove the constraints of logistics, quality maintenance and thus, help in efficient access, delivery, price discovery and compete with global products. Linking small primary producers with markets can help improve the livelihoods for millions of poor in India. Banking and bank finance also plays a critical role in the entire agribusiness chain. As a result a broad consensus has emerged about the need for reforms in agricultural market policies and important reform measures have been implemented in recent years, as part of the ongoing policy reform process in India, such as, amendments to the APMC Act as also the recent initiative to allow Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the retail sector. At a more specific level, introduction of negotiable warehouse receipt system, the scheme of bank financing against such receipts, establishment of Warehouse Development & Regulatory Authority (WDRA) and guarantee support scheme up to ten years for construction of warehouses/storage facilities would provide much needed fillip to efficient marketing management and price risk reduction for the producers. Further, the disbursements under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) administered by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) with a special earmarking of ₹50 billion for the year 2012–13 for developing cold storage and warehousing facilities in rural areas would also provide boost to infrastructure development for marketing efficiency. External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) for infrastructure to cover cold storages has also been allowed. Considering the need to boost the supply and value chains in certain critical agricultural products that have significant implications for both the producers and the consumers, NABARD has initiated a few pilot programmes on supply chain development for potato in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, onion in Maharashtra and tomato in Punjab and Haryana. These projects, which would involve the banks, the State Governments and the research institutes, are comprehensive in nature and are expected to help the farmers in better 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  sorting/packaging, warehousing and marketing apart from helping at the production stage by adopting better agricultural practices, involving quality inputs and R&D support. Measures to improve supply chain The suggestions from various policy documents to strengthen the supply chain can be classified into: 1) enhancing the capabilities of farmers, 2) strengthening infrastructure, and 3) legislative interventions. By encouraging farmers to organise themselves into groups – growers’ groups, co-operatives, self-help groups, joint liability groups, and producer companies given the preponderance of small and marginal farmers in our country – supply chains can be streamlined as well as made more egalitarian. Recently, NABARD has set up Producers Organization Development Fund (PODF), which could play a catalytic role in this regard. Also, investments across the entire agro-value chain spectrum, such as creation of cold chains, rural godowns, new agricultural marketing infrastructure, and modernisation of existing markets could be promoted by providing them fiscal incentives. As suggested by the Inter-Ministerial Group on Inflation, perishables could be taken out of the ambit of the APMC Act to encourage arbitrage activity by small traders and farmers by allowing them to freely trade perishables through buying where it is cheap and selling where it is expensive. Similarly from the long-term perspective of inflation management, it is crucial to improve mandi governance with focus on transparency and efficiency by holding regular elections of agricultural produce market committees as well as to bring professionalism into the functioning of the existing regulated markets through public private partnership. Analysis of international market developments reveals that encouraging large scale integrated players to develop the supply chains in various commodities with latest technology infrastructure is the right approach suitable for Indian conditions. The existing system of fragmented handling of various supply chains should be converted into integrated handling systems so as to ensure better realisation to the farmers. Contract farming and supermarket procurement arrangements are two supply chain arrangements that are gaining ground amid active debate in India. Recent experience in India indicates that contract farming and supermarket procurement approaches will have to involve small-scale farmers in the medium term, because the farm structure obliges them to do so. Initiatives like the one in Argentina by the company El Tejar where the small and marginal farmers are pooled together by taking the land on rent and providing them wage employment could be experimented. In some countries, public-private partnerships have been instrumental to the success of new supply chain arrangements, for example, in providing extension and technical assistance to improve the quality and safety of produce and accreditation of farmers. The country needs a convergence platform at national, state and district level where private players join hands with large number of farmers through various ongoing schemes and programmes of Central and State Governments in a PPP mode. Approaches to promote equitable participation by large-and small-scale farmers who constitute more than 80 per cent of the rural farming community would include:  • Facilitating entry and competition among buyers, for example, improving the rural infrastructure or establishing collection centers to reduce the transaction costs involved in sourcing from small scale farmers;  • Organizing farmers into formal or informal groups to meet the volume requirements and strengthen farmers’ bargaining power;  • Reforms in tenancy laws and legalizing tenancy farming to facilitate establishment of production rights and credit flow; • Enhancing farmers’ capacity to adopt improved production and post-harvest techniques to meet the required higher quality standards; • Assisting farmers to obtain the capital, in addition to short-term production loans given by banks, to make on-farm improvements and other required investments, for 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  example, micro-irrigation, greenhouse, grading, or cooling facilities and acquire essential national and international certifications;  • Efficient dissemination of market information to the producers by leveraging ICT (for example, mobile phone based market information propagation);  • Training farmers and buyers about their rights and obligations under contract farming arrangement and in the design of contracts; and  • Developing institutions that assist farmers to settle contract disputes, such as, commodity or market associations.  • The Working Group of the 12th Five Year Plan on “Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure, Secondary Agriculture and Policy Required for Internal and External Trade”6 has identified the following models of agriculture marketing that should be emphasized during the Plan period viz., a) greater responsibility to producer organizations; b) direct linkage with retailers/processors/exporters; c) price discovery through virtual market platform; d) direct marketing; e) organized retailing and removing restrictions on FDI for greater competition; f) market access for small producers; g) reforms in APMC Act; h) integrated value chain system covering even areas like partnership, information and communication technologies, leveraging networks, value chain financing, smallholder policy, and contracts; i) promotion of innovative marketing models for effective market participation, and j) PPP for efficiency and effectiveness.  Finally, in the context of the role of public distribution system in cereals also needs to undergo a transformation. There are two opposing views on the desirable strategy of the PDS system. According to some, PDS should play a stabilising role by releasing stocks when food prices are high, particularly during periods characterised by supply chain manipulation. However, there are others who opine that the PDS dilutes competitive market forces and the government instead should focus on removal of supply chain rigidities. Given this rise in demand due to urbanisation and migration, higher per capita incomes, changing dietary habits, on one hand, and the huge costs and leakages associated with PDS, on the other, it is considered desirable and imperative for competitive market forces to play an increasingly greater role over time. The proposed alternatives to PDS like cash transfers/food coupons would also be effective only with the presence of a well integrated supply chain. Otherwise, the supply chain manipulation could lead to exploitation of cash transfer beneficiaries and could have implications for food inflation.  Concluding remarks I would like to conclude by saying that the world is destined to struggle with shortage of supply of agricultural commodities vis-à-vis the growing demand for several years. The pressure would be reflected, among others, in rising prices. Apart from raising agricultural productivity, improvement in management of supply chain would be critical for sustenance of overall economic growth and for prevention of runaway rise in prices. Diversification into non-traditional areas like biofuels, polymers, pharmaceutical/health products and feed for poultry and diary to meet growing demand for protein food has major implications for supply chain. Increase in complexity and decentralisation of agribusiness organizations would guide the future changes in supply chains. It would also entail the need for development of new concepts and techniques. I hope you all would deliberate on these issues and suggest the way ahead.                                                 6 Report of the “Working Group On Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Secondary Agriculture and Policy Required For Internal And External Trade For The Xii Five Year Plan 2012–17” http://planningcommission. nic.in/aboutus/committee/wrkgrp12/agri/weg_rep_market.pdf

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Hirohide Yamaguchi: Economic slowdown and monetary easing Speech by Mr Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Asian Affairs Research Council, Tokyo, 24 September 2012. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak at the Asian Affairs Research Council special lecture in front of distinguished members who are active in a wide range of areas. For half a century since 1964, the Council has been, through its various kinds of research and studies about the Asia and Pacific region, contributing to the deepening of mutual understanding and harmonious development of the region. The year 1964 was when the Tokyo Olympics were held and when Japan joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Japan’s trade balance turned into a clear surplus from that year and continued to be in surplus for 47 years up to 2010. The year 1964 could be said as a milestone for Japan’s economy. In September 1964, the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group were held in Tokyo. Half a century since then, Japan’s economy has grown significantly and, amid globalization, a linkage between Japan and the rest of the world has been further closely interrelated. In the week after next, from Tuesday, October 9, the Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group will be held in Tokyo for the second time. The Bank of Japan, together with the Ministry of Finance, is preparing for the Meetings as a host country. About 20 thousand participants and concerned parties from all over the world are expected to join, and many conferences and seminars on the global economy, financial systems and other various issues are to be held. In order to let people know further about Japan’s economy, the best way is to let them actually see Japan. I believe many of you are already planning to participate, and hope that you will seize the opportunity for a lively exchange of views. Today I will talk under the theme of the “Economic Slowdown and Monetary Easing.” In the first half, I will present an overview of the current state and outlook for the global economy and Japan’s economy. In the second half, based on such things about the economies at home and abroad, I will explain the Bank of Japan’s conduct of monetary policy. To summarize the thrust of my speech in advance, there are five points. First, looking at overseas economies, due to the effects of the European debt problem, business sentiment has become cautious in many countries and regions, mainly in the manufacturing sector, and the economies have moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase. Future uncertainty remains high. Second, in considering the background to the slowdown in overseas economies, it might be better not to focus only on the effects of the European debt problem, but to view from a broader perspective. Namely, we need to have the following big picture in mind. During the period up to the mid-2000s of the so-called Great Moderation, a bubble was generated in advanced countries and they are still suffering from the balance-sheet adjustments after the burst of the bubble. In emerging economies, as an excess supply capacity of a low cost labor force, which was a factor in supporting the Great Moderation, becoming low, it has become difficult to simultaneously achieve economic growth and price stability. Third, Japan’s economy registered relatively high growth in the first half of 2012, but the pick-up in economic activity has come to a pause, reflecting the weak developments in overseas economies. Economic activity is expected to level off more or less for the time being. Fourth, in response to a weaker outlook for economic activity, the Bank of Japan further enhanced monetary easing at the Monetary Policy Meeting held last week so that the future economy will not deviate from the orbit of “returning to the sustainable growth path with price stability.” Fifth, in order for Japan’s economy to 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  overcome deflation, in addition to such support from the financial side, it is important to make efforts to strengthen growth potential and take advantage of accommodative financial conditions. After explaining those issues, I will answer to some of the questions raised about this time’s monetary easing. I. Current state and outlook for overseas economies Let me start with the current state of the global economy. Overseas economies have moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase. While the global economy has been on a deceleration phase, it seems that the extent of deceleration has recently increased mainly in manufacturers in many countries and regions. Current state of the European economy The European economy is currently in a deceleration phase. Three years have already passed since concern over the government debt was recognized in international financial and capital markets, and, at present, the problem has not been limited to Greece, Portugal, and Ireland, which have already been receiving support from the European Union (EU) and the IMF but also spread over to major southern European countries, including Spain and Italy. In those countries, due to a rise in government bond yields, namely, a decline in government bond prices, financial institutions’ assets have deteriorated, which has led to a rise in funding costs and instability of financial positions. As a result, financial conditions surrounding firms and households have worsened, posing pressure to suppress economic activity. Such deterioration in the real economy and concern over the financial systems have been fed back to the fiscal problem through a decline in revenue and an increase in support for financial institutions. In such a way, in Europe, a vicious cycle of public finance, the financial system, and the real economy has been at work, mainly in peripheral countries. Therefore, the stagnation in the European economy has been protracted, and that has recently been spread to core countries, including Germany, mainly in terms of business sentiment. The growth rate of the euro area economy has been negative for three consecutive quarters. In the meantime, the European authorities have been taking various policy measures. In July, a financial support measure to inject public funds into Spanish financial institutions was compiled, and in the beginning of September, the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a new program to purchase government bonds with a maturity of between one and three years, with no ex ante quantitative limits on the size of purchases. However, in starting purchases of government bonds, the ECB is going to make some conditions. For example, the issuer countries of bonds to be purchased will have to accept monitoring by the EU and the IMF on the progress of fiscal consolidation. Thanks to those various policy responses, stability has been maintained in interbank funding markets, and investors’ risk aversion has abated somewhat in international financial and capital markets as a whole. The policy responses by the ECB and other policy authorities are indispensable for containing the vicious cycle of public finance, the financial system, and the real economy. However, in order to resolve the European debt problem fundamentally, it is necessary for countries whose fiscal sustainability has been a cause for concern to make some progress in meeting the challenges such as fiscal consolidation, strengthening medium- to long-term growth potential, and reinforcing the stability of the financial system. In addition, for Europe as a whole, integrating fiscal policy and banking supervision of the nations is an unavoidable challenge. None of these challenges is easy to meet and thus it is likely that high uncertainty will continue to surround future progress. Speaking of risks associated with the European debt problem, there is a risk that stagnation in the real economy might become protracted under the vicious cycle of public finance, the financial system, and the real economy, and there is a risk that a financial crisis might occur due to concern over the financial system. Put simply about the recent developments in 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Europe, it can be summarized that the risk that stagnation in the real economy, including the spillover to core countries, might become protracted has still been large, while the risk that a financial crisis might occur has subsided due to various policy responses. Current state of the U.S. economy Let me turn to the United States. The U.S. economy has been on a modest recovery trend with a moderate increase in private consumption, including automobile sales, and signs of a pick-up in the housing market. However, there have been weak developments. Improvement in employment has been slow and, amid economic adjustment in Europe being protracted, business sentiment, mainly of manufacturers operating globally, has recently become cautious and an increase in business fixed investment has been slowing. Against such a backdrop, the Federal Reserve has recently decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and changed the outlook for the duration in which exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted, from “at least through late 2014” to “at least through mid-2015.” In addition, it has decided to purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by governmental financial institutions, called agency MBS, at a pace of 40 billion dollars per month until the outlook for the labor market improves substantially in a context of price stability. In the United States, while balance-sheet adjustments due to the burst of a housing bubble have been progressing to a certain degree, it has steadfastly remained. In such a situation, in addition to the effects of the European debt problem, there are no prospects for a solution to the so-called fiscal cliff problem and there is an increasing awareness about uncertainty of fiscal consolidation over time. Those factors are likely to continue to constrain economic activity for the time being through growing cautiousness in household and business sentiment. While the U.S. economy is expected to continue recovering partly supported by accommodative financial conditions, the pace of recovery for the time being is likely to be only moderate. Current state of the Chinese economy Next is China. While the Chinese economy has been growing at a relatively high rate, the state of slowdown has become protracted. It has been pointed out that, in the background, there are a slowdown in exports to Europe and a deceleration in private real estate investment due to the effects of past monetary tightening and policy measures to control real estate transactions. With final demand at home and abroad declining, pressure for inventory adjustments in the raw material industry and a wide range of areas has recently been increasing, which has been spreading to production in the manufacturing industry. In China, as the authorities were taking policy responses, including monetary easing and advancement of infrastructure investment, the economy was considered to gradually accelerate the pace of growth if those effects would manifest themselves. While I believe such a scenario is still maintained, the slowdown has been lingering longer than expected and it is certain that the time when economic activity gets out of the state of slowdown will be deferred. While it is due mainly to greater-than-expected stagnation in the European economy, which is the largest trading partner, there might be a more structural problem. One is that the policy authorities seem to be hesitant about stepping on the gas pedal toward economic growth. That might be due to a bitter experience that a large-scale fiscal spending and monetary easing after the Lehman shock led to a rise in prices and a surge in real estate prices. A simultaneous achievement of both economic growth and price stability is a common challenge to many emerging and commodity-exporting economies, which I will talk about in detail later. Another reason might be that, in China, as a result of continued growth for a long period led largely by public investment and business fixed investment, industries, mainly the raw material industry, have been carrying a structural problem of excessive investment, and the balance between supply and demand has been prone to be lost. In the process of China’s transition from high growth to sustainable growth, an 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  answer to the question on how to change the balance between investment and consumption, domestic and external demand, urban and rural areas, and coastal and inland areas is yet to be found, and that might have been increasing uncertainty about the future economic activity. Overall picture of the global economy While I have explained Europe, the United States, and China, respectively, that will not suffice to see the overall picture of the global economy. There are other elements, including challenges advanced countries are commonly faced with and challenges emerging economies are faced with, that should be understood in the overall picture of the global economy. In order to consider the challenges common to advanced countries, let us go back to the period up to the mid-2000s, which was called the “Great Moderation.” At that time, as various favorable factors including a rise in emerging economies and technological innovation in finance overlapped, extremely favorable economic conditions of high growth, low inflation, and low interest rates continued for a long period. Against such a backdrop, an optimistic view on the economic outlook spread globally and an investment boom and a boost of demand for consumer durables surfaced in the United States and Europe. On the financial front, financial institutions’ risk-taking attitude became aggressive, and a rapid bloat in credit and a rapid increase in leverage took place. In short, an excess was generated both on the real economy and financial front, and such excesses were finally corrected by the Lehman shock. Subsequently, the experience the United States, Europe, and other advanced countries had is that, once a large-scale bubble bursts and a financial crisis occurs, economic adjustment becomes protracted and, in the meantime, the economy is forced to grow at a low rate – a phenomenon repeated over and over in history. In the United States, substantial impairment of households’ balance sheets due mainly to the subprime mortgage problem has made a recovery in the U.S. economy a sluggish one. In Europe, amid an optimistic mood called “europhoria,” which is a word coined by combining “euro” with “euphoria,” loose fiscal management in Greece and excessive real estate investment in southern Europe took place, and left a severe problem in the balance sheets of the governments and financial institutions. In the process of balance-sheet adjustments, economic activity will not recover as wished. An economy that is unlikely to accelerate and remains vulnerable to the downside will continue for a long period. Without recognizing that fact, frustrations of “why the growth rate is not increasing despite those policy responses” or “why the unemployment rate does not decline” are prone to surface. It seems that both the United States and Europe are yet to identify “a normal pace of economic growth” in the balance-sheet adjustment process. That seems to have induced difficult problems of heightening expectations for economic policy and social unrest or dissatisfaction. While it might be somewhat too much to say, from such a viewpoint, there is in a sense a commonality among dissatisfaction among young people in Spain for a high unemployment rate, demonstrations against fiscal austerity in Greece, and repeated conflicts on fiscal management in the United States. At least, resulting increased reliance on central banks in the United States and Europe is an obvious tendency. In the meantime, China and other emerging economies were affected by a plunge in advanced economies immediately after the Lehman shock, but they subsequently restored growth at an early stage on the back of buoyant domestic demand and have been growing at somewhat high rates. The continued capital inflow to emerging economies, while advanced countries have been continuing monetary easing and providing ample funds, seems to have also been boosting domestic demand in emerging economies. Recently, contribution to the global economic growth by advanced countries has been declining markedly and that by emerging economies has been increasing. According to the IMF, the proportion of 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  advanced countries and emerging economies in world GDP has shifted substantially from “7 to 3” to “5 to 5” in the past 30 years. While emerging economies have been leading the global economy, they have been faced with a new challenge after the Lehman shock. That is a simultaneous achievement of high growth and price stability. One important element that supported the “Great Moderation” was a dramatic increase in the world’s supply capacity due to emerging economies’ industrialization on the back of an ample and inexpensive labor force. However, demand in emerging economies increased accordingly and that resulted in putting constant upward pressure on commodity prices and food prices. In addition, for example in China, while development in inland areas has progressed, a mechanism, in which an increase in the labor force was covered by a population inflow from rural to urban areas, has recently been changing. As a labor population as a whole is expected to decline in the future, labor supply will become more prone to fall short than in the past, and inflationary pressure might also stem from that aspect. At present, in response to the pressure of economic slowdown from Europe and other advanced countries, emerging economies have been taking policy responses, including monetary easing, but it has been difficult to take drastic measures as the economy has been susceptible to inflationary pressure. There is uncertainty as to when those policy effects will surface in emerging economies and the pace of growth will accelerate. As crop prices have recently been surging, a simultaneous achievement of economic growth and price stability is likely to continue to be a challenge for emerging economies. In such way, the global economy has moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase, with the effects of the European debt problem combined with unique factors various countries and regions have been involved in – namely, a great challenge of balance-sheet adjustments in advanced countries and that of searching for a sustainable growth path in emerging economies. As mentioned earlier, with the U.S. economy continuing to recover moderately and policy effects gradually surfacing in the Chinese economy, the global economy is likely to get out of a deceleration phase, but the exit has been deferred. II.  Current state and challenges of Japan’s economy Let me move on to Japan’s economy. As I have just explained, overseas economies have moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase. As a result, exports and industrial production have been relatively weak. The month-on-month rate of change in real exports has been negative for four consecutive months since May due to a weakness in exports to Europe and China, and, against such a backdrop, industrial production declined again in July relative to the April-June quarter, following a decline in the April-June quarter relative to the previous one. On the other hand, domestic demand has been resilient mainly supported by reconstruction-related demand. Public investment has been clearly increasing and business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend with an improvement in corporate profits. Private consumption has been resilient with improving employment and housing investment has generally been picking up. However, there have recently been somewhat weak indicators in private consumption. While that is partly due to a weather factor, a sluggish pace of growth in overtime wages mainly in the manufacturing industry due to weak production and a decline in summer bonuses might have contributed to constraining consumption from the income side. While an application for receiving subsidies for eco-friendly cars ended at the end of last week, last minute demand was not observed. That was partly because efforts by car sellers after ending of the application, including a rebate in place of the subsidies and the release of popular fuel-efficient new-models, had been anticipated, but it perhaps should be interpreted as a sign that pre-consumption of future demand has reached its limit. As for business fixed investment, while it is likely to continue increasing as a trend, attention should be paid to whether there are any effects of a global deterioration in business sentiment. While domestic demand as a whole is likely to maintain its firmness, it might be difficult to expect domestic demand to 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  have power to offset the weakness in external demand and further elevate economic activity. As explained, Japan’s economy registered relatively high growth in the first half of 2012, supported by the firmness in domestic demand, but the pick-up in economic activity has come to a pause, reflecting the developments in overseas economies. Economic activity is expected to level off more or less for the time being. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices excluding volatile food has been around 0 percent and was minus 0.3 percent in July as the earlier fall in crude oil prices has been exerting downward pressure. The year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices is expected to remain at around 0 percent for the time being. Regarding risks, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the global economy, including the European debt problem, the momentum toward a recovery in the U.S. economy, and a simultaneous achievement of price stability and economic growth in emerging and commodity-exporting economies. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the effects of financial and foreign exchange market developments on economic activity and prices. III.  The bank’s conduct of monetary policy Comprehensive Monetary Easing Based on the state of the economy at home and abroad, let me turn to the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy. The Bank recognizes that Japan’s economy faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation and returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability, and has been pursuing powerful monetary easing. As powerful monetary easing is pursued within the framework of Comprehensive Monetary Easing, let me first briefly explain the framework. It was October 2010 when Comprehensive Monetary Easing was introduced and about two years have passed since then. The basic reason for the introduction was, amid the policy rate virtually becoming 0 percent, to further generate easing effects. The specifics of the framework were as follows. First, the Bank has been encouraging the policy rate of the overnight rate in the uncollateralized call market, namely, an interest rate of a quite short-term of one-day borrowing, to move at around 0 to 0.1 percent, which can be said as virtually 0 percent. Second, the Bank introduced financial assets purchasing program named an Asset Purchase Program (hereafter referred to as “the Program”) and under the Program has been purchasing short-term and long-term government securities as well as a wide range of risk assets, such as commercial paper (CP), corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). That has been a measure, through influencing longer-term interest rates and risk premiums, to urge the effects of monetary easing to spread steadily over to firms’ funding costs. Third, the Bank has been aiming at 1 percent in terms of the year-on-year growth rate in consumer prices for the time being and made a commitment to continuing its powerful monetary easing through the pursuit of virtually zero interest rate policy and purchases of financial assets until it judges the 1 percent goal to be in sight. By a central bank making a commitment to continuing monetary easing for a long period, there will be momentum for pushing down the entire yield curve, including longer term yields. Background to the enhancement of monetary easing At the Monetary Policy Meeting held last week, the Bank further enhanced monetary easing. Specifically, first, the Bank decided to increase the total size of the Program by about 10 trillion yen, from about 70 trillion yen to about 80 trillion yen. The completion of the purchases under the Program was extended for six months and the purchases will continue until around the end of 2013. Second, the Bank decided to remove the minimum bidding 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  yield, which used to be set at 0.1 percent per annum, for the outright purchases in order to ensure smooth purchase of the Japanese government bonds (JGBs). Looking at the developments in economic activity and prices that led to the decisions, as explained earlier, while overseas economies have moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase, the pick-up in economic activity has come to a pause and is expected to level off more or less for the time being. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding volatile food is to hover at around 0 percent for the time being. In the meantime, attention should be paid to the effects of financial and foreign exchange market developments on economic activity and prices. Until recently, the Bank had judged that, from a longer term perspective, Japan’s economy would return to the moderate recovery path as domestic demand remained firm and overseas economies gradually emerged from the deceleration phase. And, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding volatile food would start to gradually increase and was likely to reach 1 percent in the not so distant future from fiscal 2014 onward. However, taking into account the current developments in economic activity and prices, the time of “overseas economies to gradually emerge from the deceleration phase” and the time of “Japan’s economy to return to the moderate recovery path” are both likely to be delayed. While to what extent the delay will be is not clear amid continued high uncertainty concerning China and other overseas economies, roughly speaking, it is likely to be about six months. If things had remained as they were, Japan’s economy would have been on the verge of deviating from the assumed orbit of “return to the moderate growth path with price stability.” To avoid that, the Bank judged it necessary to further strengthen monetary easing this time. The aim of the measures this time is, by pursuing powerful monetary easing, inclusive of the measures this time, to bring back the outlook for economic activity and prices in the long run to the orbit of returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability. Specifics of the enhancement of monetary easing As mentioned earlier, the Bank decided this time to increase the total size of the Program substantially by about 10 trillion yen. Based on the recognition of the current state of economic activity and prices, the Bank considered that a large amount of funds would be necessary in order to prevent the outlook for economic activity and prices in the long term from deviating from the orbit of returning to the sustainable growth path with price stability. While there was a choice to increase additional purchases in risk assets, as the current financial conditions in Japan were not in a situation in which risk premiums increased due to investors’ anxiety or risk aversion, the Bank opted to increase purchases of short-term and long-term government securities. By increasing purchases of those by about 5 trillion yen each, the Bank aimed at influencing the entire yield curve. Japanese firms’ funding structure, unlike that of the United States in which the proportion of long-term corporate bonds and mortgage loans are high, has a characteristic of a high proportion of bank loans of three years or less. In particular, bank loans of one year or less account for about one-third of new loans, and there are also long-term loans with variable rates. Taking into account such structure of corporate finance, the effects on the entire yield curve, and financial institutions’ sense of security in their funding, the Bank considers that purchasing government securities with a remaining maturity of three years or less in a balanced manner will be effective in further spreading monetary easing effects. While the increase in the outstanding amount of the Program was to be completed by the end of June 2013, it is extended to be completed by the end of December 2013. Given the economic situation, the Bank has judged it necessary to beef up the aforementioned “commitment to continuing monetary easing for a long period” by extending the accumulation period of the Program. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In addition, while the minimum bidding yield for purchases of the JGBs and corporate bonds was set at 0.1 percent, the Bank has decided to remove it. With the Bank pursuing monetary easing, the bidding yield for the JGB issuance as well as actual market transaction rates up to three years have often fallen below 0.1 percent. To that end, in the purchases of the JGBs, aggregate bids falling short of the Bank’s offers, or the so-called undersubscription, has taken place. While such phenomenon itself is an indication that monetary easing has been spreading powerfully, in order to further ensure purchases of financial assets, the Bank has decided to remove the minimum bidding yield. By combining an increase in the total size of the Program and the removal of the minimum bidding yield, the Bank believes that the effects of monetary easing will occur more powerfully. As the current amount outstanding of the Program is about 60 trillion yen, hereafter, toward the scheduled amount of 80 trillion yen by the end of 2013, the Bank will accelerate its purchase schedule to further accumulate 20 trillion yen of financial assets. The Bank will continue to proceed with monetary easing in a continuous manner by steadily increasing the amount outstanding of the Program. Accommodative financial conditions Then through what transmission channels will this time’s measures influence economic activity and prices and “ensure the return of Japan’s economy to the sustainable growth path”? First of all, since the measures are to increase the amount of purchase by the Program and to enable the Bank to purchase the JGBs at a yield level of 0.1 percent or lower, they will add further downward pressure on market interest rates. That will encourage a decline in financial institutions’ lending rates and influence interest rate formation in various financial markets, thereby making financial conditions surrounding firms and households more accommodative. That is an effect that could be clearly confirmed in two years’ experience of Comprehensive Monetary Easing. Under the Bank’s powerful monetary easing, Japan’s financial conditions are accommodative. Since the introduction of the Program, longer term market interest rates have been steadily declining. Looking at the yields of the government securities, in a manner of spreading from short-term to long-term, yields up to about three years have already been hovering at an extremely low level of about 0.1 percent. A 5-year yield has also declined to about 0.2 percent. Such a decline in market interest rates has encouraged a decline in firms’ funding costs and increased a sense of security for funding. According to a survey on firms about their cash management and financial institutions’ lending stance, diffusion indexes have clearly improved to the levels better than the average since 2000. Issuing conditions of CP and corporate bonds have generally been favorable and banks’ average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have been at about 1 percent for both short and long terms, which are at historically low levels of even lower than those during the period of quantitative easing policy in the first half of the 2000s. Against such a backdrop, average interest payment on firms’ interest bearing debt has declined to around 1.5 percent. That is an extremely low level compared with firms’ return on asset (ROA) being around 3.0–3.5 percent. Consequently, firms can now borrow a sufficient amount of funds at much lower interest rates than their own profitability. In such a way, as for the effects monetary policy exerts on the real economy, it can be said that the effects of monetary easing have thoroughly spread in terms of the first stage of transmission from monetary policy to financial conditions. What is important for Japan’s economy is that firms and households take advantage of the accommodative financial conditions and increase investment and spending aggressively. By that, the second stage of transmission from financial conditions to the real economy will be strengthened. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Efforts to take advantage of accommodative financial conditions In that regard, currently, as firms are not confident about their future profits environment, they have not necessarily been able to take full advantage of such accommodative financial conditions. What becomes important here is the efforts to strengthen growth potential. If strengthening growth potential actually proceeds and growth expectations for Japan’s economy pick up, the outlook for firms’ profits will increase or the expected rate of return of investment will increase, which will lead to positive developments like firms’ investment. If that happens, accommodative financial conditions will further exert their effects. Once such virtuous cycle starts, inflation will be more likely to rise through an improvement in aggregate supply and demand balance. In such efforts to strengthen growth potential, it goes without saying that private economic entities will play the most important role. Recently, as seen in an increase in consumption by the elderly and in renewable energy-related investment, the move to convert challenges Japan’s economy is faced with into an opportunity to tap new demand has been gradually taking place. It is important to grow such bud of growth and nurture it to a larger market. In doing so, the role of financial institutions in providing funds necessary for firms’ activity, including in their startups, and the role of the government in preparing an environment that facilitates firms’ activity, including promotion of deregulation, are also important. Also the Bank, from the viewpoint of making utmost contribution that a central bank can do, has been implanting the extraordinary “Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth” since June 2010. The measure is for the Bank to provide long-term funds at a low interest rate to financial institutions carrying out lending and investment that contribute to Japan’s economic growth, and the total amount of line of credit has now reached 5.5 trillion yen, inclusive of the U.S. dollars. While the measure is an extraordinary one, given the intrinsic role of a central bank, the reason the Bank dares to do it is that the Bank expects the measure to play the role of a “catalyst” in strengthening growth potential. In addition to the impact of actually providing funds, significance of sharing the recognition that strengthening growth potential is important is not small at all. In fact, since the introduction of the measure, there have been not a few examples of promoting voluntary initiatives toward strengthening foundations for economic growth, such as some financial institutions setting up a dedicated fund for the regions’ promising businesses. If such efforts further develop and, as the moves to take advantage of the current accommodative financial conditions increase, the effects of monetary easing will be further exerted. While accommodative monetary conditions have reached a state of saturation as I have explained earlier, from the viewpoint of taking advantage of such accommodative financial conditions, a strong possibility still remains for monetary easing exerting greater effects. Assessment of the economy and the timing of monetary easing As for this time’s measures, I have explained a grand view of the assessment of underlying economic activity and prices and the aim, the specifics of the measures, assumed transmission channels, and the importance of strengthening growth potential to utilize them. In the following, I will answer to some questions raised related to the measures taken this time. First, the question on “why the Bank decided monetary easing at this time’s Monetary Policy Meeting.” That originates both from a view that “the past assessment of the economy might have been too optimistic” and a view that “the Bank could have waited until it checked the result of the Tankan survey to be released at the beginning of October and it conducted the full examination in the Outlook Report scheduled for the end of October.” As for the assessment of the economy, in recent months, it has been said that the deceleration phase of overseas economies has been continuing on such occasions as 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Governor’s press conferences, speeches, and interviews. Against such a backdrop, it has been confirmed that the extent of deceleration has recently increased in many countries and regions, mainly in the manufacturing industry, and that the phenomenon has been clearly spreading to Japan’s exports and industrial production. The weaker-than-expected developments in the global economy in the meantime were, as shown in a deterioration in business sentiment indicators, beyond many people’s expectations, including us. As for the question on what cases the Bank will make policy responses in, I myself mentioned at various opportunities that “when the outlook turns out to be weaker than expected or the risk associated with it intensifies, the Bank will not hesitate to implement additional monetary easing.” The Bank, not only in the Monetary Policy Meeting to publish the Outlook Report but also in every Meeting decides on the conduct of monetary policy by examining the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as risk factors surrounding it based on available information. As a result of such examination at the latest Meeting, the Bank judged that the scenario it assumed had been delayed or weaker than expected. As long as there is such judgment, there is no reason to procrastinate a policy response. In such a way, the decision this time was quite an orthodox one in line with the basic concept expressed at various opportunities. The further enhancement of monetary easing decided this time, together with the cumulative effects of the past measures, will ensure the return of Japan’s economy to a sustainable growth path with price stability. Then, in the Outlook Report scheduled to be released at the end of October, based on new indicators and developments being added by then, the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as risk factors are to be examined comprehensively. As for the Bank’s decision on enhancement of monetary easing at this timing, there have been comments, for example, from market participants that “the Bank has followed central banks in the United States and Europe.” Each country’s central bank has been striving to pursue optimal policy according to each country’s economic and financial situation, and does not consider taking policy action following another country’s central bank. As long as the economy itself has been interrelated globally, there is a good chance that the economies of countries and regions simultaneously become weaker than expected and, as a result, each country’s or region’s central bank takes the same kind of response at the same period. As for this time’s policy actions, amid a sense of slowdown in the global economy becoming stronger than widely predicted, it appears to be the case that major central banks have examined the situation of each country or region and have respectively chosen responses deemed appropriate. As a policy stance going forward, the Bank has clarified its view that “[t]he Bank continues to conduct monetary policy in an appropriate manner. The Bank will also do its utmost to ensure the stability of Japan’s financial system, while giving particular attention to developments in global financial markets.” As has been the case, the Bank will examine the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as risk factors, and, when judged necessary, respond decisively and flexibly. Comparison with overseas central banks In relation to monetary easing by overseas central banks, we sometimes receive an opinion that “the Bank should pursue bolder monetary easing, like the Federal Reserve, by purchasing assets without setting a ceiling and a time limit or clarifying the duration for the zero interest rate.” In that regard, as said before, a central bank strives to choose the most effective policy measure or policy framework based on policy challenges and the financial and economic situation of each country or region. While there are various differences in policy conduct between the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve, both share the view of doing its utmost as a central bank to achieve respective goal. It might not be desirable to argue which central bank is bolder, based on the difference in specific monetary easing measures. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  To be somewhat specific, let me point out three things. First, the relationship with policy challenges. The Bank, with the recognition that Japan’s economy is faced with the critical challenge of overcoming deflation and returning to the sustainable growth path with price stability, has been purchasing various assets, including risk assets, and, at the same time, ventured into taking an extraordinary measure, as a central bank, to support strengthening foundations for economic growth. Central banks of major countries are choosing policy responses in line with challenges each central bank is faced with. Second, about a ceiling and time limit. While the Bank has set a ceiling and time limit for the Program, they have been increased or extended from time to time. What started initially at about 35 trillion yen in the total amount and to be completed by the end of 2011 has now become a much larger and much longer easing measure than initially planned, with the total amount of about 80 trillion yen and to be completed by the end of 2013. Regardless of whether there is a predefined ceiling or time limit, the idea of strengthening monetary easing if those are judged insufficient in achieving a policy objective is the same in every central bank. Third, how to show the duration for maintaining the virtual zero interest rate. The Bank, while presenting the outlook for economic activity and prices of two to two and a half years ahead, has clearly made a commitment to pursuing powerful monetary easing through measures, including the virtually zero interest rate policy and purchases of financial assets, until it judges “the price stability goal in the medium to long term” for the time being of 1 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI to be in sight. From a perspective of practical effects, we recognize that there is not a great difference between such approach and the Federal Reserve’s approach, which specifically shows the duration for maintaining the zero interest rate on the basis of the outlook for economic activity and prices at a certain point and change the duration in accordance with subsequent changes in the outlook. Therefore, it seems to be no significant difference in the basic idea and effects of policy conduct between major central banks, albeit some difference in specific ways of conduct. Purchase of government bonds and confidence in currency Finally, in relation to the Bank’s decision to increase the purchase of the JGBs, we sometimes receive concern that “the Bank’s massive purchase of government bonds is fiscal monetization by a central bank and eventually confidence in currency will not be maintained.” Let me touch on that point. At present, the Bank has been purchasing the JGBs according to two different objectives. One is the purchase of the JGBs corresponding with the trend increase in demand for banknotes associated with economic growth. In that case, as long as the purchase corresponds with the trend increase in demand for banknotes, it is rational to hold not short-term assets but long-term government bonds. And in light of the thrust of such purchase, the outstanding amount of banknotes issued is set as the ceiling of the JGB purchases. The other purchase of the JGBs is through the Program, which I have repeatedly mentioned today. As those purchases are decided based on monetary policy judgment to influence longer-term interest rates and other rates, there is no such condition that the total size of the purchases should be kept within the amount of banknotes issued. The outstanding amount of the JGBs held by the Bank has increased from about 66 trillion yen at the end of 2011 to about 84 trillion yen at present, coming to exceed the outstanding amount of banknotes issued. That is due to an increase in the JGB purchases through the Program under pursuing powerful monetary easing. As it is expected that the outstanding amount of the JGBs held by the Bank will increase to about 92 trillion yen at the end of 2012, it will be an increase of about 26 trillion yen in one year. Given that this year’s issuance of special deficit-financing bonds is about 38 trillion yen, it can be said that, the Bank’s purchase of the JGBs has already reached to a substantial size. 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches  If by any chance such massive purchase of the JGBs is interpreted, apart from the necessity in monetary policy conduct, as aiming at fiscal monetization, confidence in the Bank could be eroded considerably and long-term interest rates could rise substantially. That will affect significantly the government which issues the JGBs and financial institutions which hold the JGBs, thereby could impair the stability of the financial system and the real economy. In order to avoid such things, the Bank considers it important to firmly convey the idea to the market that the Bank will not carry out fiscal monetization. In addition, so that the market can always check the Bank’s actions, the Bank will continue to disclose the state of purchases under the Program in a transparent manner. Concluding remarks I have spent quite a time talking about the current state and outlook of the global economy and Japan’s economy, and the Bank’s conduct of monetary policy based on them. In conclusion, let me briefly touch on the prospects of Asian economies and Japan’s economy. Japan’s economy was faced with a structural challenge of declining growth potential due to rapid aging and has long been struggling to overcome it. As mentioned earlier, recently there have been increasing moves to seize it as an opportunity to tap new demand. Such moves have been factors underpinning the relatively resilient domestic demand. If such moves continue in Japan, it will have a significant meaning for the Asian economy as a whole in the future. That is because aging is a problem that other Asian countries also have to be faced with in the not so distant future. As the income levels of Asian emerging economies rise, the potential market size of business for the elderly has a chance of expanding dramatically. To utilize the fruits of the efforts to tap demand of the elderly that has accumulated in Japan as a result of facing the challenge ahead of other countries, namely, to utilize the wisdom of maintaining and improving the vitality of the economy even with aging in Asian markets will not only raise the growth potential of Japan but also enhance the economic and social sustainability of other Asian countries and lead to benefits for the Asian economy as a whole. Those are not limited to the problem of aging. I recognize that it will become increasingly important to have a perspective that Japan’s efforts to overcome various challenges will lead to global benefits. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Money creation and responsibility Speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 18th colloquium of the Institute for Bank-Historical Research (IBF), Frankfurt, 18 September 2012. *      *      * 1. Welcome Dear Dr Reckers Prof Hüttl Prof Binswanger Ladies and gentlemen I am delighted to be able to welcome you today to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Regional Office in Hessen. The high number of participants shows that the Institute for Bank-Historical Research has found a very attractive topic for the colloquium. The caption for today’s event is “Paper money – Public finances – Inflation. Did Goethe hit upon a core problem of monetary policy?” I could now answer this question posed in the title with a clear yes. Indeed, Goethe already analysed the core problem of today’s monetary policy based on paper money around 180 years ago, recording it in literature in inimitable fashion. I would like to keep things short, but in order to do justice to the occasion and topic I do not want to leave it at a simple yes, but elaborate on the issues of today’s colloquium. 2. Money and money creation I wish to begin with a question which appears trivial at first glance but which, as experience has shown, is particularly difficult. What is money exactly? A succinct response from an economist would be: Money is what money does. As money is defined by its functions, various instruments are fundamentally capable of acting as money, as long as they can be used as a medium of exchange, medium of payment and store of value. Shells were previously used as money in some countries, for example, as were furs, salt or pearls. Livestock could also serve as money – the Latin word for cattle is “pecus” from which the word “pecunia”, meaning money, is derived. Concrete objects have served as money for most of human history; we may therefore speak of commodity money. A great deal of trust was placed in particular in precious and rare metals – gold first and foremost – due to their assumed intrinsic value. In its function as a medium of exchange, medium of payment and store of value, gold is thus, in a sense, a timeless classic.” To gold they tend, on gold depend, all things!”, says Margaret in the First Part of Goethe’s Faust. However, the money that we carry around in the form of banknotes and coins no longer has anything to do with commodity money. Money has no longer been linked to gold reserves since the US dollar was removed from the gold standard in 1971. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In short: today’s money is no longer backed by any real assets. Banknotes are printed paper – and the experts amongst you know that the euro is printed on paper made of cotton – coins are minted metal. That banknotes and coins are accepted as a medium of payment in our daily lives also has to do with the fact that they are the only legal tender. However, ultimately the acceptance of banknotes is based on public confidence that it can use this paper money to make purchases. In this sense, money is a social convention – it has no intrinsic value which comes before its use; instead, its value is created by its constant exchange and use as money. By the way, this recognition that trust is central, or even constitutive, for the properties of money is very old; it was already discussed in the 4th century BC by Aristotle in his Politics and Nicomachean Ethics. In recent times, in particular, many citizens are asking about the origin of money: where do the central banks actually acquire the huge amounts of money that they need to give billions in loans to the banking system as part of monetary policy operations or to make other purchases? Why it is often repeated in this context that central banks have virtually unlimited firepower?  Central banks create money by granting commercial banks credit against collateral or by buying assets such as bonds. The financial power of a central bank is unlimited in principle; it does not have to acquire beforehand the money it lends or uses for payments, but can basically create it out of thin air. The printing of money is an appropriate image here; from an economic perspective, the printing press is not necessary, as the creation of money primarily shows up on the central bank’s balance sheet, on its accounts.  How does Johann Wolfgang von Goethe enter the equation when talking about the creation of money. Why have I widened the discussion further? 3. Money creation, Goethe, Faust and alchemy Let me remind you briefly of the “money creation” scene in Act One of the Second Part of Faust. Mephistopheles, disguised as a fool, talks to the Emperor, who is in severe financial distress, and says “In this world, what isn’t lacking, somewhere, though? Sometimes it’s this, or that: here’s what’s missing’s gold”The Emperor finally responds to Mephistopheles’ subtle attempt to persuade him,  “I’m tired of the eternal ‘if and when’: We’re short of gold, well fine, so fetch some then” To which Mephistopheles replies “I’ll fetch what you wish, and I’ll fetch more” In the commotion of the nocturnal masquerade ball, he persuades the Emperor to sign a document – a document which Mephistopheles has reproduced over night and then distributed as paper money. Those involved are quite taken by the initial success of this measure. The Chancellor is delighted to announce  “See and hear the scroll, heavy with destiny, – (referring to the paper money that has been created) – that’s changed to happiness our misery”  He reads, “To whom it concerns, may you all know, This paper’s worth a thousand crowns or so”  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  A little later, Mephistopheles stirs up the general elation even further by saying  “Such paper’s convenient, for rather than a lot Of gold and silver, you know what you’ve got. You’ve no need of bartering and exchanging, Just drown your needs in wine and love-making.” Those concerned are so overjoyed by this apparent blessing that they do not even suspect that things could get out of hand. In the Second Part of Faust, the state can get rid of its debt to begin with. At the same time, private consumer demand rises sharply, fuelling an upswing. In due course, however, all this activity degenerates into inflation, destroying the monetary system because the money rapidly loses its value. It is very striking that Goethe throws light in this way on the potentially hazardous connection between paper money creation, public finances and inflation – and thus on one core problem of uncovered monetary systems. This is all the more remarkable given that Faust and Goethe are not generally immediately associated with economics, especially not with such central areas of conflicting monetary policy priorities. The fact that Faust can indeed be interpreted in economic terms has been demonstrated, not least, by Professor Adolf Hüttl, who used to be Vice-President of the former Land Central Bank in Hesse. I am delighted that he is in attendance here today. Back in 1965, he wrote a very insightful article in the Bundesbank’s staff magazine about “Money in the Second Part of Goethe’s Faust”. In the mid-1980s, while teaching in Sankt Gallen, Professor Hans Christoph Binswanger – who I am pleased to say is also here today – took a similar line and brought out a book entitled “Money and Magic: a Critique of the Modern Economy in the Light of Goethe’s Faust”. Binswanger’s thesis is that Goethe was portraying the modern economy with its creation of paper money as a continuation of alchemy by other means. While traditional alchemists attempted to turn lead into gold, in the modern economy, paper was made into money. Indeed, the fact that central banks can create money out of thin air, so to speak, is something that many observers are likely to find surprising and strange, perhaps mystical and dreamlike, too – or even nightmarish.  4. The responsibilities of an independent central bank If central banks can potentially create an unlimited amount of money out of thin air, how can we ensure that money remains sufficiently scarce to preserve its value? Does this ability to create money more or less at will not create the temptation to take advantage of this instrument to create additional leeway short term, even at the risk of highly probable long-term damage?  Yes, this temptation certainly does exist, and many in monetary history have succumbed to it. Taking a look back in time, this was often the reason for establishing a central bank: to provide those in power with free access to seemingly unlimited financial resources. However, such government interference in central banking, combined with the government’s large demand for funding, often led to a strong expansion in the volume of money in circulation, causing it to lose value through inflation. In light of this experience, central banks were subsequently established as independent institutions, with the mandate to safeguard the value of money, in order to explicitly keep the government from co-opting monetary policy. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The independence of central banks is an extraordinary privilege – it is, however, not an end in itself. Instead, its primary purpose is to use its credibility to ensure that monetary policy can focus unhindered on preserving the value of money. Independent monetary policy combined with policymakers with a well-functioning, stability-oriented compass are a necessary – but not a sufficient – condition for preserving the purchasing power of money as well as public confidence in it. Of course, it is important that central bankers, who are in charge of a public good – in this case, stable money – bolster public confidence by explaining their policies. The best protection against temptation in monetary policy is an enlightened and stability-oriented society. 5. Conclusion I will end my overview of Goethe, Faust and paper money here. You have probably noticed that the building we are in reflects, in many respects, the connection between Frankfurt, Goethe, money and Faust, in particular the sculptures and paintings. This type of architectural art was primarily the idea and initiative of Professor Hüttl. On that note, I would like to turn over to the other speakers, who will speak about the topic of today’s colloquium in more detail. I am sure that the combination of Goethe and money will have many additional interesting insights in store for you this afternoon. Thank you for your attention, and I hope you will find the event both enjoyable and stimulating. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Øystein Olsen: Monetary policy in turbulent times Address by Mr Øystein Olsen, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Centre for Monetary Economics (CME)/BI Norwegian School of Management, Oslo, 20 September 2012. *      *      * Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. Central banks the world over are now conducting monetary policy in what must undoubtedly be called turbulent times. My address today will focus on how and why new tools of monetary policy are being deployed internationally and our response to these developments here in Norway. The economic situation in Norway is quite different from that of surrounding countries and we have been able to operate within the established monetary policy framework. Chart: GDP growth Growth in the global economy has been weak since the 2008 financial crisis and has affected some countries more severely than others. Countries with large imbalances when the crisis began are now facing formidable challenges. The imbalances have been self-reinforcing. Higher pricing of risk has resulted in increased yields on the government bonds of countries with a high level of debt. Fragile government finances have become even weaker. A decrease in the value of government bonds has also generated uncertainty concerning the position of banks. Banks have had to consolidate their balance sheets and have curtailed lending to firms and households, amplifying the decrease in economic activity. Heavily indebted countries are now working to make banks more robust and strengthen government finances. Cost competitiveness must be restored. The road will no doubt be long and arduous. Chart: Yields on 10-year government bonds But the situation across countries differs considerably and is reflected in wide yield spreads. Investors now demand substantial premiums for investing in less safe assets. Capital is seeking safe havens, even though real returns on presumably risk-free investments are low or negative. Wide yield spreads may persist for a period – it takes time for countries to restore competitiveness and build up stronger balances, particularly when growth is also weak in other regions. Substantial economic imbalances in Japan and the US also need to be redressed. Turbulence and bad times in Europe are now dampening activity in these countries and in emerging economies. This situation has led to the emergence of new forms of monetary policy in many parts of the world. Interest rates have been low – close to zero – for a long period. The Federal Reserve has indicated that the federal funds rate will most likely be exceptionally low at least until mid-2015. In the event, the US key rate will have been close to zero for almost seven years. As key rates cannot be lowered further, several central banks have decided to apply other methods. The methods fall into two main types: The first method relates to communication. Statements concerning the future central bank key rate are being employed as a new monetary policy tool. Here at Norges Bank, the application of this method is not new – the interest rate forecast has been published by the Bank since 2005. The aim is to influence interest rate expectations and thereby contribute to achieving the objectives of monetary policy.1 The Federal Reserve has published board                                                 1 See speech by Janet L. Yellen, 25 February 2011: “Unconventional Monetary Policy and Central Bank Communications”, http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20110225a.htm. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  members’ expectations of when the first key rate increase will take place since January 2012.2  The second method is known as quantitative easing, or balance sheet policy, and consists of measures to change the composition and size of central bank balance sheets. This use of the balance sheet differs from the usual monetary policy operations in that instruments other than the key rate are used to influence market rates and economic activity. Traditional monetary policy operates through the commercial banking system: it influences the economy because banks let their interest rate conditions in the central bank pass through to their customers. Moreover, liquidity management is used to keep short-term rates close to the key rate. In countries where the key rate is close to zero, this instrument has been exhausted. At the same time, the effect of the key rate may be weaker than normal as many banks are consolidating and are reluctant to engage in lending. Using balance sheet policy, the central bank seeks to influence longer-term interest rates and thereby funding costs in a more direct manner.3  Purchases of government or private sector bonds are intended to depress yields and push up securities prices – the so-called portfolio effect.4 Studies from the past three or four years indicate that the portfolio effect has been in operation in both US and UK markets – bond prices have increased and long-term yields have fallen as a result of quantitative easing.5 The aim is to achieve lower long-term yields in order to boost lending and investment. In addition to the portfolio effect, the new use of the balance sheet can have a signal effect: central banks that engage in large-scale purchases of securities to pull down long-term yields are sending a signal that the key rate may be kept low for a long period. In this sense, balance sheet policy also contributes to anchoring expectations and supporting monetary policy communication. It is not easy to say what the situation would have been without these measures. However, it is likely that central bank bond purchases have curbed the decline in output in the UK and the US. Chart: Central bank balance sheets, stylised These measures, by their nature, have an impact on central bank balance sheets – in terms of both size and composition.                                                 2 See the Federal Reserve’s “Monetary Policy Report to the Congress”, February 2012, http:// www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_20120229_part1.htm. 3 For a description by the Bank of England of how quantitative easing works, see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/qe/default.aspx.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  When a central bank purchases government bonds, it pays for the bonds with new electronic money. Chart: Central bank balance sheets – government bond purchases The money ends up as increased bank deposits at the central bank – also known as central bank reserves. This strengthens banks’ holdings of liquid assets and may induce them to increase lending. The pricing of government bond holdings in the private sector is also affected. Chart: Central bank balance sheets – private sector bond purchases Private sector bond purchases can ease funding conditions for firms more directly than purchases of government bonds by depressing interest rates on private sector market funding. As with government bond purchases, central bank reserves also increase in this case. The latest measure implemented by the Federal Reserve, known as QE3, is a plan for the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. Chart: Central bank balance sheets – foreign exchange purchases A third form of balance sheet policy is interventions in the foreign exchange market. Central bank foreign exchange purchases are also balanced by an increase in banks’ deposits in the central bank. Chart: Central bank balance sheets. Index In September 2011, the Swiss National Bank decided to announce a minimum exchange rate, a floor, for the Swiss franc against the euro owing to the substantial appreciation of the Swiss franc. Interest rates and inflation in Switzerland were close to zero and growth was low. According to the Swiss National Bank, a further appreciation could have resulted in a recession with deflationary developments. In order to defend the floor, the Swiss central bank has purchased foreign currency in large quantities. This has led to a considerable expansion of its balance sheet. The chart shows the wide swings in central bank balance sheets since the 2008 financial crisis. Expansion of central bank balance sheets has been particularly rapid in the UK, the US and Switzerland and somewhat more moderate in the euro area. As I mentioned earlier, the purpose of balance sheet policy is to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and funding costs in a situation where the key rate is close to zero. Central banks themselves emphasise that the positive effects of balance sheet policy are uncertain – and the effects must be weighed against possible problems.6 There are four factors that can be highlighted here: First, it may be difficult for central banks to exit the markets once they have built up large bond holdings, and this would require considerable portfolio adjustments for households, firms and banks. Postponing a reversal of the measures could generate expectations that interest rates will remain very low for too long a period after the economy has recovered. This could in turn generate expectations of high inflation further ahead. Indeed, the connection between inflation and the money supply constitutes the second challenge. When a central bank purchases securities or provides longer-term loans to banks, the monetary base, i.e. banks’ deposits at the central bank, increases. There is no direct relationship between the monetary base and inflation. The risk of inflation can only arise if growth in the monetary base coincides with an increase in the broader monetary aggregates through higher customer deposits in banks. For the broader monetary aggregates to                                                 6 See for example speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke: “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis”, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 31 August 2012.

Since the crisis in 2008, the monetary base in Europe and the US has grown considerably more rapidly than the broader monetary aggregates. The risk of high inflation in such a situation should be viewed in the context of central bank exit strategies. In the future, central banks will want to reverse the extraordinary measures that have resulted in substantial growth in the monetary base. This will normally be done when the crisis is over and the economy is recovering. Third, the large sums of money involved may also affect exchange rates. Even if central banks do not intervene in exchange markets directly, the measures may in the short term reduce the value of the currency issued by a central bank. This will, in isolation, strengthen exchange rates in countries that were initially less severely hit by the crisis. Small, open economies can be vulnerable to large capital movements when powerful instruments are deployed by large countries. A possible side-effect of balance sheet policy is that the private sector also takes longer to strengthen equity capital and reduce risk than it would otherwise have done. With the low price of capital, it costs little to postpone restructuring and put off debt repayment. Finally, confidence in economic policy may be affected. The dividing line between monetary and fiscal policy seems to be more blurred. Balance sheet policy may dampen the effects of market volatility on interest rates and give heavily indebted countries a breathing space and time to adjust. On the other hand, the measures may also reduce the incentive to carry out necessary fiscal tightening. In the euro area, different considerations are now being balanced in the new “Outright Monetary Transactions” (OMT) programme. Under this programme, the European Central Bank (ECB) may only purchase bonds from countries that have entered into a loan agreement under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) or the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – which in turn is conditional on a commitment to fiscal tightening. Chart: Corporate borrowing rates One reason for the ECB’s decision to establish the OMT programme is the partial breakdown of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area economy. There are wide differences in interest rates facing banks and firms across Europe. Although the same key rates apply to all the euro area countries, average corporate borrowing rates differ widely from country to country. Some of the variation is due to differences in credit risk across countries owing to very different economic situations. Additional risk premiums may reflect fears that one or more countries might at some point have to replace the euro with a new local currency. ECB President Mario Draghi has referred to these as convertibility risk premiums. One of the objectives of the OMT programme is to reduce this premium and restore the proper transmission of monetary policy. The OMT programme can be regarded as an answer to the signs of financial market fragmentation in the euro area. Differences in financial conditions across countries have become considerable and the willingness to provide loans across national borders has declined. The same picture is reflected in the so-called TARGET2 balances. TARGET2 is the central interbank settlement system in the euro area. In all countries, interbank payment settlement is carried out by the national central bank. One bank’s payment to another is settled by adjusting the two banks’ deposits in the central bank. Central bank reserves are the means of interbank payment. In the euro area, interbank payment settlement takes place in two stages: banks have their settlement account in the national central bank, while each country’s central bank has, in turn, an account at the ECB. If, for example, deposits are transferred from a Greek bank to a German bank, the Greek bank’s deposits in the Greek central bank are reduced, while the German bank’s deposits in the Bundesbank increase by the same amount. The Greek central bank’s debt to the ECB increases in turn, while the Bundesbank’s claims on the ECB 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  increase accordingly. Such changes in claims and liabilities are expressed in the TARGET2 balances. Chart: TARGET2 balances In a well functioning market, the bank that had drained its central bank reserves would borrow to replace them in the interbank market, balancing the transfer described above. Imbalances in TARGET2 are a symptom of an interbank market that is not functioning efficiently between all countries in the euro area. If banks in the north are no longer willing to lend to banks in the south, the southern banks must meet their need for reserves by borrowing directly from the central bank. The northern banks increase their reserves at the central bank accordingly. In addition to increasing the claims in the TARGET2 system, this inflates the Eurosystem balance sheet. The central banks are the hub of the system and are required to receive deposits from areas where banks have a surplus of reserves and extend loans to areas where banks as a whole need more funding. Imbalances between countries in the TARGET2 system give no indication of who will bear the losses if a bank defaults and the value of the collateral posted is not sufficient. Any losses are allocated among the participating national central banks according to their relative shares in the ECB’s paid-up capital. To sum up the international picture: over the past year, growth prospects have been lowered for all the large advanced regions. In Europe, activity is likely to decline this year owing to debt problems and fiscal tightening. Unemployment is on the rise. Fiscal and monetary policy space is limited, or virtually exhausted. Many countries must tighten fiscal policy to reduce debt to a sustainable level. Central banks have responded by communicating that interest rates will be held low for an extended period. And they have stretched the limits of monetary policy to counteract a deeper and more persistent downturn. Chart: GDP growth The economic situation in our external surrounding environment stands in contrast to that of Norway. Domestic activity is particularly high in the oil industry and construction sector, and both employment and the supply of labour are on the increase. Unemployment remains low and stable. Public finances are healthy. Norway’s terms of trade are favourable, with high export prices and low import prices. At the same time, house prices and household debt are still rising. Nonetheless, the Norwegian economy is not unaffected by the turbulence abroad. Developments in Europe and a strong krone exchange rate are adversely affecting some Norwegian export industries, such as the paper, metal, and furniture industries. While other countries have used nontraditional instruments, we have managed to come through by using our main instrument – the key policy rate – which is now 1.5 per cent. It is low because inflation is low and because adverse conditions abroad are curbing growth in a number of industry sectors in Norway. Very low interest rates abroad and high risk premiums in money and capital markets underpin this picture. Norges Bank’s conduct of monetary policy is geared towards low and stable inflation. The operational target of monetary policy is consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. At the same time, monetary policy shall contribute to stabilising output and employment. We also give weight to the risk that low interest rates may over time lead to excessive risk-taking and debt accumulation in the household and business sector. Such imbalances can give rise to negative ripple effects further ahead, with a considerable impact on output and employment. Chart: Criteria for an appropriate interest rate path and loss function In Norges Bank’s March 2012 Monetary Policy Report, the Bank clarified how the various considerations are expressed in Norges Bank’s response pattern. Adjustments were made to the criteria for an appropriate interest rate path. In the Bank’s system of analysis, the criteria are expressed as a loss function for monetary policy. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Criterion 1, which states that the inflation target is reached, is covered by the first segment, where the loss is higher the more actual inflation πt deviates from the target π*. Criterion 2, which states that for given inflation developments, the loss Lt will increase with fluctuations in economic activity, is covered by the first and second segments. Criterion 3, which states that monetary policy shall be robust, is covered by the second, third and fourth segments. The adjustments made in March were expressed by slightly increasing the weight given to the output gap, , because financial imbalances can often build up in periods of high capacity utilisation. At the same time, weight was given to avoiding substantial deviations in the interest rate from a normal level. This consideration is expressed in the final segment in the loss function. This can help to mitigate the risk of a buildup of financial imbalances, even in periods when capacity utilisation is not particularly high. Chart: Key policy rate Normally, the key policy rate cannot achieve several objectives simultaneously. In the case of conflicting objectives, the choice of interest rate path will involve a trade-off between different considerations. If monetary policy only took into account the low level of inflation, the key policy rate would be rapidly reduced and kept close to zero for a good while. Inflation might then pick up faster, partly as a result of a weaker krone. In the light of the trade-off against other considerations, however, the Bank does not want to accelerate the pace of inflation. The result would be a pronounced impact on output and employment. A prolonged period of even lower interest rates would increase the risk that debt and asset prices will be driven up to levels that are unsustainable over time. We thus obtain a smoother interest rate path when we also give weight to the other two criteria. The criteria and loss function reflect the Bank’s reaction pattern in the period following the financial crisis. We are responding to new insight and lessons learned. The loss function is a mathematical illustration and must be regarded as a simplified representation of the more extensive assessments underlying interest rate decisions. Interest rate setting is based on the Executive Board’s assessment, not a model calculation. Mathematics and models can, however, clarify the alternatives. There is considerable uncertainty as to the effect of low interest rates over extended periods on risk-taking behaviour and the buildup of financial imbalances.7 In this regard, we are in quite uncharted waters. How financial imbalances build up is not explicitly considered in the analytical apparatus. Work is in progress both in Norway and internationally to further develop the economic models used in monetary policy analysis. As we gain new insight and gather experience, our assessments of economic relationships may change. This will also influence the formulation of our models.                                                 7 Monetary Policy Report 1/12, box on pages 15–16, Norges Bank, and “Norges Bank’s new monetary policy loss function – further discussion”, Snorre Evjen and Thea B. Kloster, Norges Bank Staff Memo 11/2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Chart: Household debt burden and interest burden In Norway, house prices and household debt have reached historically high levels. The rapid growth in incomes has been a primary driving force. The high household debt burden in Norway represents a risk of financial instability in the longer term. Households can be a source of both direct and indirect losses for banks. Banks’ loan losses will depend on households’ capacity to pay interest and principal, and to the value of the underlying collateral, which is primarily in the form of dwellings in Norway. Banks are also exposed to the economic repercussion effects that may occur in the event of a fall in household consumption. In the short run, the risk of disturbances is probably small because interest rates are low and the vast majority of households have job and income security. Chart: Household financial wealth by debt burden Household saving has been high in recent years, but households with the highest debt have the lowest financial wealth. In 2009, only about ten percent of financial assets were held by households with a high debt burden – that is to say those with debt that was more than five times their disposable income. These households also accounted for around one third of total household debt. Chart: High population growth and low residential construction rate In recent years, pressures in the housing market have been amplified by high population growth. Despite rising housing construction, the number of housing completions remains low in relation to population growth. The housing deficit has grown over several years and is pushing up house prices. The housing shortage requires measures in the real economy – in this case, an increase in housing construction. Monetary policy cannot aim to redress such real economic imbalances. Low interest rates over time can increase the risk of driving up debt levels and asset prices, bringing them to a level that is unsustainable over time. This is an important lesson from the financial crisis. We take account of this when setting the key policy rate, as has been made clear in the most recent formulation of the loss function. At the same time, there is – with one instrument available to us – the key policy rate – a limit to how many tasks can be assigned to monetary policy. In order to counter financial imbalances, instruments in addition to those available to monetary policy must come into play. Macroprudential regulation of the financial industry will play a greater role in the years ahead. The overall risk in the financial system is greater than the sum of the risk represented by each individual bank. Which macroprudential instruments would be the most suitable is currently being discussed in detail in various international fora and central banks. One instrument that will be introduced is the countercyclical capital buffer for banks. The purpose of this buffer is to reduce the procyclicality of bank lending. When banks are required to hold more capital in a period of high credit growth, they will be more robust to large loan losses. In addition, increased capital requirements could restrain credit growth. The Ministry of Finance has the overriding responsibility for regulating the financial industry, but Norges Bank will be given the primary responsibility for elaborating the basis for the establishment of the countercyclical capital buffer. With a buffer ceiling of 2.5 percent of banks’ risk-weighted assets, the buffer will probably have a limited downward impact on banks’ lending enthusiasm in good times. But banks that have solid capital reserves can take larger losses before having to limit lending to creditworthy customers. The countercyclical buffer comes on top of a new, comprehensive regulatory framework. Equity capital requirements will be tightened. Banks will face stricter maturity requirements for funding, limiting their share of short-term funding. They will be required to hold more liquid assets. All in all, the new regulatory regime will contribute to a more robust financial system and reduce fluctuations in credit growth. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The turbulence in Europe, which started with the problems in Greece, has now prevailed for close to two and a half years. Financial market sentiment and banks’ access to funding have varied widely during the period. The nascent market optimism may continue, but it is fragile. Should the economic situation abroad worsen again, and credit markets dry up, other tools can be put to use in Norway. During the financial crisis in 2008, several measures were deployed, such as the so-called swap arrangement, which provided banks with access to liquid government securities in exchange for covered bonds. Smaller banks were given loans with longer maturities. The measures aimed at improving banks’ access to long-term funding. The measures enabled banks to maintain virtually normal lending standards for Norwegian households and businesses. Norway’s swap arrangement and quantitative easing have some common features: bonds shift from private to public hands, and banks’ funding costs become lower than would otherwise have been the case. But there is an important difference. The swap arrangement was reflected in the government’s balance sheet – not the central bank’s. Quantitative easing, which increases the size of a central bank’s balance sheet, as observed in the US and the UK, is still not a relevant approach for Norway. Normally, the provision of capital and liquidity by authorities is not to replace banks’ own sound liquidity management and long-term market funding. Any decision relating to the use of the creditworthiness of government or taxpayers to finance banks and businesses rests with the Government and the Storting (Norwegian parliament). Chart: Liquidity and EUR/NOK exchange rate International turbulence can push the krone in both directions. On the one hand, in periods of severe market turbulence, investors have tended to shy away from presumably less liquid currencies. The krone market is among the less liquid markets. One indicator of liquidity is the so called bid-ask spread.8 An exit from the krone market may be tight when many investors seek to shift out of krone positions at the same time. This can trigger a considerable depreciation of the krone, as experienced in autumn 2008. On the other hand, Norwegian securities can be perceived as safe havens because the associated credit risk is perceived to be low. Experience has also shown that international turbulence can in periods lead to an appreciation of the krone. A krone that is too strong can over time result in inflation that is too low and growth that is too weak. In that case, monetary policy measures will be taken. In Norway, the key policy rate is the relevant instrument. We still have room for manoeuvre in interest rate setting – in both directions. Foreign exchange interventions are not in principle an instrument suited to influencing the krone exchange rate over a longer period. It would only be relevant should the krone exchange rate move significantly out of line with that deemed reasonable in relation to the underlying fundamentals of the Norwegian economy, and should developments at the same time threaten the credibility of the inflation target. In addition, the interest rate weapon must have already been exhausted. Over the past decade, inflation has been low and stable. This shows that monetary policy has functioned effectively. Transparency about the response pattern and key policy rate forecasts reinforce the impact of monetary policy. With firmly anchored inflation expectations, Norges Bank has also been able to give weight to economic stability when setting the key policy rate. Further light is being shed on the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability. Inflation targeting in Norway has become more flexible. At the same time, we cannot overburden monetary policy. In weighing the various considerations, we will in our                                                 8 “Liquidity in the foreign exchange market for EUR/NOK”, Kathrine Lund, Norges Bank Economic Commentaries 3/2011.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: Challenges to the single monetary policy and the European Central Bank’s response Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Institut d’études politiques, Paris, 20 September 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,1 It is a great pleasure for me to speak here today at Sciences Po Paris.  9 August this year was the fifth anniversary of the start of the financial crisis. The past few years have been times of hardship, financial turbulence and risks. At the same time, the crisis has exposed weaknesses in the framework of the economic and monetary union and provided an impetus to strengthen its foundations and to begin the process of bringing all euro area countries back to a more sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic path.  The crisis has also brought challenges and opportunities for monetary policy, which is going to be the focus of my remarks today. Let me elaborate on two of them. The first challenge I will describe is that after Lehman’s collapse central banks had to combat exceptional threats to price stability arising from financial instability and recessionary forces. At that time their standard tool of monetary policy – changes to the short-term interest rate – was losing traction due to the dislocation in the financial system. Central banks had to quickly learn that this situation required switching from normal operating mode, based simply on setting short-term interest rates, to crisis mode, aimed at sidestepping the obstacles to the standard channels of monetary policy transmission. This experience has given us an opportunity to deepen our understanding of monetary policy and, in particular, to reject the textbook dichotomy that either the central bank is able to rely on the “interest rate channel” for the transmission of its intentions, or else the economy is condemned to lasting instability. It is now clear that additional channels and conduits are available. The second challenge I want to discuss is the sovereign debt crisis and the associated fragmentation of credit markets across national borders. Starting in 2010, the financial crisis began to unfold in the euro area by turning into a debt crisis for some sovereign issuers. This quickly spilled across markets and countries. And more recently, it was exacerbated by investors’ fears of the reversibility of the euro. The challenge faced by monetary policy in this environment is enormous and is testing the ability of the ECB to act as the central bank of a single monetary area with 17 fiscal jurisdictions. It has been increasingly challenging to preserve the singleness of the monetary policy and to ensure the proper transmission of the policy stance to the real economy throughout the currency area. To address this situation, the ECB has taken a number of non-standard measures, and two weeks ago it announced the modalities for undertaking Outright Monetary Transactions in secondary markets for sovereign bonds in the euro area. I will describe the rationale for this decision and argue that it is a key element to ensure a lasting “monetary dominance” in the euro area, compliant with the Treaties.  Channels of monetary policy in normal times and crisis times  In normal times, monetary policy works primarily through inter-temporal financial arbitrage. In the Eurosystem, this arbitrage covers two different time dimensions. There is the weekly arbitrage cycle, through which the volume of central bank liquidity is reallocated across                                                 1  I would like to thank Roberto Motto, Stefano Nardelli, and Massimo Rostagno for their contributions to the speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions expressed herein. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  banks trading in the money market in the period between two consecutive weekly Eurosystem main refinancing operations (MROs). The reason for this reallocation is that – as a matter of routine, at least – the Eurosystem provides reserves at weekly intervals. While the banking sector’s need for reserves in the aggregate may not change significantly within a week, the cash needs of individual banks do fluctuate at higher frequencies, probably daily.2 So banks with liquidity deficits in the infra-weekly period need to borrow from banks with liquidity surpluses. The price at which these trades of liquid reserves between banks occur, i.e. the overnight interest rate (of which a euro area average, the EONIA, is computed and published every day by the ECB), is influenced by expectations of the cost of Eurosystem credit – the so-called MRO rate – at the next weekly monetary policy operation. A short-term inter-temporal arbitrage calculus anchors the overnight interest rate applied on the credit transaction between banks that need liquidity and banks that have a liquidity surplus.3  The second dimension of the inter-temporal calculus has a longer horizon and a wider scope of application across asset classes. Banks can borrow short in the money market or from the Eurosystem and decide to engage in term lending to other banks or to their customers. Bank customers, in turn, can use bank liquidity to finance consumption or the acquisition of capital. It is important to note that all of these money transactions in the broader economy involve traders weighing the costs of their borrowing against the return opportunities on their asset acquisition at different points in time, where the horizon is typically longer than a week. But, again, as banks borrowing from the Eurosystem are the source of this liquidity propagation pattern, and banks’ financial calculus is based on their anticipations of the interest rate settings by the Eurosystem in the future, such anticipations anchor the pricing of credit in the broader economy. We call this “the interest rate channel” of monetary policy decisions. In normal times, when risk factors are contained and can be diversified away, the interest rate channel, working through inter-temporal arbitrage, is the prime conduit of monetary policy (see slide 2). It sets the floor for term borrowing costs. Parsing longer-term yields into two components – the average level of the short-term policy interest rate expected over the term to maturity of the asset, and the risk premia – expectations of monetary policy pin down the first component. The mechanism through which this occurs is the inter-temporal financial arbitrage I just described. Term and liquidity premia are the additional returns that investors demand as a compensation for their reluctance to bear interest rate risk over long-duration assets, and for their decision to forgo liquidity services – I am abstracting here from credit risk, to which I will return later. When markets are properly functioning, non-depository institutions – dealers, hedge funds, investment banks – provide immediacy by offering lenders and borrowers their capacity to take positions on both sides of the market. Their ready availability to take positions as lenders and borrowers supports market liquidity, namely the ease with which a lender can liquidate a position before maturity. When market liquidity is secure, lenders are willing to engage in finance, trades in long-duration assets are active and the liquidity premia are contained. And, most importantly, they are steady. With a steady premium, the expectations                                                 2 There are two reasons for idiosyncratic fluctuations of reserve demand by individual banks. The first reason is associated with cash withdrawals and cash deposits by customers and from bank transfer payments intermediated by the Eurosystem – in its function as the clearing institution of the most important interbank payments system in the euro area. The other reason is that not all banks participate in the Eurosystem liquidity-providing operations, but prefer to cover their needs for reserves primarily in the interbank market. For example, in normal times, of the 1,700 banks that were eligible for Eurosystem monetary policy operations, less than 500 used to participate in liquidity allotments. 3  In a Eurosystem environment, the short-term inter-temporal calculus finds another anchor: the need for banks to fulfil their reserve requirements over a monthly maintenance period. In normal times, this is accomplished smoothly throughout the monthly period, again via an inter-temporal substitution of liquidity balances by each individual bank. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  of the short-term rates become the driving factor in the pricing of long-dated securities, and monetary policy acquires a potent handle on the economy. In August 2007, a sudden re-pricing in the US sub-prime mortgage market changed this world. The close and predictable relationship between the expected path of policy rates and market rates broke down because the liquidity premia widened and became volatile. The elevation of market premia was especially pronounced in the spread between the three-month EURIBOR and the expected three-month path of the overnight rate (see slide 3). Banks recognised a substantial counterparty risk in lending to each other, given that interbank lending was generally unsecured. But, even if collateral was taken, the ability to liquidate it at a reasonable price was severely impaired in an environment of widespread fear and uncertainty. Bank positions in the interbank market can be highly persistent. Large diversified banks tend to be borrowers and smaller, regional banks lenders. When the financial turmoil erupted, persistent borrowers endured a sharp and sustained jump in their funding costs and many of them had no access to markets at all.  When Lehman Brothers finally filed for bankruptcy in mid-September 2008, widespread financial panic broke out. The paralysis of transactions spread beyond the money markets, where it had been more or less confined for a year. Outside the money market, dealers play a critical role guaranteeing market liquidity. But in order to be able to take positions on both sides of the market, they need to finance their securities positions via collateralised funding. For that, they need their own capital, which they can use to pay for the margins required by those who lend them securities. When confidence evaporates, margins increase and dealers’ capital is eroded, so that their ability to trade as buyers is restricted. Markets lose a critical actor, assets become less liquid, and the value of assets declines further. Having tasted the forbidden fruit of excess risk-taking, financial institutions were cast out of the paradise of seamless financial markets. In a financial crisis of these proportions, “outside money” – an asset that is not a liability for anybody else than a central bank – becomes the sole trustworthy store of value.4 Only a central bank, the monopoly provider of outside money, can respond to the scrambles for liquidity.  The ECB injected its funding capacity into a market vacuum left wide open by bank retrenchment, dealer defaults and investor panic. In these conditions, inter-temporal financial arbitrage – of the type I described above – becomes impaired. The power of banks and dealers to engage in or finance inter-temporal trades of liquidity balances is degraded. So the main conduit of monetary policy – which depends on those trades – is lost. The ECB had to open a new channel, the “liquidity channel”, to get round the roadblocks facing the interest rate channel (see slide 4). More precisely, the ECB acted in two dimensions. It sought to alleviate the difficulties experienced by banks in getting liquidity from the interbank market, which was putting pressure on the assets side of banks’ balance sheets and increasing the risks of hindering credit supply. At the same time, it sought to restore the normal pass-through from short-term money market (lending) rates to other market and bank interest rates.  As far as impairments to banks’ funding are concerned, the ECB addressed banks’ funding uncertainty by fully accommodating liquidity needs at a fixed interest rate (the ECB main refinancing rate), while simultaneously lengthening the maturity of refinancing operations: from three to six months and twelve months, and more recently two operations with a three-year maturity. This has allowed an alleviation of the funding constraints of the banking system. In this way, a substantial change in the term structure of liquidity has taken place. While before the crisis about three-quarters of outstanding liquidity had a maturity of one                                                 4  See Holmström, B. and Tirole, J., (2011), Inside and Outside Liquidity, MIT Press. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  week and the rest three months (i.e. an average maturity of 15–20 days), the current average maturity is 28 months (see slide 5).  The expansion of the ECB collateralised monetary policy operations, together with the more widespread collateralisation of financial transactions, has raised the fear of encumbrance of bank assets. This risk has not materialised as the list of eligible collateral has been expanded to enable banks to take full advantage of the ECB full-allotment policy, while rigorously applying risk control measures to mitigate liquidity, market and credit risk. But as higher haircuts erode the refinancing power of encumbered assets, there must be an asymptotic limit to the ability of the central bank to provide outside money without endangering its creditworthiness, on which confidence in the currency rests. The notion that central banks have an unlimited capacity to create money is an illusion and thus cannot be used as an excuse not to reform the economy. Overall, the policy measures taken on several fronts were able to stem the risk of a credit flow fallout with related adverse implications for price stability. In particular, the role of bank credit in financing the private sector has been preserved, supported by an increased recourse to debt markets especially by large firms (see slide 6). The sovereign debt crisis and fragmentation of credit markets across national borders My discussion so far has focused on term and liquidity premia, which have taken centre stage since the very beginning of the financial crisis. Starting in May 2010, the crisis was marked by a new phenomenon, until then little known in euro area: the emergence of large and variable credit risk premia in the pricing of supposedly risk-free securities issued by euro area governments. This has led to questions about the creditworthiness of some sovereign issuers and to a fully-fledged sovereign debt crisis.  This new phase of the crisis has taken on several dimensions. The first and most noticeable one has been the large sell-off of government debt issued by sovereigns in precarious fiscal positions (see slide 7). Markets have increased their scrutiny of the fiscal and structural conditions of Member States (the “fundamentals”) and assessed them with an increasing degree of risk aversion. At times, markets have also overreacted to national news and to the political debate at euro area level, with yields subsequently displaying little mean reversion.  Fragmentation of credit market across national borders The second dimension of the debt crisis has been a fragmentation of credit markets across national borders, affecting both banks and the private non-financial sector – in addition to the fragmentation experienced in government debt markets. The tight link between sovereign and bank creditworthiness is clearly visible in the high degree of correlation between sovereign CDS premia and bank CDS premia within the same jurisdiction (see slide 8). Causality runs both ways: banks’ rising funding costs reflect the risk associated with banks’ holdings of bonds issued by their own sovereign; and sovereign risk is exacerbated by the contingent liabilities coming from the perception that the government will have to intervene to rescue the domestic financial system. This creates a self-reinforcing loop between bank and sovereign risks, with doubts about the solvency of the sovereigns feeding doubts about the solvency of the banks, and vice versa. Such dynamics are much weaker in euro area countries considered by markets as financially solid. In the US – an example of a well-integrated fiscal and financial union, with a shock-absorbing capacity at the federal level, credible discipline at state level and a centralised mechanism to supervise and resolve banks – there is no correlation between bank and sovereign CDS premia. With hindsight, the “original sins” of Economic and Monetary Union, an otherwise carefully thought-through and consistent project, were weak fiscal institutions, tolerance of economic imbalances and the lack of an integrated mechanism to supervise and resolve banks. As a matter of fact, financial fragmentation has led to a “two-gear” monetary union, in which the marginal cost of borrowing for banks varies according to the jurisdiction.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  1. Banks belonging to jurisdictions considered by markets as financially sound can generally access the interbank money market and get overnight financing at the EONIA rate, which is currently as low as 0.10%.  2. Banks in jurisdictions where risks and uncertainty are elevated generally have limited access to the interbank money market and rely to a large extent on central bank liquidity, charged at the MRO rate, currently 0.75%.  The distressed funding conditions faced by banks in some parts of the euro area, compounded by expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook, have in turn resulted in fragmented credit conditions for households and firms, again along national borders. For one thing, credit supply standards applied by banks in their lending to the real economy have diverged across euro area countries. A similar message comes from the cross-country comparison of bank lending rates. The 75 basis point cut in the ECB main policy rate implemented in late 2011 has been accompanied by little reaction or even an increase of lending rates in countries under stress, whereas there has been a complete pass-through in euro area countries considered by the markets as financially solid (see slide 9).  Self-fulfilling equilibria driven by break-up fears The third, and most recent, dimension of the debt crisis has taken the form of investor fears of a break-up of the currency union. Whereas exchange rate risk across euro area countries should have disappeared permanently with the creation of the single currency in 1999, there have been signs, especially over the summer, that investors have started pricing in redenomination risk. Investors require a compensation for the risk that the euro might not remain the irreversible currency of the euro area – at least in its current composition.  Although it is difficult to disentangle redenomination premia from other sources of risks – and it requires econometric analysis – the inversion of the slope of the term structure of sovereign bond spreads5 observed in early summer 2012, for instance, for Spain and Italy was consistent with expectations of imminent break-up risks. Market fears of a high probability of not paying back in full, or of equivalently to repaying in a different, lower-valued currency, command high spreads. If the probability of this event concentrates over the short horizon, then the cumulative default probability for longer horizons (bounded overall by 100%) cannot rise much further, and inversion of the spread curve necessarily follows.  Redenomination premia share some similarities with exchange rate premia that were driven out of control in the early 1990s by speculative attacks against the legacy currencies. The early symptoms – inverted sovereign yield curves, at least for some contries – were the same. And the potential of such attacks is known to generate self-fulfilling prophecies.  In early summer 2012 this situation had two main implications. One was for fiscal policy: it needs to deliver sound fundamentals as the only way to lastingly overcome the crisis; but, at the same time, there can be no viable fiscal adjustment that can ensure sustainability if the interest rate faced by the fiscal authority keeps rising and there are severe distortions in government bond markets. The second implication was for monetary policy: the central bank cannot fulfil its mandate to maintain price stability if its policy intentions are not transmitted correctly to the real economy through the chain which forms the basis for monetary policy transmission; but, at the same time, the central bank cannot fulfil its mandate to maintain price stability if the fiscal authority does not fully honour its obligation to pay back its liabilities under all circumstances.                                                  5 To remove the influence of market expectations about future policy rates, it is useful to focus on the term structure in terms of spreads between sovereign bond yields of a given euro area country and benchmark yields – which can be represented by the OIS curve or the term structure of German Bunds. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  How to make these apparently conflicting instances compatible? And how to overcome the deadlock? The ECB policy response: Outright Monetary Transactions  Guidance to answer these questions can be derived from the Maastricht Treaty and the conceptual apparatus developed in the context of the economic literature on monetary vs. fiscal dominance. These insights have made clear that, from an institutional design perspective, central bank independence and a clear focus on price stability6 are necessary but not sufficient to ensure that the central bank can provide a regime of low and stable inflation under all circumstances – in the economic jargon, ensuring “monetary dominance”. Maintaining price stability also requires appropriate fiscal policy. To borrow from Leeper’s terminology,7 this means that an “active” monetary policy – namely a monetary policy that actively engages in the setting of its policy interest rate instrument independently and in the exclusive pursuit of its objective of price stability – must be accompanied by “passive” fiscal policy. A passive fiscal policy means that the fiscal authority must be ready and willing to adjust its policy stance (revenues and primary spending) in such a way as to stabilise its debt at any level of the interest rate that the central bank may choose. Or, to put it another way, borrowing from Woodford’s terminology,8 fiscal policy needs to be “Ricardian”.9  Although the Treaty shows an awareness of the need for consistency between monetary and fiscal policy, in the sense described above, to ensure lasting stability, it did not foresee that fiscal policy could go off track to an extent that requires dedicated institutions and policies able to provide financial assistance, against conditionality, in order to restore sustainability and preserve financial stability in the euro area. The creation of the EFSF/ESM in charge of providing support to euro area Member States in difficulties and enforcing appropriate conditionality has filled this gap. It provides the euro area with a means to restore “Ricardianess”, thereby minimising the risk of “fiscal dominance”.  Against this background, it is easy to understand the ECB’s decision on 6 September to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) in secondary markets for sovereign bonds in the euro area, and to understand the specific framework within which they will be implemented. The aim of OMTs is to preserve the singleness of monetary policy and to ensure the proper transmission of the monetary policy stance to the real economy throughout the euro area. OMTs are intended to provide the ECB with a tool to address severe distortions in government bond markets which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro. Effectively, OMTs represent a means to rule out destructive self-fulfilling prophecies that would force the economy into a sub-optimal equilibrium (with elevated interest rates, adjustments made impossible, ultimately leading to default and currency redenomination).10 Meanwhile, OMTs preserve the incentives for governments to enforce the economic and fiscal adjustments which will prove                                                 6 On the importance of central bank independence and credibility as a means to address possible inconsistencies between monetary and fiscal policy, see, T. Sargent and N. Wallace (1981), “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic”, Quarterly Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Fall. 7  See, E. Leeper (1991), “Equilibria under ‘active’ and ‘passive’ monetary and fiscal policies”, Journal of Monetary Economics 27, 129–147. 8  See, M. Woodford (2001), “Fiscal requirements for price stability”, NBER Working Paper No. 8072. 9 “Ricardian equivalence” implies that forward-looking agents internalise the fact that the government budget will always be adjusted to neutralise fiscal disturbances. However, only a “Ricardian” fiscal policy has this property. 10 O. Jeanne has shown that elevated yields could make inflation more, rather than less likely, due to lack of fiscal adjustment. See O. Jeanne, (2012), “Fiscal challenges to monetary dominance in the euro area: A theoretical perspective”, Banque de France Financial Stability Review, No. 16, pp. 143–150. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  necessary to steer the economy towards the “good” equilibrium. As a consequence, OMTs can succeed only if action is taken by governments, at national and at euro area level, to restore long-term growth and bridge fiscal and economic imbalances. The framework for OMTs is based on six main elements (see slide 10).  First, strict and effective conditionality. A necessary condition for initiating OMTs is that a Member State activates an appropriate EFSF/ESM programme, which envisages strict and effective conditionality spanning the fiscal, macroeconomic, structural and financial spheres. And the design of conditionality and the monitoring of such a programme can largely benefit from the involvement of the IMF. This is however not sufficient. The country also needs to maintain (at least some) market access. And this is signalled by the reference the ECB has made to the need for the EFSF/ESM programme to include the possibility of primary market purchases. In addition, and most importantly, the Governing Council maintains full discretion to initiate OMTs, focusing its assessment exclusively on monetary policy considerations.  The second main element on which the framework for OMTs is based is a built-in exit strategy. OMTs will be terminated when one of the following conditions materialises. OMTs are no longer warranted due to threats to price stability; the aim of OMTs has been achieved; there is non-compliance with the conditionality established in the EFSF/ESM programme. This announced rules-based approach represents a way to address time inconsistency.  Third, OMTs will focus on the shorter part of the yield curve, and in particular on sovereign bonds with a maturity of between one and three years. This underscores the monetary policy nature of such outright transactions, the principle of which was foreseen in the ECB Statute. And it buttresses the OMTs’ aim to address reversibility premia which, as I argued above, have tended to manifest themselves at the short end of the term structure, while addressing the fact that credit risk embedded in longer-term yields should reflect the credibility of countries’ economic and financial adjustment programmes. Fourth, there are no ex ante quantitative limits on the size of OMTs. This makes clear that the ECB is committed to do whatever it takes, within its mandate, to preserve the solidity and irreversibility of the currency. Fifth, the ECB accepts the same (pari passu) treatment as private or other creditors with respect to bonds purchased in the context of OMTs.  Finally, the liquidity created through OMTs will be fully sterilised. This reflects the role of OMTs in counteracting destructive self-fulfilling equilibria rather than altering the aggregate liquidity stance.  The main features of the framework for OMTs outlined here address by design also three concerns or questions sometimes voiced in relation to outright purchases of government bonds by a central bank.  The first concern can be summed up in two questions: are OMTs a form of monetary financing of governments and will inflation be unleashed? The answer to both questions is: No. In fact, quite the opposite. OMTs will be conducive to the monetary authority restoring its power to control credit conditions in the euro area and, through that channel, inflation in the medium term. It thus creates the conditions for a transition from a regime of undisciplined fiscal policies – from a “non-Ricardian” or “active” fiscal policy, using the terminology of the economic literature referred to above – to a regime where fiscal policy respects its inter-temporal obligations – it becomes “Ricardian”, or “passive”. This means that monetary policy has regained its pre-eminence in determining credit conditions and inflation. This renewed assignment of tasks pushes back fiscal dominance and affirms monetary dominance.  The second concern can be formulated in terms of the question: will OMTs bring large risks to the central bank’s balance sheet? The answer again is: no. OMTs establish a second type of interaction: between the central bank, real money investors and households and firms, 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  which save and borrow to finance real economic activity. To the extent that break-up and reversibility premia are squeezed out of bond pricing, real money investors will return to the euro area securities market, and the prices of securities will again better reflect the fundamentals. Households and firms will benefit from restored credit conditions. And the associated widespread reassessment of risks will make market portfolios and the central bank portfolios grow in value. Ultimately, strict and effective conditionality could be seen as acting as a credit enhancement of all euro area portfolios.  The third question is whether OMTs are a form of quantitative easing (QE). The answer is: no. First of all, QE is meant to ease the general credit conditions which are considered by the central bank to have become tight in a situation in which the short-term interest rate cannot be reduced further. OMTs are meant instead to restore homogeneous credit conditions throughout the euro area, but not necessarily to ease credit conditions in the aggregate. In the euro area as a region, there are currently no clear signs of deflation fears (see slide 11) that would justify QE. In addition, the channels of transmission are different. QE is expected to act on risk premia (primarily term premia) by subtracting long-duration securities from the market and replacing them with base money, which has a very short duration. This would reduce term premia and bid up the price of long-dated securities. The aim of OMTs however is not to create an excess demand for duration in the market, but to counteract redenomination risk and squeeze redenomination premia out of bond prices. In fact, OMTs focus on relatively short maturities, where premia associated with break-up risk are most evident. Finally, QE would need to be tailored to the specificities of the euro area, where two-thirds of the external financing of non-financial corporations is extended by banks and which does not have access to actively traded credit markets. Conclusions Let me conclude. The effectiveness of monetary policy relies on the control of monetary and credit conditions. This ability has been severely tested by the crisis. Some of the challenges faced by the ECB have been common to other central banks. The threat to the viability of the interest rate channel, and the consequent need to devise alternative (“non-standard”) measures exploiting other channels of transmission, is a prominent example. The crisis has taught us that the liquidity channel exploited by monetary policy in the euro area can be very powerful. It has allowed the ECB to maintain the flow of credit to the real economy and ensure price stability even in face of the soaring liquidity and funding risks experienced by banks during the crisis.  Other challenges faced by the ECB have taken a specific form in the euro area and thus been somewhat different from those experienced by central banks elsewhere. The most obvious one is the sovereign debt crisis, with the associated fragmentation of credit markets across national borders and more recently the break-up fears. The destructive potential of these developments is enormous. This has led the ECB to recently announce its Outright Monetary Transactions in secondary markets for sovereign bonds as a means to safeguard the monetary policy transmission mechanism in all countries of the euro area and to counteract self-fulfilling prophecies. The design of OMTs has been inspired by the desire to affirm in a lasting manner “monetary dominance”, in compliance with the principles enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.  Going forward, the ECB remains committed to do whatever it takes to comply with its mandate of maintaining price stability in the euro area.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Christian Noyer: It was vital to break the adverse feedback loop between bank and sovereign risk Interview with Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, in Les Échos, 17 September 2012. *      *      * Do the ECB’s announcement to purchase sovereign debt and the German Constitutional Court’s approval of the European Stability Mechanism mark a turning point in the crisis? These announcements were welcomed by the markets and the outlook now appears much clearer. The European Stability Mechanism is a key factor for strengthening the cohesion of the euro area and demonstrates that the euro is here to stay and irreversible. It will help ailing economies return to competitiveness and growth. The Governing Council’s decision to purchase, subject to appropriate conditions, government debt is reassuring for at least three reasons: purchases are potentially unlimited, which should end speculation about the possible collapse of the euro area; the strict conditionality will oblige countries to pursue their fiscal consolidation efforts; lastly, these purchases fall squarely within the ECB’s mandate as they are conducted in the secondary market and aim to ensure the proper transmission of the policy stance to the real economy. The ECB has played its role. What must governments now do? Euro area Member States need to restore their credibility and they are already making efforts to do so. Some have had to implement austerity plans and others, less drastically, are undertaking structural reforms and continuing to reduce their government deficits. This is the case of France. Even if these efforts appear moderate compared to those of other countries, they are necessary for our market credibility. Brussels has presented its proposals for a European bank supervisory mechanism; are they in line with your expectations? Yes, they are. The developments of the financial crisis have brought to light one of the euro area’s fragilities: the link between bank and sovereign risk. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, governments bailed out their banking systems and, in doing so, established a nexus between sovereign debt and local banking systems, which interferes with monetary policy transmission. When the euro area sovereign debt crisis erupted, bank refinancing conditions became correlated with sovereign risk, with the consequences that we have witnessed for ailing countries. The large amount of liquidity provided by the Eurosystem has reduced this impact, but funding costs have remained very high in some countries. It was therefore essential to decouple sovereign risk from bank risk. The banking union will ensure a sounder monetary union.  Germany has expressed doubts as to the proposed set-up, in particular with respect to the number of banks covered by the ECB. Could this prove a threat going forward? The proposed union implies a transfer of sovereignty from States to the ECB, which Germany has always wished for. As regards the scope of supervision by the ECB, there were no doubts that all banks had to be covered. The problems often stem from small- or medium-sized banks, as we saw in Ireland and Spain. To ensure credibly vis-à-vis the markets, across-the-board coverage is necessary. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  In practice, how will the tasks be divided between national supervisors and the ECB? The legal responsibility for supervision would be transferred to the ECB, but in concrete terms, national supervisors would continue to supervise banks on a day-to-day basis. In fact, it is a mechanism similar that of the Eurosystem: under the authority of the Governing Council, the supervision committee, bringing together the ECB and the heads of national supervisory authorities, will coordinate supervisory actions and the allocation of tasks with the national supervisors. In practice, the ECB would be responsible for major decisions regarding prudential supervision: assessing capital adequacy in relation to risk, compliance with regulations, etc. I would also like the ECB to have decision-making powers in dealing with cases of distressed banks. Questions remain as to division of powers between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA) The distribution of tasks seems clear to me: the EBA is the European body responsible for banking supervision. It sets prudential rules and standards and ensures that they are applied; the ECB will be the euro area bank supervisor. The EBA’s governance arrangements will have to be changed slightly, as the Commission proposes, to take account of the banking union. The UK has nothing to fear from the creation of a single euro area supervisor. What would have changed if the European supervision system had have been in place, for example for the Crédit immobilier de France (CIF)? Technically, not a lot. Instead of the French Autorité de contrôle prudentiel, the ECB would have asked the CIF to increase its capital. But make no mistake, banking supervision is not a catch-all insurance. In the case of the CIF, we were aware of its fragility stemming from its increasing refinancing difficulties and we knew that there were longer-term liquidity risks. The CIF is a textbook case where a downgrade by ratings agency expedited the disclosure of funding problems. Would you say that Moody’s was responsible for this situation? No, the primary responsibility lies with its management, which was unable to find a merger solution when it was possible and we had asked it to do so. Did you lack coercive power in this case? Yes, definitely. We have very great powers when an institution does not comply with regulations, but we do not have powers that enable us to prevent a crisis. As things stand, we can appoint temporary administrators if need be or revoke an authorisation, but we do not have powers of resolution allowing us to impose the restructuring of a banking group or transfers of assets. We worked on a draft regulation before the European project started to be discussed, but we underestimated the length of time needed to arrive at a European proposal. I regret this somewhat as it would have been useful for us. Is the French banking system still sufficiently robust? In fact, French banks are increasingly robust as they are reducing their risks and increasing their capital. The reduction of risk has resulted from the selling-off of business lines, often abroad, and a scaling-back of some market activities; the increase in their capital reflects the setting aside of profits that remain substantial thanks, in particular, to the resilience of retail banking in the face of the economic slowdown. Their core tier 1 capital grew by 0.5 percentage point in the second quarter and they have exceeded the target set by the EBA. In terms of liquidity, they have managed very well the withdrawal of US money market funds last year by adjusting their assets, as well as the rebalancing of their sovereign bond portfolios. This goes to show that, if it is based on a sound internal model, the universal banking model works well. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Do you remain opposed to the separation of investment and retail activities? I really do not understand the benefit of this principle of separating activities. The only thing I wish to see is the outright prohibition of speculative activities and stronger internal controls for the risks associated with market activities. Otherwise, banks should be able to serve their customers, whether they are private individuals, companies or institutions, in all of their operations – on bond markets, forex and hedging operations, and creating savings products. For all of these reasons, I do not fully understand the concept of separation, whereas I do understand that of stopping speculation. At the same time as bank failures are continuing, banks have obtained an easing of their liquidity constraints under Basel III. Isn’t this a paradox? That's not what it’s about. We have always believed that a liquidity ratio was necessary – and, incidentally, we have applied our national rules for many years, which is not the case everywhere. But the draft agreement was finalised too quickly and we had to rework it. We need to strike the right balance between strict regulation and supporting the financing of the economy. But will the timetable be put back? Yes, I am in favour of putting it back a bit, if necessary, in order to make these major trade-offs and to give banks more time for the implementation phase so that they can adapt to the new standards. Should banks carry less sovereign debt? Banks should facilitate the financing of the economy; from this point of view, they should not hold huge quantities of sovereign bonds, even if these constitute liquid assets that are precious in assets and liabilities management. But the excessive concentration of liquid assets on sovereign debt in the calculation of the liquidity ratio can run into difficulties – either when the sovereign has its rating substantially downgraded or, on the contrary, when the country has low levels of debt, such as Australia or Switzerland. Will the long-term liquidity constraint, the NSFR, eventually be abandoned? We will work on it again as of next year. Should the Solvency II standards for insurers also be delayed? We have a particular problem concerning long-term business lines (i.e. life insurance, civil liability, construction). Designed before the crisis, this system of standards, which adjusts portfolio assets according to their market value, is not suited to a highly volatile environment like the one we have seen for the past five years. We need therefore to ask again the fundamental question: are the basic assumptions underlying Solvency II correct? And we need to seek to reduce volatility by getting closer to economic reality. Here again, we should not set rules too quickly the impact of which may be very great but has not been fully assessed in times of crisis. I think that it would be fruitful to try out several different technical solutions over a number of years before laying down the final rules. In any event, I recommend that French insurers continue with their preparations in order to be ready technically in 2014 as if the standards were going to enter into force as scheduled. Is the programme of job cuts that you have just announced for the Banque de France sufficient when compared with staff levels at other central banks? I find the accusations about the supposedly excessive staff levels at the Banque de France exasperating. They are based on spurious international comparisons since other central banks – such as the Bank of England – do not print their own banknotes, do not (yet) incorporate the banking supervisor and do not perform tasks such as the management of 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  over indebtedness, which is entrusted to the Banque de France by law. More than 200,000 households debt applications processed every year is no mean feat! We have already made a great effort over the past few years as our staff levels have been cut by nearly 20% in ten years. And we will continue with this effect; but it is based on a detailed analysis of our activities and requires substantial investment in order to increase productivity. Our programme is ambitious but in keeping with the reality of the tasks we perform and respectful of our employees. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Prasarn Trairatvorakul: Post-crisis recovery – Asian lessons for Europe Speech by Dr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the OMFIF Golden Series Lecture, London, 12 September 2012. *      *      * Distinguished guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am honored and delighted to be part of the Golden Series Lecture and would like to thank OMFIF for the kind invitation. Events such as these provide an opportunity for us to exchange views on topical issues that are at the center of international finance and I am keen to learn from the perspective of our audience. Fifteen years ago the Asian crisis forced us to go through painful adjustments and far reaching economic and financial reforms. We had to embrace legal, regulatory and governance reforms, while our business sector had to deleverage and our bankers became much more prudent and risk conscious. Today, the world is witnessing another crisis not dissimilar to ours and I have been asked to share with you some lessons from the Asian financial crisis. This is somewhat ironic as we in Asia look to Europe as a role model and a benchmark in our integration efforts. Individually we are all small states and find it difficult to compete for foreign investment without the attraction of size and economy of scale. So my talk today will be a modest contribution to the current debate on the challenge of post crisis recovery. I will start with a brief recap of the Asian crisis, drawing some lessons and comparison with the European debt crisis. I would briefly discuss the economic setting and policy reform that brought Asia out of the crisis and end with some thoughts and reflections on the post crisis recovery period. Ladies and gentlemen, As a well-known American author, Mark Twain puts it, “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme”. So despite the differences in the context and details of both the Asian and the European crises, the underlying root causes are not dissimilar. First, both crises, like most others in the recent economic history of the world, are often associated with the mispricing of risk and distorted incentives structures. In the case of Asia, our problem was both a currency and a banking crisis. We had to abandon the pegged exchange rate system which led to massive devaluation of our currency. With the corporate sector largely overleveraged and loaded with foreign debt, the sharp depreciation of the currency technically bankrupted firms overnight. Banks NPLs shot up and brought on with it the banking crisis. It was clear that the region’s “original sin” was well beyond redemption. We borrowed in foreign currencies and used it to finance projects that did not generate foreign exchange earning to service such a debt. In the case of Thailand, the amount of private external debt was over three times the level of international reserves. Given the healthy public finances in Thailand (with 9 years of fiscal surplus prior to 1997), the expanding foreign private sector debt was interpreted as a sign of euphoria and confidence in the emergence of a new tiger of Asia. In Europe, a similar story of mispricing occurred when some peripheral nations were able to access financing at a much cheaper rate than the country’s underlying credit rating would have allowed them to do so - and this was made possible out of sheer membership of the Euro zone. A single currency and a convergence in risk rating, like our 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  fixed exchange rate, gave the market a false sense of security that encouraged borrowing beyond our means and without proper risk management. Second, both crises occurred as a result of a failure to fulfill the necessary “pre-conditions”. In Asia, they were preconditions for liberalization, and in Europe they were preconditions for integration. A number of Asian countries embarked on ambitious liberalization programs with insufficient safeguards, appropriate infrastructure and policy tools. Liberalizing capital flows while still maintaining a fixed exchange rate system eventually ran up against the impossible trinity. The country must give up control over monetary policy. Recourse to macroprudential policies to stem the excessive bank credit expansion and asset price inflation, was not well-known then. Along the same line, the currency union proceeded without the necessary preconditions for integration. Countries entered the union with large diversities both in terms of economic development and competitiveness, and in the absence of fiscal, and banking union. On the whole, these countries were victims of their own success. The “reckless optimism” prior to both episodes of crisis had ultimately led the countries to face similar consequences of severe market stress and capital flight, albeit with different symptoms: for Asia, losses incurred in the private sector’s balance sheet, for Europe, public sector balance sheet was impaired. Ladies and gentlemen, Let’s now look at how Asia got out of the crisis and whether such conditions are available for Europe. At the onset of the Asian crisis, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand built up large private short term external debt while high private credit growth fueled the bubble in the stock and property markets. Once the crisis hit, these countries faced sharp capital reversal of up to 10% and 12.5%1 of GDP in 1998 for Korea and Thailand respectively and a massive devaluation of the currency soon followed. Some of us were forced to seek international assistance (IMF) or, in the case of Malaysia2, to undertake rigorous self-reform and an eventual unorthodox measure on exchange and capital flows. Notwithstanding the different approaches, these steps were all painful yet critical for economic recovery. By 1998, the current account balance of the four countries became positive, helping to improve the national account and restore consumer confidence. GDP growth subsequently returned to positive territory by the second quarter of 1999. Two differences stand out between Asia and Europe. The first is policy flexibility. The devaluation of the exchange rate helped restore export competitiveness of the Asian economies. However, this freedom of flexibility might not be practical for Europe given its single currency setting and political complexities. The second is the supportive global economy, which provided the necessary market for Asia and allowed Asia to export our way out of the crisis. Global GDP registered a 4.7% growth in 2000 with advanced economies, the world’s largest consumer, growing at 4.1%. In contrast, the global setting of the current European sovereign debt crisis is not                                                 1  BOT’s staff computation from CEIC data. 2  Malaysia’s policy mix started out with an initial fiscal and monetary tightening, a conventional IMF-like measure, followed by a reversed loosening of macroeconomic policies. The insufficiency of these policies to restore confidence led the country to resort to exchange and capital control which yielded positive result. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  as favorable. Global and advanced economies growth turned to a negative territory of 0.6% and 3.4% respectively in 2009. Emerging and developing economies, increasingly feeling the pinch of the global slowdown, witnessed the continued slowdown of their GDP growth from 8.7% in 2007 to just 2.8% in 2009. I believe that there may be other success factors for the European story. But, we have to bear in mind that some of the success factors are not without costs that remain to be addressed. In the case of Asia, the sharp devaluation and swift recovery in exports led the Asian economies to become addicted to large volume of export at low prices. And, in the case of Thailand, with little incentive to invest in research and development to raise the products’ value and enhance human capital, the average growth of labor productivity3 had trended down from the 1990s to 2000s. Ladies and gentlemen, This brings me to my third part on the lessons from the Asian financial crisis. I would like to offer three reflections that may not necessarily pertain to Europe but may provide food for thought for policymakers. First, conventional policy prescriptions may not be appropriate for unusual circumstances and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Asia was a case in point of ill-timed austerity measures. Public sector debt in Thailand then was less than 15% of GDP; yet the policy prescription for Thailand was to tighten fiscal policy and maintain tight monetary policy, resulting in (interbank) interest rate rising from 10% at the beginning of 1997 to over 20% at the end of 1997. With large private external debt beyond the ability of the country to service, a way out should have been debt restructuring with international creditors to give the country a breathing space and avoid the painful shock from the sharp reversal in capital. This was made possible only in the case of Korea which has helped the country recover from the crisis and was able to bring down interest rate much faster than other crisis countries. The case of Indonesia further led the IMF to reform towards more careful and focused policy prescription. The abrupt close-down of Indonesian commercial banks under the IMF program added to a sense of panic, which led to a broad-based bank run. Moreover, the conditionalities did not focus on the more critical macroeconomic adjustments which were directly related to the problems of the crisis but also included unrelated changes such as requirement to abolish import restrictions on all new and used ships. Secondly, policymakers must be ready to take away the punch bowl. In the past we used to talk about monetary policy being on the alert to take away the punch bowl. This crisis has proven that public policy in general need to observe this principle as well. Fiscal policy must guard against falling into the populist trap. Financial supervisors also need to be vigilant and watch out for signs of excessive credit creation, and act pre-emptively for the cost of cleaning up the crisis far outweigh the brief euphoria and exuberance of the moment. Central bank must maintain independence and credibility in order to voice and conduct appropriate policies that may not be favored politically. Going forward, I view that there is a need for international institution that oversees all finance-related conducts to ensure strict compliance of rule, implementation of ethical codes and avoid double standard across nations. Lastly, continuous and collective reforms are vital. Crisis is a recurring phenomenon and no lessons from previous crisis will ever fully prevent the next one. But through the process of reform after each crisis, the market grows and becomes more efficient. Crises provide a window or “political feasibility” to undertake needed structural changes that                                                 3  International Labor Organization (ILO).

I am pleased to see numerous improvements in key areas of finance and supervision such as the use of macroprudential measures to complement traditional monetary policy tools. It is also more acceptable to require banks to provision in good times against losses in bad times, for after all most bad loans are made in good times. In addition to structural reforms, change in “mindset” is probably the most important. In order to keep up with the dynamic global environment, we may need to challenge and correct some of our old beliefs. Let me name a few – 1) sovereign is no longer risk-free, 2) we are taught to value economies of scale but are now confronted with the too-big-to-exist problem and 3) banks should no longer be only international in life but also in death as crises are more and more systemic given the growing interconnectedness. Spillover and contagion were witnessed in 1997 where the turbulence spread from Thailand to South East Asia and to Russia, China and Brazil, as it was a decade later in 2007 where the crisis widened from US and EU to the rest of the world. Imagine the pace of the spread of crisis in the next 10 years in 2017 – where crises would grow in size and speed beyond the management capacity of a single nation, real collective action is called for. Most importantly, we have to be forward-looking and well prepared. As crises are prone to occur more frequently with larger spillover, reform must be continued during normal times. It is imperative that the public is on board and support the reform effort to raise the competitiveness of the country, and minimize vulnerabilities or imbalances that may be triggered by external factors through no fault of their own. Ladies and gentlemen, Let me conclude by offering an observation that in 2002, five years after 1997 crisis, Asian economies had fully recovered, in particular, Thailand was able to repay the IMF package some two years ahead of the schedule. Today, four years after the Lehman crisis, more work remains ahead of us. At this critical juncture, it might come down to policy action, which entails clarity, commitment and credibility, to progress onwards. Indeed, there are always benefits from looking back to the do’s and don’ts in the rear mirror but it is of greater importance to be looking forward in the windshield. As such, for Asia and other non- crisis country, in this era of growing uncertainties, complacency is a luxury we can ill afford. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fernando Restoy: Remarks on banking union Remarks by Mr Fernando Restoy, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the round table “Systemic risk and securities markets”, II International Conference on Securities Markets, held by the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), Madrid, 14 September 2012. *      *      * Let me first thank the organisers for their kind invitation to participate in this event held by the CNMV, of which I was Vice-Chairman from 2008 until my recent appointment in the Banco de España. I also had the privilege to participate in the highly successful conference organised in 2011. A glance at the quality of the papers and speakers in the programme of this conference is sufficient to confirm that the organisers have succeeded in maintaining the high standards achieved last year. Our Chairman today, Oscar Arce, deserves much credit for that. I am sure that the CNMV’s new top management – who will be taking over in a few weeks – will continue to support this event, as the President Julio Segura and myself did the first two editions. The current financial crisis has shown up numerous deficiencies in the functioning of the global economic and financial system. Many of those deficiencies are the consequence of imperfect rules, policy mistakes and inappropriate conduct by private agents. Some of those deficiencies are the subject of an on-going policy debate and of regulatory reform which, with varying degrees of ambition, is taking place in different jurisdictions. However, in addition to imperfect rules and policy actions, the crisis has revealed a series of institutional deficiencies which need to be eliminated in order to restore economic and financial stability. The clearest example in this regard is probably the European institutional framework. Over the last three years we have witnessed how the perception of country risks has climbed to very high levels as a consequence of both sovereign credit risk as well as the so-called redenomination risk. This development has impeded the adequate functioning of monetary union by leading to sizeable differences in the financing conditions for agents located in different States within the monetary union and by instigating the renationalisation of financial markets. There can be no doubt that much of what has happened is directly linked to the significant macroeconomic and financial imbalances accumulated by several euro area countries, as well as to the emergence of vulnerabilities within the financial sector. It is also clear that the main remedy for those destabilising developments lies in effective adjustment of domestic policies, which is currently being implemented in those countries suffering the most significant stress. But, at the same time, the elimination of any perception of redenomination risks can only be fully accomplished if – in addition to the required domestic policy action – the central bank is fully and credibly committed to intervening in sovereign markets as far as is necessary to avoid the pricing of sovereign risk becoming self-fulfilling. In that regard, the recent announcement by the European Central Bank of its determination to conduct unlimited intervention in the sovereign secondary markets, provided effective conditionality is fulfilled, constitutes a significant step towards the normalisation of market conditions in the euro area. Yet, the return to a smoothly operating monetary union cannot be completely achieved by simply relying on ad-hoc reactions by policy-makers. Institutional arrangements must be reviewed in order to restore adequate incentives for domestic authorities to prevent the reemergence of destabilising imbalances and to ensure that any residual risks arising in specific jurisdictions that could affect the area as a whole would be addressed by integrated mechanisms operating at the euro area level. The recent changes introduced in the European Union to strengthen the requirements and the mechanism for the surveillance of domestic fiscal policies and structural reforms, together with the creation of the EFSF and the ESM – which we now know will be soon be launched – are good examples of the required institutional reforms. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  At the same time, a specific source of risks for the smooth functioning of monetary union that needs to be addressed directly is the financial instability experienced in specific jurisdictions. As we have seen in the last few years, the deterioration of the perceived solvency of financial institutions located in specific countries within the monetary union can have spill-over effects across the financial sector as a whole, can contribute to a disorderly functioning of wholesale markets and can put great stress on the public finances of the countries affected. Consequently, the soundness of financial institutions is of systemic importance within the monetary union and should therefore be preserved through the appropriate integrated crisis prevention and resolution mechanism. Against this background, a consensus has emerged of unprecedented strength on the need to take steps to create a banking union. The first step would be the adoption of a single supervisory mechanism. A regulatory proposal for such a mechanism has been released this week by the European Commission. The proposal has three main features. First, the assignment to the ECB of supervisory responsibilities for all banks in the euro area, and possibly also for banks in countries outside the euro zone willing to enter into cooperation arrangements with the ECB. Second, the adoption of mechanisms to ensure that the ECB’s supervisory tasks are strictly separated from the conduct of its monetary policy. Third, the involvement of national supervisors in the preparation and implementation of decisions. The proposal is in my view well founded. In particular, it makes sense to subject all financial institutions in the euro area to a single supervisory mechanism. Recent experience shows that the instability of medium-sized or small institutions with limited links to other European institutions may sometimes generate disruption at both the national and the euro area level. Moreover, the coexistence of different supervisory regimes for institutions sharing the same market place may generate competitive distortions, which should be avoided. Similarly, it is important to establish institutional mechanisms to mitigate any potential conflict between the objectives pursued by the supervisory and the monetary policy functions. I believe that the crisis has already helped to allay our concerns about the extent to which those conflicts could actually arise in practice. Indeed, most central banks have understood that financial stability considerations should be taken into account when designing monetary policy measures without challenging the priority that should be given to the price stability objective. In any case, from a procedural point of view it seems reasonable for the Governing Council of the ECB – the interest-rate setting body – to make relatively extensive delegations to the Supervisory Board envisaged in the draft regulation as the operational body through which the ECB will exercise its new supervisory functions. Finally, on the involvement of national supervisory authorities, the draft regulation envisages a model under which the ECB will have ultimate responsibility for the tasks conferred on it by the new regulation. In performing the new functions, the ECB will however take full advantage of the expertise of national authorities. The principle under which national central banks and supervisory authorities are to help in preparing and implementing decisions is an essential ingredient of the new supervisory mechanism. At the same time, it is probably reasonable to develop that model in such a way that the principle of delegation is flexibly used so as to take into account the different nature of the supervised financial institutions and the specific supervisory functions to be performed. Although the involvement of national authorities should always be required, the ECB should normally participate more directly when institutions of systemic importance and actions of a strategic nature are involved. The draft regulation foresees that the ECB will start performing its functions through national supervisors already in January next year and that the new system will be fully operational in 2014. That is quite a demanding timetable. I can well understand the need to speed things up as much as possible as the new system should already be being used to help solve the problems the euro area is facing now. That includes the possibility it will open for direct recapitalisation of financial institutions requiring public aid by the European Stability Mechanism, thereby helping to mitigate the destabilising association of sovereign and financial risk. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  It is probably reasonable to expect that the overall supervisory framework should evolve over time beyond January 2014. In particular the distribution of responsibilities between the centre and the national authorities could naturally change as a result of the accumulation of expertise in the ECB and the progress made in developing the other two pillars of banking union: namely, an integrated resolution regime and a common deposit guarantee scheme. Indeed, the idea that a fully effective banking union requires also the establishment of those two additional components is quite compelling in my view. Moreover, it could be argued that the combination of a centralised supervisory mechanism with decentralised resolution schemes may generate some dysfunctionalities and incentive compatibility issues. More importantly, the mitigation of destabilising financial risks and of their impact on sovereign risks requires not only a strong crisis prevention scheme, but also an effective common crisis resolution regime. Even if banks are supervised under a common system, episodes of financial distress may still deteriorate the perceived cohesion of the eurozone if purely domestic mechanisms are used to restructure or resolve weak banks and to protect depositors. That is conceptually contradictory with the goals of a banking union. In that context, the communication by the Commission to shortly make legislative proposals in this area above and beyond the Directives which are currently under discussion is obviously welcomed. In any event, there is a lot of work to be done in the short term to put in place the new unified supervisory mechanism. At present, important differences remain between the characteristics of the national supervisory models which affect powers, means, practices and procedures. The use of permanent on-site supervision, the link between off-site supervision and on-site inspections or the powers of the supervisory authority (if any) in relation to accounting regulations, are simply some examples. Differences between national supervisors also exist regarding the availability of data. To give you an example, Central Credit Registers – which in our experience are a highly valuable source of information for prudential supervision purposes – are not yet available in all jurisdictions. The EBA has played a very important role by improving cooperation between national supervisors and promoting supervisory convergence. But these improvements fall short of the needs of an effectively unified supervisory system. Substantial and swift progress in this field is therefore needed. Let me just finish by making a general comment. It is obvious that the creation of a banking union poses enormous challenges for Europe that will require strong political support and effective cooperation among all authorities involved. The good news is that if we look at the process of European integration from a historical perspective, we realise that this is not the first time that the way forward has been highly complex. And, past experience has regularly shown that the response has always been to deepen integration and increase the transfer of national powers to the Union as the best – and possibly only – way to preserve all the achievements made so far.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Michael Gondwe: Mobile payments and mobile banking in Zambia Opening address by Dr Michael Gondwe, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the 4th Annual Celpay Mobile Payments Conference, Lusaka, 12 September 2012. *      *      * • The Chairman of the Board of Celpay Zambia, Dr. Jacob Mwanza  • The Chief Executive of Celpay International, Mr. Lazarus Muchenje  • Senior Government officials  • Representatives of Embassies  • Chief Executives Officers of Commercial banks and Financial Institutions  • Representatives of International Business Organisations  • Representatives of Zambian Business Organisations  • Distinguished participants  • Members of the press  • Ladies and Gentlemen  It is an honour and privilege to officiate at the 4th Mobile Payments Conference being hosted by Celpay Zambia Limited under the theme “1st Decade Mobile Payments, 2nd Decade Universal Mobile Banking services”. The Theme for this conference is appropriate and timely as it provides an opportunity for participants, and especially stakeholders, to not only reflect on what has been a decade of tremendous achievement and growth, where major changes have occurred in banking due to the introduction of mobile payments and mobile banking, but also an opportunity to gaze into the future and take a pioneering role in charting out how mobile payments can ultimately provide more banking services remotely, and away from traditional banking. It is now accepted that the advent of the internet coupled with the emergence of mobile phones have greatly enriched the banking experience whilst simultaneously serving as the core technologies assisting Africans and most of the developed world to start accessing financial services.  Mr. Chairman, I am extremely proud that this mobile banking and mobile payments revolution that has changed the face of banking forever was started right here in Lusaka, Zambia by Celpay Zambia, who on April 24, 2002 made the very first mobile payment and in doing so ignited a banking revolution that is bringing affordable, accessible payments and banking services to previously financially excluded societies and families. I would like to congratulate Celpay on this momentous achievement and on their 10th Anniversary. I trust that as you go through your deliberations over the next two days, this pioneering spirit will be enthused into your discussions and debates and you will chart the way forward for the next decade so that more banking services can be delivered through this innovative channel to even more people.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take a moment to dwell on the global environment. Since 2008 the world has gone through an unprecedented financial crisis, which led to the collapse of some major global financial institutions and also resulted in some countries requiring significant amounts of debt to bail them out of the crisis.  This environment has ameliorated somewhat, but continues to simmer in the Eurozone, where Greece, notably, has gone through some major difficulties. The affected countries in many cases have been the traditional donor and investor countries. The knock on effect of these changes is that many corporations have scaled back on their corporate expansion 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  plans, donor countries and donor organizations have also put in place austerity measures resulting in less donor funding globally.  Chairperson, I am sure you would agree that against this background, it becomes imperative to ensure that the financial sector is sound and can withstand shocks, whether from within or external, as well as to have the capacity and capital to support local ventures including large corporate expansion programs.  We have seen moves aimed at ensuring stability of the financial sector in places such as Nigeria and Ghana, where the capital requirements for banks were raised in recent times. In Zambia we have also introduced new capital requirements for Commercial banks that have to be in place by the end of this year. I am happy to inform you that the Bank of Zambia is working with each Commercial Bank to ensure that this requirement is met in order to strengthen the banking industry in Zambia.  Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bank of Zambia has also embarked on some key projects that shall have a lasting and beneficial bearing on the Zambian economy, such as the rebasing of the Zambian currency as well as the branchless banking initiative.  The currency rebasing shall be implemented effective 1 January 2013, and is expected to bring efficiency in the Zambian currency as a medium of exchange and store of value. As you may be aware, the Bank is re-introducing coins which will encourage the use of mechanisms such as pay phones, vending machines, car parking meters and other related technologies.  Mr. Chairperson, According to the Finscope Zambia survey conducted in 2009 only 33,7% of Zambian adults have access to financial services, leaving 66,3% financially excluded. This is despite the growth in the number of banks and indeed branches in Zambia. It is obvious that at the current growth rate of the penetration of banking services, if this is left to traditional banks alone, it may mean that the majority of Zambians will be financially excluded for a long time to come.  Ladies and Gentlemen, given the above challenge, it is quite appropriate to conclude that the mobile payments industry provides Zambia with a unique opportunity to accelerate the provision of banking services in rural and remote areas at an affordable cost to the Zambian people. To this extent I am happy to inform you that since the enactment of the National Payments Systems Act of 2007, when we only had one designated Payments Business, which was Celpay, the Bank of Zambia has now registered 28 Designated Payments Businesses. The Bank continues to encourage growth of the mobile payments sector and other initiatives that promote financial inclusiveness. For instance, the Bank supports the initiative of Branchless Banking as an innovative way of growing the banking industry.  Mr Chairperson, another important facet in the development of the mobile payments industry shall be the ability of the individual payments systems to interoperate and settle real time across different payment systems through shared infrastructure. This should be one of the objectives of the Zambia Payments Systems Association, and therefore urge that the Association adopts this objective as part of their medium term plan. The Bank of Zambia welcomes initiative that will bring down costs and ultimately make mobile payments services affordable to the people.  Ladies and Gentlemen, the conference theme looks to the next decade in mobile banking and talks about universal mobile services, I am glad that this theme is being explored here. Our understanding of this theme is twofold: firstly, that in the next decade all adult Zambians will have access to financial services and secondly that financial services shall be available to the majority of our people through this delivery mechanism. This is indeed an ambitious target and can only be achieved through forums like this one where industry experts come together to share ideas and chart the way forward. As the regulator the Bank shall continue to provide policy guidance and regulations that are clear and unambiguous in support of the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  growth of this industry. Further, our obligations extend to ensuring that as these technological advancements occur:  1. The consumer remains protected;  2. Anti Money laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing regulations are in place; and  3. Business continuity is assured.  Chairperson, I wish you good deliberations over the next two days, the Bank of Zambia will be expecting a report from the conference. I wish to thank Celpay for once again arranging and hosting this event, and I congratulate you on your 10th Anniversary.  I now declare the 4th Annual Celpay Mobile Payments Conference officially open.  I thank you and may you have inspired deliberations. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  K C Chakrabarty: Indian economy – imperatives for second generation reforms Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the inaugural session of the State level seminar, organized by the Department of Economics of the Vivekananda Education Society’s College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Mumbai, 14 September 2012. *      *      * The assistance provided by Smt. Rekha Misra and Shri S.M. Lokare in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged. Dr. Suresh Kotak, Chairman, Kotak and Co. Ltd.; Dr. J. Phadnis, Principal of the VES College of Arts, Science and Commerce; Shri B.L. Boolani, Trustee In-charge; Dr. Suniti Nagpurkar, Head of the Economics Department and Convener of the Seminar, Mrs. Dipta Dasgupta, my old friend from the Banaras Hindu University; faculty members and students participating in the Seminar, Ladies and Gentlemen. It is, indeed, a matter of great pleasure and privilege for me that I have been called upon to address today’s Seminar, which indeed is topical, given the changing contours of the financial regulatory architecture amidst uncertain global financial market environment. The global banking and financial system is currently undergoing structural transformation with standard setting institutions and national authorities framing new regulatory paradigms to address the weaknesses of the global financial system that surfaced during the crisis. Against this backdrop, I am delighted that the Vivekananda Education Society is conducting this State level Seminar on this subject. The Vivekananda Education Society, which started its educational activities in 1962, today imparts education to more than 18000 students ranging from primary school to advanced learning in diverse areas such as management, law, engineering, science, etc. With a mission of “Pursuit of Excellence in Higher Education”, the society has sought to impart quality education and help in character building in students. I am told that the society and this college in particular, were set up to cater to the needs of the socially and economically weaker sections of the population, in line with the recognition that education provides opportunities for improvement in quality of life of these deprived sections. I congratulate the Society for completion of 50 glorious years and commend its achievements over this period. I hope that it continues its good work in the times to come. I must admit that interacting with a gathering of teachers and students provides us with an opportunity to get a different perspective on issues from what we normally get while interacting with fellow finance professionals. Besides, interacting with teachers provides a platform to convey our ideas, through you, to a much larger audience consisting of young minds who will define the path that the country and the financial sector will take in the years to come. It is, hence, a great pleasure for me to be here today. Swami Vivekananda – a great reformer himself On the eve of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Vivekananda Education Society, it is apt to recall Swami Vivekananda, from whom the College derives its name and inspiration. Swami Vivekananda was a great thinker and reformer of India who envisioned a new educational model for the society. His valuable thoughts on education are relevant and viable even today. According to him, “education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man”. He said “mere book-learning won’t do. We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one’s own feet”. He taught that it is only through education that the upliftment of masses is possible. However, Swami Vivekananda’s scheme of education, through which he wanted to build a strong nation that will lead the world towards peace and harmony, is still a far cry. It is high time that we give serious thought to his philosophy of education and remember his 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  call to every-body – “Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.” I hope the society pursues this vision of Swami Vivekananda. Swamiji’s most unique contribution to the creation of new India was to open the minds of Indians to their duty to the downtrodden masses. He was the first religious leader in India to understand and openly declare that the real cause of India’s deep rooted problems was the neglect of the masses. Long before the ideas of Karl Marx were known in India, Swamiji spoke about the role of the labouring classes in the production of the country’s wealth. Having said this, let me come back to the realm of financial sector reforms in India. As many of you are aware, the Indian financial sector has seen wide ranging reforms during the last two decades. However, these reforms were broader and focused at the macro level with internal reforms at the institutional level yet to take place. Thus, the need of the hour is to go for second generation reforms. Nonetheless, the reforms in the financial sector alone will not bring perpetual prosperity. It is the real sector which needs reforms. The financial sector has to grow and keep pace with the developments in the real sector. Why financial sector regulation? On an intuitive basis, the business of finance and banking is different from other businesses. This is on account of the fact that while other businesses operate with their own funds, banks are highly leveraged institutions that operate with public money and hence, require to be closely regulated and supervised. Besides, unlike other businesses where, due to absence of entry barriers, free market competition can be expected to ensure efficiency and fair treatment of customers, in the banking business, high entry barriers imply that banking operations cannot be carried out without a license. This restricts the free play of competitive forces and hence, makes it all the more imperative to have a sound regulatory framework, particularly for protection of customers. In the business of banking and finance, there is an inherent inequity between the provider of the service and the consumer and this, again, presents the need for a framework of rules and procedures, which we call as regulation. The health of the financial sector is a matter of public policy concern in view of its critical contribution to economic performance. Financial regulation and supervision assumes importance in ensuring that the financial system operates along sound lines. The primary justification for financial regulation by authorities is to prevent systemic risk, avoid financial crises, protect depositors’ interest and reduce asymmetry of information between depositors and banks. As the costs of financial crises are perceived to be very high, the authorities realised that they should be avoided at all costs. As a result, banks came to be regulated everywhere. Besides, financial regulation attempts to enhance the efficiency of the financial system and to achieve a broad range of social objectives. Going by the experience in several countries, effective regulation is in the interests of all concerned, though it cannot be based on a “one-size-fits-all” approach. However, it is important to bear in mind that while financial institutions do benefit from an appropriate regulatory regime, there is not much evidence that the existence of a regulatory jurisdiction makes institutions stronger and less prone to shocks. There is neither a unique theoretical model, nor just one practical approach to the regulation and supervision of a financial system. The existence of different types of regulatory models of the financial system makes the ideal choice a difficult exercise. The regulation and supervision of the financial system in India is carried out by different regulatory authorities. The Reserve Bank regulates and supervises the major part of the financial system. In the past five decades, the Indian banking system has traversed through a difficult path endeavoring to balance several competing and conflicting demands on it from large, medium, small and tiny borrowers in both the organised and unorganised sectors. The banking system’s activities were initially tightly regulated and their freedom was restricted. It also confronted several domestic stresses and external shocks. However, the regulations have changed over time to ensure that the banking system steps out of the restrictive 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  operational environment and functions in an atmosphere that provides the freedom to innovate. In recent years, innovations in instruments and processes, advances in technology and the increasing volumes of capital intermediated by the financial system have necessitated a proactive strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework. Emergence of several players with diversified and significant presence in the financial sector makes it imperative for supervision and regulation to be spread across various segments of the financial system. In recent years, there has been a shift in emphasis from microregulation to macro-management, supported by a tightening of prudential norms and improvements in the functioning of the financial system. Since the global crisis, there has been a decisive shift in trend towards assigning increased responsibility to the central banks for both “systemic oversight” and “macro-prudential regulation”. This greater responsibility is driven by the capability of the central banks among regulators and public institutions to perform the intended task. Central banks have robust frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, and in India, the Reserve Bank has the responsibility for micro-prudential supervision of banks and non-banking financial companies. As a result, while macroeconomic analysis has helped in strengthening the microprudential supervision, supervisory information aggregated for the financial system as a whole has also helped in conducting more appropriate macroeconomic policies. The Reserve Bank has been deeply involved in the development of markets, and it monitors and analyses the impact of market trends on the economy and financial institutions. Another important reason why central banks have to be the systemic risk regulator is because of their mandate of Lender of Last Resort (LOLR). Going forward, given the complex nature of the challenge, significant strengthening of the capacity for systemic risk assessment and macro-prudential regulation would be critical for the Reserve Bank. Macroeconomic and financial sector reforms In response to the macroeconomic crisis, a programme of stabilisation and structural adjustment was initiated in July 1991, with wide ranging reform measures encompassing the areas of trade, exchange rate management, industry, public finance and the financial sector. Fiscal correction, exchange rate adjustment, monetary targets and inflation controls constituted the immediate measures for macroeconomic stability. These measures were supported by structural reforms in the form of industrial deregulation, liberalisation of foreign direct investment, trade liberalisation, overhauling of public enterprises and financial sector reforms. Apart from aiming at restoring the economic stability on both domestic and external fronts, the economic reform programme strived towards achieving a higher growth trajectory through increased levels of investment and improvements in productivity, efficiency and competitiveness. Structural reforms aimed at reorientation of the economy from a centrally directed command and control economy to a market oriented one to foster greater efficiency and growth. This was done by introducing greater competition in the economy through progressive internal deregulation accompanied by external competition promoted by foreign direct investment and trade liberalisation. The reform measures had sectoral dimensions as well. Beginning with the industrial policy of 1991, reforms in the industrial sector were undertaken with a view to remove distortions in the resource allocation and improve competitiveness of Indian industry. The reform measures included removal of industrial licensing, reduction in the number of industries reserved for the public sector, abolition of restrictions on investment and expansion under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP)Act, 1969, automatic approval of foreign investment, elimination of quantitative import restrictions on intermediate and capital goods and steady reduction in protective customs tariffs. These measures created a favourable environment for industry to upgrade its technology and build-up capacity in order to cater to growing domestic and external demand. A series of policy initiatives were undertaken in 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  agricultural sector as well. These included, inter alia, replacement of quantitative controls by tariffs, partial decontrol of fertilizer prices, removal of bottlenecks in agricultural marketing, relaxation of restrictions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, replacement of the Revamped Public Distribution System (RPDS) with Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), and establishment of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF). Moreover, price reforms improved terms of trade for agriculture. Also, exchange rate and international trade reforms improved the incentive structure facing agriculture. Several initiatives were undertaken for the development and reform of financial markets, particularly since the 1990s. The reforms in various segments of financial markets such as money, the government securities and the foreign exchange markets were introduced in a calibrated, sequenced and careful manner, in step with those in other markets in the real economy. The sequencing has also been informed by the need to develop market infrastructure, technology and capabilities of market participants and financial institutions in a consistent manner. In India, the initiation of the structural reforms in the early 1990s encompassed a process of phased and coordinated deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets. Financial markets in India, in the period before the early 1990s, were marked by administered interest rates, quantitative ceilings, statutory pre-emptions, captive market for government securities, excessive reliance on central bank financing, pegged exchange rate, and current and capital account restrictions. As a result of various reforms, the financial markets have transited to a regime characterised by market-determined interest and exchange rates, price-based instruments of monetary policy, current account convertibility, phased capital account liberalisation and an auction-based system in the government securities market. Enhancing efficiency, while at the same time avoiding instability in the system, has been the challenge for the regulators in India. This approach to development and regulation of financial markets has imparted it greater resilience. India’s reform programme has had a definite positive and significant impact on the economy as compared with the past. Who are the stakeholders? In the whole process of reforms, the key stakeholders are the customers themselves. The regulators have a critical role in ensuring fair treatment to customers and it cannot be left to the market forces alone. The key to a prompt, effective and courteous customer service emanates from having the right attitude. A radical transformation of attitude right from Top Management to ground level employees is the first step towards improving customer service. Communication is at the root of effective customer care in a service industry, especially like banking, where the documents, terms and conditions, practices and precedents are all heavily loaded against the customer. In many fields and in different countries, regulators determine the price. But, the financial sector regulator in India does not do so. Therefore, whatever charges are levied, it is expected that they are reasonable and that the pricing is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. Globally, regulators are expected to usher in much stricter regulations in the area of fair treatment to customers. Banks need to price their products and services fairly and competitively and ensure higher transparency in their products and pricing. Lack of transparency in designing and pricing of products and services and selling them to inappropriate customers could expose banks to litigation and reputational risks, besides making them liable for supervisory action. There should be no unreasonable post sale barriers if the customers wish to change product or bank. Customer education is also critical in providing appropriate and need based products and services and the Indian Banks’ Association may have a critical role to play in this regard. The banking business would, thus, have to turn customer centric in all its true dimensions. Financial sector reforms – what next? The Indian approach to financial sector reforms, so far, has been driven by the predominant objective of enhancing the role of finance in promoting growth and economic development, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  while preserving financial stability, which is equally critical for sustained economic progress. While balancing the goals of efficiency and stability in introducing reforms, the Reserve Bank has moved towards deregulation of interest rates, promoted development of markets, and strengthened the legal infrastructure to facilitate better enforcement of financial contracts. Going forward, three areas will continue to be important in policy debates, i.e., development of long-term corporate bond markets, derivative markets to facilitate better price discovery and risk transfers, and more competition by allowing greater foreign participation. The regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial system across the world is undergoing a paradigm shift following the problems experienced during the global financial crisis. In this regard, multilateral and standard setting bodies like the G-20, IMF, BIS and FSB have been in the forefront to design an advanced regulatory framework to prevent the recurrence of such crisis. Addressing the regulatory gaps based on the lessons from the global financial crisis in advanced economies will be a major challenge for regulators all around the world. Much of the challenges in the domain of financial stability regulation would arise from complexities surrounding the assessment of systemic risk, interconnectedness, common exposures, risk concentrations in complex innovative products and use of models to manage and price risks which, at times, mask information. While India’s financial sector remained resilient in the face of global shocks, there are a number of areas where the reforms would be needed to promote stability and generate growth impulses for the real economy. In the wake of turbulent global financial environment, banks and financial entities have to grapple with growing complexities and risks associated with their businesses. Against this backdrop, the policy initiatives such as adoption of tighter capital and liquidity standards, improved risk management practices and sound compensation practices are required to place the Indian banking system on a strong footing and enhance the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from any financial and economic stress and encourage prudent risk taking. Moreover, in India, while broader institutional reforms have taken place at the macro level, the internal reforms among banks and financial institutions are yet to take place. Thus, there is a need to go for second generation reforms, particularly focusing on bringing down the cost of banking services, strengthening the credit delivery mechanism, improving customer service, reforming the human resources management systems and enhancing the financial outreach to hitherto unbanked areas. Second generation reforms Let me talk about some of the elements of these second generation reforms. (i)  Adopting improved risk management practices One fundamental principal of finance that I would like to emphasize is the direct relationship between risk and return. Any investment that offers greater returns, invariably involves more risk. Similarly, if you avoid taking risk, then the returns could even be negative. Banks, for instance, are in the business of taking risks and hence, cannot be expected to shun risk in its entirety. Four basic requirements that banks and professionals in the field need to develop is to: • Understand Risk  • Define Risk  • Measure Risk  • Manage Risk  My advice to all students entering the finance field would be that never take a risk where you cannot meet the above four requirements. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Globally, there is an increasing move towards more advanced approaches to risk management. Banks in India have made progress in moving towards the advanced risk management approaches. Banks, however, need to traverse a long distance in this regard. As capital always comes at a cost, banks need to have in place a fair and differentiated risk pricing of products and services. This involves costing, quantitative assessment of revenue streams from each product and service and an efficient Transfer Pricing Mechanism, which would determine capital allocation. Each business unit in the enterprise would have to aim at being a profit centre within the overall risk–return framework. In essence, it would mean accountability for profit, tempered by the discipline of risk–return within a deeply embedded culture of good governance. Our past experience has been of poor savers subsidising the rich borrowers. Also, there are incidences of rampant mis-pricing of risks. From a business perspective, pricing of assets should be non-discriminatory and in line with risk rating of the customer. A lower rated customer should not get a better price than a higher rated customer. Once these basic issues are addressed, other issues such as migration to advanced approaches, etc. would gain importance. While all Indian banks have adopted the standardised approaches under the Basel II framework in 2009, the pace of migration to the advanced approaches has, naturally, been very slow. Though the Reserve Bank has set an indicative time schedule for implementation of the Advanced Approaches, banks’ response has been less than encouraging so far. Migration to the Advanced Approaches is important for larger banks as it involves adoption of more sophisticated risk management systems. Moreover, there are reputational issues also in large banks continuing with standardised approaches. Apart from these fundamental issues, much of this sluggishness could be attributed to issues relating to development of human resource skills, technology upgradation, branch interconnectivity, availability and management of historical data, robustness of risk management systems, etc. within the banks. Even within the Reserve Bank, the supervisors would have to make rapid strides to be able to appreciate the nuances associated with the quantitative techniques and models. The objective of the Basle III reform package is to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. An assessment of Indian banks’ capital requirements under Basel III has revealed that, notwithstanding some issues with a few individual banks, the system as a whole, is very well capitalised and the transition to the revised capital norms of overall capital adequacy, Tier I component or equity component would be smooth. The implementation period of Basel III capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer and regulatory deductions, will begin from January 1, 2013 and will be fully implemented by March 31, 2018, before the timeline (January 1, 2019) indicated in Basel III rules. (ii)  Reforming human resources management There is an imperative need to improve the productivity and efficiency of human resources. An organisation can only be as good as its people. They are the force behind innovation, business process re-engineering and making the difference between success and failure. A committed and highly motivated work force can make the difference in winning and retaining customers as banking is a people oriented business. Banks have to be knowledge organisations, able to attract and retain talent. HR policies should look at right size, right fit and career growth with market related compensation. Increasingly, there is going to be intense competition for the right kind of talent as they are likely to be in short supply. The demand for efficient manpower will not only stem from domestic institutions but also from foreign institutions/ countries; and not just from the banking industry but from other financial/non-financial sectors. The challenge before Indian banks is, therefore, to revitalise themselves by hiring the right talent, investing in training and bringing about a vibrant transformation in their DNA. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  (iii)  Technology to be more customer focused Most banks are already on Core Banking Systems (CBS) which covers banking operations pertaining to deposits, withdrawals, credit delivery, back-office operations, etc. Banks need to look beyond Core Banking to harness the benefits of technology. CBS could provide inputs for developing customised products based on customer database. It would help in planning product delivery and service at selected/ multiple delivery points, better Customer Relationship Management and building lasting customer relationships which will translate into higher revenues. Technology needs to be more customer focused than employee or vendor focused. In case of glitches, the rectification must be swift to instill faith and confidence in the system. It is only the more agile and innovative players who will stay ahead in the game. Along with IT solutions arise allied issues such as IT security, governance and audits. Gaps in IT security could make banks vulnerable to data piracy, fraud and operational risk leading to reputation risk and erosion of customer confidence. (iv)  Focusing on MIS and information literacy MIS is an inseparable part of bank’s decision making process. The integrity and timeliness of data is critical in formulating the bank’s capital planning, business strategies, reviewing achievements vis-a-vis targets, formulating course correction exercises where required, feeding data into stress tests and importantly, taking action on the outcomes. This brings us to technology support for decision making. Banks have made huge investments in technology, which should be translated into better MIS through decision support systems and yield returns on investment by providing economical, affordable and customised customer centric banking solutions. The use of technology should not be seen as an end in itself but as a means to an end. (v)  Business strategy and vision The role of banks’ Boards would become increasingly crucial in the next decade in view of the looming competition. The Board would need to have a clear vision for the bank, a strategy to achieve its objectives, both medium and long-term, and a well laid out long-term plan. Banks would need to look beyond their existing customer base and large corporates and reach out to rope in the vast number of small, retail and SME clients which are presently deprived of bank credit. Alongside extending the reach of their banking services, there would be a need to improve the products offered to customers and the quality of services. They need to have proper business model and delivery model. (vi)  Reaching to the unbanked / under-banked areas In India, growth with equity has been the central objective right from the inception of the planning process. The objective of financial inclusion is to provide financial services at affordable cost to those who are excluded from the formal financial system. This is vital for sustaining long term equitable development, since a large proportion of the households/areas do not have access to basic banking facilities, notwithstanding the existence of vast institutional framework in the country. An important challenge is to channelise more savings to the financial system, particularly in rural areas and from the urban informal sector. This would need further penetration of the banking system. The Reserve Bank’s emphasis on financial inclusion is important in attaining this objective over time. There is also enormous potential for extending finance in semi-urban and rural areas for productive activities, which may require strengthening the banking correspondent relationship, simultaneously enhancing the risk assessment and risk management capacities in order to maintain credit quality and sustain the credit growth in these sectors. Besides benefiting the unbanked masses, this will also ensure viability and scalability of banks’ financial inclusion initiatives. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  (vii)  Bringing down the cost of banking services Further reduction in the cost of banking services may require greater competition among product lines, improved delivery mechanisms and increasing use of information technology. The costs of banking transactions need to be dramatically reduced as has happened in many other fields such as telecom, after the advent of technology. However, it is observed that, in banking, the transaction costs continue to be high, particularly in agriculture sector, which include costs incurred in appraisal of borrowers, processing, documentation and disbursement charges, loan monitoring/supervision and collection. It is essential to bring down such transaction costs to make available credit at affordable price to the farmers. Balancing the real and financial sector reforms Financial sector reforms alone will not bring continued prosperity. In the recent years, we see, growing evidence on growth deceleration in the Indian economy. For sustaining the high growth path, improving the investment climate and enhancing the absorptive capacity by bringing in the real sector reforms would be critical. The fact that a well-developed financial sector is necessary to act as the intermediary between entrepreneurs/ investors and savers can hardly be overstated. An efficient financial sector reduces the cost and risk of producing and trading goods and services and, thus, makes an important contribution to raising standards of living. The recent crisis, however, showed that the financial sector had apparently taken a quasi-autonomous existence without close connection with the financing requirements of the real economy. The financial industry, indeed, grew oversized in the preceding years, reflected in rapid credit creation, asset price bubbles and high levels of indebtedness, particularly in advanced financial systems. The disproportionate growth in the global financial sector was largely due to the aggressive search for yield, engendered by the easy liquidity in the global system that triggered a wave of financial innovation. Complex financial products were created by structuring and hedging, originating and distributing, all under the belief that real value could be created by sheer financial engineering. There were hardly any signs of growing capital formation due to the growing and increasingly complex financial sector. The financial sector grew more rapidly than other goods and services. In a way, that made growth of finance an end in itself and not a means to meet human needs such as food, fuel, health and education. Given that the busting of the oversized financial sector has a devastating impact on the real sector, it becomes important to (i) examine the optimal size of the financial sector relative to growth and development needs and (ii) make financial sector innovations more meaningful to cater to the needs of the real sector. For sustaining the high growth path, it is imperative that we bring in reforms in the agriculture, industry, infrastructure and services sectors. I would like touch upon some of the elements of these reforms. Improving agricultural governance and productivity In order to step up agriculture growth, a judicious use of technology is required along with institutional reforms, including those relating to land, incentives for supply response and better input use. Given the dependence of a vast majority of workforce on agriculture, enhancing the agricultural output, driven by higher yield and diversification of crops, assumes importance. Higher investment, backed by sustained research and extension activities, could be critical for augmenting yield. The policy focus, so far, has been on using higher MSP to generate supply response and public investment on expanding the irrigation potential. However, there is a need for improving the market structure for agricultural commodities, ensuring competitive pricing, enhancing warehouse facilities and improving rural roads for enhancing better connectivity with urban markets. Better water management, with an emphasis on water harvesting, would be important for enhancing the farm productivity and output. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  Improving the performance of manufacturing sector The manufacturing sector’s performance in a competitive environment and in the face of risks of rising protectionism could encounter several challenges. Despite the advantages of a large domestic market, abundant availability of skilled labour force, and the proximity to the fast growing Asian markets, productivity growth needs to catch up with the Asian economies, including China. This requires greater emphasis on quality, better adoption of technology, more flexible labour laws, significantly improved infrastructure and a policy environment supportive of the SMEs sector. The industry-education linkages must be strengthened vigorously. Persistent problems like frequent disruptions in the availability of power and lack of stable demand also affect the performance of the manufacturing sector. Harnessing the potential of services sector Notwithstanding the high growth and resilience of the services sector in the recent past, the sector faces multiple challenges for sustained growth over the years. A number of services, where India enjoys comparative advantage, experience lack of clear policy thrust. For instance, despite the high quality of healthcare services, it attracts a number of regulations. Similarly, in education, multiple regulation points and lack of credible accreditation systems hamper the growth potential. Given the medium to long-term contribution of investments on education and health to growth and productivity, availability of these services at affordable cost, while enhancing their global competitiveness, must form part of the priority in India’s development process. A number of services in India are either predominantly associated with the Government or not liberalised enough to ensure growth through organised private initiatives. Services like professional, legal, postal, accountancy and insurance need further liberalisation to harness their potential. Facilitating infrastructure finance As per the assessment of the Planning Commission, during the Twelfth Plan (2012–17) India may need infrastructure investments of over US$ 1trillion. This poses a mammoth financing task. The infrastructure gap in India, both in relation to other major countries and its own growing demand, has been a key factor affecting the overall productivity of investments. The requirement of high initial capital outlay, that took over longer terms, necessitates measures to address the financing constraint to capacity expansion in infrastructure. The financing issue relates not only to possible resource gap, but also to ensure commercially viable funding that remains so over business cycles. Infrastructure investment during the Twelfth Plan will need to be funded by both, public and private sectors. Despite increasing participation of the private sector in bridging the infrastructure gap, public investment still has to play a significant role. Fiscal consolidation and reorientation of expenditure towards capital expenditure is required to meet the target. The banking system, despite the risk of asset-liability mismatch while lending for long-term infrastructure projects, has seen high growth in credit to this sector in recent years. To sum up The first round of financial sector reforms resulted in strengthening of the financial system and making it more vibrant and resilient. However, over time, the pace of reforms and growth has slowed down and the need for second generation of reforms is strongly felt. These reforms would have to focus on individuals and corporates and work towards improvement in productivity and efficiency of the economy as a whole. Financial sector reforms, in isolation, will not have a significant impact unless there is improvement in the absorption capacity of the economy. Real sector reforms should precede financial sector reforms for bringing in inclusive and sustainable development of the country. Even in the financial sector, there is an imperative need for internal institutional reforms, particularly focusing on improving the risk management practices, reducing the cost of transactions, both borrowing and lending, and improving the overall customer service. I hope 
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  all concerned stakeholders work towards implementation of these second generation reforms, which is essential for moving the economy back to the high growth trajectory. I would, once again, like to congratulate the Vivekananda Education Society for completion of 50 glorious years and hope that the Society continues its efforts to produce students who are fully equipped to shoulder the responsibility of taking the nation forward in the coming years. I would also urge the management, faculty and students to rededicate themselves towards further broadening the activities and reach of the Society so that it provides an avenue for the deprived segments to attain social and economic prosperity through education. This would be in line with the message that Swami Vivekananda sought to spread, all through his life, through his work and writings. I wish the deliberations of the Seminar all success. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Norman T L Chan: New round of countercyclical prudential measures for property mortgage lending Address by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, to the media, Hong Kong, 14 September 2012. *      *      * 1.  I am going to announce a new round of countercyclical prudential measures for property mortgage lending. 2.  Since the introduction of the fourth round of tightening measures for property mortgage loans by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in June 2011, the local property market quieted down somewhat – but for just about seven months. The property market began to heat up again in February 2012, with significant increase both in transaction volume and prices. Cumulative growth in property prices was as much as 13% compared with the beginning of this year. 3.  The evolution of the property market cycle in Hong Kong is affected by many factors, including the external environment. With the third round of quantitative easing announced by the US Federal Reserve last night, there can be more capital inflows through the US banking system into the emerging markets. Moreover, Europe has earned some respite from its debt crisis following the announcement by the European Central Bank of its bond-buying programme and related judgment by Germany’s Constitutional Court. So the sentiment in financial markets is likely to stay calmer for a while. Against this background, the risk brought by the continued heating up of the Hong Kong property market on the banking sector will rise again. To enhance risk management of banks, the HKMA has just issued a set of guidelines to banks, requiring them to tighten the underwriting criteria for mortgages where borrowers already have one or more properties under mortgage. 4.  Under these new measures, when handling new applications for mortgage loans for residential, industrial or commercial properties from borrowers who already have one or more properties under mortgage, banks must adopt the following three requirements: First: for mortgage loans assessed based on the debt servicing ability of a mortgage applicant, the maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) shall be lowered from the current 50% by 10 percentage points to 40%. Accordingly, the maximum stressed DSR shall also be lowered correspondingly from the current 60% by 10 percentage points to 50%. However, an applicant with just one property with outstanding mortgage loan will not be affected by this new measure if the new mortgage loan is for self-occupied purpose, or for the replacement of an existing property. Second: for mortgage loans assessed based on the net worth of a mortgage applicant, the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio shall be lowered from the current 40% by 10 percentage points to 30%.  Third: for mortgage applicants whose principal income is derived from outside Hong Kong, the applicable maximum LTV ratio shall be lowered by 20 percentage points, instead of the current 10 percentage points. 5.  Based on the experience in Hong Kong, borrowers with multiple outstanding mortgage loans have higher level of indebtedness and leverage. During property market and economic downturns, the chance of default for this group of borrowers can be significantly higher than those with only one property under mortgage. In view of this, the HKMA considers it necessary to require banks to further tighten the underwriting criteria for mortgage loans to borrowers with multiple property mortgages to reduce the risk of banks. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  6.  Besides, the HKMA notices a recent trend of lengthening average tenor of new mortgage loans. The average tenor for new mortgage loans now is 25 years, which is three years longer than that of 22 years in 2009. Some banks have extended the maximum tenor to even 40 years. Prolonged loan tenors will not only increase credit risk of banks, but may also weaken the ability of borrowers to withstand interest rate risk. In particular, when mortgage rates return to more normal levels, borrowers with a loan that already stretches to 30 or even 40 years simply cannot seek to reduce their monthly instalment payment burden by extending the tenor, and may therefore face financial difficulty. Therefore the HKMA has now required banks to set the ceiling for the maximum loan tenor for all new mortgage loans to not more than 30 years. 7.  The above measures take effect immediately. However, loan applications in respect of property transactions with provisional sale and purchase agreements signed today or earlier will not be affected.  8.  Mr Arthur Yuen, our Deputy Chief Executive, will explain the details of these measures later. 9.  When introducing measures to tighten the underwriting criteria for mortgage loans, the HKMA has always strived to strike a balance to minimise the impact on end-users, particularly first-time homebuyers. Although we have already introduced five rounds of prudential measures on mortgage lending, we have sought to ensure that purchasers of residential properties at a value of HK$6 million or below for self-occupied purpose would still be eligible for a maximum LTV ratio of 70%. In addition, purchasers who meet the eligibility requirements will be able to apply for mortgage loans of up to 90% LTV ratio under the mortgage insurance arrangements. According to figures provided by the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, the value of properties involving mortgage loans with a 90% LTV ratio averages at around HK$3.2 million. Therefore, I believe that the measures of the HKMA will have minimal impact on first-time homebuyers. 10.  Changes in the property market cycle are affected by a host of internal and external factors, including land supply, interest rate movements, changes in household income as well as economic and financial market developments in Europe and the US. In view of the highly uncertain internal and external environments, the HKMA will continue to monitor the market situation closely and introduce appropriate measures in response to changes in the property market cycle to safeguard banking stability. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Development of credit and debit card payments in Fiji Address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the launch of China Unionpay Cards, being accepted at Bank South Pacific ATMs, Suva, 17 September 2012. *      *      * Salutations  Mr Cai Jianbo (First Executive Vice President China UnionPay)  Mr Kevin McCarthy (Bank South Pacific Country Head for Fiji)  Representatives of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China  Representatives of the credit issuing banks and China UnionPay  Distinguished guests  Ladies and Gentlemen  Introduction  Bula vinaka and Ni How  It is an honour for me to be here today at the launch of the business partnership between China UnionPay and Bank South Pacific. In Fiji, we are always pleased to see the strengthening of collaboration, partnerships and business opportunities with countries that are aligned to our objectives and will help us grow as a nation.  It is also a pleasure to welcome all our distinguished guests from the People’s Republic of China. You may be a long way from home, but please take the time to experience our world renowned Fijian hospitality.  China UnionPay Cards  I understand that our Prime Minister launched the UnionPay products in Fiji on 20 September 2010, almost two years ago to the day. At that time the China UnionPay cards were accepted by a few merchants in the country. That official launch in 2010 enabled local merchants and businesses to be aware of this particular brand. With greater acceptance over time, this is vital for the development of the Chinese tourist market.  Today’s announcement of the ability of BSP ATMs to accept China UnionPay credit and debit cards is a milestone achievement. This will now allow China UnionPay’s 3.1 billion cardholders the ability to conduct financial transactions at any of BSP’s 100 ATMs or 1,000 EFTPOS terminals when they are visiting Fiji.  This milestone, with the added convenience of direct flights between Hong Kong and Fiji and the Visa on Arrival policy for Chinese visitors to Fiji, will add to the attractiveness of Fiji as a popular tourist destination for inbound Chinese travellers.  China UnionPay, together with BSP, will be able to offer Chinese tourists, as well as UnionPay card cardholders from other countries, a better way to facilitate their financial transactions while they are in Fiji.  We have noted a large increase in tourist arrivals from China recently. In 2009, the number of tourist arrivals from China at 4,087 was just 0.8 percent of total arrivals. In 2010, the figure rose to 18,147 or 2.9 percent and further increased to 24,389 or 3.6 percent in 2011. The latest figure for January to March 2012 is 5.2 percent. With the increasing trend in arrivals from China, we know that such an alliance will be beneficial to China UnionPay and BSP.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Card policy  Ladies and gentlemen, the Reserve Bank issued a press release on Thursday last week upholding the “no surcharge rule” for credit and debit card payments in Fiji. This extends to all merchants and all cards used in Fiji and will be effective from 1 November 2012, allowing a necessary transition period for banks to roll out awareness and merchants to review their existing practices and procedures.  The “no surcharge rule” is already in place as stipulated by major credit card providers in agreements with banks and contained in agreements between banks and merchants. I hope that this announcement will make shopping in Fiji more transparent, convenient and attractive for our visitors from China. So whether you pay by cash or credit card, the price is the same.  We look forward to compliance by the commercial banks and merchants in the implementation of this policy.  The Fijian economy  Let me take this opportunity to say a few words about the Fijian economy. Based on economic activity for the first six months of 2012, overall performance has been on track and the projected growth of 2.7 percent for the year remains intact. However, we still need to be mindful of developments in the global economy and any likely impact on our trading partners.  Inflation in Fiji was 4.0 percent in July. This is lower than the inflation rates in the previous months. The decline is due to lower commodity prices and current benign domestic driven inflationary pressures. As a result, we still expect the year end inflation to be around 3.5 percent.  The level of foreign reserves is currently just under $1.6 billion or adequate to cover 5 months of retained imports of goods and non factor services.  We are currently reviewing economic data and the next official update on the economic variables will be during the 2013 National Budget announcement.  Conclusion  In conclusion, I take this opportunity to thank the Chinese Government for its continuing goodwill and willingness to engage in closer economic ties with Fiji. I also extend my best wishes towards this partnership between China UnionPay and Bank South Pacific. This alliance is an excellent business and investment opportunity for both countries and institutions.  I wish you both the very best in your future endeavours.  Vinaka vaka levu 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1   Sebastián Claro: Chinese challenges facing Chile and Latin America Speech by Mr Sebastián Claro, Board Member of the Central Bank of Chile, at the 2012 Latin American Cities Conferences “Chile on the path to development”, organized by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, Santiago, 30 August 2012. *      *      * I would like to thank Consuelo Edwards and Yan Carrière-Swallow for their help in translating this speech from the original Spanish. Thank you for inviting me to this event that for several years now has been gradually positioning itself – both in Chile and in the rest of Latin America – as a seminar dealing with key issues for the region’s economic development. On this occasion, and at the organizers’ suggestion, I would like to share with you some thoughts on the economic development of China and its implications for Latin America. Rather than focusing on aspects of the Chinese economy – which I will come back to at the end of the presentation –, I would like to focus on those dimensions in which China’s spectacular growth affects the region directly. Let me begin by recalling a widespread debate in the region in the early 2000s. While Europe was boastfully launching its new single currency, Latin America was struggling to leave behind the havoc of successive crises that had hit the region, starting with Mexico in 1994. The meager growth of the late 1990s and early 2000s, plus the accumulation of large current account deficits during the 1990s, caused the region to begin the new century with relatively high levels of debt-to-GDP. For example, at the end of 2002 Brazil’s government debt reached 80% of GDP while its external debt was close to 55% of GDP. In every other country in Latin America – with the exception of Chile –, the debt of the general government exceeded 40% of GDP. Moreover, large current account deficits persisted throughout the region. Take the year 2002, when Mexico and Peru – as well as Bolivia and Costa Rica – had accumulated 5 years of current account deficits of over 2% of GDP.1 Doubts about the sustainability of national debts across the region fueled an academic debate as to identifying the highest level of debt that could be tolerated. In a 2003 paper by Carmen Reinhart, Miguel Savastano and Kenneth Rogoff – which has been part of a successful research program on the history of debt crises –, the authors examined the history of defaults around the world, and concluded that relatively low levels of debt-to-GDP were enough to trigger credit restructuring events.2 In particular, the paper found that several countries in the region had debt levels above the limits of what could be deemed “tolerable”. The authors also provided evidence of how countries – in Latin America and elsewhere – have historically used deleveraging to regain a sustainable path for their external debt. Their conclusion is clear: “For debt-intolerant countries, sustaining access to capital markets can be problematic unless debt ratios are quickly brought down to safer levels. To assess how such ‘deleveraging’ might be accomplished, we examine how, historically, emerging market economies with substantial external debts have managed to work them down. To our knowledge, this is a phenomenon that has previously received very little, if any, attention. We analyze episodes of large debt reversals, where countries’ external debt fell by more than 25 percentage points of GNP over a three-year period. Of the twenty-two such reversals that we identify for a broad group of middle-income countries since 1970, two-thirds involved some form of default or restructuring. Only in one case – Swaziland in 1985 – was a country                                                 1  Sources: World Bank, Moody’s and IMF (WEO, April 2012). 2  Reinhart, C., M. Savastano and K. Rogoff, (2003), “Debt Intolerance”, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  able to bring down a high ratio of external debt to GNP solely as a result of rapid output growth.” Thus, in the early 2000s, there were widespread expectations that a default would occur. Overall, the history of Latin America in the 2000s did not go as expected. During the first decade of the twenty-first century, Latin American countries succeeded in lowering their levels of external debt by nearly 20 percent of GDP. The current-account balance, which had exhibited a secular deficit during the 1980s and 1990s, posted a surplus of nearly 2% of GDP during the 2000s. A review of the fiscal ledgers yields similar numbers. What happened? What was the miracle? In a word: China. China’s strong growth began to permeate international commodity markets early in the decade, leading to an enormous increase in the region’s terms of trade beginning around 2004. This major increase in income enabled the economies to deleverage without having to make large adjustments to expenditure or output. Also, the real exchange rate appreciated by almost 20% with respect to trading partners during the 2000s, which contrasts with the greater stability of the 1990s. Of course, better macroeconomic policies contributed markedly to this success. Whereas previous income booms had been accompanied by strongly pro-cyclical economic policies that incubated problems, this time greater efforts at fiscal saving, more exchange rate flexibility and better banking supervision helped the countries take advantage of the high commodity prices. But for a large part of the region, the seed of the success of the 2000s was sown by China. Today our objective is to look ahead, not to dwell on thoughts about the region during the past decade. The strength of the Chinese economy leads one to think that this phenomenon of high terms of trade will go on for some time, posing a number of challenges to economic development in the region. At the risk of oversimplifying these challenges, let me group them into three categories: (i) challenges to macroeconomic management, (ii) structural challenges, and (iii) cyclical challenges. The first two depend essentially on us, while the third refers to the short-term trajectory of the Chinese economy and its possible impact on developing countries. Macroeconomic challenges A first issue worth noting is that commodity prices have experienced successive cycles throughout history, and there is a permanent risk of mistaking a temporary phenomenon for a permanent one. This time is no different. There is a valid argument that the Chinese economy can sustain its recent dynamism for many years to come. While there are reasons to believe that the Chinese economy should converge to growth rates around 7% within the next few years, and that 9% growth rates are very difficult to sustain, this does not imply a substantial deterioration in Chinese demand for commodities.3 In the case of Chile, the experts surveyed by the Ministry of Finance have raised their estimates for the long-term copper price on repeated occasions on the grounds of both supply- and demand-side considerations.4 However, economic cycles do exist and the response of supply – which has not been fully perceived so far – will tend to drive prices to their trend values, which are below current levels. Clarity on this point is not only fundamental to determine a fiscal policy consistent with medium-term income, but also to guide private spending and investment decisions on the basis of sustainable future earnings. For macroeconomic policies, there is an important                                                 3  Claro, Sebastián.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3   challenge in facing a period of temporarily high terms of trade, and the improved external financing conditions that become available as a result. The experience of many countries shows that the best policy mix is sound fiscal discipline, prudent financial regulation, and a monetary policy framework that combines price stability and flexible exchange rates. A sound fiscal policy not only smoothes the business cycle and helps minimize foreign exchange fluctuations, but also avoids commitments to spending on outlays that depend on uncertain future income. Fiscal policy in Chile has been moving in that direction for decades, the importance of which cannot be overemphasized. Sound banking supervision is key for several reasons, among others because the intermediation of large capital inflows – in a context of upward pressures on asset prices – may lead to excessive risk taking. The reversal of these conditions has hit particularly hard in previous financial crises, where risk- taking by financial institutions prompted aggressive deleveraging, with strong implications for credit and output. For this reason, in circumstances like these it is extremely important to closely monitor the prices of key assets and risk-taking patterns in the financial system. Finally, regarding monetary policy two issues are worth noting. On one hand, a monetary policy that favors sound domestic price stability is consistent with macro stability in the medium term. This is a much sought-after objective in many economies of the region and must be protected. On the other hand, a flexible exchange rate policy is the best framework for dealing the situation we face. The reasons are twofold: first, in a context of high commodity prices and good external financing conditions, a floating exchange rate helps prevent the incubation of macroeconomic imbalances,5 as Chile can attest from past experience. There are many examples of countries facing favorable external conditions, in which foreign exchange rigidity resulted not only in higher inflation but also in large current account deficits, causing major imbalances in the external accounts. Second, foreign exchange adjustments allow the economy to adjust to fluctuations in external conditions, such as those that have been so prevalent in the past several years. Volatility of the terms of trade and external credit conditions generates a constant need to adjust relative prices, which is more easily accomplished through flexible exchange rates.6 Current developments in Europe are providing further evidence for this view. The benefits of flexible exchange rates are accompanied by costs, primarily due to the possibility of an increase in exchange rate volatility. This introduces further difficulties for making business and investment decisions. The trade-off has been present in the academic and economic policy debate for many decades and, although opinions differ in terms of acknowledging the difficulties caused by exchange rate volatility, the benefits of a floating exchange rate to safeguard macroeconomic stability are perceived to trump these difficulties. For one thing, over the past decade the credible Chilean policy of flexible exchange rates has brought about a nearly total elimination of currency mismatches in the corporate sector that had hindered monetary policy making for so many years. Structural challenges In a context of good commodity prices and favorable access to credit, the phenomenon of real exchange rate appreciation poses structural challenges to economies in the region. I would like to focus on three issues that have been widely discussed in business, political, and academic circles.                                                 5  Dornbusch, R., (1983), “Real Interest Rates, Home Goods, and Optimal External Borrowing”, Journal of Political Economy 91(1). 6  Calvo, G., A. Izquierdo and E. Talvi, (2003), “Sudden Stops, the Real Exchange Rate and Fiscal Sustainability: Argentina’s Lessons,” NBER Working Paper 9828. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  First, it is worth emphasizing that part of the appreciation of the real exchange rate reflects the proceeds from the higher prices of our main exports. The resulting increases in expenditure and investment push up the price of services and wages, which is the counterpart of exchange rate appreciation. The impulse to demand from these conditions does not depend essentially on monetary policy, which can primarily affect the trade-off between fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate and domestic inflation. Although monetary policy does have a toolkit to smooth short-term exchange rate fluctuations without jeopardizing price stability – which under some circumstances could justify intervening the foreign exchange market –, the underlying trends of the real exchange rate cannot be dealt with using monetary policy. The second issue has to do with recognizing that this phenomenon has an impact on the competitiveness of certain export-oriented industries whose prices do not increase in dollars and whose domestic costs rise due to pressure on wages. Here we need to distinguish a couple of elements. For one thing, essentially the same phenomenon that is holding the copper price above its long-term level is causing high prices of other commodities, such as foodstuffs. This is why Chinese growth offers such enormous opportunities to countries with agricultural and agribusiness potential, such as Chile. In turn, Chile’s capacity to diversify its exports and avoid specializing in a handful of raw materials requires a substantial effort to promote competitiveness, which is the most critical tool to foster growth and diversification. Support for and training of human capital, increased market competition and flexible labor markets all stand out as important measures to improve competitiveness. All these dimensions point to the fundamental source of productivity gains, which is the creation and development of new enterprises. International experience shows that countries’ export growth is driven mainly by new firms – in existing product categories and to existing destinations – with a stronger capacity for growth than existing exporters.7 As some authors have pointed out, taking advantage of this growth potential requires fostering factor mobility across firms of different productivity levels. This process generates a major portion of the gains from economic openness, such that policies that hinder workers crossing over to other firms or that raise the cost of adjusting the scale of production weaken capacity for innovation.8 Finally, and in the same token, it is clear that the opportunities that China’s strong growth generates for the region must be well used. For this to take place, not only will greater saving be required, but also more productive investment. In other words, one significant challenge facing the economies of the region – and Chile in particular – is to take advantage of this momentary boom in the terms of trade by promoting saving and investment, thus making sure that it does not simply translate into an unsustainable spending spree. To that end, fiscal policy plays a key role by setting up well evaluated investment programs, while maintaining the incentives that promote the accumulation of scarce physical and human capital among private agents. Policies that distort these incentives inevitable end up lowering the rate of saving and investment.                                                 7  See Eaton, J., M. Eslava, M. Kugler and J.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5   Challenges facing China I would like to end by referring to China’s challenges in the short run, and the impact that current developments may have on the economies of the region. Already in the mid-2000s the Chinese economy was in a transition to becoming less dependent on the external sector and investment demand, and thus trying to promote domestic consumption. There were obvious signs of investment exhaustion in some sectors, together with doubts about the capacity to sustain such high rates of export growth. The reforms adopted in the middle of the past decade to enhance the operation of the financial system and thus attain a more efficient allocation of credit – to offset the natural fall in the savings rate – came to a halt during the crisis of 2008–2009 due to the great boost in government expenditure and public credit. This boost, which allowed the Chinese economy to deal quite successfully with the global financial crisis, brought about significant indebtedness of local governments, high exposure of the financial system to projects of dubious quality, and substantial over-investment. The need to put a stop to this impulse in order to safeguard macroeconomic stability has defined China’s economic policy decisions since 2010. Accordingly, the contractions in investment projects and credit availability have been the main stabilization tools used in China. However, this process coincided with the aggravation of problems in Europe, which resulted in a very sharp reduction of external demand for the Chinese economy, among other things. The fall in exports, together with the need to withdraw the stimulus that had been given to investment over the past few years, has put significant pressure on China’s growth. Its capacity to offset the drop in demand with increased domestic consumption is limited in the short run, especially since the necessary conditions to promote lower savings rates, such as changes to social security and health-care plans, a deepening of the household credit market, and changes in relative prices – such as a real exchange rate appreciation –, are often slow to implement. Until now the Chinese economy has continued to decelerate, and somewhat more rapidly than was foreseen a few quarters ago. In my view, China has the necessary tools to deal with this deceleration, and to deal with a possible worsening of problems in Europe. But at the same time, the programs implemented in 2008–2009 have lost their efficacy, and the authorities are taking a more cautionary stance. Today, China needs to rearrange its economy, and although events in Europe have caught China flatfooted with respect to its economic reforms, part of the adjustment to slower short-term growth is necessary and partly inevitable. A significant impulse to public expenditure and investment will only be observed if there is a significant deterioration of external conditions. Overall, the Chinese economy faces important challenges in the short run. These could introduce fluctuations in commodity prices that threaten to expose the weaknesses of countries in the region whose recent growth has come almost exclusively from increased expenditure financed by the Chinese boom. In particular, it is especially important at this point that the region work hard to maintain the health of its fiscal and external accounts. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Finance and the real economy – fostering sustainability Speech by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Regional Lecture Series on Islamic economics, finance and banking: “Finance and the real economy – fostering sustainability”, Jakarta, 19 December 2012. *      *      * I am most honoured to be invited to deliver this inaugural lecture of the Islamic Development Bank Regional Lecture Series. I am also most delighted to be back here in Jakarta. I would like to thank the Islamic Development Bank for the invitation, and Bank Indonesia for kindly hosting this event. For more than three decades now, the Islamic Development Bank has had an important role in promoting economic growth and development in so many parts of the world, and associated with this, has been its role in fostering the development of Islamic finance. It has supported the building of key international financial infrastructure that has been important for the orderly global development of Islamic finance and for safeguarding financial stability. The Islamic Development Bank has also supported research and education efforts in this area, while its strategic interests in financial institutions in different jurisdictions have been an important catalyst for their establishment and expansion. In the current more uncertain environment, in the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis, the role of the Islamic Development Bank will continue to be important, given that the goal of sustainable growth and development in the world economy has now become even more challenging. As the conventional financial system currently confronts what is perhaps its most defining period, several important lessons can be drawn for our collective efforts to build more resilient financial systems. Important considerations need to be accorded to the issues that have emerged, and on the policy directions affecting growth and stability. My address today will discuss several of these issues, and discuss how Islamic finance, given its nature and inherent features, can contribute to the process of enhancing the discipline that contributes to ensuring growth and financial stability. At the core, the financial system needs to serve the real economy. The purpose of the financial system is intermediation – that is, to match savings and investments for the purpose of generating economic growth. Yet, in recent decades, a number of factors have contributed to the weakening of the link between financial intermediation and productive economic activity. Deregulation opened up new opportunities for financial institutions to enhance performance and expand the scope of their activities. Greater competition, reinforced by significant advances in technology, intensified the pace of innovation. And, the extended period of low inflation and low interest rates incentivised greater risk-taking. Cumulatively, these developments contributed to a dangerous build-up of financial imbalances. This has prompted a rethinking of the issues related to the financial business and its models, and wide-ranging regulatory reforms by the international community. Related to these issues is the question on the “appropriate” size of the financial sector. As economies develop, the size of financial sector assets and, correspondingly, the value-added contribution of the financial sector, is expected to increase. However, while there is a fundamental relationship between the growth of the financial sector and the real economy, the relationship is not well-understood or captured in current macroeconomic models. This creates a potential challenge for policymakers to determine the point at which growth of the financial sector may be outstripping the demands and the potential of the real economy. This issue has become even more pronounced with greater regional and global financial integration, and in countries that are also international financial centres. To the extent that corporate and personal income growth is driven by financial transactions rather than by an increase in production or 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  employment growth, economies become potentially more vulnerable to the consequences of financial system stress. The recent global financial crisis provides a distinct example of how excessive leverage and exponential growth in financial activities that are detached from the growth trajectory of the real economy can become a source of instability. Leverage increased sharply in the years leading to the crisis, buoyed by years of strong economic growth. In the advanced economies, bank balance sheets exploded, growing to multiples of annual GDP. For example, in the case of Iceland, the three largest banks that were nationalised in early October 2008 had seen their total assets expand from 100 percent of GDP in 2004, to more than 900 percent of GDP as at end-2007. Similarly in Ireland, assets in their financial institutions with substantial domestic businesses were more than 400 percent of GDP by 2008, while in the United Kingdom, bank assets were more than 500 percent of GDP prior to the global financial crisis. The sheer size, complexity and leverage in the banking system increased the fragility of financial institutions and limited their ability to absorb even small losses, thereby resulting in widespread and deep economic dislocations. This expansion of financial activities was also in part due to the activities in the shadow banking system, which in the United States, grew to be even larger than the traditional banking sector in gross terms. At the height of the crisis, the size of gross amounts outstanding of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives globally was estimated at over 614 trillion US dollars1, more than ten times global GDP. Despite its size, the over-the-counter market was opaque and inadequately regulated, making it more difficult to quantify the risk that had been assumed by the financial institutions. A further issue relates to financial innovation and for policy interventions not to stifle those innovations that are beneficial to society, while reining in those that are harmful. The current debate on the international financial reforms continues to reveal that this is a challenging task. While there is wide support for a return to basic banking, it is also acknowledged that financial innovations have been instrumental in improving financial access levels, by enabling financial institutions to manage risks in ways that have allowed for higher-risk economic activities to be undertaken. Contrary evidence, however, also exists. In the run-up to the crisis, derivatives were extensively used to arbitrage regulatory requirements and to extract excessive profits through opaque and complex transactions that resulted in the fundamental mispricing of risk. Current reform efforts are therefore confronted with the need to strike a balance between constraining harmful practices, without restricting innovation that is key to a progressive financial system. Another issue relates to the prospect for aligning the expectations of capital providers with the imperatives of sustainable banking. In the years preceding the crisis, the growth of the financial system substantially exceeded that of the overall economy. Published data2 indicates that the balance sheet of the world’s largest 1000 banks increased by about 150 percent between 2001 and 2009. At its peak, the scale of the assets of the financial sector far exceeded those in other sectors, with record profits reported from year to year. In the current environment, banks continue to remain under considerable pressure to support activities that generate the kind of rates of return that capital providers have come to expect from the industry. This runs counter to expectations for banking to be returned to its fundamental role of supporting real economic activity. The extent to which these conflicting imperatives can be reconciled in a sustainable manner remains unclear. A focal point of the reforms has been to protect retail banking from the vagaries of investment banking that often has involved higher risk-taking activities. In the United States,                                                 1 As at December 2009. BIS Quarterly Review Statistical Annex, June 2010, Table 19. 2 The Banker publication. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  the Volcker Rule prohibits banks from carrying out certain types of investment banking activities if they wished to continue to rely on deposit funding. In a similar vein, in the United Kingdom, the adoption of the recommendations by the Independent Commission on Banking mandates banking groups to establish a separate subsidiary for their retail activities, and it prohibits the subsidiary from undertaking other businesses and risks. Solutions to these challenges are far from straightforward. While these and other reforms by the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board are expected to have far reaching implications for the landscape of the financial system as we know it today, they have yet to provide answers to many of the key questions that policymakers and the financial industry need to address in the pursuit of effective functioning and sound financial systems as we progress forward into the future. Since the global financial crisis, significant attention has been directed at evolving an effective macro-prudential policy framework, which can serve to rein in excesses and strengthen the nexus between finance and the real economy. The concept of macro-prudential policies is hardly new and can be traced back to as early as the late 1970s, in reference to the macroeconomic and financial stability implications from the rapid pace of lending to developing economies3. Some emerging markets, including Asia, have, since the 1990s, deployed macro-prudential policy instruments to manage imbalances in the financial system and capital flows. Following the recent global financial crisis, greater attention is now being focused on the role, scope, instruments and governance arrangements for macro-prudential policy to preserve financial stability. New or strengthened mandates for macro-prudential policies are being established in a growing number of jurisdictions, supported by wide-ranging changes to the legislative framework and institutional structures. Used effectively in combination with other policy tools, including micro-prudential measures and monetary and fiscal policy tools, macro-prudential policies have been demonstrated to significantly improve financial stability outcomes. Effectively operationalising macro-prudential policy frameworks, however, remains a key challenge. By design, macro-prudential policies are intended to reduce the probability and severity of a future crisis. While further research will deepen our understanding of leading indicators and transmission channels, judgments will continue to have a key role. History has shown that political economic considerations have, at times, had an effect on the willingness of policymakers to act. Despite the high costs of crisis on the financial system on the economy and on the society, there is still an inherent bias towards inaction. This underscores the need for a stronger focus on creating an environment in which policymakers will have the confidence to act. This requires a strong mandate, sufficient policy instruments, and clear accountability structures. While macro-prudential policy has a clear and important role in contributing towards financial stability moving forward, it does not however diminish the important role of micro-prudential supervision. Indeed, the notion that more developed macro-prudential policy frameworks can, over time, provide a credible alternative to the close supervision of systemic financial institutions – for example, through the development of better predictive macro indicators, or through reliance on recovery and resolution plans alone – is misplaced. There can be no substitute for the effective ongoing supervision of financial institutions, which relies on supervisory assessments and judgments, and enhances the understanding of firm behaviours in a manner that models and plans, no matter how sophisticated, will never be able to fully achieve. Efforts should therefore also be accorded towards further strengthening                                                 3 Based on the article entitled “The term ‘macro-prudential’: origins and evolution” published in the BIS Quarterly Review March 2010, which contains excerpt of the unpublished minutes of a meeting of the Cooke Committee (the precursor of the present Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the conduct of micro-prudential supervision and promoting the complementarities between micro- and macro-prudential policies. Let me now turn my remarks to the growing role and relevance of Islamic finance in contributing to the global agenda of fostering sustainable growth that is firmly anchored to the real economy. The core proposition of Islamic finance draws from its inherent features and the values that it brings to the economy, and the tremendous potential that it offers in supporting sustainable economic growth and in safeguarding financial stability. These core propositions are derived from the Shariah, which dictates that Islamic financial transactions must be supported by underlying productive activities. This Shariah ruling ensures a close link between financial transactions and the real economy. Innovation and intermediation in Islamic finance are thus aligned to generating productive economic activities. There is also strong discouragement against excessive risk undertakings and a prohibition against speculative elements. These rulings also serve to insulate the Islamic financial system from excessive leverage, which in turn contributes towards promoting financial stability and its long-term sustainability. These fundamental elements resonate with the call for banking to focus on its core function of providing financial services that add value to the real economy. This recent decade has also witnessed a dramatic transformation of the Islamic financial landscape. It has been marked by sustained rapid growth and the widening of its geographical reach, resulting in more diverse Islamic financial institutions and the generation of a wide spectrum of innovative products, particularly in the high-growth segment of the sukuk market. In this decade, Islamic finance has also evolved from being domestic-centric to become increasingly internationalised. In this dynamic environment, the scope of the Islamic finance business has expanded from simple retail and trade financing to include private equity, project finance, sukuk origination and issuance, as well as fund and wealth management products. Today, the total global size of the Islamic financial assets has surpassed more than 1 trillion US dollars. There are now more than 600 Islamic financial institutions operating in 75 countries. The vision for the Islamic financial system in Malaysia was articulated in our first Financial Sector Masterplan that was launched in the year 2001, in which the plans for building the foundations for the Islamic financial system were outlined. This included strengthening and diversifying the financial intermediaries in the financial system, building and developing the financial markets, and enhancing the regulatory supervisory, Shariah and legal framework. Ten years later, in 2011, a new Financial Sector Blueprint was launched, charting the path for Islamic finance to transition to become increasingly internationalised, and thus to become more integrated into the mainstream of the global financial system. Whilst Islamic finance has all the ingredients and the potential to meet the needs of the global economy, the channelling of funds to productive activities in Islamic finance today is still largely being carried out through non-participatory contracts, that includes the mark-up sale (Murabahah) and the lease-based (ijarah) structures, which continue to remain essential to cater for financing trade and the purchase of assets. Such contracts are similar to lending instruments which expose the Islamic financial institutions mostly to credit risk elements. Whilst non-risk-sharing contracts will continue to contribute to the future growth of Islamic finance, the wider use of risk-sharing transactions and undertakings under participatory finance models have significant scope in evolving a broader representation of Islamic financial products that will spur the next phase of industry growth and development. This includes participatory or equity-based contracts such as Mudarabah and Musharakah that support ventures involving entrepreneurship endeavours. Greater use of equity-based models in Islamic financial solutions has been observed in the more recent period. This has been most evident in the sukuk segment, with Shariah structures evolving from predominantly ijarah and murabahah structures to musharakah partnerships as well as convertible and exchangeable trusts. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  The further development of participatory Islamic finance contracts on a broader scale offers particular potential in efforts to reinforce links between finance and the real economy. Several elements of risk- and profit-sharing participatory contracts support this. As profit-sharing and loss-bearing are clearly identified and agreed based on the contractual agreements between the financier and the entrepreneur, strong emphasis is placed on the value creation and economic viability of productive efforts that create new wealth. In equity-based contracts, the financial intermediation is thus also directed towards promoting entrepreneurship, in that the clearly defined risk- and profit-sharing characteristics of the Islamic financial transaction provides strong incentives for both parties to contribute to the success of the investment. This also provides the foundation for a long-term trust-based relationship, and a clear interest for the financial institutions to undertake the appropriate due diligence to ensure that the returns are commensurate with the risks being assumed. Aspects of governance and risk management thus strongly underpin these contracts. In particular, such contracts demand higher standards of disclosure and transparency to be observed, which in turn act to strengthen market discipline. The legal, regulatory and supervisory framework will need to be adjusted to accord greater clarity to the appropriate legal and regulatory treatment in order to foster the sound and orderly growth of risk-sharing structures and activities, both in terms of the funding and the assets-side of Islamic banks. In Malaysia, steps are currently being taken to provide a conducive enabling environment for this next phase of development that will spur more risk-sharing transactions though the formulation of new legislation for Islamic banking and takaful. This legislation is now at the final stages of the process of its enactment. This new law for the industry is aimed at promoting certainty to the legal and regulatory treatment of Islamic financial transactions by providing legal recognition to the contractual requirements in accordance with the Shariah. This provides a comprehensive legal environment under which effective risk and profit sharing activities can take place, encompassing all aspects of Islamic financial transactions, from its prudential and business conduct requirements to the legal treatment of Islamic banking assets upon its resolution, to be fully consistent with the distinctive elements of the respective Shariah contracts employed in these transactions. This legal framework will also further enhance the capacity of the regulatory and supervisory framework for the Malaysian Islamic finance industry to evolve in greater alignment with the international regulatory and the supervisory standards and best practices issued by the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) to govern the specificities of Islamic financial transactions. To complement the efforts to strengthen the regulatory law for Islamic finance, Malaysia has also established the Law Harmonisation Committee in 2010 to undertake objective reviews on other relevant laws and recommend legislative changes to ensure that the laws in the country would allow for Islamic financial transactions to take place effectively and efficiently. Another important dimension in fostering the further development of risk and profit sharing instruments is the need to ensure the institutional soundness of the Islamic financial institutions and their enhanced ability to assess risks in the real sector. This underscores the imperative of robust risk management capabilities to manage new risks peculiar to risk and profit sharing contracts and the adoption of strong governance, transparency and disclosure practices within the Islamic financial institutions to meet the due diligence requirements for determining the viability of business and investment proposals. Business risks of equity positions and ownership risks of underlying assets are, for example, embedded in these arrangements arising from the contractual relationships between the investors and entrepreneurs as well as the Islamic banking institutions as the intermediary of funds. Further in-depth applied research is also needed to develop more innovative financial products using risk and profit sharing structures with the corresponding development of risk management techniques. This also needs to be reinforced by enhanced consumer protection and education initiatives to deepen the understanding and awareness of consumers on the 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  associated risks and rewards in the Islamic financial contracts, in particular for equity-based instruments. Equally important in ensuring the institutional soundness of Islamic financial institutions is the need for robust liquidity management. Today, Islamic financial institutions operating in the different jurisdictions are still confronted with the challenge of managing their liquidity positions effectively, given the limited supply of high quality Shariah-compliant liquid instruments being the reason most commonly cited. The lack of high quality liquidity instruments for Islamic finance is not only constraining effective liquidity management, but it is also affecting the efficient cross-border diversification of financial flows. It is therefore our hope that through the mandate of the International Islamic Liquidity Management Corporation (IILM) in issuing high-quality liquid sukuks, it will contribute to promoting more efficient cross-border liquidity management by Islamic financial institutions whilst facilitating Islamic financial institutions in meeting the international requirements on liquidity. Let me conclude my remarks. Whilst the evolution of the global financial landscape is currently being shaped by the need to return finance to its basic functions of serving the real economy, several critical questions remain, the answers to which will continue to have an important bearing on the global agenda to build sound and resilient financial systems that promote sustainable growth. In particular, determining the appropriate size of a financial sector relative to its economy before it becomes a risk to overall financial system and economic stability; promoting conditions that ensure that financial innovation is beneficial to the economy; and enhancing prospects for aligning expectations of capital providers with more sustainable banking strategies present significant policy challenges that will continue to occupy the attention of policymakers going forward. The global community has made some important strides, but more work remains to achieve an appropriate balance between preserving safety and soundness of the financial system and allowing financial institutions and markets to perform their intended functions. We are not without policy options. The role of macro-prudential policy and the developments in Islamic finance have gained greater prominence in terms of their potential to improve financial stability outcomes, and most notably by the vital contribution that they make towards restoring the foundations for finance that supports sustainable economic growth, and bringing with it immense benefits to the real economy and to the well-being of society. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepak Mohanty: Money market and monetary operations in India Speech by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Seminar on “Issues in financial markets”, Mumbai, 15 December 2012. *      *      * The assistance provided by Sitikantha Pattanaik, Jeevan Khundrakpam, Binod Bhoi and Rajeev Jain is acknowledged.  I thank Mr. G. Mahalingam for the opportunity to share my thoughts in this distinguished panel on money market. This forum which brings together the Reserve Bank and practitioners in the financial market, is important not only from the perspective of market development but also for fostering a better understanding of monetary operations. Money market is at the heart of monetary operations. Over the last decade, there has been substantial development in the Indian money market in terms of depth, variety of instruments and efficiency. This has enabled the Reserve Bank to change its monetary operations from direct quantity based instruments to indirect interest rate based instruments to enhance the efficiency of monetary transmission consistent with international best practice. Against this background, I will briefly capture the developments in the money market and discuss the experience with the recently modified operating procedure of monetary policy before concluding with some thoughts on the way forward. Role of money market Money market can be defined as a market for short-term funds with maturities ranging from overnight to one year and includes financial instruments that are considered to be close substitutes of money. It provides an equilibrating mechanism for demand and supply of short-term funds and in the process provides an avenue for central bank intervention in influencing both the quantum and cost of liquidity in the financial system, consistent with the overall stance of monetary policy. In the process, money market plays a central role in the monetary policy transmission mechanism by providing a key link in the operations of monetary policy to financial markets and ultimately, to the real economy. In fact, money market is the first and the most important stage in the chain of monetary policy transmission. Typically, the monetary policy instrument, effectively the price of central bank liquidity, is directly set by the central bank. In view of limited control over long-term interest rates, central banks adopt a strategy to exert direct influence on short-term interest rates. Changes in the short-term policy rate provide signals to financial markets, whereby different segments of the financial system respond by adjusting their rates of return on various instruments, depending on their sensitivity and the efficacy of the transmission mechanism. How quickly and effectively the monetary policy actions influence the spectrum of market interest rates depends upon the level of development of various segments of financial markets, particularly the money market. Cross-country studies suggest that as domestic financial markets grow, transmission of monetary policy through various channels becomes better. As a crucial initial link in the chain through which monetary policy aims at achieving ultimate goals relating to inflation and growth, money market developments are closely monitored and influenced by central banks. Besides expecting money market rates to respond to policy rate changes in a well anchored manner, central banks aim at ensuring appropriate liquidity conditions through discretionary liquidity management operations so that money market functions normally. Money market is also an important funding market for banks and financial institutions, and at times, even for corporates. Stressed conditions in the money markets could increase moral hazard with banks expecting a central bank to function as the lender of first resort. Following the recent global financial crisis, money market funding for the financial system effectively got replaced with central bank funding in advanced countries. Money 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches market rates (like LIBOR and EURIBOR) are standard benchmarks for pricing of bonds, loans and other financial products. Market manipulation of this key benchmark – as reportedly happened to LIBOR recently – though undermined the faith in money market. A sound money market would have to ensure conditions where banks can conduct business safely. Money market transactions could be both secured and unsecured, i.e., without collaterals. What does one expect from the secured and unsecured markets? The unsecured market should primarily promote market discipline. Loans being uncollateralised in this market, lenders are directly exposed to the risk of non-repayment. This works as an incentive for them to address information asymmetry by collecting information about borrowers. It is the constant peer monitoring that promotes market discipline. In the secured segment of the money market, the lender may address credit risk concerns by asking for sound collaterals and also applying some haircuts, but the peer monitoring could potentially then be less emphasised. Conditions of market stress can lead to collateral scarcity and falling value of collaterals could stifle even the secured money market. Illiquidity spiral from the financial markets, i.e., when financial instruments held as assets turn illiquid, may lead to a situation where central banks would be required to dilute the collateral standards for liquidity injection, and even exchange good quality securities against securities facing illiquidity risks. This becomes necessary to unfreeze the markets in general. After the global crisis, asset quality, particularly liquidity, has received greater policy focus. Money market rates also reflect market expectations of how the policy rate could evolve in the near term. As per standard expectations hypothesis, money market rates for different time duration should equal expected future short-term rates, plus term premium and risk premium. Bernanke (2004)1 had examined how expectations of the likely future course of the federal funds rate respond to the Fed’s policy actions and statements and noted that “...Our findings support the view that FOMC statements have proven a powerful tool for affecting market expectations about the future course of the federal funds rate”. Empirical research suggests that if the shortest end of the money market, which is influenced the most by policy rate, is stable, or less volatile, then it may help in keeping term premium lower, compared to a period when volatile short rates get transmitted to the entire money market and simultaneously the term premium rises. With the sophistication of financial markets rendering the money, output and price relationship unstable, by the early 1980s, major central banks began to emphasise on the price channel, i.e., policy interest rate for monetary policy transmission. As a result, the role of money market became all the more important for signaling and transmission of monetary policy. Thus, the development of money markets across countries in terms of instruments and participants with varying risk profiles has necessitated changes in the operating procedures of monetary policy. In the case of India, the ultimate goals of monetary policy, i.e., price stability and growth, have remained unchanged over the years. In the recent years, financial stability has been considered as an additional objective of monetary policy. However, operational and intermediate objectives of monetary policy have undergone periodic changes in response to changes in the economic and financial environment. The development of the money market over the years and relative stability in the call money market enabled the Reserve Bank to move away from quantity-based instruments to price-based instruments under its multiple indicators approach adopted since 1998. Accordingly, the overnight call rate, which was used implicitly as operating target since the institution of liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) in 2000, became explicit after the adoption of a new operating procedure in May 2011.                                                  1 Bernanke, Ben S.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Money market in India Financial reforms in India began in the early 1990s. However, various segments of domestic financial markets, viz., money market, debt market and forex market underwent significant shifts mainly from the 1990s. Earlier, the Indian money market was characterised by paucity of instruments, lack of depth and distortions in the market micro-structure. It mainly consisted of uncollateralised call market, treasury bills, commercial bills and participation certificates. Following the recommendations of the Chakravarty Committee (1985), the Reserve Bank adopted a monetary targeting framework. At the same time, efforts were made to develop the money market following the recommendations of Vaghul Committee (1987). In this regard, important developments were: (i) setting up of the Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) in 1988 to impart liquidity to money market instruments and help the development of secondary markets in such instruments; (ii) introduction of instruments such as certificate of deposits (CDs) in 1989 and commercial papers in 1990 and inter-bank participation certificates with and without risk in 1988 to increase the range of instruments; and (iii) freeing of call money rates by May 1989 to enable price discovery. However, the functioning of the market continued to be hindered by a number of structural rigidities such as skewed distribution of liquidity and the prevalence of administered deposit and lending rates of banks. Recognising these rigidities, the pace of reforms in money market was accelerated. Following the recommendations of an Internal Working Group (1997) and the Narasimham Committee (1998), a comprehensive set of measures was undertaken by the Reserve Bank to develop the money market. These included: (i) withdrawal of interest rate ceilings in the money market; (ii) introduction of auctions in treasury bills; (iii) gradual move away from the cash credit system to a loan-based system. Maturities of other existing instruments such as CP and CDs were also gradually shortened to encourage wider participation. Most importantly, the ad hoc treasury bills were abolished in 1997 thereby putting a stop to automatic monetisation of fiscal deficit. This enhanced the instrument independence of the Reserve Bank (Table 1). Table 1 Major Developments in Money Market since the 1990s 1. Abolition of ad hoc treasury bills in April 1997 2. Full fledged LAF in June 2000. 3. CBLO for corporate and non-bank participants introduced in 2003  4. Minimum maturity of CPs shortened by October 2004  5. Prudential limits on exposure of banks and PDs to call/notice market in April 2005  6. Maturity of CDs gradually shortened by April 2005  7. Transformation of call money market into a pure inter-bank market by August 2005  8.

The reporting of all such transactions made compulsory through NDS-CALL in November 2012.  10. Repo in corporate bonds allowed in March 2010. 11. Operationalisation of a reporting platform for secondary market transactions in CPs and CDs in July 2010.  
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches More importantly, efforts were made to transform the call money market into primarily an inter-bank market, while encouraging other market participants to migrate towards collateralised segments of the market, thereby increasing overall market stability and diversification. In order to facilitate the phasing out of corporate and the non-banks from the call money market, new instruments such as market repos and collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) were introduced to provide them avenues for managing their short-term liquidity. Non-bank entities completely exited the call money market by August 2005. In order to minimise the default risk and ensure balanced development of various market segments, the Reserve Bank instituted prudential limits on exposure of banks and primary dealers (PDs) to the call/notice money market. In April 2005, these limits were linked to capital funds (sum of Tier I and Tier II capital) for scheduled commercial banks. In order to improve transparency and efficiency in the money market, reporting of all call/notice money market transactions through negotiated dealing system (NDS) within 15 minutes of conclusion of the transaction was made mandatory. Furthermore, a screen-based negotiated quote-driven system for all dealings in the call/notice and the term money markets (NDS-CALL), developed by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), was operationalised in September 2006 to ensure better price discovery. Beginning in June 2000, the Reserve Bank introduced a full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) and it was operated through overnight fixed rate repo and reverse repo from November 2004. This helped to develop interest rate as an important instrument of monetary transmission. It also provided greater flexibility to the Reserve Bank in determining both the quantum of liquidity as well as the rates by responding to the needs of the system on a daily basis (Chart 1).    
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 In the development of various constituents of the money market, the most significant aspect was the growth of the collateralised market vis-à-vis the uncollateralised market. Over the last decade, while the daily turnover in the call money market either stagnated or declined, that of the collateralised segment, market repo plus CBLO, increased manifold (Chart 2). Since 2007–08, both the CP and CD volumes have also increased very significantly (Chart 3). Furthermore, issuance of 91-treasury bills has also increased sharply (Chart 4). The overall money market now is much larger relative to GDP than a decade ago.     
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Alongside, the rates of return on various instruments in the money market have shown greater co-movement, especially since the introduction of LAF (Table 2 & Chart 5). Table 2 Interest Rates in the Money Market (Percent per annum: Annual Averages)    
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  Monetary operating procedure The development of money market as well as its growing inter-linkages with other segments of financial markets enabled the Reserve Bank to alter the operating procedures of monetary policy consistent with the objectives of the monetary policy. Based on the recommendations of Chakravarty Committee (1985), a monetary targeting framework with feedback was introduced during the mid-1980s, under which reserve money was used as operating target and broad money (M3) as an intermediate target. By the mid-1990s, this framework was rendered increasingly inadequate due to several developments. Structural reforms and financial liberalisation led to a paradigm shift in the financing of government and commercial sectors with increasingly market-determined interest rates and exchange rate. Development in the various segments of the financial market led to deepening of the financial sector. This provided the Reserve Bank to effectively transmit policy signals through indirect instruments such as interest rates. On the other hand, increase in liquidity emanating from capital inflows raised the ratio of net foreign assets to reserve money and rendered the control of monetary aggregates more difficult. With financial innovations, the stability in the demand function for money also came under question. Recognising these challenges and the growing complexities of monetary management, the Reserve Bank switched to a multiple indicators approach in 1998–99. Under this approach, a host of macroeconomic indicators including interest rates in different segments of financial markets, along with other indicators on currency, lending by banks and financial institutions, fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinancing and transactions in foreign exchange available on high frequency basis are juxtaposed with output data for drawing implications for monetary policy formulation. However, the approach itself continued to evolve and was further augmented by forward-looking indicators drawn from Reserve Bank’s various surveys and a panel of parsimonious time series models (Mohanty, 2011).2  Along with the multiple indicators approach, operating procedure also underwent a change following the recommendation of Narasimham Committee II (1998). The RBI introduced the                                                  2 Mohanty, Deepak (2010), “Monetary Policy Framework in India: Experience with Multiple-Indicators Approach”, RBI Bulletin, March 2010. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches Interim Liquidity Adjustment Facility (ILAF) in April 1999, under which liquidity injection was done at the Bank Rate and liquidity absorption was through fixed reverse repo rate. The ILAF gradually transited into a full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) with periodic modifications based on experience and development of financial markets and the payment system. The LAF was operated through overnight fixed rate repo and reverse repo from November 2004, which provided an informal corridor for the call money rate. Though the LAF helped to develop interest rate as an instrument of monetary transmission, two major weaknesses came to the fore. First was the lack of a single policy rate, as the operating policy rate alternated between repo during deficit liquidity situation and reverse repo rate during surplus liquidity condition. Second was the lack of a firm corridor, as the effective overnight interest rates dipped (rose) below (above) the reverse repo (repo) rate in extreme surplus (deficit) conditions. Recognising these shortcomings, a new operating procedure was put in place in May 2011.  Let me elaborate on the key features of the new operating procedure. First, the weighted average overnight call money rate was explicitly recognised as the operating target of monetary policy.3 Second, the repo rate was made the only one independently varying policy rate. Third, a new Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) was instituted under which scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) could borrow overnight at 100 basis points above the repo rate up to one per cent of their respective net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). This limit was subsequently raised to two per cent of NDTL and in addition, SCBs were allowed to borrow funds under MSF on overnight basis against their excess SLR holdings as well. Moreover, the Bank Rate being the discount rate was aligned to the MSF rate. Fourth, the revised corridor was defined with a fixed width of 200 basis points. The repo rate was placed in the middle of the corridor, with the reverse repo rate at 100 basis points below it and the MSF rate as well as the Bank Rate at 100 basis points above it (Chart 6). Thus, under the new operating procedure, all the three other rates announced by the Reserve Bank, i.e., reverse repo rate, MSF rate and the Bank Rate, are linked to the single policy repo rate. The new operating procedure was expected to improve the implementation and transmission of monetary policy for the following reasons. First, explicit announcement of an operating target makes market participants clear about the desired policy impact. Second, a single policy rate removes the confusion arising out of policy rate alternating between the repo and the reverse repo rates, and makes signalling of monetary policy stance more accurate. Third, MSF provides a safety valve against unanticipated liquidity shocks. Fourth, a fixed interest rate corridor set by MSF rate and reverse repo rate, reduces uncertainty and communication difficulties and helps keep the overnight average call money rate close to the repo rate. Let me now turn to a brief evaluation of the experience with the new operating procedure. In the implementation of the new procedure, the Reserve Bank prefers to keep the systemic liquidity in deficit mode as monetary transmission is found to be more effective in this situation (RBI, 2011).4 The Reserve Bank also announced an indicative liquidity comfort zone of (+)/(–) 1.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks.                                                    3 Even though the share of call money market in the overnight money market is lower than that of collateralised segment, the weighted overnight call rate is used as operating target. This is partly on account of high correlation between the overnight call money rate and the collaterallised money market rate at 0.9. The issue was examined in detail by the Working Group on Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy which observed that the transmission of policy rate to the overnight call money rate is stronger than the overnight money market rate. In addition, the call money market is a pure inter-bank market and, hence, better reflects the net liquidity situation. 4 Reserve Bank of India (2011), Report of the Working Group on Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy (Chairman: Deepak Mohanty), March. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9     Since May 2011, the liquidity conditions can be broadly divided into three distinct phases. After generally remaining within the Reserve Bank’s comfort zone during the first phase during May–October 2011, the liquidity deficit crossed the one per cent of NDTL level during November 2011 to June 2012. This large liquidity deficit was mainly caused by forex intervention and increased divergence between credit and deposit growth. The deficit conditions were further aggravated by frictional factors like the build-up of government cash balances with the Reserve Bank that persisted longer than anticipated and the increase in currency in circulation. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank had to actively manage liquidity through injection of liquidity by way of open market operations (OMOs) and cut in cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks. This was supported by decline in currency in circulation and a reduction in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank. As a result, there was a significant easing of liquidity conditions since July 2012 with the extent of the deficit broadly returning to the Reserve Bank’s comfort level of one per cent of NDTL (Chart 7).  
10 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Since its implementation, the systemic liquidity has been in deficit mode, which has helped in better transmission of policy rate to various segments of money markets. First, the overnight interest rate has been more stable since its implementation (Chart 8).   Second, the repo rate and weighted call rate are far more closely aligned under the new operating procedure than earlier; implying improved transmission of monetary policy in terms of movement in call money market interest rate (Chart 9). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 11  Third, the call money rate in turn is observed to be better aligned with other money market interest rates after the implementation of new operating procedure than before (Chart 10).  Conclusion  Let me conclude. Our experience shows that the development of money market and refinements in operating procedures of monetary policy have moved in tandem. Financial sector reforms along with Reserve Bank’s emphasis on development of various segments of financial market enabled shifts in operating procedures based on direct quantity-based instruments to indirect interest rate-based instruments. The Reserve Bank has been able to better transmit monetary policy signals in the money market through a single policy repo rate. 
12 BIS central bankers’ speeches Evidence so far suggests a significant improvement in monetary policy transmission under the new operating framework. In order to reinforce this process, I make three suggestions. First, there has been a swift transmission of policy rate at the short-end of money market, partly due to the prevalence of market liquidity in deficit mode. However, ensuring market liquidity in a deficit mode of desired level on a sustained basis is contingent on Reserve Bank’s ability to effectively conduct OMOs and the market appetite for such operations. Hence, there is a need to develop the market micro-structure and further enhance secondary market transactions in government securities to facilitate smooth conduct of OMOs. Second, the LAF is not the appropriate instrument for managing the liquidity of more enduring nature. As the system is expected to be in deficit, there is a need to develop term repo to minimise daily requirement of liquidity. Third, notwithstanding significant advances in developing the market, the term structure in the money market is incomplete. It is, therefore, desirable to extend the yield curve beyond the overnight rate by developing a term-money market. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, before the Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 17 December 2012. *      *      * Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure to be back here in Parliament and in front of your Committee for our last exchange of views in 2012. This year has not been an easy one. It has been a year when the ties that bind the Member States of the euro area have been tested. But it has also been a year in which a longer-term vision for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has been formulated. And it is a year in which that vision has begun to be translated into actions, including on vital reforms of European governance. We end the year on a positive note with the re-launching of that longer-term vision, with the proactive steps taken by governments and European institutions towards a genuine EMU and, most recently, with the unanimous agreement by the ECOFIN to establish a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Let me congratulate your Committee for the swift adoption of its position on the SSM and its ambitious European approach. This a clear demonstration that European institutions are determined to act in a timely and decisive way to complete EMU. And it is a clear demonstration that euro area Member States are ready to agree to a substantial sharing of sovereignty when circumstances require. Recent agreements mark a major qualitative step towards a stable EMU. The establishment of the SSM can be expected to be a key turning point in the resolution of our current challenges. The SSM will contribute to restoring confidence in the banking sector across the euro area. It will help to revive inter-bank lending and cross-border credit flows, with tangible effects for the real economy. And combined with possible direct recapitalisation of banks by the European Stability Mechanism and an envisaged single resolution mechanism, the SSM will go a long way towards breaking the vicious feedback loops between sovereigns and banks. I hope that the legislative process can now be concluded swiftly. After the adoption of the relevant legal acts, the European Central Bank (ECB) will launch the preparations so that the SSM can be established within the timeline foreseen by the legislators. In my introductory remarks today, I will first briefly summarise the economic and monetary situation. I will then address the relationship between monetary policy and financial supervision. And I will close by outlining my views on the priorities for 2013 in implementing the shared longer-term vision for EMU. 1. Economic and monetary developments Since our last meeting, the ECB has left its key interest rates unchanged: the main refinancing rate stands at 0.75%; the rate on the deposit facility at 0%; and the rate on the marginal lending facility at 1.50%. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  On non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council decided in December to continue conducting all refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, at least until July 2013. The medium-term outlook for economic activity remains challenging. Economic activity contracted for a second consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2012, and indicators for the fourth quarter signal further weakness, although some recent survey indicators have stabilised at low levels and financial market sentiment has improved further. Domestic demand is dampened by still weak consumer and investor sentiment and the ongoing balance sheet adjustments in the banking and business sectors, which continue to weigh on investment decisions. We expect economic weakness to extend into next year with a very gradual recovery in the second half of the year. The recovery is expected to be supported by strengthening global demand, a highly accommodative monetary policy stance and significantly improved confidence in financial markets, all of which should work their way through to spending and investment decisions. Annual inflation in the euro area has continued to moderate, falling from 2.5% in October to 2.2% in November. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to decline further. This should support real disposable incomes. Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced. Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly in line with the Governing Council’s aim of maintaining annual inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Our monetary analysis paints a picture consistent with price stability. Looking at developments over several months, the underlying pace of monetary expansion, when accounting for special factors, remains subdued. Loan dynamics are also subdued and in many parts of the euro area, credit has been contracting. This is the result of balance sheet adjustments by banks and businesses as well as the current economic weakness. 2. Monetary policy and financial supervision Let me now turn to the first topic chosen for our exchange of views, namely the relationship between monetary policy and financial supervision. The discussions leading to the recent decision to establish the SSM have raised questions about how monetary policy responsibilities and supervisory responsibilities should be appropriately separated. In recent years, many central banks have, for good reasons, assumed supervisory roles. Fourteen of the 17 national central banks in the euro area have a role in supervision and so too do several major central banks elsewhere in the world. Indeed, the global financial crisis has generally led to closer ties between central banks and financial supervision. The Bank of England, for example, will soon assume supervisory responsibilities previously assigned to the Financial Services Authority. In the US, the role of the Fed in financial supervision has been strengthened. This all suggests that the relationship between monetary policy and financial supervision is particularly important in times of crisis. It is not by chance that historically the first central banks were supervisors of commercial banks. The ECB will establish clear guiding principles and internal operating practices to ensure effective separation of monetary policy and financial supervision. Let me briefly elaborate. First, the ECB’s involvement in financial supervision has no bearing whatsoever on our primary objective of price stability. It bears neither on the objective itself, which is statutory, nor on its quantified expression of inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Second, a supervisory board will form the centre of gravity for the conduct of financial supervision. It may encompass a geographical entity that is somewhat wider than the euro area if, as we hope, several countries that are not currently euro area Member States decide to join the SSM. Third, separation between monetary policy and financial supervision will in particular take the form of independent analysis and prescription for the use of policy tools for each of the two functions. This will rely on strong governance. We will establish appropriate internal procedures that ensure clear functional separation. Here we will follow international best practice. While separation of the two functions is essential, it is an established fact that stronger supervision facilitates the conduct of monetary policy. Let me give you just two examples. First, in the absence of financial stability, standard monetary policy tools – namely, changes in the short-term interest rate – lose some of their potency. Effective supervision that contributes to a stable financial system can only benefit the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Second, effective financial supervision can counteract excessive leverage and exuberant credit expansions, which can generate inflationary pressure over the longer term. Thus, in mitigating the build-up of macroeconomic imbalances, effective supervision can foster a stable macroeconomic environment with stable prices. Monetary policy will stay credibly oriented towards price stability. In so doing, it secures the trust of markets and the public in the stable purchasing power of a currency. This stabilises market expectations, lowers volatility and creates an environment for stable financial markets. We have begun internal reflections on all these issues, together with the national central banks, and we stand ready to launch the formal preparations as soon as the legal framework has been adopted. 3. A genuine economic and monetary union Let me now turn to the second topic chosen for our exchange of views, namely a genuine economic and monetary union. In the spring of this year, after three years of severe economic and financial challenges, it became clear that what the euro area needs is a coherent longer-term vision for EMU. At our April hearing, we discussed such a vision, following earlier discussions in this Committee about the Fiscal Compact and Growth Compact. The vision was then laid out in greater detail for the Heads of State or Government. Since that time, remarkable progress has been made. The June European Council was an important milestone. Institutional changes that were not conceivable less than a year ago have been put on the EU political agenda or are about to be finalised. The SSM is a prime example of such political momentum. Last week, the European Council set out further steps towards the completion of EMU. The in-depth discussions of structural reforms and the challenges of competitiveness have been particularly important – and they are reflected in the Council’s conclusions. From an ECB perspective, I see two main priorities for 2013. First, we should improve the functioning of economic union. Excessive imbalances within the euro area have destabilised EMU. This must not be allowed to happen again. It is encouraging that adjustment is now visibly underway. For example, exports of goods and services have increased by 27% in volume in Spain since 2009 – and by 14% for Ireland, 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  22% for Portugal and 21% for Italy. These four countries are also experiencing gains in relative unit labour costs. Economic reforms bear fruit, even if, in the short term, the costs to individual citizens can be considerable. But the reforms are the right path. Governments should persevere. What can be done at the European level to provide even more support for this process? The proposed “reform contracts” between euro area Member States and EU institutions are a promising avenue. Combined with a carefully designed framework of targeted and temporary financial support, they should contribute to fostering structural reforms and thereby strengthening competitiveness. Ideally, the reform contracts should focus on countries with the largest competitiveness challenges. They should identify the structural bottlenecks to improving competitiveness and target the reforms in a way that will remove those bottlenecks. This would establish a clear link between reforms and restoring competitiveness, which is essential for growth and job creation. Smooth functioning of product and labour markets is a prerequisite for growth and job creation in EMU. I therefore welcome the announcement that next year the European Commission will undertake a systematic review of product and labour markets. For euro area countries the review should allow to assess whether these markets are fully compatible with participation in EMU. Here, product and labour markets must provide for enhanced adjustment capacity to adapt to a changing global economic environment and ensure sustained high levels of employment. The second priority for 2013 from the ECB’s perspective is the completion of financial union with the establishment of a single resolution mechanism. The aim of resolution is to deal with non-viable banks through measures that include their orderly winding down and closure while preserving financial stability. Such a mechanism will make it possible for banks to fail in an orderly manner. Improving economic union by restoring competitiveness and the functioning of product and labour markets on the one hand, and setting up a single resolution framework on the other hand are key priorities for 2013. This Committee has always pushed for ambitious European solutions in the field of financial and economic governance. I am confident that you will again play an instrumental role in moving the agenda forward and adopting the relevant legislative proposals. Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  G Padmanabhan: Technology enabled transformation in the financial sector Keynote address by Mr G Padmanabhan, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the GM/CIOs Conference of the Institute for Development & Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), Hyderabad, 17 December 2012. *      *      * Assistance provided by Smt K Nikhila in the preparation of this speech and comments on the draft from S/Shri S Ganeshkumar and A Madhavan gratefully acknowledged. Mr Sambamurthy, Members of Faculty, CIOs and GMs of banks, ladies and gentlemen. I thank the IDRBT for inviting me to address this erudite audience. The issues that I have chosen to flag; I hope, would generate adequate interest and be the basis for further deliberations leading to some concrete suggestions. We, in the Reserve Bank would eagerly look forward to such outcomes, as these can be useful to set the road map for technology adoption in the Indian financial sector in the years to come. Introductory thoughts Information and communication technology is playing a vital role across many industries and sectors, resulting in a positive impact on economic development cutting across the geographical barriers. It is important to note that the financial sector and more particularly banking industry was one of the very first to utilize information technology way back in the 1960s, and has thus the record of influencing the development process through the technology. The banking sector is an example in which information technology infrastructures have had implications on the economic development of many nations across jurisdictions. Studies show that information technology coupled with knowledge management hold much potential for propelling the development process (Okpaku, 2003). Since the 1990s, the banking sector in India has seen greater emphasis being placed on technology and innovation. Banks began to use technology initially with a view to take care of their internal requirements pertaining to book keeping, balancing and for transactions processing; the all-pervasive face of Information Technology soon enabled banks to provide better quality of services at greater speed. Internet banking and mobile banking have made it possible for customers to access banking services literally and virtually from anywhere and anytime. The biggest barriers, time and distance, to access banking services were crossed by leveraging technology. The sector has also moved rapidly towards universal banking and electronic transactions, which changed the way banking is done, during the last decade or so. Take the case of payment systems, an area which I am familiar with and where technology has brought in a sea-change. Till 1990s, one could make payments in this country through two predominant means – cash and cheque. Today, a tech-savvy customer is empowered to choose a desired service from slew of products – card payments, NEFT transfer, RTGS transfer, ECS/NECS payments, mobile payments etc. Further, after using any of these payment methods, the first instrument he turns to is his mobile phone for confirmatory messages, a feature unique to India. What would you imagine as the future scenario? Consider this: “the future of payments is the elimination of POS terminals and checkout lines that require an associate in a store to scan and bag purchases item by item. The most frictionless solution is not a smart phone but a collection of sensor networks that automatically identify the buyer, scan the items to be purchased, and process payments without human intervention. No lines, no taps, no swipes, no associates, no cash registers. Just wireless sensors and networks that automatically process transactions, manage inventory, etc… Our grand kids won’t be carrying a wallet even if it’s digital… Biometric factoring is not that far away. You’ve heard of fingerprinting and retina scans. The distance 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  between pupils is unique even between twins. You’ll be able to walk into a store that knows how much you have available [if you’ve made that information available], what you usually spend based on which a personalized deal is offered. Your pre-set rules and the store’s pre-set rules will negotiate, and the store will offer you a set of options.” The impact of social commerce is also evident, so much so that one could expect to get discounts and other rewards based on your influence on friends’ purchases.”1 To restate the future scenario more directly, in the next few years, there will be substantial challenges for the banking industry. Customers will become increasingly individualistic and, at the same time, more discerning in their relationships with banks. Ubiquitous information and the power of social media inputs will result in customers comparing offerings across the market; evaluating the service levels of different banks and also demanding transactions increasingly on their own terms – a mimic of the corporate sector. This may well signal the sunset phase of the hitherto traditional segmentation approaches and “go-to market” techniques. There would be dramatic changes in the levels of competition in the retail banking space with the predicted entry of non banks. Banks, may have to look at opportunities particularly with respect to harnessing product, service and process innovation to serve customers better, and to create a niche in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Two main trends that may stand out here, as the most significant forces that will drive industry change are increasing customer centric products and intensifying competition. Further, the other trends that may change the way we do banking in the future would be – managing human capital, regulations and technologies – and these may strongly contribute to and reinforce the effects of intensifying competition and customer empowerment on banks’ strategic choices.2 Are we ready? And could these be the niche areas of focussed research for the IDRBT? Before moving on to the next set of issues, let me set out a few more questions. If IT is to rule our lives, how do we measure whether IT has delivered? IT has certainly enabled banks to increase its business multiple times with less of man power. But is this sufficient? What has been the customer experience? Do banks study the customer satisfaction levels after a new product is offered? Are there tools or techniques available to measure the impact of IT? Can IDRBT and the experts here suggest tangible methods of measuring the success or failure of IT deployment? Mind the gap – issues in IT delivery in the banking sector Though IT is increasingly becoming an invaluable and powerful tool in driving development, supporting growth, promoting innovation, and enhancing competitiveness in the banking context in India, there are several potential areas where technology can deliver better.  Financial inclusion Technology plays a major role in financial inclusion, a sustainable banking theme very relevant to a country like India that has a large unbanked population. For example, handheld devices, used by bank agents to draw people living in remote areas into the banking fold, run on technology. Internet and mobile technologies are trying to reach out to the populace starved of banking services as well. Financial institutions are also joining forces with network operators in providing access to mobile based payment services even to those who do not have bank accounts. These product and channel innovations require robust and scalable ICT platforms.                                                 1  Lisa Morgan- “Making Change: The Future of Payments is ease of use.” 2  The paradox of Banking 2015 - IBM paper. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  If we want to move the mobile financial services sector beyond payments space and create products that reach every level of society, we have to be creative. The industry requires product innovation that focuses on customer desires, usage patterns, and needs, and then translate these findings into viable products. For example, in Uganda, Grameen Foundation’s AppLab is partnering with MTN and CGAP to do this by launching a product incubator: AppLab Money. This product AppLab Money reportedly uses several complementary research methods to understand the financial lives of the poor. In this context, are our efforts good enough? Where can we do more? Isn’t it time for introspection? Innovation  Today, banking is becoming increasingly complex and banks which fail to use technology to take their services to the common man and tap the potential of the rural sector will stand to lose. Ultimately, technology would be the key enabler and differentiator in accomplishing this objective. When we look at technology, the scope for innovation is immense – in the field of financial inclusion itself, right from biometric based systems to mobile based to simple Interactive Voice Response based applications. But it cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. This however, does not reduce the importance of standardisation and interoperability which would result in higher efficiency and more choices. Further, many initiatives using technology would be impossible to pursue without the active participation and support of several stakeholders. Thus the need of the hour is collaborative innovation. Do banks recognise the power of innovation to create higher customer satisfaction, loyalty and bank productivity through their products/processes/channels? Data integrity The policy and decision-making processes are becoming more information intensive, therefore, it is imperative to ensure quality of data and its timely submission by banks not only to the regulator but to the banks’ managements as well. This area requires more attention, given that data quality may have an impact on the reputation of banks besides posing other risks. You would appreciate that accurate data is a sine-qua non for improving the quality of MIS and an effective Decision Support System (DSS). By adopting an automated process for submission of returns, the banks would be able to submit accurate and timely data without any manual intervention to the regulator. Inter alia, this process would also assist the banks in terms of improved timelines, enhanced data quality, improved efficiency of processes. Towards this, the Reserve Bank has initiated the Automated Data Flow Project. The deadline for banks to automate all their returns is March 2013. Are the banks braced up to meet the deadline?  Cost of transactions  Technology has been helping in delivering affordable financial services with greater efficiency without compromising on levels of safety, security and reliability. Perhaps the most significant contribution of technology has been in attempting to bring down the cost of financial services by using economies of scale. Technology has also been used in removing geographical barriers and reaching out to the unbanked – the poor are unreached but not unreachable. The use of electronic payment modes to disburse the governments social benefit transfers illustrates this point. Technology should be used in such a manner that you have a diversified product range to bridge the supply gap at the same time keeping in view the customers convenience in mind. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Has IT delivered in India in terms of reducing the costs? If not why? Is the Government/ Regulatory intervention the best way forward? What are the advantages or dangers to such an approach? Channel security To compete successfully in today’s tough market place, financial institutions need to retain the trust of their customers –a trust which relies not only on their capacity to deliver good value services, but also on their ability to protect people, assets, premises and the highly sensitive data they hold. There is always an element of hidden fear as far as IT based operations are concerned, the fear of the unknown. Banks need to ensure that the best of controls and security measures are in place. Customer education is the key to customer trust. Are there steps taken towards customer education as far as IT based service delivery channels are concerned? Are these adequate? How to bridge the Gap?  Having identified some of the gaps, let me now try and offer suggestions to bridge these gaps. IT and business alignment Alignment can be described as the timely and appropriate application of IT in harmony with business objectives, strategies and requirements. Alignment occurs when the respective strategies are interwoven in such a way that the right things are done to deliver greater value to the organisation. After all, a successful alignment is a two way relationship, a give and take between IT and business. Though IT has the capability to reduce costs, standardise processes, the benefits of successful IT-business alignment are beyond these i.e. increased efficiency of implementation & integration, reduced cycle time, increased enterprise agility and the ultimate benefit of improving the bottom line. Until recently IT played a docile role in business planning. It is now time for banks to move over from being merely an implementation tool to shaping business strategy. The principal difficulty is that there are few instances of business oriented IT strategies as most are focussed on technology products of one shape or another. This makes it all the more challenging to align the IT and business strategies. Managing outsourcing IT outsourcing is a growing phenomenon in developing economies. The challenges of outsourcing range from selection of ideal outsourcing partner to dynamic issues of knowledge transfer, security risks, legal concerns, vendor dependency, etc. This concern has heightened in recent years and these issues may be dealt with in synchronization with general governance principles. As we look to external IT service providers for assisting us to innovate and optimize, we must assess how mature our outsourcing capability is to utilize the right engagement models and align ourselves with the appropriate providers. Before initiating the process of outsourcing any service/application, it is necessary to examine whether the outsourced function meets the business needs and strategic objectives. Identification of the nature of the activities undertaken by the vendor and the inherent risks of the activity are also important. It is recommended that due diligence in selecting, contracting, supervising and monitoring of the vendor is adopted. Diligence in vendor selection also requires a reasonable inquiry into the ability and suitability of the vendor to meet the requirements for the proposed service. Well defined and enforceable Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with the vendor will establish the performance standard and service quality expected under the agreement. As part of meeting principles of governance, it may be ensured that there is a documented, accepted procedure which governs service expectations and obligations including change management.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Combating cyber crime In a networked world, there are no real safe harbours—like a ship which can be attacked by pirates anywhere, a service delivery offering on the network is generally available to everyone else on the network; in some cases this may well be the gateway for entry to the bank’s main systems as well. Cyber security is a collective concern that is comprehensive in scope—the Internet has no national boundaries. Whereas security is typically regulated at the government level, cyber security is national, international, public and private in character – all in the same context. Today, there are Government initiatives aimed at enhancing cyber security which is complemented by cyber risk management and security provided by private entities that manage and operate most ICT infrastructure. Such security cannot be adequately assured by market forces or regulation; rather, it requires a novel mix of solutions involving a range of stakeholders working both in their own domains and in concert. No single strategy, set of governance arrangements, or operational practices will be right for every country. Cyber security issues now top the list of risks to watch. While such importance is ascribed for cyber security in general, banks, as prime targets of financial fraud and crime, need to be extra vigilant as far as cyber security is concerned and this needs to be ingrained in each and every offering made available using IT. The role of organisations such as IDRBT assume significance in this regard.  To share some important findings: • India is seeing an increase in the number of cyber attacks, from 2,565 in 2008 to 8,266 in 2009 and 10,315 in 2010 (source: CERT-In). India is one of the top three countries in the world in terms of malicious activities.3 India has been responsible for sending out 16 percent of all spam according to the results of IBM’s “X-Force 2012 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report’’, ahead of the 15% level of the USA. Some of the cyber security threats (malware and virus) reported by CERT-In are DNS Changer malware, Zeus BOT, stuxnet and spyeye. • According to a report by Japanese security company Trend Micro, hackers are now increasingly targeting Indian financial institutions with the latest variants of malware like SpyEye and Zeus to siphon larger amounts of money from bank accounts. It has reported a whopping 187 per cent rise in phishing attacks being reported on various Indian brands in May this year over the previous month and points out that significantly, all phishing are targeted on the banking sector.4 In this context, the questions that arise are:  • How secure are we? • How literate and aware are our employees about the IT governance and cyber security?  • Is there an organisation culture for detecting and reporting of violations?  • Is there a zero tolerance policy about breeches of policies? • Do business partners share and observe your governance and security policy?  All these assume significance in view of the fact that the internal threats from employees and third party service providers are as critical as external threats.                                                 3  Source: Symantec Intelligence Quarterly: July - September, 2011. 4  http://newindianexpress.com/business/article551583.ece. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Governance in IT Is IT governance all about IT? A consistent IT Governance policy provides institutions with tools which ensure that IT investment drives business to meet its goals. IT Governance depends strongly on corporate governance and the overall corporate strategy, which means that IT strategy and IT processes should be in consonance with business goals. In other words, it means that IT Governance provides tools to manage IT structures and processes in order to appropriately support business strategy. Implementing IT Governance in banks can be very challenging. For addressing the structural inadequacies in the areas of IT governance – information, data, information security – there is an imperative need to have synergy among these areas. Adoption of a structured IT Governance framework would enable banks to manage their businesses in a manner that would bring about benefits to their customers as also facilitate the growth of banks in this fiercely competitive world. Banks’ investments in IT are most fruitful when they match technology strategy with business strategy, implement systems in a disciplined way, and balance value creation with increased IT capabilities. Human capital – development of knowledge and talent marketplace Though the face of banking industry has undergone a sea change in the years that have gone by, you would agree with one characteristic of the industry that has remained unchanged is people. The banks succeed or fail depending on the quality of their workforce talent at every level—the front lines, middle management and executive leadership. Banks should look at workforce talent as the primary engine for sustained, competitive advantage and for creating a workforce in which people at every level are capable of contributing with high levels of performance leveraging on technology. It’s about creating a IT culture of excellence. It is the HR teams that will give banks the competitive advantage in the years to come.  Analytics – to drive up customer confidence  The power of predictive analytics is undisputable. It has made deep inroads into several industries and is now doing the same in banking. So, what’s new? Haven’t banks – the producers and consumers of more data than most other industries, been mining it since ages? Yes, but data mining and analytics aren’t the same thing. To cut a long story short, the latest analytics solutions have the ability to process petabytes of data into predictive insights, in near real time. This means that in theory, banks can derive key insights into the outcome of an action, even as they execute it. In practical terms, this could mean the difference between stopping fraud in mid-transaction or raising the alarm after the deed is done. Now banks should be looking at leveraging predictive analytics to acquire and retain customers, manage campaigns and improve cross sales. They also have the opportunity to refine customer understanding to a different level, with the help of analytics, which would improve customer centricity. Concluding thoughts At this stage, I would like to acknowledge the contributions made by you all. As CIOs and IT managers, you have all excelled in bringing about the much needed change in the banking sector. A decade back we could see on the sign boards “fully computerised branch” which now could perhaps be changed to “fully automated transaction processing branch”. We cannot, however, rest with this. We need to strive towards higher levels, each one of you becoming a super CIO5 – A CIO who can function as that lever and who can make a difference to the bank’s productivity. Since I am addressing a group of CIOs, I would like to                                                 5  CIO Anniversary Issue – November 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  leave you with some thoughts as to how you can transform into super CIOs by using technology differently: Use big data Banks would need to think about Big data. Collecting and analysing transactional data will give banks more insight into their customer’s preferences. It can be used to create new products and services and allow banks to remedy emerging problems in an efficient manner. However there is one word of caution, you may need skilled personnel to work on the tools to analyse the data. Lead What CIOs need is independent thought, open-mindedness, flexibility and the ability to learn continuously. Technology expects you to be a student for all your life. You also need to have that ‘‘fire in your belly’’ to lead a team. Leadership is an art. Master IT. This may also mean that you may have to press pause button while engaging the top management once in a while for effectively bridging gaps between the IT and business teams. Collaborate To increase efficiency and ensure regulatory compliance, banks need better methods of gathering and reporting data from all their verticals. Most banks struggle with multiple back-office systems and silo based information. To address these issues in earnest, there will be a need for new and improved business process management tools in the times ahead and hence a great deal of collaboration among all. Stay secure New technologies being adopted everyday are opening doors for new threats. To combat these, we need new weapons. In the first place we need to identify information that needs to be secure and protected at all times. Further we need to put in effective security for accessing, sharing and controlling important documents across the extended and mobile enterprise on any device. You would appreciate that controlling sensitive or confidential documents is more difficult than controlling records in databases. Most organisations including banks focus the majority of their security resources on the network rather than their applications. Banks would need to prioritise their application security to avoid being “sitting ducks” for impending attacks. There’s a silver lining here. According to a report,6 security in the banking vertical worldwide has shown its dedication to security. During 2011–12, banking websites have had the highest remediation rate at 74%. Go Cloud but with caution  The rapid emergence of cloud computing is transforming the way financial institutions think about how they consume their IT resources. The Cloud is here to stay. We all know it but are worried whether or not to acknowledge it. This is because we are worried about the security and data integrity in the Cloud. Cloud computing, which in the most basic of terms, offers unlimited computing resource as a service on a pay-per-use basis, is proven to directly translate to less upfront capital expense and reduced IT overheads, offering a cost-effective, simple alternative to accessing enterprise-level IT without the associated costs. But world over, financial sector is treading with caution in adopting this technology. Indian financial sector needs to be conscious of this reality, at least until such time, the industry evolves Indian standards for cloud computing.                                                 6  Whitehat Security Website Statistics report 2011. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Source  Outsourcing is still in. It may have taken on new names like the cloud but traditional outsourcing is not really extinct. CIOs need to work towards improving their relationship with their vendor so that banks may finally look, in the long run, towards increasing their productivity. In order to cut outsourcing costs, banks may look towards setting clear expectations from the vendor, take control of the project, and choose the vendor wisely. At times, banks may look towards being reasonable in their negotiations, at times “put the contract away”, partner with them to bring about change and be nice; of course not at the cost of expecting sub-optimal performance!! Manage Mobile  The mobile revolution has created a sort of new world order. It has the potential to change the way banks do business. It is up to the banks to take cue. While banks are embracing the mobile channel – and continuing to support the old standby of online banking – they are not integrating the technologies used to build e-banking solutions. Also as more people conduct their banking on mobile devices, these devices also will become the growing focus of hackers and fraudsters, who are always on the hunt for ripe targets. Banks can work on two areas within the mobile channel:7 fraud prevention and marketing to customers. In fact, world over mobile banking already is playing a role in reducing fraud in a variety of ways – ranging from simple transaction and security alerts to mobile authentication for bank transfers. As I conclude, let me flag final set of broad issues: • Can CIOs of banks come together and identify three major challenges which require immediate remediation? IDRBT could take these forward as their core activity. • A major aspect to be taken care of in IT implementation pertains to technological obsolescence. CIOs need to be ready with alternatives before this sets in as far as their systems are concerned. Could we see CIOs collaborating so that you drive the change rather than getting driven? • All of you are fully aware of the KYC requirements. Can we look at technology based KYC which is easy to implement yet ensures secure and sure information which cannot be repudiated? • Has time come for CIOs to worry about over dependence on some IT systems (Oracle for database, Windows for Operating system and so on)? • Finally what would be the best fit options for inter-operability across IT systems and more importantly inter-operability across banks? Whether it’s helping to better understand customer profitability, deliver products in innovative ways or manage the spiralling data requirements as a result of new regulation, technology is emerging as both a key enabler and differentiator. As the role of technology evolves more into mainstream banking, banks will need to think about technology expenditure in a different way. Instead of being a cost to manage down, it should be seen more as an investment to support growth and new business development, only to stay ahead of the curve in the competitive world. Ultimately, the proof of technology adoption is in the improvement of services to customers – across all economic, social and geographical sectors. And the CIO’s have a large role to play in fulfilling this objective. I would like to conclude with the observation of Gurucharan Das who said ‘‘What leadership needs more than thought is action and what’s more important than intelligence is will power’’. CIOs, who are leaders in their own right, should work towards translating their thoughts into action with the will power to make IT happen.                                                 7  Forrester Report commissioned by ClairMail.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: Interview with Financial Times Interview with Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, in Financial Times, conducted by Mr Lionel Barber, Financial Times editor, and Mr Michael Steen, Frankfurt bureau chief, in Frankfurt on 11 December 2012, published on 14 December 2012. *      *      * The following is an edited transcript of the interview. FT Do you think when historians look back, that they will say this was the year that the euro was rescued? MD This year will in my view be remembered as the year when the long-term vision for the euro and the euro area was re-launched. The June summit, especially, was a key event. It’s also the year when euro area governments achieved substantial progress in adjusting their economies. And it’s the year when the ECB has stepped in to remove tail risks.  FT Why was the June summit so important? MD The June summit was important because, for the first time in many years, it laid out a medium-term vision for a genuine economic and monetary union, made by four pillars: fiscal union, the so-called banking union, economic union and political union, endorsed by the leaders. That was an important milestone. FT This was the extension to the Maastricht framework that had proven to be inadequate?  MD Exactly. The leaders built on Maastricht with a stronger fiscal discipline. In the euro area a country cannot pursue its economic policies in a completely independent way, ignoring their implications for other member states. This was one of the main conclusions of that summit. Sovereignty is something that needs to be shared.  FT Was the June summit the precondition for OMT? MD No, the decision for OMT was meant to pursue, within our mandate, our objective to deliver price stability. The removal of tail risks related to unfounded fears regarding the euro was essential to fight fragmentation of the euro area markets. And that has been important because with fragmentation – I’ve stressed this many times – we are not in a position to deliver price stability for the euro area as a whole.  FT When did it become clear that you had to take that step as a central bank? MD Clear visible signs of fragmentation had been with us since the second half of last year, gradually leading to a euro area-wide credit crunch by year-end. Then the ECB conducted the two LTRO operations, which removed another type of risk, namely the possibility of a banking crisis caused by lack of liquidity. They had a very powerful effect of calming financial markets for some time. But then, by the end of April this year, we saw all types of spreads widening again, and the amount of short positions against the euro picking up. These signs made clear that fragmentation had reached points beyond which we would not be able to deliver price stability. FT I’m going to explore this crucial approach, which you adopted on OMT and which you clearly said, one, that it would be conditional. And, two, that you were acting within the ECB mandate. But before I do that, I just want to turn the reel back to when you started and ask you about strategy, because it seems to me that you have had a strategy. You may not have been convinced that you could save the euro, or, at least, re-launch the euro, but you had a strategy. Is that right, or have you more improvised? MD There certainly was a deep reflection going on in the months before, both in the ECB and in the Governing Council, about how to cope with this fragmentation. The objective was and still is to restore a financially integrated monetary area. The OMT was the result of this 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  reflection. The first element of which was the acknowledgment that we were in what economists call a “bad equilibrium”, namely, a situation in which you have self-reinforcing expectations that, if left on their own, produce disruptive outcomes. It’s a vicious circle that we had to break, but we should never forget how we found ourselves in that “bad equilibrium” to begin with, and that was because during the previous ten years several governments of the euro area pursued economic policies which were either plainly wrong, or they were simply missing, in a world that was changing fast.  FT But the crucial point is that this was a different quality of intervention and approach from earlier years in the ECB. You said it will be conditional and unlimited, whereas earlier it was limited and unconditional. MD That’s the difference between the OMT and the SMP.  FT But did you say, look, we understand, historically and politically, why it’s been limited and unconditional, but this isn’t working. We have to move beyond that. Was that you arguing that, or do you think that was within the ECB, everybody understood it? MD There was a sense among us that the SMP had run out of steam in terms of its effectiveness. FT All the top financiers were saying that they’ve got to have unlimited ECB capacity. Of course, but the conditionality was crucial for winning support within the Governing Council, but even more important in Berlin. MD The decision was taken in total and full independence. Certainly, conditionality, in a set-up like ours, is essential for two reasons. One is that it’s a form of a credit enhancement in the bonds issued by the country that applies for OMT because the more it will comply with conditions, the more creditworthy will be its bonds. The second reason is that with any type of intervention, moral hazard has to be avoided and fiscal discipline, in particular, has to be ensured. That’s why conditionality is crucial, but it is only a necessary condition because in any event the Governing Council assesses independently the state of monetary fragmentation. Let’s not forget our objective is fight financial fragmentation and deliver price stability. FT Let me just go back to the political element. I respect what you’re saying about the ECB’s paramount independence, but, at the same time, you’re not monks in cells. You don’t sort of deliberate within the monastery and come up with something. MD Today most central banks are independent, headed by non-elected officials, and quite powerful. This set-up is acceptable only if independence is limited by the mandate. That’s the framework that legislators have given us – independence limited by our mandate. That’s why we are so keen about respecting the mandate, because that’s the true guarantee of our independence, which especially in the euro area set-up is crucial for our credibility. And credibility is essential for delivering price stability.  FT Surely it’s also important for you, though, that politically you’re seen to be within your mandate. MD Certainly and that’s why the ECB should be transparent and accountable.  FT Returning to the question of conditionally, there are important critics, particularly in Germany, who say that it removes the incentive of governments to act. How do you counter that?  MD Quite the contrary. Conditionality makes sure that governments will make the necessary reforms and maintain fiscal discipline. FT Let me rephrase the question. How can you restore enduring confidence if there is a high level of conditionality? I’m talking about a kind of resolution of the crisis, and if the conditionality is too tight, too severe, governments don’t act and, therefore, nothing happens. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  MD The assessment of conditionality is primarily in the hands of the European Commission, the ESM, and the IMF. But also do not forget that the ultimate assessment of whether to act or not is entirely in the hands of the Governing Council.  FT You announced the programme; there was immediately a favourable reaction in the markets, remarkable. Many people assumed then that the governments would apply, but they haven’t. What conclusions did you see? MD The purpose of the OMT is to remove the tail risks. It’s up to the governments to decide upon a programme. We never took a stance which was proactive in the sense of encouraging governments or discouraging governments to apply. Let’s not forget that the ESM is tax-payers’ money, the decision over which should be taken by governments and by national parliaments. And the same is true for the potential applicants’ reforms and budget consolidation. The role of the ECB, in that stage, should be on the back stage, not front line. It’s up to the governments to decide.  FT Again, let’s just step back a minute. It’s been a tumultuous, extraordinary year. You have been a leading player in this drama. There are others, obviously. Chancellor Merkel, Mario Monti. What were the moments that stick out in your mind? Let’s just look where you said the risks are really high and we need to act, if you think about that in the blur of events. MD The speech in London on 26 July was such a moment. If you look at the verbatim, it doesn’t say anything that’s outside our mandate. But indeed it’s an especially strong speech that makes a firm statement on the preservation of the euro. FT It was a very, very firm statement. How did you come up with that wording? “Whatever it takes... And, believe me, it will be enough,” – with a dramatic pause before. MD Again, there was a sense that we had to overcome the limitations of the SMP, and make sure that the signal to the market would be proportionate to the gravity of the situation. That’s actually what is behind that statement. FT Did you rehearse the pause? MD No, I’m not really that theatrical. But the situation at this moment was clearly showing that tail risks were increasing. So my intervention was made important by the very critical situation that was evolving. FT You intended to have a reaction in the market. Was that your intention? MD What I thought was that the markets should know what our stance was. This was the objective of this speech. It was meant to be absolutely clear about our determination. I also made the point that it was not only our determination but it was also our leaders’ determination to carry out the June summit conclusions. I said that markets underestimated the leaders’ determination and the amount of political capital they have invested in the euro. This is what I said first and then added that it’s our intention to be firm and to do whatever it takes but within our mandate.  FT And, just to be really clear, you did not clear that speech, those remarks with anybody outside in the capitals? MD No, absolutely not. FT So that was a seminal moment. What was the moment in 2012 where you felt perhaps a sense of some relief? Without over-confidence, but that maybe the mood had shifted. MD Was there such a moment? FT I was hoping you’d say that. MD That’s what I feel like. FT I just want to come back to this question of public opinion, which is very important. When did you decide and why did you decide to go to the Bundestag? 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  MD In an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung the journalists asked whether I would speak in the Bundestag if I were to be invited, to explain better in Germany what we do and our intentions are. I responded that if I was invited, I would be ready to go. A few days after the interview I received the invitation from President Lammert. There was a genuine interest from the Bundestag to know in greater detail about our policy decision, at the time controversial in Germany, but applauded in the rest of the world. FT There’s a serious point about German public opinion. Do you think it’s become more euro-sceptical this year, with all the difficult economic circumstances? MD The difficult economic circumstances are everywhere in the euro area and this might have caused a different sense of perception of the euro. These are very serious moments. When I’m asked whether I can persuade the German public opinion, I say that I don’t know. But I know that we have the duty to explain, and we are really working very, very hard on that front. Hopefully the results will follow. And this holds true for the all euro area public opinion. FT You can see it in Britain where it’s moving towards questioning membership of the European Union. Can we perhaps turn now to the question of what comes next – economic growth and the adjustment process? So, while it is true that current account deficits are shrinking and governments are doing, in many ways, courageous things, they’re passing reforms, there’s still the question of economic growth. What is your prognosis for the next 12 months? MD Last week we published our new staff projections, showing the beginning of a slow recovery in the second part of next year. We have a serious situation in front of us. At the same time, there are some encouraging signs. The spreads are tighter than they were four months ago. Liquidity conditions are better, banks and corporates are funding themselves. Bond issuance has restarted. And for the public sector, the distressed countries have basically completed all their sovereign funding plans. Furthermore we think that our very accommodative monetary policy stance will find its way into the economy in the coming months. That’s why we’re saying that we may see a recovery in the second part of the year. Also, at some point, one will see the benefits of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. So far we’ve only seen the contractionary effect of the fiscal consolidation. We haven’t seen yet the positive effects of structural reforms because, obviously, they take effect with a certain lag. And third, we will be seeing a more buoyant world growth, which will help sustain exports of the euro area. FT Are you bullish of America if they get through the fiscal cliff? MD I’m confident they will find an agreement. FT And even beyond that with shale gas revolution, re-shoring, property market recovered. They’ve fixed their banks. MD I think they are well poised for a positive outcome. It’s interesting though that until two months ago when people were asked about the major source of uncertainty and risk in the world, the answer was the euro crisis. And now it’s the fiscal cliff. FT Just going back to the forecast you were talking about. Those are actually a pretty dramatic downward revision. And this better mood in financial markets is pretty fragile, as Mario Monti’s resignation shows. It just sounds like you’re painting the picture of the glass being half full when that might be a bit on the optimistic side. MD Indeed it’s a significant revision downward. At the same time, the medium term outlook for price stability hasn’t changed in any dramatic way. And you see these positive signs in the soft data coming out.  FT There are many critics of fiscal consolidation as you know. I know you’ve talked about this before. But is it problematic as the ECB to be pushing the case for it so hard, particularly in countries like Spain and Greece where this is causing real human misery, given, as you said before, you’re unelected and you have to stick closely to your mandate. If there is no risk 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  over the medium term for price stability, maybe there is a case to say there’s too much austerity right now. MD We’re fully aware that the economic situation in several countries, not only Spain and Greece, is very serious, and we are not underestimating the difficulty of the situation at all. Let’s not forget that the reason why fiscal consolidation became central for the policy advice of the ECB is because one can’t have systems built on debt and deficits that the financial crisis has shown to be unsustainable. And there has been progress. To give up now, as some suggest, would be tantamount to waste the great sacrifices made by the citizens of Europe. FT Yes, and what about the Martin Wolf critique that adjustment is a two-way process and that while the austerity should be pursued rigorously in the peripheral countries, the creditor countries must also adjust. They must also do their bit, which, in effect, means a somewhat more expansionary policy to counteract… MD First of all one must stress that inflation is not a policy tool. One doesn’t toy with inflation. Especially in an area made up by several sovereign states. The second point is that – in our institutional set-up – if you had to choose one policy objective that would be to increase competitiveness. The countries that have been successful in adjusting and in reforming have mitigated the short-term contractionary effects of fiscal policies. Countries that can actually manage this policy combination have a chance to reduce the difficulties that come from fiscal consolidation. FT Are you thinking about Italy? MD No, I’m thinking about Ireland. FT A couple of other questions, one is the banking union because, in addition to all the questions that we’ve just discussed, these huge challenges for the eurozone and for the ECB, now you’re going to have to take on the extra responsibility of supervision of at the least the large banks in the eurozone. Is the institution ready for this? Are you ready for this? MD We will be ready. After the Council Regulation will enter into force, it’d take about a year to set up organisation of the SSM. There have been many discussions on how fast we should move and how broad should be the scope. One has to remember that we are a passive actor. We are in the hands of our legislators. It’s clear that we want to move in a timely fashion, but it’s more important to move well. And we intend to take the time that’s needed for that. FT Would one of the things about doing it right be that you need there to be some sort of European-wide bank resolution scheme in place before you take over the supervision, otherwise you’re in a situation where you’re nominally in charge of supervising all these banks. If one of them needs to be wound up, for whatever reason, you’re completely at the mercy of the local supervisor and the local arrangements. You don’t actually have the powers to do anything. MD A European Resolution Authority is an important complement to the SSM, and it will likely be in place by the time the SSM takes up its responsibilities. But even in its absence, the single supervisor’s assessment of the possible non-viability of a bank would be such a strong statement that it would likely trigger the national government’s policy response. FT A personal question, it’s a human question, here you all this incredible pressure on you. If you had to think of a few people in the world, you’re definitely in the top five who’ve got most pressure from all the places, trying to hold this together. How do you cope with that, number one? And, number two is there anything that surprised you after being in this place for one year? MD The way to cope with these pressures is to never forget that they are part of the set of responsibilities that one carries with this job, responsibilities to deliver price stability; to take policy decisions that affect the welfare of millions of people.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  I really can’t answer your second question because to say that something has surprised you, you have to be able to look back and say, oh, that thing actually surprised me. And this is not the way I function. I look forward, being naturally inclined to focus on the future. At least I think. But you should ask my colleagues too. FT Anything to add? MD I’d like to give you this quote of Professor Zygmunt Bauman, a Polish sociologist who has become best known for his analyses of postmodernity and consumerism. It has to do with the fact that you don’t lose sovereignty when you share it, but you actually regain it. Countries with high debt and deficits should understand they have lost sovereignty a long time ago over their economic policies in a globalised world. Working together in a stability-oriented union actually means to regain sovereignty at a higher level. FT They’ve lost it to the markets? MD Yes. And sharing common rules for them actually means to regain sovereignty in a shared way rather than pretending to have sovereignty they’ve lost a long time ago. That’s the point. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Eddie Yue: Evolution of financial consumer protection and education in Asia Speech by Mr Eddie Yue, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the HKMA-SFC-OECD Asian Seminar, Hong Kong, 13 December 2012. *      *      * André (Laboul),1 Ashley (Alder),2 distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Good morning. It’s my pleasure to be among such distinguished company, and for such an important topic. On behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), thank you all for joining us and I look forward to the discussion here today. In discussing consumer education and protection, the focus must of course be on benefiting the consumer. That said, there is more than an element of enlightened self-interest for the rest of us. For the pathway to profit does not divert around the consumer interest. It runs right through it. Indeed, the best companies – those with long-term sustainable models of growth – operate on the basis of a natural synergy between what is good for customers and good for business. This is an old lesson – but it’s one we are relearning in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. One of the gripping aftershocks from the crisis has been the mis-selling complaints against some financial institutions. Such cases are, of course, deeply damaging to those individual institutions. Yet they also impact on us all. When the dust settles after each successive scandal, the lasting impression threatens the reputation not just of individual firms, but of whole sectors. In the case of Hong Kong, where the financial industry is so critical to the economy, this obviously carries even more importance. Now, as a survey has found, we are fortunate in Hong Kong to have one of the highest levels of consumer trust in banks and financial services compared to other places.3 But we’ve seen in the financial crisis how fragile trust can be. So we need to guard against complacency, and work towards ensuring that Hong Kong remains a beacon to the rest of the global financial services industry. Whether one is a financial institution, a financial regulator or a consumer, this is in all our interests. So, how do we get there? In short, my argument this morning is that we will do so by recognising the interdependence of these three groups. Each has a role to play, but each also needs the help of the others. And, I would argue, at the heart of this interdependence lies effective consumer protection and education. I would like to discuss briefly each group in turn – first, the role of financial institutions.  “The role of financial institutions” As I alluded to just now, financial-services institutions have a direct interest in upholding the reputation of the industry as a whole. I believe success in this regard rests on two pillars. First, nurturing a culture of honesty among practitioners. Second, an absolute commitment to                                                 1 Mr André Laboul, Head of the Financial Affairs Division, OECD and Chairman of the International Network on Financial Education. 2 Mr Ashley Alder, Chief Executive Officer, Securities and Futures Commission. 3 See Edelman Trust Barometer 2012, Hong Kong (HK trust in banks 74% and financial services 62% compared to a global average of 47% and 45%, respectively. See slides 13 and 15). (http://www.slideshare.net/DavidRBrain/2012-edelman-trust-barometer-hong-kong-deck-1232012checkedfinal#btnNext) 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  prioritise above all the customer, not profit maximisation. Or, combining both pillars, we could summarise all that into a single, rather old-fashioned word: integrity. In theory, that’s a standard to which we are all happy to sign on to. And yet, the temptation to put product before service, profit before client, is very real. I am sure we have all seen sufficient examples in different places.  I believe there are a number of actions financial institutions can and should take to guard against such dangerous practices. I will mention just three very briefly. First, greater transparency and disclosure of the benefits and risks of investment products. Second, more responsibility placed on financial institutions with respect to assessing the suitability of a product for a customer given his/her risk appetite. Third, simpler procedures and freer access for consumer to complaint and redress mechanisms. These are all things that many financial institutions have embedded into their corporate culture and I encourage all others to do the same. “The role of financial regulators (the HKMA)” This brings me to the second group, financial regulators. Given my role, I will focus specifically on the example of the HKMA. In response to the changing landscape following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the HKMA expanded its efforts to protect and educate consumers, and this change resulted in the creation in April 2010 of our Banking Conduct Department. I will focus first on our work to strengthen consumer protection before going on to saying something about our work on consumer education. HKMA & consumer protection In terms of consumer protection, first, the HKMA has introduced new requirements on banks and issued guidelines on the selling of investment products. These include (a) requiring audio-recording the customer risk profile assessment and sales process to provide audit trails for reviews by banks and the regulators; (b) implementing a pre-investment cooling-off period in the sale of unlisted structured products to less sophisticated customers (such as the elderly or first-time buyer); and (c) requiring banks to carry out continuous reviews of product risk and inform investors of any upward changes to the risk ratings of the products they have purchased. These requirements were in addition to existing measures introduced by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on the supervision of securities companies’ selling activities. Second, the HKMA is active in monitoring banks’ compliance with these and other regulatory requirements through thematic on-site examinations. Banks are expected to have control processes and procedures in place to ensure adherence to the conduct regulations. In addition, to monitor compliance levels among banking staff, the HKMA conducts mystery shopping trips.  Third, the HKMA has strengthened consumer protection by working with partners. One example is our work with the Hong Kong Association of Banks in carrying out a comprehensive review of credit card practices in Hong Kong, drawing on reforms undertaken in the UK and US. As a result, we have been rolling out in stages 31 measures aimed at promoting fair and responsible business practices by credit card issuers, and all these will become effective by 2013. A second example is our partnership with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Securities and Futures Commission to establish the Financial Dispute Resolution Centre. The objective is to help consumers settle monetary disputes quickly by means of mediation and arbitration. The Centre came into operation in June this year.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The HKMA & consumer education On consumer education the HKMA has also been very active. From time to time, we publish articles, called “insight articles”, to increase consumers’ awareness of their rights and obligations in relation to particular consumer products like accumulators, Octopus cards and instalment payment plans. We also highlight key features and risks of certain investment products, and remind consumers not to invest if they do not understand a product. We have launched earlier this week a “Consumer Corner” on the HKMA website to provide important information on local banking consumer issues, including a set of “frequently asked questions” based on public enquiries and topical issues. As with protection, so with education, we are also working with our partners. Among these initiatives, we are joining with the Consumer Council in their consumer awareness campaigns. Another very important initiative I’d like to highlight, is our work with the Securities and Futures Commission to establish an Investor Education Centre (IEC). The HKMA will supplement this with additional consumer education independent of the IEC, focusing on areas such as banking products and services, as well as other investment products that may not be covered by the IEC.  “The role of the consumer” So, as well as good practice among financial institutions, financial authorities also have an important role to play in enhancing consumer protection and education. But focusing on just those two groups leaves out possibly the most important group of all – the consumers themselves, to whom I will devote my remaining remarks. One of the things on which the global financial crisis cast a cold light was the implicit cost to households – and indeed to society and financial markets – of low levels of financial literacy. Financial literacy is increasingly recognised as an important individual life skill that people need to thrive in a modern economy like Hong Kong. Without it, consumers can be at risk of mis-buying and bank employees are themselves at a higher risk of mis-selling. For example, one of the hallmarks of our financial sector in this city is the universal banking regime that allows banks to offer basic services as well as a wide range of financial products. This is a great strength for the industry and highly beneficial to both banks and consumers. However, we should also acknowledge that it can expose some customers to higher risks arising from investment in complex financial products. I have in mind especially consumers who may be less sophisticated but who may nonetheless have a high level of trust in banks. In that sense, it was not surprising that following the financial crisis, there was greater demand by consumers and consumer groups to better understand the risks of investment products offered by banks. This demand has been amplified by a number of other trends, namely: the greater complexity of financial products; the rapid pace of change in financial standards and regulations; the rising number of high net worth individuals in Asia-Pacific actively looking for investment opportunities; and the recognition that regulation alone is insufficient to protect consumers.  Financial education has thus become an important complement to market conduct and prudential regulation. Raising the financial competencies of individuals has become a long-term policy priority for the financial industry. This is particularly crucial in Hong Kong where, as you know, we have a regulatory framework based on disclosure and complementary customer suitability assessments. In that context, it is especially important that consumers understand a product’s features and risks thoroughly when considering their investments. They have to decide whether or not an investment suits their objectives, and whether they have the ability to assume the associated risks. Thus, a key component of any efforts to enhancing financial education and protection must be improving individuals’ ability to ask the right questions and increase their awareness that ultimately they are responsible for their investment decisions. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  “Conclusion” So, we’ve discussed how important consumer protection and education are. And we’ve covered the roles of each of the three groups in bringing about better protection and education. Let me now try to bring these strands all together. Something that became very clear in the wake of the financial crisis was that apparently low-probability risks at the margin of an industry can have profound impacts – and that a rules-based system alone is inadequate in guarding against them. After the crisis, there has been increasing recognition that each of us in fact operates in a financial eco-system – in some respects, a fragile system – in which the well-being of the whole rests on the health and actions of each part. Through suasion and regulation, financial regulators like the HKMA can do a lot to support consumers. But we will always be one step remote from the point of transaction. That’s why we look to banks and other financial institutions not just to follow our rules, but to show leadership by really engaging in this area. Institutions can do a lot, individually and together, to self- and peer-regulate and, above all, ensure integrity throughout their organisations, particularly at the consumer-facing levels. In the end, though, in this financial eco-system as with any other, so much depends on its beating heart – the consumer. That’s why I believe one of the best things we in this room can do is to bend our efforts towards greater financial literacy. Through initiatives to better inform and empower consumers, they can be the judge of their own best interests. That way, the benefits accrue not only to individual consumers, but to the sector and society more widely. Education requires long term commitment and effort from us all, but the prize is also great. Ladies and gentlemen, over the next day or so, we have the opportunity to make a real and substantial contribution to this agenda. For that reason, I am most grateful to you for joining us, and I very much look forward to our discussion and exchange of views. Together, I am sure we can learn and develop further many good measures. Measures that will not only help consumers, but will also improve the health and strength of the financial sector and our economies more widely. Thank you.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jean-Pierre Danthine: Financial stability developments and the delayed new Swiss banknotes Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Vice Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 13 December 2012. *      *      * In my introductory remarks today, I would like to look at the main developments in the area of financial stability since the publication of our Financial Stability Report in June of this year. Afterwards, I will talk about the postponement of the new banknote series. In the area of financial stability, the improvement in the big banks’ capital situation is particularly noteworthy. The prevailing uncertainties and the risks for the banking sector as a whole remain considerable, however. Prevailing risks remain considerable General economic and financial conditions for the Swiss banking sector remain difficult. On the one hand, the situation in the financial markets has eased since June 2012. This is largely due to various decisions and measures taken by governments and central banks worldwide. On the other hand, the easing of tensions in the financial markets should be interpreted with caution. Should the measures already taken not be effective or should the progress made in restructuring government budgets be slow, we cannot rule out renewed turbulence in the financial markets. The European banking industry is also in a fragile state. Although CDS premia for European banks have been going down in the last few months, their level is still considerably above previous years as well as that of Swiss and US banks. Finally, as my colleague Thomas Jordan has explained, the global economic outlook remains modest. For Europe, in particular, we have revised our short-term forecast downwards again slightly.  For Switzerland, the National Bank is expecting moderate growth. Economic conditions remain comparatively good, which – in conjunction with the low level of interest rates – is boosting the continued strong momentum in the mortgage and real estate markets. I will speak about developments in this market in more detail later on. To sum up, the risks in the banking environment remain considerable. First, the risk of an escalation of the European debt crisis is not insignificant. Second, imbalances are building up in the Swiss real estate market. This goes hand in hand with an increased risk of significant price corrections in the medium term.  Greater resilience of the big banks The situation of the big banks has improved since the last news conference, as both institutions have further increased their resilience. This increase was particularly pronounced at Credit Suisse. According to the bank’s most recently published data, it increased its holdings of loss-absorbing capital by roughly three-quarters in the second half of 2012. In addition to retaining profits, this increase is mainly attributable to the capital measures announced in July, which have already been implemented to a large extent. In addition, as part of their strategic reorientation, both big banks announced measures which will further enhance their resilience. For instance, both institutions are planning to further expand their loss-absorbing capital, to reduce their risks and, in particular, trim their balance sheets as well as to pursue a policy of dividend restraint. The National Bank welcomes the increase in the big banks’ resilience achieved thus far, as well as the announced measures to further improve their capital situation. The consistent 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  implementation of these measures is important for two reasons: First, leverage has remained high despite the improvement in the capital situation. Second, the risks in the environment – and thus the associated potential losses for the big banks in the event of a further escalation of the European debt crisis – remain considerable. Situation at domestically focused banks I would now like to turn to the situation at domestically focused banks. The risks associated with the environment in which these banks operate increased during the past six months. Indeed, the isolated signs of a slowdown of growth in the mortgage and real estate markets observed in the second quarter did not materialise in the third quarter. In particular, prices in the different segments of the residential real estate market continued to rise at a sustained pace. At the same time, growth in the mortgage loan volume was still considerably higher than GDP growth. Imbalances have therefore grown.  As far as risk appetite and capitalisation are concerned, the situation of domestically focused banks has not changed significantly during the last six months. On the one hand, banks’ risk appetite has not diminished overall. This is substantiated by the following: First, in the case of new mortgage loans, both the loan-to-value ratios and loan-to-income ratios have remained at a high level. Second, interest rate risk has not declined and remains high. Third, the already low margins on interest income have continued to decrease. There are nevertheless considerable differences from one bank to another, in particular as to how their risk appetite has evolved. Certain banks have reduced their risk-taking significantly during the last quarters, while others have increased their exposure to risk.  On the other hand, average capitalisation for domestically focused banks relative to regulatory requirements is still at a historically high level. However, as the SNB already emphasised in its latest Financial Stability Report, the resilience of these banks, as measured by the regulatory capital indicators, is overestimated. Therefore, six months after being announced, the stricter capital requirements for mortgages and the revision of the self-regulation rules for mortgage lending have not, or not yet, led to a significant trend reversal in mortgage and real estate markets, although there is some anecdotal evidence pointing in that direction. It cannot be ruled out that the impact of these measures has not fully materialised or is simply not yet reflected in the data available. In particular, due to the still exceptionally low interest rates, there is, however, a considerable risk that these imbalances continue to build up, and the risk of an abrupt correction over the medium term keeps increasing. Under these circumstances, the SNB is carefully monitoring the developments in mortgage and real estate markets. It periodically assesses the necessity to activate the countercyclical capital buffer.  Issuance of the new banknote series in 2015 at the earliest In February 2012, the National Bank informed the public that the new banknote series would be postponed. Today, I would like to provide some background information on our decision.  The National Bank is committed to putting banknotes into circulation that are state of the art in terms of both their design and their technological aspects. In order to meet this standard, such a project must be launched at an early stage. Integrating and combining security features involving new technologies that have not previously been used for banknotes presents a special challenge. Since the development phase for new security features is very long, launching a new series is likely to take several years for the technical feasibility assessment alone. Certain insights can only be gained during the actual serial production.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The development of the new banknote series began in 2005 with a design competition. In the planning phase for the technical feasibility and during initial production tests in 2010, it became evident that the complexity of the new security features necessitated a postponement of the issue date to autumn 2012. In autumn 2011, during an early phase of the serial production, technical difficulties arose which had not been discernible in the testing phase, whose results were positive. For this reason, the SNB this year decided to conduct a comprehensive re-assessment of the entire project together with the industrial partners producing the new banknote on its behalf. As a result, several mostly technical measures were defined and in some cases have already been implemented. These measures should ensure that the series can go into long-term industrial production.  Owing to the complexity and scope of the necessary work, the first denomination of the series, the CHF 50 note, may be expected in 2015 at the earliest. The SNB will announce the issue date as soon as production of the first banknote denomination has been completed.  Since the National Bank wants to continue meeting the highest quality standards, it has accepted a postponement in the new issue, a decision which was rendered all the easier because the banknotes currently in circulation continue to offer a high standard of security. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Dimitar Bogov: When pressures on prices are relieved, we will stimulate economic growth Interview with Mr Dimitar Bogov, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, in “Kapital” weekly magazine, published on 8 November 2012. *      *      * Bank affairs are always possible In the countries in the region banking affairs have erupted, in connection with criminal activities of some banks in conjunction with politicians. What is the situation in Macedonia? Is everything under control in the banking sector? NBRM controls the banks in terms of their compliance with the regulations, the quality of corporate governance, and assesses the risks that banks undertake in their operations. Banking supervision is a strong prevention against criminal operation. But that does not mean that as anywhere in the world, banking affairs could not take place also in the banking sector in Macedonia.  Spasijka Jovanova The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia lowered the forecasts for the economic growth this year to 1 percent and raised the concerns of inflation. The condition when no growth is registered, i.e. there is a downturn, and there is higher inflation, is called stagflation, which is the worst stage of an economic crisis. Is the Macedonian economy in such a stage? I would not agree that the Macedonian economy is entering stagflation. However, there were unusual movements in the world economy. On the one hand, European economies are in recession, the US economy has been struggling to return to the path of growth, and more recently, fast-growing economies such as Brazil, India, China, Turkey have also slowed down. In such circumstances, it would be logical for the prices on the commodity exchanges worldwide to fall. But it is not happening. Prices of oil and basic agricultural products are not falling, but maintain the previously achieved high level or even continue to rise. In part, this is due to the overly relaxed monetary policy of the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England, as well as the debt crisis in the Euro area, which “urge” investors to invest in real goods on the commodity exchanges. The rest is a consequence of the so-called supply shocks, i.e. political tensions in the Arab world and the Middle East, as well as the drought in the countries that are the largest producers of grain. In such conditions, despite the slowdown of economic growth, Macedonia is facing a higher imported inflation. In conditions of such an emphasized economic crisis, how will the monetary policy be put into operation to encourage economic growth? You claim that the NBRM can contribute only by keeping price stability, but obviously it is undermined. Price stability is neither undermined nor will it be. In August and September, a higher than usual monthly price increase for this time of the year was registered, due to one-off factors that I have already explained. Their effect will soon be exhausted and the increase will stop as pressures from the demand side have been completely absent. Temporarily higher inflation does not mean that price stability is undermined. Over the last two years, inflation in the Euro area has continuously been well above the ECB’s target, but no one gets upset about it, as it is clear that it is not a consequence of overheated domestic demand. Monetary policy cannot prevent the initial impact on prices from the supply shocks, but it can prevent the transmission effect on other prices. NBRM will not allow price stability to be undermined. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  You have recently admitted that monetary policy is facing several challenges, which call for contrasting reactions. Can you explain what you think specifically and how you would solve this problem in the monetary sphere? If there had not been price shocks of the global commodity exchanges, the NBRM would have had room for further easing of the monetary policy. However, due to the pressures from international prices we must give a clear signal that we will not allow undermining of price stability, while simultaneously adjusting the monetary policy to the slower economic growth. It is a great challenge, a difficult task, but not impossible. Now is the time when many central banks apply unconventional monetary policy measures to respond to the unusual economic trends. At the moment we are sure that risks to price stability undermining are eliminated, we will apply monetary measures appropriate for the slower economic growth. Маy pressures be coming from the fiscal policy? So far, they have not, and I hope it will remain that way. The best confirmation of that are the balances in the economy. After all, exactly because of that, we had room for the so far most relaxed monetary policy without jeopardizing the stability of prices, Denar exchange rate and the banking system. Banks’ non-performing loans will decrease This year, liquidity was the biggest problem of the companies. The figures showed that the indebtedness in the real sector is huge, over Euro 5 billion, with the country’s debt to the companies being over Euro 220 million. In such circumstances, banks have reduced lending to firms to a minimum and they struggle with the growth of bad loans. Can we expect the situation to improve? In the statistics that are known to me I have not found such figures. However, when economic growth and exports slow down and budgetary payments are late, usually the liquidity of companies deteriorates. Therefore they are late in the settlement of obligations to the banks. Despite that, non-performing loans of the Macedonian banks amount to about 10 percent, which is the lowest share in the region from Slovenia to Greece. Announced debt repayments from the budget will contribute to the reduction of the debts among companies, and finally debts toward the banks. So it is logical to expect stabilization, and perhaps reduction of the level of banks’ bad loans. Banks which have huge excess liquidity, have reservations regarding lending to companies, and they locate the reason in the emphasized risks. Is the placement of those funds in Treasury bills and Central Bank bills a solution, even at the cost of a decline in the economy? The monetary policy is trying to trigger a certain behavior of the banks which it considers is appropriate at a particular time. But banks independently manage excess liquidity and it is their decision whether more will be placed in the form of loans or in risk-free securities. At the beginning of the second quarter, with several measures we released substantial excess liquidity placed in CB bills over the level that we considered it was necessary to be maintained. It is a fact that banks placed only a small part of that surplus in loans. One of the reasons is certainly the perception of banks for increased risks in the domestic and global economy. But just as important, if not even more important reason are the corporate strategies of the banking groups in the Euro area that are owners of the Macedonian banks. Some of these banking groups have serious problems in their home countries. Although their banks in Macedonia have excellent capitalization and record liquidity, they must implement the strategy of their foreign parent banks, which due to the insufficient capital, refrain from lending in all countries where they are present. NBRM cannot require those banks to increase lending, but we undertake everything we can to prevent a reduction in their loan 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  portfolios. Obviously, this is another area where we have a spillover of the negative developments in the Euro area into our economy.  What will be the credit growth this year, and what do you expect it to be next year? The estimate for this year is about 7 percent, and for the next year it is somewhat higher. In which direction will the interest rates on loans and deposits move next year? The downward trend is likely to continue, although at a slower pace. The European Central Bank reduced the basic interest rate to 0.75 percent in order to stimulate the economic growth. The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia maintains it at 3.75 percent. Why not reducing it down to 1 percent in our country, too, which will reduce the interest rates on loans as well? In a highly euroized economy as the Macedonian, it is necessary to motivate economic agents to demand Denars, not Euros. Therefore, interest rate parity on Denars and Euros must be kept at an appropriate level that stimulates the demand for Denars. In the last three years we have reduced that parity from 8 percent to only 3 percent. Further reduction is a process that depends on the resilience of the economy. Macedonia will have to save more What are your expectations for the Macedonian economy in 2013, which is expected to be perhaps more difficult and more turbulent than this year? What, according to you, will be the biggest economic challenges and problems next year? It will be another year full of uncertainty for the world and especially for the European economy. Thus, the export demand for Macedonian products is unlikely to improve. So, we cannot expect that to boost economic growth. However, our expectation for the economic growth in Macedonia is to be much better than this year, driven by diversification of the production into new export-oriented facilities that started to work this year, or will start to work in the next year, as well as infrastructural facilities for which funding has already been secured from foreign sources. Both politicians and economists globally are of a divided opinion in terms of the economic policy that should be conducted in order to emerge from the crisis. Some advocate austerity, others encourage spending to stimulate growth. Which policy you prefer and think is right for Macedonia? According to me, those are “false” discussions. If a country has a room for increased spending, certainly now is the time to stimulate the economy. But unfortunately, there are not many such countries worldwide. Developed economies were spending more than they could afford for years, and now they do not have any room for fiscal stimulus left. It is easy to say that now you have to encourage consumption in Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal, USA, etc. Who will finance this consumption? Just as banks refuse to provide new loans to overindebted customers, investors are not willing to finance increased spending of budgets. In the economics there is a saying that “there is no free lunch.” In the end someone has to pay the bill. The time has come for the developed economies to pay the bill and now there is no other choice but austerity. This is a time of painful structural reforms, revision of the generosity of social care in accordance with the possibilities of the economy. As for Macedonia, as a result of many years of prudent fiscal policies, we had room for stimulus in these few years. But this room in the medium term will be exhausted and we will have to save more. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Macedonian companies lend to their parent companies in the Euro area What are the expectations for the deposits in 2013? Can we expect further growth, especially of Denar deposits? Households’ saving is likely to continue at the usual growth rate of at least 10 percent per year, mostly in Denars. It is harder to predict the trend with companies. This year there were significant capital outflows in the form of dividends and loans from foreign-owned companies to their parent companies abroad. Obviously, Macedonian companies are still profitable and they financially help their parent companies in the troubled Euro area countries. It negatively influences the deposit potential of companies. It is uncertain whether this trend will continue next year. Why do you always connect the issue of the exchange rate policy with devaluation? Is it possible to open a debate in the country, on the economic model, the effects that it provides and the exchange rate regime and its efficiency vis-a-vis the economy? Currently, we have a real exchange rate of the Denar. Demand and supply are balanced. NBRM very rarely intervenes in the foreign exchange market. As a result of the credibility of the Denar and the National Bank created over the past 15 years, we have completely eliminated the speculative demand for foreign exchange. But experience has shown that immediately when the change in the exchange rate is mentioned, a speculative demand for foreign exchange appears and disturbs the balance on the foreign exchange market. This would cause pressure on the exchange rate, higher inflation and ultimately much higher interest rates than the current ones. Who would benefit from that? You take a selected sample of countries with flexible exchange rate that have higher economic growth than Macedonia and you offer it as evidence that such policy gives better results. I will find another sample of countries with flexible exchange rate that have lower growth than Macedonia. It is not economic analysis, it is manipulation. I am still waiting for someone to offer a plausible analysis of how the change of the exchange rate regime will boost economic growth. Except naive statements in the media, so far no one has offered such an analysis. In the economic literature, it has long been concluded that the exchange rate regime does not affect economic growth. Do you think that Macedonia has an efficient economic model and exchange rate regime if it records economic growth rates which do not exceed 3–4 percent, and everybody agrees that it is necessary to have growth of over 8 percent? It is very naive to link economic growth only with the exchange rate regime. Economic growth is a very complex phenomenon that depends on about a hundred of factors. Competitiveness of an economy does not depend only on the exchange rate. Take the global competitiveness index of the World Economic Forum. It takes into account more than one hundred indicators for measuring the competitiveness of countries. If someone believes that Macedonia will realize an 8 percent growth rate only if the exchange rate regime is changed, I am left speechless. The change in the exchange rate is used as an instrument for improving the competitiveness only when the country has failed to improve other factors and there is no other choice. But it is only a short term solution that will quickly exhaust the effects, because devaluation will bring high inflation and in the end only the nominal exchange rate is changed, and the real exchange rate will remain the same. And then again demands for a new devaluation. Look at the history of the European Monetary Union. What was the exchange rate policy of Greece, Italy, Spain, before the introduction of the ECU (the predecessor of the Euro). Instead of structural reforms, they constantly corrected their weaknesses with a devaluation of the exchange rate. When they entered the Euro area it was no longer possible and it has led to what we see today. They require internal devaluation of about 30 percent to restore lost competitiveness. By contrast, countries such as Austria, the Netherlands (Denmark, which still has its own currency) have always led policy of a fixed exchange rate pegged to the German Mark. To be competitive, they had to increase their 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  efficiency with structural measures. Therefore these countries have no problems with competitiveness today. In a recent interview you gave for Banks and Businesses you recommended that the competitiveness of the Macedonian economy must be improved through complex reforms and dedicated work that includes everybody. Do you see such progress? Yes, I see such progress. The ranking of Doing Business, of the World Economic Forum, is a benchmark for what has been done in the area of ??improving the conditions for higher economic growth. It is the only way to create higher economic growth. It is a process that should never stop. Better ranking on these lists does not mean that we will immediately have higher economic growth. It takes time, we should continuously improve the conditions for doing business. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  K C Chakrabarty: Transit path for Indian economy – six steps for transforming the elephant into a tiger Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the interaction with members of the Delhi Chapter of the Young Presidents Organization, New Delhi, 7 December 2012. *      *      * Assistance provided by Dr. Mridul Saggar in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged. Shri Prabhat Jain and other members of the Delhi Chapter of the Young Presidents Organisation! It is my pleasure to be here amidst some of the young captains of the Indian industry, who, I believe, would continue to guide their respective enterprises for a foreseeable future and make immense contributions in shaping the Indian Economy going forward. I have been asked to speak to you today on “transforming the elephant into a tiger” and in this regard, I would suggest six steps that I think are essential for such a transformation. However, at the outset, I thank the Delhi Chapter of the Young Presidents Organisation (YPO) for inviting me to share my thoughts on this important topic. YPO has really established itself as an extra-ordinary network of young global business leaders and a think tank on issues that are critical to economy, businesses and society. I am told the network has hosted some illustrious speakers in the past and therefore, I have to live up to high expectations. I believe the decades of my experience in commercial banks and in the Central Bank have provided me with insights into enterprise, governance, growth and society and their impact on nation-building, which, I would share with you today and hope you find them interesting and worth emulating. Let us now focus on the topic for the evening. Transforming the elephant into a tiger can mean different things to different people. In reality, the state of the art in genetic engineering still cannot contemplate such a modification. An Ang Lee or a Steven Spielberg can, of course, use computer generated special effects to bring about such a transformation. But it is time to get real – given that the metaphor of elephant is used to denote the Indian economy and deals with our lives and the future of our children.  In 2007, Dr. Shashi Tharoor wrote an enchanting book, “The Elephant, The Tiger and The Cellphone: Reflections on India: – The Emerging 21st Century Power”. The book, ingrained in history, culture and socio-economic change, criss-crosses the Indian life from Ajanta-Ellora and cricket to cellphones and call centres and makes a simple point of Indian growth effecting change in daily lives and imparting confidence to the Indian people. In December 2008, the Economist of London published a special report that India was elephant, not a tiger. It noted that for all its chaos, bureaucracy and occasional violence, India has had a remarkably successful past few years. But, it wondered how it will cope with an economic downturn and the general elections that were about to follow. It added that the democracy tax was rising and storm-clouds were gathering. The prognosis, however, were proven to be off beam by the events that followed. The elections removed uncertainty and the Indian economy staged a V-shaped recovery clocking 8.4 per cent growth during 2009–10 and 2010–11. Yet, we lost steam and the chinks in the tiger skin that we tried wearing, got exposed. In July 2011, Shri Swaminathan Anklesaria Aiyar, my journalist friend and a profound observer on the political economy of India, wrote a paper for the Cato Institute, “The Elephant that Became a Tiger”. In this paper he persuasively argued that 20 years of economic reforms in India had transformed the Indian economy into a tiger. Later the same year, the Reserve Bank Governor Dr. Subbarao, while delivering the Haksar Memorial Lecture, argued that India may be an elephant, but even elephant can dance. The elephant dance was disrupted by the zoo party in the form of global financial crisis. He then suggested ten steps to get back on course by re-jigging the elephant dance. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Growth in India has clearly slowed down since then to 6.5 per cent in 2011–12 and a likely 5.8 per cent in 2012–13, with significant downside risks. The twin deficits – fiscal and balance of payments – have compounded our problems. This may set us thinking on whether we are an elephant or a tiger or a goat, about to be devoured by global forces and our domestic inaction? So should we at all pursue the tiger dream? If yes, what do we need to do to earn the tiger tag? The elephant and the tiger: which one should we prefer? Before I touch upon what we need to do, the first step is to understand what these metaphors mean. So let me upfront visit the key attributes of elephants & tigers. There are four key attributes of an elephant – the size, the herbivores nature, its perceived moderate pace and its anatomy that includes large ears, the trunk and the tusks. Tiger, on the other hand, is not as large as the elephant, but is largest of the cat species. It is carnivore, and is known for its speed and agility. Its anatomy includes the stripes, the powerful jaws and razor sharp teeth, sharp claws and a flexible backbone. But, what conclusively differentiates the two is the tiger’s killer instinct. I think, in terms of size, the Indian economy is, of course, an elephant. It is also herbivores by habit given its democratic structure, unlike the carnivore habits of tigers and dragons. In terms of speed, many people have a misconception that elephants can’t run or walk fast. The fact is that elephants can walk as fast as 25 miles per hour (mph), while tigers can run only a shade faster. Bengal tigers can run at 35 mph, but for short spurts and they can’t keep this pace for long. So, in my view, it is not axiomatic that one should try transforming the elephant into a tiger. Yes, we could do with an added bit of speed but what we should really aim at is developing a tiger’s killer instinct. These, together with a better use of our anatomy or resources, both human and capital, would help us achieve what the dragons and the tigers have achieved, perhaps, with a smaller downside. For this to happen, in my view, we need to take the following six steps: 1.  Preserve demographic dividends by investing in human capital  India’s demographic dividend presents the country with a great opportunity to enhance its growth and seek convergence of per capita incomes with that in the developed world. India’s birth rate has fallen from 45.6 per 1000 in 1951 to an estimated 21 currently, but still remains highly driven by a slowly falling infant mortality rate that remains high at about 46 per 1000. The death rate has fallen dramatically from 37.2 per 1000 birth in 1951 to an estimated 7 currently, but has still not caused population ageing. Median age for India’s population is about 27 years compared with over 40 for most OECD economies. It will add significantly to its labor pool and, even as the median age bucket rises, it will still be at a relatively young 30–34 age bracket by 2026. India’s age-dependency ratio (ratio of dependents-people younger than 15 or older than 64-to the working-age population) is currently about 54. This is already lower than Japan and France. Most developed countries would see a rapid ageing of their population over the next  2–3 decades putting severe pressure on their social security systems with the rise in dependency ratio. The overall median age of these countries rose from 29.0 in 1950 to 37.3 in 2000, and is forecast to rise to 45.5 by 2050. Many developing countries like China, Brazil and Thailand too face issues of ageing population having passed through the demographic transition. Over the last 60 years, China has experienced demographic change at a historic pace that had a profound impact on its population structure. Baby boom began in the mid-1960s after the period of “Great Leap Forward” saw famines and a sharp rise in death rate and a fall in birth rate. China is now a “post-transitional” society, where life expectancy has reached new heights, fertility has 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  declined to below-replacement level, and rapid population ageing is expected over the next few decades. China’s population will start to shrink after reaching a peak of about 1.4 billion by 2025 A.D. The median age of its population could touch 50 years by then. India’s population would overtake that of China at that point. Its population is expected to peak only at 1.7 billion by 2060 A.D. Clearly, India has a potential advantage of demographic dividend over its emerging market peers. But, this demographic dividend could be a boon or a curse depending upon how we exploit it, for, the time to reap these gains is finite. By the turn of this century, India would be facing a demographic discount rather than dividend because India’s population would have aged and the developed countries’ population would be much younger. So what do we need to do to reap the demographic dividend while they exist?  The very first thing is to invest in the resources that are expected to give us advantage. India invests much less than it should in its human capital. The combined spend of central and state governments in education, is just about 3.3 per cent of GDP, while that on health is another 1.3 per cent of GDP. In contrast, the European Union (EU) countries spend from their general government account, 5.5 per cent of their GDP on education and 7.5 per cent of their GDP on health – i.e. nearly three times more of their GDP. Canada’s public spending on health alone is over 11 per cent of their GDP and that on education is nearly 5 per cent. India needs to step up its public spending on education and health considerably over the next five years. However, spending alone does not guarantee high quality human capital. We also need to focus on the quality of this spending and think whether we can achieve better outcomes with less spending. The second step we need to take is for right skilling of our work force. There is shortage of trained manpower for the industry, both at the bottom of the pyramid and higher up the ladder. India is often considered to be a source for skilled labour supply to the rest of the world, given its sheer size of manpower. It is often not recognized that over four-fifths of our rural population and over half of our urban population remains unskilled. Women participation rate in the labour market remains poor. The biggest problem is the lack of focus on technical education that could absorb a large chunk of unskilled labour, if backed by greater push to primary education. Less than 11 per cent of the job-seeking population in the age group of 15–29 receives any form of vocational training in India and only one of every three who do get vocational training receive it from specialized training institutes. Furthermore, even in the value added segment, where we have the largest pool of skilled manpower i.e. in the area of information technology, real wages are rising at a pace that may impact our competitiveness.  The biggest challenge is to ensure jobs for additional supply of labour that comes in to join the workforce. On a rough basis, about 10 million people would need a job every year for the next 15 years. Though disguised unemployment in agriculture sector has reduced over the years, it may not be possible for the sector to provide additional jobs given the rising rural wages and the need to shift to a corporate, more mechanized and capital intensive model of farming. While the services sector has led India’s growth and employment story for some time now, India’s growth pace may not be sustained unless the manufacturing sector also becomes more competitive and creates lot more jobs. This poses a significant challenge in employment generation and skilling our work force.  2.  Improve productivity and efficiency Productivity is an important driver of growth. Productivity depends on the efficiency with which scarce resources are allocated – be it your time, work effort, natural resources, capital or any other inputs. A great deal of the growth for most countries can be explained by productivity growth, especially total factor productivity growth (TFPG). Factor accumulation (such as increase in labour or capital) explains a smaller part of the growth. Given this experience, if India were to become a tiger, it would need to focus on technological 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  developments to improve its rate of TFPG. Capital deepening may also help, but the key lies in overall productivity enhancements. In India, output per worker has increased at an impressive rate in the services sector after the reforms initiated in early 90s. In this period, TFPG growth has also been impressive for this sector, though I will eschew quoting precise numbers as the growth accounting research generally gives varied quantitative estimates. TFPG growth has also improved for the manufacturing sector since the 1980s. So, progress is being made. However, the rate of this technical change, still, has been lower than that for the East Asian economies during the period in which they earned the tag of being East Asian tigers.  I would rather focus on the issue of larger policy initiative that would be necessary in the quest to transform India into a tiger. In this context, I would make four suggestions. First, improving agriculture productivity is necessary as, clearly, increase in area under cultivation is just not practical and, therefore, increasing demand for cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables would need to be met by improving yields. Substantial productivity enhancements are possible on the farm through adoption of precision farming techniques, better cultivars and optimal water management. Better adoption of modern technologies in the area of biotechnology, genomic tools, cost-effective and eco-friendly integrated pest management technologies, seed-supply chains and systems, regionally adapted varieties and hybrids, would help.  Second, we need to focus on issues confronting our Small and Medium Enterprise (SME). SME sector accounts for over a third of our industrial output and contributes an equal share of our total merchandise exports. In the current downturn, SMEs are facing adverse business climate with rising receivables, inadequate credit and high cost of credit. SME sector does not enjoy the economies of scale and scope that a large corporation enjoys. It also cannot fully reap the benefit of information technology as it has high sunk cost and a high rate of obsolescence. Though having strong links with large firms, institutional mechanisms for transfer of technology to SMEs are lacking. If SMEs are to effectively integrate with supply chains, we need to ensure that links of finance and technology with large firms work at all times. Third, as I mentioned a little earlier, India’s next growth push has to come from manufacturing sector. We had a missed century of opportunities. India cannot boast of one big “home grown” global brand while much smaller nations like South Korea, Taiwan, etc. have plenty of them. Our abundant human capital has not been effectively channelized for supporting the manufacturing growth. But what I would really blame for this is a lack of  “R & D” culture that we suffer from. Globally, India figures at near the bottom in terms of R&D intensity. It spends less than one percentage of its GDP on R&D expenditure, Countries like Israel, Finland, Sweden, Korea, Japan, US and Germany have R&D intensities that are higher by three times or more.  Fourth, a key issue related to productivity is our attitude to work. It is strange that India, that epitomised the dignity of labour in the Early Vedic period, has imbibed a culture that does not respect workers. We have forgotten Swami Vivekananda’s contribution in equating work to worship. No form of work, whether manual or intellectual is less inferior to the other. As a nation, we have been steadily neglecting our respect for dignity of labour. Since the manual labour does not receive the same respect as an intellectual work in India, work efforts are lost. This results in lower GDP and lower Welfare. Individuals idle away than take up a manual job. What else would explain the fact that labourers from poor states like Bihar, Orissa, UP, etc. migrate and work hard in the agricultural farms in Punjab and Haryana, while refusing to do the same in their own locality where the land is more fertile and same amount of labour would be much more productive. We must emulate the western society in this regard where no form of labour is discriminated against. If President Cleveland could accept dignity of labour in 1894, more than a century down the line it is time that we give respect to casual labour that operates around us – be it our maids, our drivers or the workmen in our 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  factories – a due recognition and respect. If we do so, more women and men would join the workforce. Unemployment would be reduced and Indian industry would become more competitive globally.  3.  Revive infrastructure investments and harness natural resources better  Much has been said about India’s infrastructure deficit and rightly so. India does not have sufficient roads, nor sufficient power. When I was growing up, I was taught that India is a land of poor, but is rich in resources. Today we have made a giant leap in lowering poverty and still remain abundant in natural resources. Yet, we have not learnt to optimally utilise them. Take for example coal, which accounts for India’s 55 per cent of energy needs. We have hard coal reserves of around 246 billion tonnes, of which 92 billion tonnes are proven. Yet, we are able to produce only 530 million tonnes of coal, leaving supply shortages of over 150 million tonnes. Coal shortages are constraining our power generation and though about 55 GW of new capacity was created during the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP), a large part of it remains unutilised due to coal shortages. Private sector has failed to develop most of the new coal blocks that were allotted to them. We ended up with inadequate planning and poor execution in this area. We are now planning to create even more thermal power capacity during the 12th FYP, but remain unsure of coal supplies. At the same time, banks have heavily extended themselves into lending to power sector both on generation and distribution side. On the distribution side, the State distribution companies (discoms) are sitting on huge losses and bank debt that is threatening to go bad. The end result is a loss of business confidence that has brought the investment boom to a premature halt. What is most important in this context is to revive the confidence for investing and lending to the infrastructure sector. The government, in recent period, has taken several steps to facilitate this. The broad contours of the New Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) have been worked out, though some thorny issues such as price pooling of imported and domestic coal are still to be resolved. These pending issues must be solved quickly. Similarly, a debt restructuring package for the discoms has been worked out. The private sector must seize the initiative and rekindle the Schumpeterian spirit at this juncture. Banks also need to perform their core banking business while balancing risk assessment with the functional need to support growth. We also need to harness our natural resources much better. Take the simple example of water. We are a country blessed with water resources with a network of perennial rivers and abundant rainfall. The rainfall provides four times the water that we use annually. Yet, water is a scarce resource in India. We haven’t harnessed our resources enough and haven’t planned the storage and distribution of water efficiently. India’s per capita storage capacity is significantly lower than that of other countries. For example, the quantum of water that can be stored as a proportion of average river runoff for India is just 50 days of average runoff with wide variations – from 220 days in the Krishna to just two days in the Brahmaputra/Barak Basin. The comparable figures for the Colorado River Basin and Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin are 900 days while for South Africa’s Orange River Basin it is 350 days. Better water management could radically alter the agriculture situation in India. India also needs to utilize its mining, spectrum and air resources better. The importance of clean air is often not recognized. We need to strike a right balance between our development needs and environmental commitments to ensure long-run growth sustainability. We are not among the world’s top polluters. It needs to be recognized that average per square kilometre carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution in Japan is 7.5 times more than in India. Similarly, per capita CO2 emission by India is amongst the least globally. Nevertheless, we also need to note that air pollution has serious health costs and India ranks fourth in the list of the largest CO2 pollutants after China, US and Russia. As such, if we want to ensure not just fast growth but also good quality growth sustainable for a fairly long period of time, we must continue to make efforts to exploit natural resources in an environmentally friendly way.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  4.  Improve governance at every level  The World Bank’s worldwide governance indicators 2006–11 place India below average on key parameters of governance. It scores about 15 per cent on political stability and absence of violence, 40 per cent on control on corruption as well as regulatory quality, 55 per cent on rule of law as well as government effectiveness, while 60 per cent on vice and accountability. Clearly, there is lot of scope for improvement on these parameters. Both, our overall governance and corporate governance needs improvement. In fact, we need better governance at every level – from hospital and schools to polity, firms, non-profit institutions, sports, banking and finance, regulation, land records and even in our daily lives. Our governance deficit, in some form, is reflected in our ranking on ease of doing business. According to the IFC-World Bank Report 2013 released this year, India ranks 132nd on the index measuring “ease of doing business” amongst 185 economies. Singapore and Hong Kong got the top and second spots overall. In its sub-components, India stands at an impressive 23rd on the criteria of ease of getting credit and 49th in terms of protecting investors. However, it figures at 173rd in terms of starting a business, 182nd in terms of dealing with construction permits and 184th in contract enforcement.  According to the same report, on an average, in India it requires 173 days to start a business, 196 days for obtaining a construction permit and 67 days to get electricity. In Singapore one needs just 3 days to start a business, 26 days for construction permit and 36 days for getting electricity. All other East Asian tigers also have a far superior record than India on these parameters. If we aspire to become a tiger we must become more business friendly, both for domestic and foreign firms, traders and tourists. We, of course, have an enviable record of a democratic system, a responsive government, an active media and an independent judiciary. However, the risk of dealing with India must come down further. We have to reach where the East Asian tigers reached. It is for this reason that we advocated the adoption of Singapore model in the last RBI Annual Report. In a limited way, this is being attempted in the form of National Investment Board (NIB). A well-functioning NIB can go a long way in cutting project delays. However, in our federal structure, NIB would still have some limitations. It will not have jurisdiction over project clearances that are required at sub-national levels. The Singapore model is a step further. It requires all concerned agencies to sit together in a time bound manner to clear or reject projects, failing which the clearance is deemed to be automatic. We must make doing business easy, to unleash entrepreneurship and venture capitalism in India. We also need to improve our record of corporate governance in both financial and non-financial firms. Barriers to entry must collapse and a more competitive environment needs to be generated. However, we must develop a framework and inculcate practices of arms length relationships that do not permit connected lending and business relationships that may promote “looting” behaviour as described by Akerlof (awarded the Nobel Prize in 2001) and Romer. They argued that an economic underground can come to life if firms have an incentive to go broke for profit at society’s expense (to loot) instead of to go for broke (to gamble on success). Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation, or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations. There is still a large gap arising from our nominal compliance of good corporate governance in accordance with regulatory provisions and real compliance of practicing it in law and spirit. We need to bridge this gap.  5.  Enforce accountability in all walks of life All the other five steps that I talk of in this address, including real compliance of good governance cannot be achieved unless we enforce accountability. Just as we need better governance at every level, we also need to enforce accountability in all walks of life. Our accountability structures, especially in public sector, are weak. In administration, the civil 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  servants are insufficiently incentivized for the risks they take, are seldom rewarded for successful completion of their goals and are, at best, merely transferred for poor implementation. Mangers in public sector enterprises face similar problems in addition to bureaucratic interventions that delay decisions or require them to move away from policies which may be in the best interests of a public sector unit. It is difficult to enforce accountability in this climate. On corporate accountability, the principal-agent relationship between the management or those who wrest ownership and control and the shareholders as actual owners is rather weak. We have seen asset stripping and bankruptcies in this weak environment. This has been especially true where a complex web of companies within business groups prevail. There is a strong case for simplifying these structures that are often developed to evade taxes, indulge in regulatory arbitrage and to strip assets of the firm for personal use. In recent period, we have come across instances where corporate debt restructuring is sought but ownership commitment of those who have control is rather left weak. We must enforce accountability in such cases by forcing such business entities to bring in more of their capital. There are, sometimes, grave cases of businessmen launching new firms, renaming firms or indulging in M&As to garner fresh public money after they misused funds in the first instance. The concept of the modern firm based on limited liability principle requires care to prevent such practices. Our political process ensures a fair deal of accountability through our democratic institutions. Yet, there is debate on whether a right to recall should exist. A more fragmented polity and existence of coalitions and minority governments, sometimes, make matters worse. Accountability at the municipal levels is also lacking. This, in turn, impacts the upkeep of our infrastructure that gets built. Roads seldom last more than a year. Drainage systems choke. What is, therefore, necessary in this climate is to do four things. First, stakeholder engagement must be intensified in all institutions – public or private. Furthermore, there should be a principle of inclusivity in stakeholder engagement so that any sort of regulatory capture by interest groups is avoided. Second, individuals, rather than committees or groups, should be made accountable even where a collegiate approach is adopted. Such accountability should not be time barred by transfers of jobs or retirements. Third, financial accountability must be enforced for all. For enhancing fiscal transparency, the budgetary processes should be made tighter so that slippages are eliminated. Similarly, financial accountability needs to be promoted for firms and non-profit institutions. Fourth, accountability should be codified to the degree it can be done and a periodic evaluation must be done to assess achievement, failures and correctives.  6.  Make finance more responsive to real sector and promote inclusive growth Let me, at last, cover the role of finance in India’s transformation from elephant to tiger. I have kept this for the end because this is where finance should belong to. In recent period, finance has become big and rather than responding to the real sector needs, it is leading the real sector. Too-big to fail syndrome, firms depending on other incomes to shore up their accounts, market herd behaviour driven by noise rather than fundamentals, are all examples of finance sector becoming too big for its boots. Yet, the finance to support real activity is still inadequate. Firms and businesses still get crowded out by information asymmetry. Financial frictions and financial constraints come in the way of investment and growth in the economy. For want of collaterals, the poor cannot access even elementary banking services, resulting not only in some potential saving getting lost but leaving the society more unequal and polarized with insufficient support for Pareto superior outcomes just because gainers can’t compensate the losers. Finance must be regulated more tightly. This does not require more regulations but perhaps less and newer regulations with greater effectiveness. At the same time, those who engage in finance must have an obligation towards promoting financial inclusion, without which 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  inclusive growth cannot be achieved. Banking should have a human face for it is the households who provide the base for all banking activities. They are the only ones with financial surpluses which can be intermediated to corporate and public sectors that run financial deficits. It has been my endeavour to push policies on bank lending with a view to encourage credit flows to the vulnerable section of the population that would otherwise get financially excluded.  Over the years, this has been the ethos of the Reserve Bank. The branch licensing policy and the directed lending route have been the two pillars on which the efforts for financial inclusion have rested for a long time. The bank licensing policy, mandating a certain ratio of rural bank branches for each license for urban branch, has often been criticised by banks as coming in the way of their business interests. However, there is strong research evidence to suggest that this social banking experiment in India has been successful in improving the credit flows to the rural population and even in lowering poverty as a result. The priority sector lending (PSL) stipulation has also improved the flow of credit to certain productive sectors of the economy that would otherwise have been crowded out of the bank credit market due to information asymmetries. There are reasons to believe that with proper planning and use of technology-enabled efficient delivery channels, banks can pursue financial inclusion in a profitable way. Our approach should not be seen as being interventionist. In practice, Reserve Bank has deftly balanced objectives of equity and efficiency so that financial inclusion is furthered, but banks’ financial health is not impaired. In more recent period with which I have been associated, we have redoubled our efforts at financial inclusion. For instance, the prescription for PSL in respect of foreign banks has been raised from 32 per cent to 40 per cent in case of those banks which have 20 or more branches. We have also imparted a more human touch to basic banking for those who did not have bank accounts.  Conclusion Let me end by talking about something we need to learn from the East Asian tigers in our quest to become one. Growth acceleration in these tigers were supported by liberalization, export-led growth, high investment in education, large share of educated workforce, high public and private savings rate and macroeconomic discipline and governance. We are pursuing some of these policies and can pursue some more of them. However, these tigers also failed to maintain their spurt because of some mistakes they committed. Some of them maintained high interest rate to attract foreign investments, others pegged currency arrangements and many of them developed a vulnerable financial system. An unanticipated shock from banking and currency side, therefore, resulted in growth collapse for them during the East Asian crisis. Corporate failures added to the financial sector woes in some countries (especially Chaebols in Korea). While transforming the Indian economy into a tiger, we need to calibrate policies taking into account the lessons learnt during the East Asian crisis. Thank you for your patient hearing. Downturns come and go away as business cycles run their course. In our present predicaments with macro-economic stabilization, we must not lose sight of our larger goals, whether we walk at an elephant’s pace or run like a tiger. Let me assure you that as a society, if we can inculcate an aggressive and tenacious urge to attain a set goal – the killer instinct of the tiger – we would definitely earn our rightful place under the sun.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  András Simor: Cost and efficiency of retail payments – evidence, policy actions and role of central banks Pre-dinner statement by Mr András Simor, Governor of Magyar Nemzeti Bank (the central bank of Hungary), at the ECB-MNB Joint Conference on “Cost and efficiency of retail payments – evidence, policy actions and role of central banks”, Budapest, 15 November 2012. *      *      * Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,  It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you here in Budapest. We are honoured that the ECB accepted the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) as the co-organiser for a retail payments conference held in 2012. We attribute this privilege mostly to the fact that the MNB has completed and published first the national cost of payments study based on the harmonised pan-European methodology.  As I heard, this afternoon you listened to the opening remarks by Mr. Benoît Coeuré and after that you already had two sessions. You will also have a very busy, tight schedule tomorrow, so as a kind of rest let me invite you to play a game. How many of you brought your per diem in cash or cheques? Please raise your hand if you did! ... Not too many of you, I see. I am quite sure that 15 years ago I would have gotten quite a different result! This game tells us a great deal about innovation. Innovation is very important, because it leads to new, viable products, which can contribute to greater competition between payment service providers, changes in payment habits and thus the enhancement of overall efficiency. Nonetheless, I am somewhat more interested in the bigger picture, so let me speak briefly about my own priorities in relation to retail payments.  As mandated by the central bank act, the MNB promotes the smooth execution of payments and the reliable and efficient operation of Hungary’s clearing and securities settlement systems. I am personally convinced that we must go beyond this task and facilitate the continued improvement in the efficiency of domestic payments using all tools available to us. Let me give you some Hungarian examples about what I am referring to.  One of our major recent achievements was the introduction of intraday clearing of retail payments with five daily cycles in July this year. The MNB participated in the project both as the catalyst and as the regulator to overcome network coordination failure. I am quite sure that you share my view that network coordination failure can emerge quite often in the field of payments. Therefore, in this particular case, with the conflicts of interests of individual banks and the reluctance of the banking community to make a decision on the actual start of implementation, the MNB decided to use its regulatory power. The MNB did so because timely implementation of the project was in the interest of society as a whole and the better achievement of the public good. Public good was served in several ways; First, by eliminating the float on the banks’ side; Second, by facilitating more finely tuned liquidity management by customers; and Third, by generally improving the quality of services provided to customers.  Another of our achievements is the publication of the Hungarian national cost study entitled “Nothing is free”, which has helped to foster a public dialogue about the role of cash in our society. Our staff found that cash is heavily used in Hungarian retail payments: 85% of the number of retail payment transactions is connected to the use of cash. According to the best estimates, every year 0.4% of GDP (in the Hungarian context this currently corresponds to 370 million euros) could be saved in Hungary if the national payment pattern changed in such a way that the use of cash and paper-based payment instruments declined, and the use of electronic payments increased.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Our analysis revealed that the main bottleneck hindering much wider usage of cashless payments instruments is mostly on the acquirers’ side. Consequently, we proposed public policy measures mostly with the aim of better attraction of merchants. Some of our ideas have been incorporated in the current economic policy programme of the Hungarian government, but implementation is still underway. One of the key contemplated measures is the extension of the network of POS terminals, which is underdeveloped in comparison to other European countries. In addition to possibly subsidised set-up of POS terminals, we are also thinking about regulating the level of interchange fees. Despite some declines, interchange fees remain too high in Hungary. Therefore, our intention is to somehow reduce the fee level, either by following the US and Australian examples or by reacting to recent European developments. Moreover, we also advocate the gradual introduction of mandatory acceptance of card payments at each merchant outlet.  Our analysis made it clear that cash is heavily used not only in consumer-to-merchant relationship, but also in business-to-business (B2B) payments and in payments of public administration. In case of B2B payments, one step forward is the introduction of a ceiling on the amount which can be paid in cash as compensation in a purchase contract. The current ceiling is a monthly amount of around 18 thousand euros, and this will be further reduced (to about 5–6 thousand euros), if endorsed by parliament.  We expect more robust and faster changes in the field of payments of the government. An upcoming MNB study has shown that one-third of all payments in the field of public administration (in total 100 million transactions) occur in cash. Let me give some background information. The first item is that about one-half of the outgoing cash-based payments relate to pension payments and the disbursement of various social transfers and benefits. The second item is that – within public administration – the local government sector is the most extensive cash user.  A low cost, basic payment account could also function as an important vehicle for curtailing cash usage. Providing access to payment accounts at reasonable prices is a precondition from the aspect of the government. If this kind of low cost, basic payment account facility were available, the government could launch a massive programme to increase electronic disbursements of pensions, social transfers and benefits to unbanked people and could also require that labour income and any other remuneration be transferred to payment accounts.  Our intentions are geared not only to raising awareness of the costs involved, but also provoking changes. Payment habits can be changed most quickly in the field of public administration provided that there is a supportive political will. A country like ours, a country with relatively low per-capita GDP and a not insignificant hidden economy, cannot afford to delay reducing the use of cash. It is very encouraging that in its current economic policy programme the government declared it necessary to curtail cash payments and intends to apply appropriate policy measures. However, it seems that implementation will not be completed very soon.  For most of the time I have been speaking about the Hungarian case and about the challenges we are facing, and the measures we have either taken or are still considering, in order to most efficiently tackle the waste of resources. I am sure some of these phenomena or similar ones occur in your country as well.  This entire conference and the dinner reception just ahead of us provide an excellent opportunity for learning from each other, and to discuss, for example, experiences, successes, failures, and forces behind changes in the overall efficiency of retail payments, in particular the role of central banks and the future evolution of the retail payments market. Let us keep in mind a Chinese proverb that says “A single conversation with a wise man is better than ten years of study”.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Glenn Stevens: Challenges for central banking Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Bank of Thailand’s 70th Anniversary and 3rd Policy Forum, Bangkok, 12 December 2012. *      *      * Monday marked the 70th anniversary of the commencement of operations of the Bank of Thailand, on 10 December 1942. Conceived under war-time occupation, the Bank has grown to be a key institution in Thailand. It is a pleasure and an honour to come to Bangkok to take part in one of a series of events to mark the anniversary, and I want to thank Governor Prasarn for the invitation.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has long enjoyed a strong relationship with the Bank of Thailand. In 1997, the RBA was among those central banks to enter a swap agreement with the Bank of Thailand shortly after the crisis broke. This was the first part of Australian assistance to the regional partners who were under pressure, which later extended to Korea and Indonesia. In fact, Australia and Japan were the only countries that offered direct financial support to all three countries.  It was a predecessor of mine, Bernie Fraser, who made the suggestion 17 years ago that cooperation in the Asian region might be improved by the establishment of a dedicated institution, along the lines of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel – the “Asian BIS”.1 Such a body has not come to pass – at least not yet! – but it is fair to say that this suggestion and others like it helped to spur the Basel BIS to reach out to Asia.2  The central banks of the region, taking the initiative through the Executives Meeting of East Asian and Pacific central banks – EMEAP (not the most attractive acronym) – have improved cooperation substantially over the years. Thanks to long-term efforts at building relationships, and the vision of key governors and deputy governors, including at the Bank of Thailand, EMEAP has developed into a mature forum for sharing information, and continues to develop its ability to find common positions on global issues and to promote crisis readiness.  Yet as the central banks have grown closer and become more effective in their cooperation, the challenges we face have only increased. Today I want to speak about three of them.3 First, I will talk about the framework for monetary policy and the need to allow that to consider financial stability. Secondly, I will make some observations about the more prominent role for central banks' own balance sheets that we are seeing in some countries. Then, thirdly, I will offer some observations about international spillovers. In so doing, I am not seeking to deliver any particular messages about the near-term course of monetary policy in either Australia or Thailand.                                                  1  Fraser B (1995), ‘Central Bank Cooperation in the Asian Region’, Address to the 24th Conference of Economists, Adelaide, 25 September. 2  There was a round of new shareholdings taken up by Asian central banks in the late 1990s, including Thailand in 2000. The BIS established an Asian office in Hong Kong in 1998, and the Asian Consultative Council in 2001. Admittedly, the major shareholdings of the BIS remain overwhelmingly North Atlantic in their focus. But the BIS has made a good deal of progress – more than many institutions perhaps – in addressing the imbalances in global financial governance, even if there is further to go. 3  The Bank of Thailand quite recently held a conference on exactly this topic, with a number of distinguished speakers. My remarks draw on some of their insights.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Monetary policy and financial stability It is more than two decades since the framework of Inflation Targeting (IT) was pioneered in New Zealand and Canada. The United Kingdom was an enthusiastic early adopter from 1992. Australia adopted IT in 1993.  Among the early adopters, the move to IT was driven by a mixture of principle and pragmatism. The key principle was that monetary policy was, in the end, about anchoring the value of money – that is, about price stability. The pragmatism arose because one or more previous approaches designed to achieve that – monetary targeting, exchange-rate targeting, unconstrained discretion – had proved at best ineffective, and at worst destabilising, for the countries concerned. Hence many of the adopters shared a desire to strengthen the credibility of their policy frameworks. As the initial adopters came to have a measure of success in combining reasonable growth with low inflation, other countries were attracted to the model.  According to the IMF, more than 30 countries now profess to follow some form of IT.4 The euro area could also be counted among this group though it also professes adherence to the “second pillar” of “monetary analysis”. Even the United States can, I think, be counted as a (fairly recent) IT adopter, since the Federal Open Market Committee is these days quite explicit about its desired inflation performance.5  The Bank of Thailand was one of a number of emerging economies that adopted IT around the turn of the century. Twelve years on, Thailand can boast an impressive record of price stability under this framework. A high level of transparency has ensured that financial market participants understand the framework, and view it as credible. Moreover, price stability has not come at the cost of subdued economic growth, with output expanding at a brisk pace in the 2000s.  While inflation targeting is not for everyone, the Thai experience illustrates that, when done well, it can enhance economic outcomes. I can endorse the favourable verdict offered on the Thai experience delivered by Grenville and Ito (2010).6 So I think that the adoption of IT, including in Thailand, can be seen as a success in terms of the straightforward objectives set for it. To make such a claim is not, however, to claim that controlling inflation is, alone, sufficient to underwrite stability in a broader sense. If there were any thought that controlling inflation over a two or three year horizon was “enough”, we have been well and truly disabused of that by experience over the past half decade. Price stability doesn't guarantee financial stability.  Indeed it could be argued that the “great moderation” – an undoubted success on the inflation/output metric – fostered, or at least allowed, a leverage build-up that was ultimately inimical to financial stability and hence macroeconomic stability. The success in lessening volatility in economic activity, inflation and interest rates over quite a lengthy period made it feasible for firms and individuals to think that a degree of increased leverage was safe.7 But                                                 4  IMF (2012), Annual Report, Appendix II, pp 14–16, available at <http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ ft/ar/2012/eng/pdf/a2.pdf>. 5  The Fed points out, quite properly, that it has a dual mandate – “full employment” being the other component. I don’t think this precludes being an exponent of IT: the Reserve Bank of Australia has always insisted that it is quite compatible to combine an objective for medium-term inflation performance with the notion that we give due weight to the path of economic activity. 6  Grenville S and T Ito (2010), “An Independent Evaluation of the Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy under the Inflation Targeting Framework, 2000–2010”, available at <http://www.bot.or.th/Thai/MonetaryPolicy/ Documents/GrenvilleItoV10(Oct22).pdf> 7  Stevens G (2006), “Risk and the Macroeconomy”, Address to the 2006 Securities & Derivatives Industry Association Conference, RBA Bulletin, June, pp 8–17. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  higher leverage exposed people to more distress if and when a large negative shock eventually came along. This explanation still leaves, of course, a big role in causing the crisis – the major role in fact – for poor lending standards, even fraud in some cases, fed by distorted incentives and compounded by supervisory weaknesses and inability to see through the complexity of various financial instruments.  That price stability was, in itself, not enough to guarantee overall stability, should hardly be surprising, actually. It has been understood for some time that it is very difficult to model the financial sector, and that in many of the standard macroeconomic models in use, including in many central banks, this area was under-developed. Mainstream macroeconomics was perhaps a bit slow to see the financial sector as it should be seen: that is, as having its own dynamic of innovation and risk taking; as being not only an amplification mechanism for shocks but a possible source of shocks in its own right, rather than just as passively accommodating the other sectors in the economy.8  Notwithstanding the evident analytical difficulties, the critique being offered in some quarters is that central banks paid too little attention in the 2000s to the build-up of credit and leverage and to the role that easy monetary policy played in that. It is hard to disagree, though I would observe that this is somewhat ironical, given that IT was a model to which central banks were attracted after the shortcomings of targets for money and credit quantities in the 1980s. It could be noted as well that the ECB always had the 2nd pillar, but the euro area still experienced the crisis – in part because of credit granted in or to peripheral countries, and in part because of exposures by banks in the core countries to excessive leverage in the US.  The upshot is that the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability is being re-evaluated. As this occurs, we seem to be moving on from the earlier, unhelpful, framing of this issue in terms of the question as to whether or not monetary policy should “prick bubbles” and whether bubbles can even be identified. The issue is not whether something is, or is not, a bubble; that is always a subjective assessment anyway in real time. The issue is the potential for damaging financial instability when an economic expansion is accompanied by a cocktail of rising asset values, rising leverage and declining lending standards. One can remain agnostic on the bubble/non-bubble question but still have concerns about the potential for a reversal to cause problems. Perhaps more fundamentally, although the connections between monetary policy and financial excesses can be complex, in the end central banks set the price of short-term borrowing. It cannot be denied that this affects risk-taking behaviour. Indeed that is one of the intended effects of low interest rates globally at present (which is not to say that this is wrong in an environment of extreme risk aversion).  It follows that broader financial stability considerations have to be given due weight in monetary policy decisions. This is becoming fairly widely accepted. The challenge for central banks, though, is to incorporate into our frameworks all we have learned from the recent experience about financial stability, but without throwing away all that is good about those frameworks. We learned a lot about the importance of price stability, and how to achieve it, through the 1970s, 80s and 90s. We learned too about the importance of institutional design. We shouldn't discard those lessons in our desire to do more to assure financial stability. We shouldn't make the error of ignoring older lessons in the desire to heed new ones.                                                  8  Some central banks have given a lot of thought to the question of how to manage financial stability concerns within a standard IT-type framework, though definitive answers have been hard to come by. See for example Bean C (2003), “Asset Prices, Financial Imbalances and Monetary Policy: Are Inflation Targets Enough?”, in A Richards and T Robinson (eds), Asset Prices and Monetary Policy, Proceedings of a Conference, Reserve Bank of Australia, Sydney, pp 48–76; Svensson L (2012), “Differing Views on Monetary Policy”, Speech delivered at the SNS/SIFR Finanspanel, Stockholm, 8 June, available at <http://www.bis.org/ review/r120612c.pdf>. A significant problem is that financial cycles may have a much lower frequency than normal business cycles so incorporating them into a usual two or three year horizon for policymaking is difficult. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Rather, we have to keep both sets of objectives in mind. We will have to accept the occasional need to make a judgement about short-term trade-offs, but that is the nature of policymaking. And in any event, over the long run price stability and financial stability surely cannot be in conflict. To the extent that they have not managed to coexist properly within the frameworks in use, that has been, in my judgement, in no small measure because the policy time horizon was too short, and perhaps also because people became too ambitious about fine-tuning.  We also must, of course, heed the lesson that, whatever the framework, the practice of financial supervision matters a great deal. Speaking of supervisory tools, these days it is, of course, considered correct to mention that there are other means of “leaning against the wind” of financial cycles, in the form of the grandly-labelled “macroprudential tools”. Such measures used to be more plainly labelled “regulation”. They may be useful in some instances when applied in a complementary way to monetary policy, where the interest rate that seems appropriate for overall macroeconomic circumstances is nonetheless associated with excessive borrowing in some sector or other. In such a case it may be sensible to implement a sector-specific measure – using a loan to value ratio constraint or a capital requirement. (This is entirely separate to the case for higher capital in lending institutions in general).  We need, however, to approach such measures with our eyes open. Macroprudential tools will have their place. But if the problem is fundamentally one of interest rates being too low for a protracted period, history suggests that the efforts of regulators to constrain balance-sheet growth will ultimately not work. If the incentive to borrow is powerful and persistent enough, people will find a way to do it, even if that means the associated activity migrating beyond the regulatory perimeter. So in the new-found, or perhaps re-learned, enthusiasm for such tools, let us be realists.  The limits of central banking That policy measures of any kind have their limitations is a theme with broader applications, especially for central banks. The central banks of major countries were certainly quite innovative in their responses to the unfolding crisis.9 Numerous programs to provide funding to private institutions, against vastly wider classes of collateral, were a key feature of the central bank response to the situation. In essence, when the private financial sector was suddenly under pressure to shrink its balance sheet, the central banks found themselves obliged to facilitate or slow the balance-sheet adjustment by changing the size of their own balance sheets. This is the appropriate response, as dictated by long traditions of central banking stretching back to Bagehot.  Conceptually, at least initially, these balance-sheet operations could be seen as distinct from the overall monetary policy stance of the central bank. But as the crisis has gone on such distinctions have inevitably become much less clear as “conventional” monetary policy reached its limits.  It was fortuitous for some, perhaps, that the zero-lower bound on nominal interest rates – modern parlance for what we learned about as the “liquidity trap” – had gone from being a text book curiosum to a real world problem in Japan in the 1990s. Japan subsequently pioneered the use of “quantitative easing” in the modern era. This provided some experiential base for other central banks when the recession that unfolded from late 2008 was so deep that there was insufficient scope to cut interest rates in response. So in addition to programs to provide funding to intermediaries in order to prevent a collapse of the financial system                                                 9  I note parenthetically that several important cross-border initiatives to manage liquidity pressures were put in place very quickly by key central banks. This kind of cooperation at a technical level is something at which the central banks are actually quite good. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  when market funding dried up, there have been programs of “unconventional monetary policy” in several major countries over recent years. These have been varyingly thought of as operating by one or more of:  • reducing longer-term interest rates on sovereign or quasi-sovereign debt by “taking duration out of the market” once the overnight rate was effectively zero  • reducing credit spreads applying to private sector securities (“credit easing”, operating via the “risk taking” channel)  • adding to the stock of monetary assets held by the private sector (the “money” channel, appealing to quantity theory notions of the transmission of monetary policy)  • in the euro area in particular, commitments to lower the spreads applying to certain sovereign borrowers in the currency union (described as reducing “re-denomination risk”).  As a result of such policy innovation, the balance sheets of central banks in the major countries have expanded very significantly, in some cases approaching or even surpassing their war-time peaks (Graph 1). Further expansion may yet occur.  Graph 1    It is no criticism of these actions – taken as they have been under the most pressing of circumstances – to observe that they raise some very important and difficult questions for central banks. There is discomfort in some quarters that central banks appear to be exercising an unprecedented degree of discretion, introducing new policies yielding uncertain benefits, and possible costs.  One obvious consideration is that central banks, in managing their own balance sheets, need to assess and manage risk across a wider and much larger pool of assets. Gone are the comfortable days of holding a modest portfolio of bonds issued by the home government that were seen as of undoubted credit quality. Central bank portfolios today have more risk. To date in the major countries, this has worked well in the sense that long-term yields on the core portfolios have come down to the lowest levels in half a century or more. Large profits have been remitted to governments. But at some point, those yields will surely have to rise.  
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Of course large central bank balance sheets carrying sizeable risk is hardly news around Asia. Once again, the Bank of Thailand has made an excellent contribution to the international discussion here, having recently held a joint conference with the BIS on central bank balance sheets and the challenges ahead.10 The difference is that in Asia the risks arise from holdings of foreign-currency assets which have been accumulated as a result of exchange-rate management. There is obviously valuation risk on such holdings. There is also often a negative carry on such assets since yields on the Asian domestic obligations which effectively fund foreign holdings are typically higher than those in the major countries. In effect the citizens of Asia continue to provide, through their official reserves, very large loans to major country governments at yields below those which could be earned by deploying that capital at home in the region.  For the major countries a further dimension to what is happening is the blurring of the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. Granted, central banks are not directly purchasing government debt at issue. But the size of secondary market purchases, and the share of the debt stock held by some central banks, are sufficiently large that it can only be concluded that central bank purchases are materially alleviating the market constraint on government borrowing. At the very least this is lowering debt service costs, and it may also condition how quickly fiscal deficits need to be reduced. There is nothing necessarily wrong with that in circumstances of deficient private demand with low inflation or the threat of deflation. In fact it could be argued that fiscal and monetary policies might actually be jointly more effective in raising both short and long-term growth in those countries if central bank funding could be made to lead directly to actual public final spending – say directed towards infrastructure with a positive and long-lasting social return – as opposed to relying on indirect effects on private spending.  The problem will be the exit from these policies, and the restoration of the distinction between fiscal and monetary policy with the appropriate disciplines. The problem isn't a technical one: the central banks will be able to design appropriate technical modalities for reversing quantitative easing when needed. The real issue is more likely to be that ending a lengthy period of guaranteed cheap funding for governments may prove politically difficult. There is history to suggest so. It is no surprise that some worry that we are heading some way back towards the world of the 1920s to 1960s where central banks were “captured” by the Government of the day.11, 12  Most fundamentally, the question is whether people are fully understanding of the limits to central banks' abilities. It is, to repeat, not to be critical of actions to date to wonder whether private market participants, and perhaps more importantly governments, recognise what central banks cannot do. Central banks can provide liquidity to shore up financial stability and they can buy time for borrowers to adjust. But they cannot, in the end, put government finances on a sustainable course and they cannot create the real resources that need to be found from somewhere to strengthen bank capital. They cannot costlessly correct earlier misallocation of real capital investment. They cannot shield people from the implications of having mis-assessed their own life-time budget constraints and as a result having consumed                                                 10  See BIS (2012), “Are Central Bank Balance Sheets Too Large?”, Proceedings from the 2011 Bank of Thailand-BIS Research Conference: Central Bank Balance Sheets in Asia and the Pacific: The Policy Challenges Ahead, Chiang Mai, 12–13 December 2011, available at <http://www.bis.org/publ/ bppdf/bispap66.pdf>. 11  Goodhart C (2010), “The Changing Role of Central Banks”, BIS Working Paper No 326, available at <http://www.bis.org/publ/work326.pdf>. 12  A further question is whether significant parts of private markets for which central banks are de facto a more or less complete substitute today will actually resume when central banks seek to step back, or whether those market capacities will have atrophied. This is something the Bank of Japan has long worried about – since it has been involved in QE for more than a decade. It will also be relevant in European inter-bank markets and probably elsewhere. Of course some may not mourn the loss of such markets, but that would be short-sighted. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  too much. They cannot combat the effects of population aging or drive the innovation that raises productivity and creates new markets. Nor can they, or should they, put themselves in the position of deciding what real resource transfers should take place between countries in a currency union.  One fears, in short, that while the central banks have been centre stage – rightly in many ways – in the early responses to the crisis, and in buying time for other adjustments by taking bold initiatives over the past couple of years, the limits of what they can do may become more apparent in the years ahead. A key task for central banks is to try to communicate these limits, all the while doing what they can to sustain confidence that solutions can in fact be found and pointing out from where they might come.  Challenges with spillovers Talking about the challenges associated with large balance-sheet activities leads naturally into a discussion about international spillovers.  In one sense, this is not a new issue. It has been a cause of anxiety and disagreement since the latter days of the Bretton Woods agreement at least. The remark attributed to the then Secretary of the US Treasury in regard to European concerns about the weakness of the US dollar in the 1970s of “it's our currency, but your problem” was perhaps emblematic of the spillovers of that time. There have been other episodes since.13 In a much earlier time there was, of course, the “beggar thy neighbour” period of the 1930s – something which carries cogent lessons for current circumstances.  In recent years, as interest rates across a number of major jurisdictions have fallen towards zero and as central bank balance-sheet measures have increased, these developments have been seen as contributing to cross-border flows of capital in search of higher returns. The extent of such spillovers is still in dispute. And, to the extent that they are material, some argue that a world in which extraordinary measures have been taken to prevent crises may still be a better place for all than the counterfactual.14  The degree of disquiet in the global policymaking community does seem, however, to have grown of late.15 Perhaps one reason is the following. In past episodes expansionary policies in major countries, while having spillovers through capital flows, did demonstrably stimulate demand in the major countries. It is open to policymakers in those countries to claim that unconventional policies are having an expansionary effect in their own economies compared with what would otherwise have occurred. But the slowness of the recovery in the US, Europe and Japan, I suspect, leaves others wondering whether major countries are relying more on exporting their weaknesses than has been the case in most previous recoveries. One response to that can be efforts in emerging economies to make their financial systems more resilient to volatile capital flows, such as by developing local currency bond markets                                                 13  The very high US interest rates of the late 1970s and early 1980s had major spillover effects, not least in the western hemisphere. The US bond market sell-off of 1993 and 1994 affected many other countries and was a major point of debate in international meetings of the time. The re-unification of Germany had spillover effects within Europe. 14  Bernanke B (2012), “U.S. Monetary Policy and International Implications”, Address to Challenges of the Global Financial System: Risks and Governance under Evolving Globalization, a High-Level Seminar Sponsored by Bank of Japan-International Monetary Fund, Tokyo, 14 October, available at <http://www.federalreserve.gov/ newsevents/speech/bernanke20121014a.htm>. 15  See Caruana J (2012), “International Monetary Policy Interactions: Challenges and Prospects”, Address to the CEMLA-SEACEN Conference on “The Role of Central Banks in Macroeconomic and Financial Stability: the Challenges in an Uncertain and Volatile World”, Punta del Este, Uruguay, 16 November, available at <http://www.bis.org/speeches/sp121116.pdf>.

Meanwhile people in the emerging economies, and for that matter several advanced economies, feel uncomfortable about the spillovers.  At the same time, it has to be said that spillovers go in more than one direction. While it was common for Asian (and European) policymakers to point the finger at the US for many years over the US current account deficit, with claims that the US was absorbing too great a proportion of the world's saving, the fact was that those regions were supplying excess savings into the global capital market because they did not want to use them at home. That surely had an impact on the marginal cost of capital, to which borrowers and financial institutions in parts of the advanced world responded. We may want to say, in hindsight, that policymakers in the US and elsewhere should have worried more about the financial risks that were building up by the mix of policies that they ran. But we would also have to concede that the US policymakers sought to maintain full employment in a world that was conditioned by policies pursued in parts of the emerging world and especially Asia.  Not only do spillovers go in more than one direction, but those which might arise from policies in this region are much more important now than once was the case. The rapid growth in Asia's economic weight means that policy incompatibilities which partly arise on this side of the Pacific have greater global significance. The traditional Asian strategy of export-driven growth assisted by a low exchange rate worked well when Asia was small. Asia isn't small anymore and so the rest of the world will not be able to absorb the growth in Asian production in the same way as it once did. More of that production will have to be used at home. This is understood by Asian policymakers and progress has been made in reorienting the strategy. I suspect more will be needed.  For central banks in particular, there has been talk about spillovers from monetary policy settings being “internalised” into individual central banks' framework for decision making. Exactly how that might be done is not entirely clear, and discussion is in its infancy; a consensus is yet to emerge. The IMF does useful work on spillovers and the IMF offers, at least in principle, a forum where incompatibilities can be at least recognised and discussed. One more far reaching proposal is for there to be an “international monetary policy committee”.17 That seems a long way off at present.  For spillovers to be effectively internalised, mandates for central banks would need to allow for that. At the present time most central banks are created by national legislatures, with mandates prescribed in national terms. (The ECB of course is the exception, with a mandate given via an international treaty). It would be a very big step to change that and it certainly won't occur easily or soon, though national sovereignty over monetary policy within the euro area was given up as part of the single currency – so big changes can occur if the benefits are deemed to be sufficient.  Whether or not such a step eventually occurs, it is clear that spillovers are with us now. All countries share a collective interest in preserving key elements of the international system, even as individual central banks do what it takes to fulfil their current mandates. It is vital, then, that central banks continue to talk frankly with each other about how we perceive the interconnections of global finance to be operating. We may be limited at times by the national natures of our respective mandates, but those limitations need not preclude cooperative action altogether, as has been demonstrated at various key moments over the past five years.

Internationally, the BIS of course is also a key forum for “truth telling” in a collegiate and confidential setting and one in which the central banks of this region are playing an increasingly prominent role. There will need to be much more of this in the future.  Conclusion The Bank of Thailand and the Reserve Bank of Australia have, in our respective histories, faced challenges, some of them severe ones. We have learned much from those experiences. In recent years, we have had our own distinct challenges. Fortunately, we have not been directly at the centre of the almost unprecedented challenges faced by our colleagues in major countries, though we have all been affected in various ways.  The future in Asia is full of potential, but to realise that we have to continue our efforts to strengthen our own policy frameworks, learn the appropriate lessons from the problems of others, and continue our efforts to cooperate on key issues of mutual interest. As the Bank of Thailand moves into its eighth decade, I am sure you will rise to the challenge.  Thank you again for the invitation to be here, and Happy Birthday!  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Prasarn Trairatvorakul: Policy Forum marking the Bank of Thailand’s 70th anniversary Welcome remarks by Dr Prasarn Trairatvorakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, to the Bank of Thailand’s 70th Anniversary and 3rd Policy Forum, Bangkok, 12 December 2012. *      *      * Governor Glenn Stevens, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1. It gives me great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to all of you, our distinguished guests, to the Bank of Thailand’s Policy Forum. Today’s gathering marks the third such event organized by the Bank of Thailand. The policy forum serves as a platform for prominent academics, policy-makers and market participants to learn from the visions and insights of outstanding international leaders. More importantly, the discussion and knowledge-sharing arisen from this forum will further equip the Bank of Thailand with a broader and deeper pool of knowledge to pursue its mandate. On that note, let me add that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the Bank of Thailand, an institution that has always been committed to preserving economic and financial stability. This commitment would not be possible without continual upgrading of our knowledge base through forums such as the one today. 2. Today, the Bank of Thailand is truly honored to have Governor Glenn Stevens of the Reserve Bank of Australia with us to share his thoughts on “Challenges for Central Banking”. This talk is especially timely because the effects of the global crisis are spreading to our region. Asia is clearly slowing amid the weak US economic recovery and the euro crisis. At the last policy forum, Dr. Wolfgang Schäuble, Federal Minister of Finance of Germany, spoke at this forum and shared with us his views from the eye of the storm. Now, as the storm moves east to Asia, Governor Glenn Stevens will be able to share with us his views from the perspective of our region with respect to the external challenges we are facing.2 3. Apart from common external challenges, Australia and Thailand also share many internal characteristics as well as a similar monetary policy framework. For example, both are open economies. Both export commodities and import oil. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) practices inflation-targeting with a flexible exchange rate. In fact, it is considered a pioneer among central banks as it adopted inflation-targeting in 1994. As you all know, the Bank of Thailand also practices inflation-targeting with a flexible exchange rate. Both Australia and Thailand recently experienced substantial exchange rate swings amid the euro crisis. A flexible exchange rate regime allows flexibility in responding to exchange rate movements. However, in a world where global liquidity is especially fluid due to loose monetary policies in the US and the euro zone, can exchange rates move out of line with fundamentals for prolonged period of time? This is an issue that faces not only Australia and Thailand but also the region as a whole. As a life-long central banker, I’m sure Governor Glenn Stevens can give us the broader perspective on this issue. 4. I sincerely hope that the common lessons learned from our experiences within the region will help us, and indeed other central banks, better manage the complexities of the global economy. 5. Before we hear from Governor Stevens, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all guests for joining us at this Policy Forum to mark the 70th anniversary of the Bank of Thailand. Many of you here have been an integral part of our policy progress over the past many years. On this note, may I propose a toast of appreciation to all of you and of hope that many of you will continue to support a common vision toward building further policy progress for the well-being of all Thais in years to come. 6. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Choongsoo Kim: Strengthening the resilience of the financial system in Asia and the Pacific Welcome remarks by Dr Choongsoo Kim, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the BOK-BIS Roundtable on “Strengthening the resilience of the financial system in Asia and the Pacific”, Hong Kong SAR, 10–11 December 2012. *      *      * Greetings On behalf of the Bank of Korea I bid a warm welcome to all participating in the BOK-BIS Roundtable on Financial Markets. Our gratitude goes in particular to those giving presentations and the BIS as the co-host. Currently, the world economy has not yet gained traction amid the prevailing high degree of uncertainty, not having completely broken free from the aftershocks of the Global Financial Crisis and it is now facing the euro area sovereign debt crisis and the risks of the U.S. fiscal cliff. When we turn our eyes to the Asia-Pacific, economies closely linked with China in a supply chain are on the alert for the spillovers to them depending upon the direction the Chinese economy takes,1 and some economies are keen to see a soft-landing of their household debt and real estate prices. In addition, emerging market economies in Asia and the Pacific are making various efforts to prevent advanced countries’ crisis response measures including QE and international financial market unrest from causing excessive capital flows and consequential commodity price increases and the exchange rate volatility. At this critical juncture, I think it is most timely that this meeting is being held as it sets out to examine financial system resilience in Asia and the Pacific and to find measures to strengthen it. Seizing this opportunity, I would like to give you my thoughts on the need to strengthen regional financial integration and other policy tasks such as maintaining financial stability in order to boost the resilience of the financial system in Asia and the Pacific. Regional financial integration in Asia and the Pacific and financial system resilience Countries in Asia and the Pacific and, above all, financial markets in emerging economies show very high beta, namely sensitivity, to global shocks taking place in systemically important economies such as the U.S. and Germany.2 The real economy’s resilience in emerging market economies including those in Asia, in contrast, is analyzed as having increased greatly over the past ten years3 and, unlike advanced economies, emerging market economies have kept up relatively high growth rates since the Global Financial Crisis. The fact that the resilience of the financial markets in Asia and the Pacific does not match that of the real economy seems to be because the degree of regional financial integration is relatively low compared to that of trade integration, in other words, real integration. While the share of regional trade in total trades in Asia and the Pacific, by the way, in my speech this morning, Asia and the Pacific refer to 12 ACC members of the region, has generally maintained a high level of around 49% for the past ten years, the degree of capital integration is low, with the share of regional portfolio investment running at only around 10%.                                                 1 Ahuja and Nabar (2012). 2 Elekdag et al. (2012). 3 IMF (2012b). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Consequently, at a time of shocks external to the region like the Global Financial Crisis, the real sector showed relatively high resilience thanks to its high regional dependence, but the financial sector even became an innocent bystander due to its heavy extra-regional dependence. More specifically, when the Global Financial Crisis broke out, financial institutions in the US and the euro area embarked on massive deleveraging. Hence Asia and the Pacific experienced large scale capital outflows, which were unrelated to pull factors, and consequent financial market unrest. In this regard, one step toward enhancing the resilience of the Asia-Pacific financial system is to further strengthen regional financial integration in such a way as to relieve the asymmetry between the degrees of financial and real integration. The initial target level for strengthening financial integration can be taken as that of regional trade integration. If so, risk sharing with offshore regions including the U.S. and the euro area will decrease, while risk sharing through the Asia-Pacific financial system will increase.4 Besides the risk diversification effect in moderating offshore shocks, closer regional financial integration will lead to consumption smoothing in regional economies, a typical effect of financial integration, and will also contribute to the easing of global imbalances and the development of regional financial markets. In the course of the euro area crisis, the Asia-Pacific is actually enjoying certain positive effects ― its financial system has become more stable along with a rise in regional financial transaction. This appears attributable to the fact that, while European banks have deleveraged out of Asian emerging market economies, regional banks, such as those of Japan and Australia, have stepped up their lending to regional emerging market economies, which has helped ease the shocks.5 Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific seems to be well placed to a double harvest in terms of the positive effects from the progress of regional financial integration. First, since regional economies show large differences, for example in terms of economic development status, population aging and the degree of financial market development, the wide diversity within the region makes for possible complementary financial transactions within the region. For instance, if an aged country with a high degree of capital accumulation and a low growth rate invests in a country with a younger demographic structure and showing relatively strong growth, benefits accrue to both parties,6 such as improving profitability and the raising of required funds. We need to set the methods and appropriate degree of financial integration in the Asia-Pacific, bearing in mind the lessons from the Global Financial Crisis and the latest ones from the euro area. The Global Financial Crisis highlighted the danger of the excessive financial integration of advanced economies, including the U.S. and European countries,7 and the euro area crisis was attributable to the serious internal imbalances accumulated by financial integration8 that was blind to the differences in industrial competitiveness within the region. The degree of regional financial integration should therefore be set within a level at which the positive effects, such as risk diversification and sharing, are not offset by the negative effects from spillovers. Furthermore, just as a variety of species helps reduce the possibility of the collapse of an ecosystem,9 financial integration in the Asia-Pacific that                                                 4 Rungcharoenkitkul (2011). 5 McGuire and Rixtel (2012). 6 Jin and Jokish (2011). 7 Aizenman et al.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  recognizes and makes the most of the diversity of regional economies will further strengthen financial system stability. Moreover, since the Asia-Pacific accounts for 30 percent of total global GDP and 46 percent of total global population in 2012, respectively, and includes economies with developed financial markets such as Japan, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong SAR, the region is fully capable of developing its own regional financial markets. Policy tasks for financial stability in the Asian and Pacific region After undergoing the Asian Financial Crisis from 1997 to 1998, Asian emerging economies, while proceeding with capital account liberalization, improved the resilience of their economies by individually achieving moderate inflation, a sound fiscal policy, and a current account surplus and building up foreign currency reserves as a first line of defense against crisis.10 Despite such efforts, the Global Financial Crisis brought home to us all the danger of surges and sudden stops. It also taught us a lesson that the interconnectedness of the global economy has made the Asian-Pacific financial system subject to external shocks and that the capacity of an isolated response by a single country has hit its limit. As I noted earlier, even in advancing regional financial integration to strengthen its buffer against external shocks, the Asian-Pacific may also have to shoulder a cost burden as there would be heightened contagion effects from internal shocks. Therefore, to ensure the stability of the financial system it is vital to build up organically functioning multi-layered financial safety nets including bilateral currency swaps, regional liquidity arrangements, and IMF loans as global liquidity arrangements, and not just foreign currency reserves if situational needs are to be met.11 These are all necessary, since we cannot foretell where and in what form the next crisis will emerge regionally and globally. Although advanced economies take a rather more reserved position on building multi-layered financial safety nets, citing moral hazard and such like, I believe we need to focus on the benefits that this safety net would bring about not only for emerging economies but also advanced economies. Having financial safety nets would indeed lower the need for emerging economies to accumulate foreign currency reserves due to the original sin hung around their necks that their local currencies are not used for international settlement. Thus in due course it would lead to global re-balancing. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific accounts for 55% of world foreign currency reserves, providing an environment conducive to strengthening crisis response capacity within the region through bilateral currency swaps or regional liquidity arrangements. One such regional financial safety net, the CMIM(Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization) has made much progress but it is still judged in need of further improvements to serve as an effective crisis response.12 The scale and membership of regional financial safety nets should be enlarged in keeping with regional trade volumes and the degree of regional financial integration. However, the euro area has had to wrestle with difficulties in seeking to expand such of safety nets since the outbreak of its crisis, serving as a saltatory warning over which we should ponder. Also, too much focus on a timely crisis response can increase moral hazard on the part of recipient economies and investors, on the other hand, too strict bailout conditions can bring about a stigma effect, undermining the bailout’s usefulness. Thus, a balanced design and effective surveillance mechanisms are crucial. Having said that, what is most important is that every individual economy should be committed to making every effort for the stability of its own financial system. First of all,                                                 10 IMF (2012b). 11 Kim (2012a). 12 Hill and Menon (2012). 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  whether financial stability is explicitly included in a central bank’s mandate or not, in view of the macro-finance linkage, as the central bank, it needs to prevent the build-up of excessive imbalances in the financial system while not detracting from price stability. Additionally, policy makers should measure misalignments in asset prices with alternative indicators, notably economic agent’s financial leverage, taking the view that they are one source of systemic risks rather than they should simply be stabilized. Based on the results, they need to seek steps such as the use of macroprudential policy to curb the misalignments. Furthermore, in coping with highly volatile capital flows, an economy needs to consider capital flow managements13 which can help lower the proportion of unstable capital flows such as short-term debt and mitigate the boom-bust cycles of capital flows. In today’s open global economy, however, the policy effects taken by an individual economy alone can be limited because the effects always spill over to other economies. Thus, policy coordination among economies concerned is necessary to ensure the intended policy effect. In this regard, regional cooperative organizations such as the ADB, ASEAN+3, SEACEN, EMEAP and indeed this meeting are very important for policy coordination in the Asia-Pacific region. While we live in a global economy, we know that there is no global jurisdiction. Under such circumstances, it is likely that a state of multiple equilibria prevails. Good and bad equilibrium can coexist for some time. We may need to remember that an intra-local equilibrium is no more than a “knife-edge equilibrium”, which is vulnerable to external shocks and falls short of stability and resilience.14 In the ongoing Eurozone crisis, there has been injection of massive capital in pursuit of intra-regional equilibrium. From the perspective of global equilibrium, however, for the faster recovery of world economy, capital should, by all the principles of economic structural adjustment, flow into economies with faster growth and higher productivity. As pointed out earlier, multiple local equilibria may be suboptimal rather than optimal given the external effects. Thus, policy coordination striving for having a global-dimension equilibrium through the IMF, BIS, and the G20 is called for. Conclusions The Global Financial Crisis revealed that under excessive financial integration without appropriate regulations and financial safety nets, crises could spread around the world with amazing rapidity. Currently, the Asia-Pacific is in the somewhat paradoxical situation, where it needs to deepen regional financial integration in order to heighten financial system resilience against shocks occurring outside the region. Nevertheless, the costs of that greater financial integration in terms of crisis contagion can be reduced by the appropriate execution of macroprudential policies by individual countries and the strengthening of multi-layered financial safety nets. I am therefore sanguine that our objective of bolstering Asia-Pacific financial resilience can be achieved. Past experience shows that one region’s economic crisis can be overcome easily when another region can lead the world economy. In the Asian Financial Crisis, the United States and Europe took that role, which helped Asian economies overcome the crisis. In the resolution of the current crises in advanced economies, emerging economies whose potential economic growth is much higher than advanced economies similarly need to take the role of leading the world economy on the basis of domestic demand rather than exports. To put it more specifically, the size of the domestic markets of the emerging economies as compared to the magnitude of GDP is, however, relatively small so they cannot take up the slack sufficiently to lead the world economy. To overcome this limit, free trade agreements could be a good solution in that they can expand market size through boosting both trade                                                 13 IMF (2012a). 14 Kim (2012c).

In this regard, the Korea-China-Japan FTA, the negotiation of which just started, could be a benchmark example if it is signed in the near future.15 In addition, in the current global financial system which is decentralized without a global jurisdiction, policy coordination and information sharing through international institutions and cooperative organizations are of the utmost importance. For example, we should be looking closely at plans for the pursuit of joint research on indicators for measuring financial system resilience in Asia-Pacific and on ways in which it can be strengthened. In this regard I look forward to this meeting serving as productive forum for wide-ranging discussions on all aspects of the resilience of the Asia-Pacific financial system, the presentation of possible options and the pooling of members’ experiences.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  V K Sharma: Unearned and unshared prosperity are unsustainable Keynote address by Mr V K Sharma, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the International Leadership Symposium on “Rethinking capitalism and globalization”, organized by the World Forum for Ethics in Business in partnership with the World Bank Institute at the European Parliament, Brussels, Belgium, 30 November 2012. *      *      * The views expressed are those of the author and not of the Reserve Bank of India. 1. As is invariably the case with any major crisis, the ongoing global financial and economic crisis, including lately, of course, the eurozone crisis, have unleashed a passionate debate over the design of a new architecture of finance, capitalism and globalization. However, the trouble has been not so much with the inter-temporally evolved architecture of finance, capitalism and globalization as really with how it was actually worked in practice. The apocalyptic denouement, almost bordering on a veritable global financial and economic nuclear winter, happened not because the existing systems and best practices failed but because those responsible for implementing, and enforcing, them failed them! After all, of all risks to regulators and regulatees alike, human resources risk is by far the most serious as it is the source of all risks as confirmed by the ongoing financial and economic cataclysm. Effective and credible systems are not about right architecture but about right people for right people can make a wrong architecture work while wrong people can’t make even a right architecture work! This “right people-wrong people” trade-off is substantively, and effectively, about “ethics-expediency” trade-off, with the overwhelming anecdotal evidence of “expediency” prevailing over “ethics”! The crux of the matter is what we need is not more, or less, regulation, but good regulation, and governance. This has been the undoing of regulators/supervisors and financial firms/banks alike. But unfortunately broad-spectrum and generic failure of an inertial regulatory and supervisory system worldwide, especially in the West, precipitated the unprecedented global financial crisis and the resulting great recession. This regulatory and supervisory inertia and imperviousness to the early warning signals of unprecedented underpricing of risk, which were galore, and aplenty, pre-crisis, is graphically epitomized by the most no-holds-barred acknowledgement of this – though it came much later only recently – was when Donald Kohn, former Vice Chairman of the US Federal Reserve apologized by saying, “The cops were not on the beat, resulting in the worst economic recession and loss of millions of jobs”! At the end of the day, the problem is not not knowing the problem, but knowing it and dithering, agonizing over choices, temporizing, procrastinating and doing nothing credible, timely, tangible and decisive about it. In other words, in my considered opinion, we don’t really have to rethink capitalism and globalisation, for paraphrasing John Ruskin, what finally matters is not knowing what must be done but actually doing what must be done and doing it when it must be done!! 2. The cataclysmic financial crisis has thrown into sharp relief, as never before, the critical and important role of “asset price” inflation/asset bubbles also, as opposed to that of shop floor/products/services inflation alone, as a key variable, in monetary policy response. For what happened was unprecedented in that with monetary policy focused only on traditional CPI, interest rates were kept low in spite of exploding prices of assets like real estate/property, credit assets, equity and commodities. And this was all made possible because of the huge pre-crisis current account surpluses in China and other Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), and huge private capital inflows into EMEs in excess of their current account deficits, getting recycled back as official capital flows into government bonds of reserve currency countries, especially the USA, resulting in compression of long term yields which, in turn, translated into lower long term interest rates even for the riskier asset classes mentioned above. This chasing of yield, due to global savings glut, in turn, led to a veritable credit bubble, characterized by unprecedented underpricing of risk as reflected in the all-time-low risk premia with junk bonds spreads becoming indistinguishable from 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  investment grade debt! Such a low interest rate environment coupled with luxuriant supply of liquidity, created enabling environment for excessive leverage and risk taking. This financial syndrome was a classical case of “too much” and “too little” – too much liquidity, too much leverage, too much complex financial engineering, too little return for risk, too little understanding of risks”. This syndrome of too much of arcane rocket science and financial alchemy in the financial sector, almost entirely for its own sake to almost complete exclusion of the needs of the real sector, created a massive “financial sector – real sector imbalance” which, being, intrinsically unsustainable, culminated eventually into the now-all-too-familiar apocalyptic denouement.  3. Significantly, the above pre-2007 story of massive and unprecedented current account imbalances was almost replicated in the current on-going eurozone crisis with large and persistent current account imbalances between the core, proxied by Germany, and the Netherlands, and the crisis-hit periphery, with the surpluses of the core being almost mirror image of the current account deficits of the periphery. Indeed, it is noteworthy that current account surpluses of the core increased dramatically after the launch of the single currency because of significant depreciation of the real exchange rate in the core and appreciation of the real exchange rate in the periphery. Such large, and persistent, current account imbalances between the core and the periphery would not have been possible but for the explicit moral hazard of fixed and stable exchange rates created by the single currency because the respective national currencies of the periphery would have depreciated in real terms resulting in timely automatic rebalancing of the current account imbalances! Incidentally, but significantly, these current account imbalances between the “core” and the “periphery” are, to an extent, the result of post-1999 fiscal convergence to fiscal divergence story in the eurozone for, unless, net private savings offset it, fiscal deficit typically tends to spill over into current account deficit and, therefore, post-euro launch, there ought to have been a credible, effective and functioning institutional enforcement mechanism to ensure ongoing compliance on Maastricht fiscal parameters. Of course, this post-1999 fiscal convergence to fiscal divergence story in the “periphery” would not have mattered if, like in the case of Japan, net private savings more than offset the comparable net public dissaving (fiscal deficit) of –9.5%! So the way out of the current crisis is unwinding these imbalances through higher productivity and competitiveness in the periphery relative to the core. This is exactly what happened post-crisis in the case of unwinding of the imbalances between China, on the one hand, and the United States, on the other, with the United States current account deficit halving from almost 6% in 2007 to 3% currently and that of China’s current account surplus shrinking steeply from 10% in 2007 to 2.6% currently! Thus, in the framework of “unearned – unshared prosperity”, it was the case of “unearned” prosperity for the “deficit” periphery and “unshared” prosperity for the “surplus” core! But as in the case of China and the United States, there is some good news that real wages in Germany have gone up by 3% and those in Greece have gone down by 7%. Going forward, this then holds the promise of unwinding such imbalances by export of goods and services from the “periphery” and import of goods and services by the “core”. 4. As I said, these large and persistent current account imbalances represented “unearned” prosperity for deficit reserve currency countries and “unshared” prosperity for surplus countries. Such a global economic order was inherently unsustainable, and unstable, from the word go. But the greatest good, and the highest virtue, as it were, of sustainable globalization is that, it does not permit, except in the very short term, “unearned” and “unshared” prosperity but delivers “sustainable prosperity” only if they are “earned” and “shared” prosperity! And mind you, “unearned” and “unshared” prosperity are no socialistic/egalitarian platitudinal rhetoric but pretty compelling real-politik and geo-economic imperatives given the current irreversibly globalised and, increasingly integrated, and interdependent, world. Sustainable globalization is about macroeconomic equilibrium, balance and harmony. In fact, the whole thing can be likened to cosmic balance/equilibrium/harmony where stars, suns, planets, all orbit within the inviolable discipline of their elliptical orbits which do not permit deviant behavior beyond the shortest 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  and the longest distance from suns and stars of orbiting planets! Any deviant behavior/conduct, inconsistent with the cosmic harmonious balance and equilibrium, will invite, and inflict, extremely retributive backlash; the more severe and prolonged the disequilibrium and imbalance, the more wrenching and excruciating will be the resulting pain as is currently being experienced, especially in the euro zone, where, it is no brainer to see that, in the event of the break-up of the euro, it is the surplus/creditor “core” that has far more to lose than the deficit/debtor “periphery”! For if the surplus/creditor “core” exit the euro, value of what is left of the euro will be worth much less in terms of national currencies of the exiting surplus/creditor countries. On the other hand, if the deficit/debtor “periphery” exit, they will simply default on their euro-denominated debt owed to the surplus/creditor “core” because of the collapse of their national currencies against the euro! In other words, in sustainable globalization, there can be both winners, and losers, only in the short term, for such is the nature of sustainable globalization that, in the long term, there can only be all winners and no losers! To conclude, therefore, if we earn and share, we prosper together, and if we don’t, we perish together!! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 András Simor: Anchor 2013 Speech by Mr András Simor, Governor of Magyar Nemzeti Bank (the central bank of Hungary), at the Anchor 2013 Conference, Budapest, 7 December 2012. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  Two statements, three proposals: these will be the main points of my speech today. Let me begin with the first statement.  First statement: Predictability and stability are required for growth  Let us try to imagine that Hungary is a successful country once again. Admittedly, this is no easy feat as we enter the fifth year of the crisis. Still, let us toy with the idea. What does success mean in economic terms? It means at least three things. If you want to work, you can find a job. Your income increases. And last but not least, you need not worry about inflation, or your savings losing their value. In other words, success also requires price stability. Every country that we can consider as a model has price stability. Even where inflation is not on target at present, monetary policy has managed to create a persistently low inflationary environment, which ensures that the expectations of economic agents are well anchored.  Price stability is not the luxury of rich countries, it is a prerequisite for growth. Price stability is an indispensable component of a predictable economic environment where it is worth investing and creating jobs. When prices are stable, the highest rate of economic growth can be reached over the longer term, not only in developed countries but also in emerging ones.  However, in addition to price stability, growth also requires predictability in terms of laws, regulations, taxes, that is, the predictability and stability of the entire regulatory environment for businesses.  Second statement: Hungary has a severe growth problem, which cannot be remedied by fiscal and monetary stimulus. What is more, the recovery from the debt trap is hindered not only by the adverse international environment, but also by a complex crisis of confidence.  Hungary’s potential growth already slowed down before the crisis, and the process of catching-up with the euro area halted close to a decade ago. Before the crisis, analysts mostly blamed the problem on the long-term unsustainability of the budget and the disincentives prevalent in the labour market. The tax wedge, which was excessively high compared with other countries of the region, the welfare benefits system, which was too generous for our level of development, and tax evasion due to the high tax rates all contributed to undermining Hungary’s growth potential.  We have made significant progress towards a sustainable growth path since the outbreak of the crisis. The previous government already started to remedy the country’s structural problems. The government currently in office also has as its priority removing the obstacles to improved economic performance, focusing on improving labour market incentives. We have made considerable achievements. The fiscal deficit has fallen to around 3% despite the crisis; banks have stopped lending in foreign currency; the country’s current account has been in surplus for years. And external debt has also been declining gradually, albeit slowly.  Although the adjustment has required huge sacrifices, we have not reached the end of the road. We have not been able to place the economy on a balanced growth path, we have not become an attractive target for investments, we have been declining in the international competitiveness ranks, our credit rating is worse than it has been ever since the political transition and we have remained at the bottom of the regional league in terms of growth.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches It is difficult to escape from this situation, because the unpredictability of future economic developments renders rational calculation nearly impossible. If we consider the future to be uncertain, we postpone major decisions with long-term effects until the fog lifts. This response, which is rational for the individual, leads to subdued consumption, postponed investments and jobs not created at the macroeconomic level. Without growth, debt reduction becomes an uphill struggle.  Today, the international and domestic uncertainties reinforce each other; we are living through a highly complex crisis of confidence.  In respect of the global economy, there is no proven recipe for stimulating the recovery of developed countries as they run out of ammunition for fiscal and monetary stabilisation and struggle with high debt.  In the past, the recovery of countries hit by debt crises typically occurred along an export-driven growth path, which was supported by a favourable international economic climate. In the current crisis, we have not been given such a forward escape route, due to the adverse external environment. Consequently, the time required for debt reduction is even more uncertain, along with the growth rate that the Hungarian economy can produce during that time.  Our future therefore is highly dependent on factors beyond our control. But we have to realise that small, open economies do not have any other option. At the same time, external market conditions are regularly turning out to be worse than expected, and this continuously increases the extent of adjustment expected from us. It is hardly surprising that weariness with this struggle creates an intense demand for, let us say, novel economic policy proposals which promise to painlessly set the economy on a growth path. However, ideas that do not pass the test of economic rationality are of no help. Indeed, they may actually make things worse by adding to the confusion. I am convinced that the only way to overcome the crisis is to do our utmost to reduce uncertainty, at least in the areas under our control and to create a predictable institutional environment. In the words of James Madison, 4th President of the United States: “It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow.”  What are the potential building blocks of confidence and predictability?   Fiscal consolidation must be made credible, and public debt must be set on a sustainably declining path. At the same time, the predictability of the legal and regulatory environment must be ensured.   The operation of the financial intermediation system, which ensures the smooth operation of the economy, must be restored.   Price stability must be achieved.  There is no chronological or preference order in the implementation of these three tasks. If we are to create a predictable economic environment, they need to be performed simultaneously and in combination with each other, rather than at one another’s expense.  First task: Stabilisation of the fiscal outlook  The crisis put an end to the excessive fiscal spending that characterised Hungarian economic policy in the first half of the 2000s. The narrowing of cheap funding opportunities necessitated the stabilisation of long-term fiscal prospects.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 As a result of the adjustment measures adopted since 2006, the deficit has been reduced substantially, and several sub-systems of general government have undergone major structural changes. The systems for education, health care, welfare benefits and local governments have all been changed. These changes have led to an improvement in the balance in the short term, but their effects on fiscal sustainability will only be manifested in the longer term.  Since the onset of the crisis, fiscal tightening has faced strong headwinds. The fiscal room for manoeuvre of Hungarian governments has been continuously diminishing, and easy-to-play cards have become scarce. After the initial programmes based on expenditure cuts with significant immediate debt-reducing effects, revenue-increasing measures came to the fore. So, overall, tax centralisation has not been reduced, what happens is that some are paying less tax and others are paying more.  Furthermore, the improvement in the budget balance was not accompanied by greater long-term sustainability and the stabilisation of the economic policy outlook. As a result of the pressure from short-term deficit targets and excessive government optimism relating to the future, a number of temporary measures severely distorting economic activity have been implemented, postponing the reinforcement of a sustainable fiscal structure to a later date.  Another equally important problem is that the frequent changes in the regulatory environment and the windfall taxes have rendered all commercial calculations concerning the future uncertain, leading to a predictability chaos. It is hardly surprising that the fiscal easing financed from the nationalisation of pension funds did not yield the results hoped for. The deterioration in business prospects and, consequently, the postponement of investment plans was aggravated particularly by the measures affecting the banking system, which severely undermined the competitiveness of Hungarian financial institutions and the chances of banks in competing with their regional peers for the funds of their parent institutions. In turn, postponed investment plans and an unemployment rate stuck at a persistently high level have impaired the growth potential of the economy, and debt servicing has become an ever greater burden in a weak economy.  Thus today, despite the numerous painful measures and the few structural reforms which were actually implemented, we cannot claim to have anchored expectations relating to long-term fiscal developments. This is also supported by the fact that so far we have only managed to reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio by nationalising private pension fund assets, rather than by improving our economic performance.  Fiscal consolidation cannot be successful unless it creates a predictable environment and thereby promotes long-term growth. Instead of improvised temporary measures, government decisions should focus on gradual consolidation to set out a longer-term path. Improving the potential for growth hinges on the abolishment of the tax regime distorting investment and saving decisions, as well as on the creation of a regulatory environment which strengthens competition, creates a level playing field for competitors, restores legal certainty and assures legal guarantees.  Second task: Stop the decline in lending  The smooth operation of the financial intermediary system is indispensable for economic growth. Through the efficient allocation of savings and lending, the banking system maintains the circulatory system of the economy in good health. Currently, the Hungarian banking system fulfils this role only with severe limitations. Lending has been contracting continuously since the start of the crisis, and we are in the rear guard in the region in this respect as well.  In addition to the obvious decline in demand for credit, there are signs indicating that banks are also reluctant to lend or will only do so at a higher price and only to premium clients. Primarily, this is not due to tight liquidity or insufficient capital levels. The problem is that the ability of borrowers to repay their debts has worsened dramatically due to the deteriorating 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches economic outlook. The marketability and value of collateral behind the defaulted portfolio is uncertain; the series of regulations and taxes introduced unexpectedly and without consultation undermines the best of business plans, and the government unpredictably but systematically takes away part of the income earned by the banks through the bank levy, the financial transaction tax or other means.  Unfortunately, given the impossibility of business planning and the highly uncertain profitability, it is a natural reaction if foreign shareholders decide to gradually downsize their operations in Hungary.  The retreat of parent banks may last for years. Make no mistake: owners may implement substantial capital increases where necessary, but they are not doing this to enhance the lending capacity of their subsidiaries. In this period, withdrawals of deposits by parent banks are several times higher than the amount of capital injections, which indicates that owners do not consider operations in Hungary to be a profitable business. In other words, the additional capital is needed only to maintain the stability of the system so that the downscaling or potential winding-down of operations can be conducted in an organised manner, without any major disturbances.  Furthermore, the reduced credit supply deepens the recession, which in turn increases the probability of corporate bankruptcies. The recession also erodes public revenues, and therefore the government seeks new revenue sources and finds some of them in the banking system which is already hit by its deteriorating loan portfolio. Thus, the government’s policy exacerbates the recession by causing an even deeper decline in lending and investment. However, the price of this economic policy is eventually paid by us all, through unrealised job opportunities and falling income levels.  The behaviour and expectations of the government, banks, businesses and households all have an influence on one another. Still, there is only one participant that is sufficiently large and has the coordination potential to break the negative spiral: the government itself. Individual banks by themselves are unable to do this; even if any of them started lending, it would have no noticeable effect at the macroeconomic level. The government, on the other hand, might be able to provide incentives to the banking sector to boost lending by reducing and stabilising the burdens on the banking system and making the regulatory environment more predictable, which could eventually place the system onto an equilibrium path. Consequently, a “compromise” is called for between the government and banks, or else we cannot expect lasting growth to emerge. And the first move must be made by the stronger player by restoring the climate of trust.  And finally, the third task: the central bank must achieve price stability  Similarly to other public entities, pro-growth monetary policy also needs to play its part in creating a predictable environment with the lowest possible risk level for economic agents. The central bank can contribute to this most efficiently by achieving price stability. This is also a precondition for reducing long-term interest rates and avoiding excessive exchange rate volatility.  What does a central bank need to do to create price stability? Over the past two decades, price stability has been achieved in almost all developed countries and a number of less developed ones. The experience of these countries shows that the most important element of success is the transparent and systematic operation of the central bank. Inflation expectations become anchored, that is, lasting price stability and monetary policy itself become credible, if the central bank clearly states its inflation target, and economic agents see that the central bank will act to curb any developments threatening to result in a persistent deviation from that target.  This conduct is greatly facilitated by a supportive fiscal policy. Expectations of exchange rate devaluation due to the increasing fiscal imbalance and the expected adjustment measures, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 unknown as yet in every detail, can unsettle inflation expectations despite the best efforts of the central bank, and thus offsetting inflationary shocks may cause an output loss. It is no accident that in most countries the adoption of inflation targeting coincided with the strengthening of fiscal discipline or the compliant nature of fiscal policy. In Hungary, ever since the introduction of inflation targeting in 2001, the central bank has unfortunately had to work against a headwind in its effort to achieve its statutory objective of price stability, against a backdrop of fiscal policy which fuelled inflation with various measures, under each government, without exception. This has had a grave effect on the effectiveness of our work.  Globally, inflation targeting passed the test of the crisis with flying colours  Positive experiences contributed to the decision of several countries to adopt inflation targeting during the crisis, and the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve also decided to introduce explicit inflation targets. Thus, the operation of the central banks in these developed countries came very close to the practices of inflation targeting countries.  The lessons learned during the crisis underlined the importance of anchoring inflation expectations and creating price stability. On the other hand, the crisis refined and expanded thinking about the mandates of monetary policy. In addition to traditional tools, the central bank can contribute to economic stability by macroprudential regulation affecting the systemic behaviour of banks during periods of expansion, by providing liquidity and supporting inadequately functioning market segments or by using other unconventional instruments in times of economic downturn.  The macroprudential and monetary policy functions coexist peacefully. Macroprudential instruments assist and promote monetary policy by restraining credit booms, real estate and exchange rate bubbles and overheating, while monetary policy keeps price stability in focus. The central bank’s work, supplemented by these new instruments, may become more efficient in stabilising economic fluctuations as well.  And what about Hungary?  Since 2001, the Central Bank Act has required the MNB to achieve and maintain price stability. That is when the elements of inflation targeting started to appear in monetary policy. However, delivering on the price stability mandate has been hindered by obstacles throughout most of the ensuing period. Prior to the spring of 2008, the central bank had to follow a dual objective of the inflation rate and the nominal exchange rate, and was only able to react to inflation developments within the constraints of the exchange rate band. The dual objective of the central bank and the frequent conflicts between these targets compromised the efficiency of monetary policy. The dual objective was abandoned in 2008; since then, the MNB has worked within the framework of an inflation targeting regime. It strives to stabilise inflation expectations at a level consistent with the 3% target.  2008 was the year when the crisis began, and since then the central bank has had to face exceptional challenges. In a period of extremely volatile capital flows, monetary policy has given priority to safeguarding the financing of the economy. Along with interest rate policy, the MNB has employed a number of unconventional instruments to restore the efficient operation of money markets as soon as possible. After the acute stage those risks abated, even though the high level of debt and the volatile risk environment continues to demand great care in the implementation of monetary policy. On the other hand, the decisions of the central bank may gradually return to normal, as inflation and growth prospects come into focus again.  What are the current dilemmas of monetary policy?  At the beginning of the crisis, we saw that the protracted recession upset all of the price and wage-setting routines that had led to the stubborn inflation of previous years. Disregarding 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches the effects of tax increases and commodity prices, Hungary has as low rate of inflation as its neighbours. Price stability, however, is not merely a question of the level of inflation today; rather, it depends on what economic agents think about future inflation. Even though demand continues to be subdued, we think that the disciplined price and wage-setting behaviour which the private sector has exhibited in the past two or three years is beginning to loosen up, and analysts’ longer-term inflation expectations have also risen. It is to be feared that – as a result of the repeated additional price rises due to a sequence of tax measures, rising commodity prices and soaring food prices – economic agents will consider an inflation rate considerably above the target to be normal. In such a situation, it is very difficult to assess the level at which inflation will settle when the extra price increase generated by the government no longer has an effect. The various answers to this question also contribute to the division in the Monetary Council. In my opinion, when inflation expectations, i.e. the longer-term inflation outlook, become uncertain, the central bank should act much more firmly to keep price and wage-setting behaviour disciplined.  Why is price stability important now?  Some think that – regardless of the answer to the question of whether the high inflation will “fall or stick” – the central bank must abandon its rigid stance and give priority to growth. This is a peculiar idea in a country where economic policy in the past two decades has always seen the solution in inflating away macroeconomic problems, without any tangible improvement in growth, I might add. Indeed, we had to learn the hard way that even though leniency on inflation may appear attractive in the short term, it has never produced any welfare gain. By contrast, our neighbours – who have created price stability with consistent and tight monetary policy and a supportive fiscal policy – are leaving us behind one after the other.  Despite these bitter experiences, some schools of economic thought still stubbornly insist that there is a trade-off between inflation and growth. Unfortunately, this is true only in one direction: overcoming inflation inertia may indeed demand substantial real economic sacrifice in a country accustomed to inflation, but no country has managed to produce any lasting growth surplus by letting inflation loose. Otherwise the countries of Europe and North America that maintain price stability would not be the wealthiest in the world and developing countries with a low inflation environment would not be the fastest in catching up. Because as soon as it becomes clear that the central bank wants to achieve higher growth by letting inflation loose, this is incorporated into the exchange rate, price and wage decisions, which in turn leads to higher interest rates in the market. Thus, monetary conditions are not effectively relaxed: we just end up in a situation that is much less predictable and much worse for growth. Consequently, monetary policy can stimulate growth only as long as it is certain not to jeopardise price stability.  International experience shows that inflation targeting is an appropriate framework – in my opinion the most appropriate one in the case of Hungary – for anchoring inflation expectations and achieving price stability. I hope that after so many dead ends and blind alleys, Hungarian economic policy will strengthen its commitment to macroeconomic stability. If fiscal policy is placed on predictable foundations, inflation targeting can be efficient in Hungary as well. The institutional framework is there.  The Hungarian economy is still characterised by deficit. Unlike in the previous period, today the primary problem is not the fiscal deficit, but rather a lack of confidence. The solution is not easy, but it is possible to find. If the lack of confidence can be addressed in the economy, fast, spectacular results would follow. To this end, we need to consult course books on economics, adapt the experiences of successful countries to the circumstances of Hungary, bring common sense back into economic policy, achieve a sustained reduction in government debt, boost the incentive for banks to lend and, ceterum censeo, deliver price stability.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Benoît Cœuré: Central banking, insurance and incentives Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the ECB conference: “Debt, growth and macroeconomic policies”, Frankfurt, 6 December 2012. *      *      * I wish to thank Florian Heider and Oreste Tristani for their contribution to this speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here with you tonight. The underlying theme of this conference is the aftermath of the financial crisis. Papers on the implications of debt overhang, on the interaction between private and public indebtedness and on the sovereign debt crisis feature prominently in the conference programme. The aftermath of the financial crisis, which I will focus on tonight, however, has to do with the changes in the nature of monetary policy operations. Central bank liquidity has increased dramatically over the past few years. “Unconventional” or “non-standard” measures have been deployed in all the main industrial countries. At the ECB, such measures have always aimed at improving the transmission of standard policy decisions, but they have assumed different forms over time. In the first phase of the crisis, they were mainly aimed at banks with the objective of preventing a collapse of the interbank market. As the financial crisis has evolved into a sovereign debt crisis, we have stepped up the size of our operations with banks, and we have also aimed at removing redenomination risk from government bond markets through the decision on Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). As a monetary policy-maker, I am convinced that these measures were necessary to prevent the financial crisis from having further adverse consequences on both the financial system and on the macro economy and therefore, ultimately, on medium term price stability. A freezing-up of the interbank market could have caused a credit crunch and a downward spiral in asset prices. The money supply would have shrunk. The ensuing collapse in aggregate demand would have put downward pressure on prices. A Great Depression scenario could have occurred. The same scenario could materialise at local level in case of fear that countries could leave the euro, and severely hamper our ability to deliver price-stability. Thanks to our non-standard measures, central bank liquidity has proved to be an effective insurance mechanism against the risk of an economic disaster.  Providing insurance can, however, generate perverse incentives. Knowledge of the existence of a safety net can encourage imprudent behaviour. Concern about this has been expressed in connection with our new OMT programme, under which we could purchase potentially unlimited amounts of sovereign bonds. By easing market pressure on governments, it is argued, ECB interventions could lead to a weakening of fiscal consolidation and reform efforts.  The focus of my remarks tonight is this trade-off between insurance and incentives. I am going to start from the general principle of committing to provide partial insurance, which arises from the literature on microeconomics. I will then illustrate how our OMT programme and also the parallel plans for a banking union can be interpreted in the light of this principle. 1. The basic principle: how to commit to partial insurance? The trade-off between insurance and incentives, or equivalently, between ex post efficiency and ex ante efficiency is a recurrent theme in microeconomics.1 I will argue that this trade-off is a useful framework for thinking about the challenges we face in the euro area. It is a widely studied topic, so we have been able to draw on and adapt existing insights when addressing those challenges. Why is there a trade-off? Why is ex post efficiency not the same as ex ante efficiency? The reason is that we all react to the circumstances in which we operate. If circumstances change, so does our behaviour. Thus, policies that ensure ex post efficiency are not necessarily efficient ex ante, because people react to those policies by altering their own behaviour. Ex post and ex ante efficiency generally do not overlap.                                                 1  As so often in economics, the theme can be traced back all the way to Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” in 1776. He describes how tenants underinvest in the land they do not own. Around the same time, in 1740, a version of the free-rider problem (a closely related incentive problem) appears in David Hume’s “Treatise of Human Nature” (see J.-J. Laffont and D. Martimort, “The Theory of Incentives”, Princeton University Press, 2002). 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Allow me for a moment to be somewhat schoolmasterly and use the example of car insurance to illustrate the basic trade-off.2 Car insurance is obviously desirable ex post, since it is not optimal for people to bear the consequences of a car accident by themselves. We are all more or less risk averse and feel much better when we have such car insurance. Without it, some of us would stop driving altogether if we had to fully pay for the consequences of an accident. Insurance improves ex post efficiency. Mark Twain is credited with saying that: “A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain”. He describes a world that is not ex-post efficient. Let’s now take an ex ante perspective. Carrying an umbrella does not encourage rain, but why drive carefully if we never bear the negative consequences of careless driving? Insurance may well encourage imprudent driving. In other words, insurance hurts incentives, that is, it reduces ex ante efficiency.  The way to manage the trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency is through partial insurance. We are usually not fully insured against car accidents. There is a deductible, a sum that we have to pay out of our own pocket if we file an insurance claim – in finance speak: we bear the “first loss”. Moreover, our insurance depends on the car we drive, our past record of insurance claims and also on whether it can be shown that we were negligent or not. In other words, insurance companies worry about the behaviour that insurance induces. The trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency is apparent from the fact that if the deductible is too high, it may discourage insurance and therefore driving altogether. If, on the other hand, the deductible is too low, then drivers may become imprudent again. The same trade-off can be found in other policy domains – say, for example health care co-payments –, and, as I will argue next, in the relationship between outside investors and inside users of funds. 2. The case of sovereign debt: insurance and incentives To some extent, a borrower’s income and hence his ability to repay debt is subject to forces outside his control. A bank, for example, cannot perfectly control its cash flow, which depends on what its competitors do and on general economic conditions, among other factors. Similarly, a country cannot perfectly control the business cycle; its income also depends on worldwide conditions that matter for its imports and exports. At any moment in time, there can be mismatch between a borrower’s income and his expenditures. Without access to capital markets, without the ability to borrow, banks would have to cut lending and countries would have to limit the provision of services once their income dropped. The ability to borrow therefore insures against shocks to income and ensures the smooth functioning of an economy. Access to capital markets improves ex post efficiency. But like car insurers, investors in capital markets worry about perverse incentives. Not so much about imprudent driving, but about some other forms of imprudence. A borrower’s income is not only subject to exogenous shocks. It is also the outcome of his decisions. Investors therefore worry that providing full insurance against the risk of income fluctuations can lead to irresponsible – for example, short-term-oriented – investment or policy decisions.3 When financing sovereigns, an additional and somewhat more fundamental problem arises: the so-called willingness to pay. Governments cannot be forced or be contractually obliged to repay their debt. Investors have to rely on the willingness of governments to make repayments, or else stop lending.4] It is precisely this threat of the loss of access to capital markets that is analogous to the deductible in car insurance. It is a form of partial insurance that provides incentives for governments to undertake good policy and to repay. While a loss of access means less insurance against income shocks and hence less ex post efficiency, it improves ex ante efficiency. The trade-off between ex ante and ex post efficiency automatically leads to a commitment problem. Let me go back to the example of car insurance. Providing only partial insurance, an insurance company expects drivers not to be imprudent so that accidents are indeed the result of bad luck. But once an accident has occurred, the insurance company could conceivably ignore the original contract and fully reimburse any claim. After all, the                                                 2  Indeed, the trade-off between ex-ante and ex-post efficiency first appeared in modern economics in the context of “moral hazard” in insurance markets (see for example M. Spence and R. Zeckhauser, “Insurance Information, and Individual Action,” American Economic Review, 1971). 3  The incentive problem started to appear in (corporate) finance with M. Jensen and W. Meckling, “The Theory of the Firm, Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure,” Journal of Financial Economics, 1976; S. Myers, “Determinants of Corporate Borrowing,” Journal of Financial Economics, 1977; and J. Stiglitz and A. Weiss, “Credit Rationing in Markets with Imperfect Information,” American Economic Review, 1981. 4  The “contract-theoretic” approach to sovereign debt was pioneered by J. Bulow and K.

Anticipating this “renegotiation” and expecting full insurance after all, drivers have an incentive to become imprudent again.5 In practice, this is not a real problem for car insurance since insurance companies can credibly commit to sticking to the original contract But what about sovereign debt? Would investors gain by nevertheless refinancing a government with a low probability to repay? Or should they stick to shutting the country out of the market since they know that this improves incentives? Past experience shows that sovereign debt has often been renegotiated as governments and investors find it difficult to commit to a given course of future actions. As this hurts ex ante efficiency and thus leads to a higher cost of borrowing for governments, there have been a number of developments to make sovereign debt more “renegotiation-proof.” Just to give a couple of examples: Bonds started to replace loans in the market for sovereign debt. Bonds, which are more widely held and easily tradable, make sovereign debt more difficult to renegotiate as the number of investors involved increases. Another development is the shortening of the maturity of credit in order to exercise the control right (of not refinancing) more often.  While these trends provide better incentives, they hurt insurance – maybe even excessively so. It may become excessively difficult to re-organise sovereign debt and to adapt to new circumstances. One possibility to counter the trend is to have collective action clauses (CACs). They offer the possibility of easier renegotiation by lowering the threshold for the number of bond-holders to agree to a debt restructuring. Indeed, as of January 1st 2013, all new bonds issued by euro area governments will contain such clauses.6  Private markets with their various self-interests may, however, find it difficult to achieve a trade-off between incentives and insurance that is optimal for everyone. In fact, markets can worry so much about incentives that they stop providing insurance altogether – in this case markets can freeze-up. And indeed, we have experienced numerous quasi-market freeze-ups in various segments of the interbank, credit and sovereign debt markets. When this happens, it is time for the public sector to step in.7 But striking the right balance between insurance and incentives is also a problem for public authorities. Full insurance produces perverse incentives irrespective of whether it is provided by a private or a public institution. One prominent example in the case of sovereign debt crises is the involvement of the IMF. In return for the insurance it provides by lending to countries in difficulty, the IMF usually receives far-reaching control rights to maintain or re-establish a country’s incentive for solid public finances. Without such far-reaching rights, interventions must take other forms to provide partial insurance. Financial assistance through the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) during the sovereign bond crisis in the euro area has also drawn on the experience of the IMF – partly thanks to the involvement of the IMF itself. At the ECB we had the insurance-versus-incentives trade-off in mind when designing our new OMT programme and in our support of a banking union. Before moving to the OMT and the banking union as topical and recent examples of the trade-off between ex-ante and ex-post efficiency, let me point out that while this trade-off is particularly stark in crises times, it is very much at the heart of central banking in general. After all, the trade-off is inherent to liquidity provision. Banking, by making long-term loans and financing them with deposits and other short-term debt, is inherently fragile. Maturity transformation exposes banks to liquidity risk.8 The classic postulate of Bagehot, for a central bank to be a lender                                                 5  There is by now a vast literation on the issue of whether and under what circumstances contracts can and will be renegotiated (for an early contribution see D. Fudenberg and J. Tirole, “Moral-Hazard and Renegotiation in Agency Contracts,” Econometrica, 1990). 6  For an extensive analysis of these complex issues, see P. Bolton and O. Jeanne, “Structuring and Restructuring Sovereign Debt: The Role of Seniority”, Review of Economic Studies, 2009; and P. Bolton and O. Jeanne, “Structuring and Restructuring Sovereign Debt: The Role of a Bankruptcy Regime”, Journal of Political Economy, 2007, and the references therein. A closely related debate is whether default is costly or not for sovereigns in the long term (see for example E. Borenzstein and U. Panizza, “The Cost of Sovereign Default,” IMF Working Paper 08/238; and M. Aguiar and G. Gopinath, “Defaultable Debt, Interest Rates and the Current Account,” Journal of International Economics, 2006). 7  The case for public intervention when markets collapse has been made in the light of the recent financial crisis in P. Bolton, T. Santos and J. Scheinkman, “Outside and Inside Liquidity,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2011; F. Heider, M. Hoerova and C. Holthausen, “Liquidity Hoarding and Interbank Market Spreads: The Role of Counterparty Risk,” European Central Bank Working Paper 1126, 2009. For public intervention in form of asset purchases, see J. Tirole, “Overcoming Adverse Selection: How Public Intervention Can Restore Market Functioning,” American Economic Review, 2012; and T. Philippon and V. Skreta, “Efficient Interventions in Markets with Adverse Selection,” American Economic Review, 2012. 8  See D. Diamond and P. Dybvig, “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity”, Journal of Political Economy, 1983. In fact, it is optimal for ex-ante efficiency to expose banks to liquidity risk, see C. Calomiris and C. Kahn, “The Role of Demandable Debt in Structuring Optimal Banking Arrangements,” American Economic Review, 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  of last resort, but to perform that function at a penalty rate, illustrates both the need for (liquidity) insurance and the need to safeguard incentives. In the words of Bagehot: “If the banks are bad, they will certainly continue bad and will probably become worse if the Government sustains and encourages them.”9 The art of central banking is the art of balancing ex-ante and ex-post efficiency. 3. OMTs and committing to partial insurance The purpose of the OMTs is to establish a backstop in the event of negative self-fulfilling market dynamics. We designed this new programme with features that are in line with an efficient trade-off between insurance and incentives. The first feature is to provide effective insurance against redenomination risk. Under certain conditions, the ECB stands ready to intervene with amounts commensurate with this objective. In other words, the scope for OMT interventions in government bonds markets is ex ante unlimited. This feature has been correctly interpreted as a commitment. After three months, we can say that it has highlighted the value of commitment. In many countries, sovereign yield spreads edged down when the programme was announced. Currently, yields stand at the lowest levels since the beginning of the crisis.  The second feature of OMTs is that the insurance is partial. The objectives of the programme are clearly delimited. The ECB will only buy bonds with shorter remaining maturities. The ECB does not aim to eliminate all spreads between sovereign bond issuers, because sovereign yields don’t have to be identical in a monetary union, and market discipline has a role to play. Nor is the ECB willing to purchase any amount of sovereign bonds necessary to balance governments’ inter temporal budget constraints. OMTs will remain consistent with a regime of “monetary dominance”,10 in which governments retain the responsibility of balancing their budgets over the medium term and the ECB remains free to set interest rate so as to ensure the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.  The final feature of OMTs has to do with setting the right incentives for governments. To qualify for interventions, countries must have negotiated with the other euro area governments a precautionary European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme with strict and effective conditionality. Conditionality serves to ensure that governments continue to correct existing economic and fiscal weaknesses when OMTs are activated. At the same time, OMT purchases will not take place while a country programme is under review. The ECB’s actions complement, but do not replace, economic and fiscal reform. Incentives also help explain why interventions will focus on shorter-term debt. Purchases of sovereign bonds will be suspended, should a country fail to comply with its conditionality requirements. Relying on short-term debt strengthens the disciplining power of the right to stop our interventions at any point in time. In short, OMTs strike the right balance between ex-ante and ex-post efficiency, and they are fully compliant with the ECB mandate. 4. A banking union and committing to partial insurance The OMTs can, however, only be part of a larger package to solve the European debt crisis, in which not only sovereigns but also banks have come under stress. In fact, both banks and sovereigns have been caught in a negative feedback loop, with the problems of one feeding on those of the other. To break out of this loop, elements of a banking union are currently being discussed. These elements need to be considered together and seen in the light of the trade-off between insurance and incentives. The first element of the banking reform is the creation of a single supervisory mechanism involving the ECB. Besides the obvious coordination and information benefits for supervising banking in a financially integrated area, and given the risk of regulatory capture when the supervisor and the supervised are too close to each other, partially transferring supervisory authority up one level can be seen as a commitment not to renegotiate. It limits regulatory forbearance (a form of insurance) and serves as an incentive for sound risk management in the banking sector. It also ensures the singleness of banks’ liabilities in the euro area, congruent with the single monetary policy. Within the ECB, there should be a strict separation between the single supervisory mechanism and monetary policy, as a way to safeguard incentives when liquidity is extended. To quote Bagehot once again: “any aid to a present bad Bank is the surest mode of preventing the establishment of a future good Bank.”11                                                                                                                                                    1991; and D. Diamond and R. Rajan, “Liquidity Risk, Liquidity Creation, and Financial Fragility: A Theory of Banking,” Journal of Political Economy, 2001. 9  See W. Bagehot (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, Henry S. King and Co. 10  See T. Sargent and N. Wallace, “Some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review, Fall 1981, pp. 1–17. 11  See W. Bagehot (1873), op. cit. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Once incentives are upheld, it is possible and desirable to provide insurance. Incentive-compatible insurance must, however, be partial. And that is why it is important to add other elements to complement the single supervisory mechanism. One such element is a European resolution mechanism. Since a bank’s debt should not be insured in full, it should, and in fact will, be possible for banks to fail. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in August 2007, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) lists 466 cases in which banks in the United States failed.12  Given the special role of banks as intermediaries, the failure of one bank can have adverse effects on the rest of the financial system. Hence, it must be possible to organise an orderly failure. Otherwise, failure is no longer credible and incentives for solid risk management are undermined. To achieve an orderly resolution of financial institutions, especially systemic ones, we need a common resolution regime. The existing legislative proposal for a Recovery and Resolution Directive aims at orderly bank resolution, including early interventions, bailing-in and bridge financing. A further important element of a credible and efficient resolution mechanism would be a common European Resolution Fund. The Recovery and Resolution Directive, together with the European Resolution Fund being financed by contributions from the industry, would ensure incentive-compatibility. Similarly, the possibility to allow direct bank recapitalisations trough the ESM can be an illustration of incentive-compatible insurance, provided that it is implemented once a single supervisory mechanism is established, and that any such recapitalisation is preceded by a burden-sharing exercise where shareholders and national taxpayers bear the first losses. Let me conclude.  The euro area is going through a serious crisis. For all European policy-makers, the crisis is a formidable challenge, but also an opportunity to learn from past mistakes and to improve the EMU architecture. I believe that a number of decisive steps have been taken in recent months.  In designing such steps, the interplay of many different factors must be borne in mind. I have emphasised tonight that we cannot design insurance and forget about its impact on incentives. When dealing with such complex issues, we have an unquenchable thirst for guidance from economic research. Many of you in the academic community have written extensively on the potential consequences of our policy decisions. Rest assured: we closely follow your work. We may sometimes disagree with your conclusions, but you will always help us to focus our thoughts. I wish you a productive day at the conference tomorrow.                                                 12  See: http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html (accessed on December 5th, 2012). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Financial capability as a 21st century life skill Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank of the Philippines), at the Citi-FT Financial Education Summit, Makati City, 5 December 2012. *      *      * Mr. Michael Zink, Head of ASEAN and Singapore Citi Country Officer; Mr. Sanjiv Vohra, Citi Country Officer for the Philippines; Secretary Imelda Nicolas, Chairperson, Commission on Filipino Overseas; Ms. Brandee McHale, Chief Operating Officer, Citi Foundation; Mr. David Pilling, Financial Times Asia Editor; Ms. Kathy Hurley, Executive Vice President, Education Alliances, Pearson Foundation; distinguished resource persons; experts and practitioners in financial education; friends who have traveled from other countries; my colleagues in the BSP; ladies and gentlemen, good morning everyone!  Finally, this annual financial education summit is in the Philippines. Now on its 9th year, it continues to enjoy such high level of interest and support for its relevance to the times. Congratulate and thank Citi and FT and the other sponsors and organizers of this gathering. For starters, its forum theme “Financial Capability as a 21st Century Life Skill” … is an outright declaration that financial capability is a must-have-skill. I agree with this statement. Indeed, the ability to make sound financial choices and decisions is essential… to ensure one’s financial well-being. And yet, most people are sorely lacking in this necessary skill. The summit’s keynote session pushes the envelope further: it raises the social, economic and moral imperatives of bridging the financial capability gap. Discussions are also bound to be thought-provoking on the topic “The Ultimate Financial Education Challenges – Impact, Scale and Sustainability.” Ladies and gentlemen. The organizers of this summit have brought together world-class finance education experts and advocates to tackle these important issues. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is therefore pleased that it is a host partner in this Financial Education Summit.  For your information, the BSP was also co-host... in the last two days... of the Asia and the Pacific Regional Meeting on Child and Youth Finance organized by the Child and Youth Finance, International.  And three months ago, the BSP co-hosted with the OECD in Cebu the Asian Seminar on Financial Literacy and Inclusion.  It must be obvious, financial education is important to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Both Mr. Zink and Mr. Pilling have given us a useful and comprehensive background on the objectives, issues, efforts being made towards expanding financial education and inclusion. I would like to tell you about our experience at the BSP. The vision of the BSP as the country’s monetary authority and supervisor of the banking system is to be a catalyst for a globally competitive economy and a financial system that delivers a high quality of life for all Filipinos. While financial education may not immediately be considered a core function of a monetary authority or a supervisor of the banking system, it is actually quite intrinsically linked to our overarching goal and vision. To us, financial education empowers people to manage their resources with prudence, instills the discipline of saving regularly, and safely grow their money. Thus, we believe that financial education empowers the citizenry to become effective partners of the BSP as productive economic agents and improves people’s lives. With the importance we attach to financial education, the Bangko Sentral is implementing a nationwide economic and financial learning program. We follow a multi-dimensional strategy 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  covering 1) the learning sector... including schools, public and private sector research work, and 2) the transacting public.  For the “learning” sector, we created Economic and Financial Learning Centers at our head office, three regional offices and 18 branches across the country. These are our primary in-house communication channels and the public’s focal point of contact in the BSP on information concerning economic and financial matters. The BSP also conducts outreach activities, such as targeted seminars and expos to promote greater awareness and understanding of essential economic and financial issues. For the transacting public, the BSP created the Financial Consumers Affairs Group (FCAG), a unit dedicated to assisting consumers who have concerns related to banking and financial services. We have also forged partnerships to broaden and deepen our reach.  Among others, we are in partnership with the Department of Education for the integration of lessons on saving and money management into the elementary education curriculum of our 14 million elementary pupils.  Parallel to this, we forged partnerships with the Bank Marketing Association of the Philippines for the development of affordable child-friendly bank products including savings account with a minimum opening balance of P100 or less than US$3.00.  We have also partnered with international organizations to help us benchmark our practices, share our learnings and exchange ideas. These include:  1)  the International Network for Finance Education (INFE) created by OECD to promote and facilitate international cooperation on global financial education issues; and 2)  the Group of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), which counts as members policy makers and regulators in the developing world who are committed to financial inclusion. Ladies and gentlemen. In scaling up its activities for consumer protection, the BSP is also intensifying its information campaign to ensure that intended benefits actually accrue to financial consumers.  For instance, we have been working on enhancing transparency in credit transactions to make sure people are not overcharged with “flat” interest rates and similar misleading methods. To ensure proper and immediate dissemination of such consumer protection measures, no less than our deputy governors explain the issues through mass media, including radio.  This may not mean much to some, but for tricycle drivers, for instance, who pay their motorcycles on installment, .... the right to demand correct pricing translates to higher income for him and his family.  It is not enough therefore to craft responsive policies. We need to communicate and educate the people on what these means for them. On the other hand, we also need our people to be responsible and vigilant in protecting their rights.  Indeed, financial capability is a life skill that can lead to a better life.  I wish all of you therefore a fruitful and successful financial education summit.  Thank you and Mabuhay!   
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Ardian Fullani: 100 years of independence – our history reflected in the national currency Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Opening of the Exhibition “100 years of independence – our history reflected in the national currency”, Vlora, 16 November 2012. *      *      * Dear Mayor, Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here today in Vlora on the occasion of the opening of the Exhibition “100 Years of Independence: Our History Reflected in the National Currency”. It is extraordinary that we are only a few days away from the celebration of Albania’s 100th anniversary of independence.  In the capacity of the institution responsible for issuing the currency in Albania, the Bank of Albania considers that it is its duty to inform the public at large about Albania’s monetary history. The exhibition we are opening today is a contribution in this respect. It presents the journey of currency in Albania from the declaration of independence to this day. It features a vast collection of artefacts of the Albanian state monetary history. It has great material and cultural value as many of these objects are unique and date back to prior the issue of our national currency by the Bank of Albania.  By touring a number of cities in Albania, such as Berat, Gjirokastra, Korça, Shkodra and Tirana, and making a stop in the city where Albania’s independence was declared, we are walking along the same path as our national currency – the lek. We aim to draw the public’s attention to the fact that the state formation process and our modern history are not only about political and military events, or about biographies of people and institutions, but they are also closely linked to the history of our national currency.  As soon as you enter this exhibition, you can immediately feel how the history of the Albanian currency has walked hand in hand with our nation’s history and its major historical figures. They are so closely linked that when you hold a coin or banknote in your hand, the historical period during which it has been minted, printed and used, flashes in front of you just like in a photo. The currency, along with the language, constitute an inseparable part of our national identity and cultural heritage. By unfolding in its images people, events and the most important values of our history, the currency has contributed to strengthening the feeling of national identity in the Albanian people.  By acting as a common medium of social interaction, the currency has also played an irreplaceable role in creating a national tradition and memory, strengthening in turn the sense of belonging to the Albanian nation and the sharing of a common destiny. All these have contributed to strengthening national sovereignty, particularly when the currency is managed in a stable way. William Camden, a British historian in the late 16th century, considered money as the fifth element after air, fire, earth and water. The universal character of money has captured the interest of numerous generations of philosophers and has stimulated human imagination in different kinds of ways. Money is not only an economic act but also a political one. It establishes the boundaries, contributes to consolidating a country’s identity and may lead to conflicts and wars. But despite all, having a good will, money may precede peace and stability of one or more countries. As also stated by Helmut Kohl, former Chancellor of Germany, “the real flag of the Federal Republic of Germany is the Deutsch Mark”.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  If you had lived in Albania in the period when its independence was declared, your money would have mainly consisted in French gold francs – what we still refer to as “Napoleons” to this day – and Austrian silver coronas. Being citizens of a coastal city, you would have probably used Italian liras and copper coins for your small purchases. During World War I, the main forms of money were not only gold and silver coins, but also local banknotes – for instance, banknotes issued by the autonomous region of Korça.  Nowadays, in addition to the currency issued by the Bank of Albania, we also use cheques and means of electronic payments. Hence, although money has taken many forms through different times, it has always been very important to the people and the economy. It has been so important that even to this day, people still continue to keep and collect coins, banknotes, cheques or notes of past times – which today have no economic value – as a sign of their trust in money. The project for an Albanian national currency was part of the general modernizing policy implemented by Ismail Bej Vlora in the newly-established Albanian state.  According to him, the sooner Albania strengthened its economic freedom, the better it could preserve the newly-gained political freedom, hence turning into a prosperous country. The father of independence considered the establishment of a central bank as crucial to Albania’s economic development, in line with the models provided by foreign banks, and particularly the Bank of England, which at the time was the centre of the global financial system. As Ismail Bey Vlora noted “... Let me say with admiration that the work of the Bank of Albania is, both economically and politically, a second victory for Albania, after that of independence”. Despite being established as a privately-held institution, the Bank’s activity would not be oriented towards generating profit or other commercial interests. It would rather orient towards providing public goods, such as issuing the currency and acting as banker to the government, banks and other financial intermediation agents in Albania. Despite the numerous efforts, gaining independence did not bring the establishment of a national monetary system and Albania continued to be one of the few countries still having a gold-based coin circulation system.  The establishment of the central bank was vital to inspire the Albanian public trust, by encouraging investment of savings in shares and bank deposits, hence turning the bank into an engine of the lending system in Albania. If we look back in the past, we can see how much the Albanian currency has evolved. From the declaration of independence – when gold and silver were considered to be the only real forms of money – we come to the present with the Bank of Albania projecting to put electronic money into circulation.  Unlike precious metals, which hold their value over the centuries, a currency’s value is equal to public’s trust in the stability of the economy and in the central bank putting it into circulation. It is this public trust that guarantees the stability of the currency and enables the development of a modern monetary system. The latter is the product of a long period of practical experience and a large number of economic studies suggesting that the central bank, through its monetary policy, contributes to improving the economic perspective and people’s living standards by preventing prolonged periods of inflation and deflation. In addition, price stability contributes to increasing economic activity and employment; hence promoting economic welfare. Firms and consumers make informed decisions about consumption and investment; the market allocates the resources more effectively; productive potential and incentives to invest in the economy increase; while the redistribution of welfare and income improves, hence contributing to strengthening social cohesion.  In order to facilitate monetary policy implementation and efficiency in the economy, the Bank of Albania pays great attention to encouraging economic and financial education in Albania. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  We believe that broadening the basic knowledge on economic environment improves people’s ability to process the necessary information and make right economic decisions.  In addition to providing the public a more effective participation in the society, economic and financial education contributes to ensuring public support for the policies the Bank of Albania implements. In carrying out this mission, our compass remains oriented towards Europe and the incessant progress towards economic and legal convergence with the EU. Our activity will continue to focus on strengthening the Bank of Albania’s independence as key precondition for safeguarding monetary and financial stability. The common European currency has itself turned into the basic anchor of the EU.  The best way the Bank of Albania can fulfil its mission to the public is for the latter to know and trust the national currency. A strong and sound currency will be an inseparable companion in our journey towards Brussels and Frankfurt. Dear Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I hope you will enjoy the visit to the Bank of Albania’s exhibition we are opening today in “the city of flag”. On behalf of the Bank of Albania, it is my great pleasure to declare it open.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Njuguna Ndung’u: Development of efficient and cost effective payment systems in Kenya Address by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the “Emerging Payment Systems Technical Capacity Building Workshop 2012”, Kenya School of Monetary Studies, Nairobi, 14 November 2012. *      *      * Dr. Eliawony Kisanga; Executive Secretary; ESAAMLG; Ms. Maria C. Stephens; Senior Technical Adviser; USAID;  Representatives of USAID and US Treasury;  Representatives of Central Banks present; Distinguished Guests and Participants; Ladies and Gentlemen: Let me begin by extending a very warm welcome to all the workshop participants. To the participants who are drawn from beyond our borders, it is my sincere hope that your stay with us shall be enjoyable and that you will carry with you pleasant memories of Kenya when you return to your respective countries. Ladies and Gentlemen: This workshop is about the development of efficient and cost effective payment systems. The workshop will offer the pertinent issues of financial integrity which completes the architecture of financial inclusion. The importance of financial inclusion is now critically clear. Indeed, there has been mounting evidence that access to financial services is a tool to fight poverty sustainably. Access to affordable and sustainable financial services enables the poor to save and accumulate capital for investment. This is important for generating self- employment opportunities, smooth consumption, reduce vulnerability to economic shocks, raise productivity, obtain higher returns on investments and ultimately improve the quality of their lives. However, approximately 2.5 billion adults globally, representing over half of the world’s adult population, have no access to formal financial services to increase their incomes and improve their lives. Among them, 1.1 billion live on less than one dollar a day. These numbers are a representation of the great demand and need for increased access to income generating activities and to appropriate financial services for the large un-banked populace across the globe. This is particularly true of developing economies in Africa, Asia and Latin America where nearly 90% of the world’s unbanked adults reside. The expansion of financial inclusion has thus become a critical topic in development agendas for policy makers and regulators globally, with considerable energy and resources having been devoted towards its enhancement. The testament to this is the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) where non-G20 members participate. The Central Bank of Kenya, and indeed Kenya has been represented by the Governor. At this point therefore, allow me to underscore the importance of emerging payment systems to promoting financial inclusion agenda. Ladies and Gentlemen: The rapid growth of the mobile phone-based money transfer service in Kenya beginning with M-Pesa, in 2007 has been seen by many as having produced a tectonic shift in Kenya’s financial landscape with a great impact on financial inclusion. Indeed, the rapid adoption and use of mobile money transfer services by some 70% of the adult population has suggested that there is huge potential for the development of inclusive formal financial services through mobile phones. Equally complementing this was banks integration with it and also payments of goods functionality raising in acceptance and reception. Notably, the development of innovative and easy-to-use payment systems by financial institutions and other businesses such as mobile phone operators has helped to 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  support rapid growth in e- commerce, in many cases providing consumers with more effective, convenient, and secure ways to purchase an expanding variety of products. Ladies and Gentlemen: We all know that in the business world, the customer is King. In this regard, I wish to highlight at this point key issues that policy makers may need to address to strengthen consumer confidence in new and emerging payment systems and which may be categorized into five broad areas including: clarity, transparency and completeness in information disclosure; variability in regulatory and protection regimes; fraudulent, misleading and deceptive commercial practices; dispute resolution and redress and security and inter-operability. Ladies and Gentlemen: Any success in financial inclusion has to go hand in hand with financial integrity. In this regard, the Central Bank of Kenya has continuously sought to enhance the regulation and supervision of the financial system in order to improve its integrity. Indeed, as part of our efforts in ensuring appropriate and effective oversight, we first issued AML Guidelines in 2000. These Guidelines were later revised in 2006 and are currently in the process of being reviewed to reflect the prevailing international best practice and to align them with the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2009 (POCAMLA) as amended and the new Act on combating terrorism financing. It is true that over the last 2 years, the Central Bank has issued regular AML/CFT guidelines to financial institutions to further support and enhance the implementation of the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act (POCAMLA), 2009. The guidelines have covered the operationalization of the AML Act, Suspicious Transactions Reporting, and measures to be adopted by financial institutions to combat the financing of terrorism. The Central Bank has also revised the Forex Bureau Guidelines so as to align them with the AML Act and is currently sharing with stakeholders the Hawala guidelines. Ladies and Gentlemen: The creation of the Financial Reporting Centre early in the year and the passing of the Anti-Terrorism Law is a clear signal of the Kenya Government’s commitment in protecting the integrity of our country’s financial system. In fact I wish to inform you that following the creation of the FRC, all financial institutions in Kenya including banks, forex bureaus and mobile phone financial service providers will be required to report all suspicious transactions to the Financial Reporting Centre. I have expounded on these issues and updates whenever I represent Kenya in FATF evaluation meetings. That is why in the current standing, FATF has commended Kenya for its tremendous effort in AML/CFT Laws enactment and how we are on implementation. Ladies and Gentlemen: In conclusion, it is my hope, that this workshop will help enhance our technical capacity on emerging payment systems as we share our own country experiences on these systems. Let me also once again take this opportunity to assure all of you of the Central Bank’s continued commitment, collaboration and partnership in the development of robust and secure payment systems. But this is where capacity is urgently needed and support by USAID and the US Treasury arising from their experience is most welcome. Finally, it is a pleasure and honour to now declare the Emerging Payment Systems Technical Capacity Building Workshop officially open and wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Nils Bernstein: Challenges ahead for the Danish economy Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the annual meeting of the Danish Bankers Association, Copenhagen, 3 December 2012. *      *      * The sovereign debt crisis is still leaving its mark on the world economy, especially in the euro area. While the US economy seems to be in a moderate upswing, the euro area economy is shrinking. GDP growth has been negative in the last two quarters and the outlook for the 4th quarter is not bright. Even the German economy, which until recently had been less severely affected by the problems in Southern Europe, seems to be slowing down. The Swedish economy is holding its ground, but is also seeing lower growth. The international organisations all predict that the world economy will pick up only gradually in 2013, and growth estimates have generally been adjusted downwards, particularly for the euro area. Although the USA seems to be faring a little better, its unsustainable budget deficit presents serious challenges. So far, political disagreement between the President and Congress has stood in the way of finding an effective solution to the problem. The risk is that the financial markets at some point begin to respond, as seen in other highly indebted countries. The USA is unique in a number of respects, such as the size of the economy, but all the same, the economic fundamentals still apply. The development in the USA will have a knock-on effect on the rest of the world. In the summer of 2011, when the US debt ceiling was raised, a compromise was reached between the Democrats and Republicans, meaning that a number of summary budget reductions will be introduced at the turn of the year, and at the same time a number of tax cuts will expire. The potential tightening accounts for 4 per cent of GDP and, if effected, it will plunge the US economy into a recession. Negotiations to avoid this “fiscal cliff” are underway. It is scarcely possible to find a solution without addressing the long-term problems linked mainly to demographic change. The financial markets constantly reflect the changing prospects of reaching a compromise. In some of the most heavily indebted countries, unemployment has reached alarming levels. Public opinion often ascribes this to the consolidation of public finances. But actually, there is no real alternative to consolidation. Sustainable public finances are a condition for reducing the rate of interest on government debt to an acceptable level. Sovereign default is not an attractive alternative. And it will certainly not lower unemployment – on the contrary. The solution is the “long haul”, to coin a phrase. The problems were caused by the imprudent economic policies pursued by these countries in the 10–15 years leading up to the crisis. They cannot be solved overnight. Ireland is an example of how resolute action to address budget and competitiveness problems can shorten the path back to tolerable conditions. The ECB continues its efforts to contain the crisis. The Outright Monetary Transactions programme announced in September entails that the ECB may buy short-term government bonds from debt-ridden EU member states in the secondary market under certain conditions – for example that the EU member state accepts a programme to seriously address its structural problems. Following the announcement, 2-year yields immediately fell in e.g. Spain and Italy, while they rose in Germany. Activation of the programme requires an official request from the member state in question. Spain has been mentioned as a candidate. Turning to Greece, we hope that last week’s agreement between the euro area finance ministers can restore calm for a while. But the Greek debt will be a recurring theme for many years to come.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The Danish economy is well-balanced, but growth is on a slow track. The current-account surplus is large, and we hold considerable external assets. Inflation is moderate, and so is unemployment. In fact, if we disregard the most recent period of overheating, culminating in 2008, we have to go back to the first half of the 1970s, when things also went wrong, to find a lower number of unemployed people than today. Experience from the period of overheating has to some extent distorted our concept of normality. But the level of unemployment in that period was not normal, so it cannot be used as a yardstick. If we do that, things will go wrong again. *** The private sector is consolidating in the wake of the financial crisis. That is understandable, but obviously it is curbing consumption and investment. This trend will cease when savings have reached the desired level – time will show when – and the economy will begin to pick up. The shift could come suddenly – but that is not a promise – especially if the signals from the rest of Europe become more positive. The most recent national accounts figures for Denmark point to negative growth this year. We estimate that the economy will grow by 1–1½ per cent next year compared with this year. Exports have buoyed up growth in Denmark. The reason is that some of our largest export markets, such as Germany and Sweden, have not been so severely affected by the crisis until now. In the short term this somewhat cushions the impact of a deterioration of around 20 per cent in Denmark’s competitiveness over the last decade, measured by relative unit labour costs. We have lost and are still losing manufacturing jobs in the competitive sectors. If we want to boost employment in these areas, we must improve competitiveness – there are no other options. *** There are – tentative – signs that the housing market is recovering. Price falls have slowed down and the curve has flattened somewhat during the year, both for owner-occupied flats and for single-family houses. In the Copenhagen area, which typically feels the winds of change first, both turnover and prices have risen. The low level of interest rates is supporting the market. Moreover, the number of homes for sale has dropped sharply over the last year, which helps to stabilise prices. As regards mortgages, we are seeing a shift from very short-term variable-rate loans to variable-rate loans with longer rate fixation periods, as well as a shift from lending by banks to lending by mortgage banks. *** The agreed Finance Bill 2013 is in keeping with the 2020 plan for public finances, which allows public spending to grow by 0.8 per cent of GDP. But this year consumption growth will be considerably lower, presumably below 1/4 per cent. However, it is essential not only to set narrow limits on growth in public spending, but also to observe these limits. In that respect we have seen a change in recent years – unlike previously, local and regional governments are not overspending. When the new Budget Act with a tougher sanction regime comes into force, starting with the budgets for 2014 to 2017, there is a greater chance that this will also be the case in future. Prudent management of public finances is a precondition if the Danish government is to maintain its high credit rating and be able to borrow at low interest rates. This year the government deficit is expected to be just over 4 per cent of GDP. This is to a large extent attributable to the extraordinary disbursements of early retirement contributions; many people said yes when this option was offered. Disbursements total some kr. 25 billion, corresponding to 1½ per cent of GDP. The estimate of next year’s deficit is subject to much uncertainty due to the new rules on taxation of capital pensions. The option to pay pension taxes in advance at a reduced rate will 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  provide considerable one-off revenue for the government. How large this revenue will be I cannot say. But it should be used to reduce government debt. The government has not yet introduced all the reforms – envisaged in the 2020 plan – required to ensure the sustainability of public finances. So keeping to the path of reform should be a main priority in the near term. *** Bank lending rates and the banks’ willingness to grant loans have been relatively high on the public agenda since the financial crisis. Since 2008, Danmarks Nationalbank has reduced its interest rates on a number of occasions. But individual bank customers have, perhaps, experienced a different reality. The banks have not reduced their lending rates by nearly as much as Danmarks Nationalbank has, and within the last six months many have announced higher interest rates, while the monetary-policy rates have continued to fall. There are several reasons for this. The unusually low level of interest rates has made it difficult – not to say impossible – for banks to reduce deposit rates further. To avoid undermining their earnings, the banks are compelled to keep their lending rates unchanged. At the same time, the banks have been met with tougher earnings requirements. While higher earnings must compensate for higher credit risk under less favourable business conditions, new and more stringent capital-adequacy rules mean increased capital requirements. Irrespective of whether a bank chooses to build up capital buffers by retaining profits or by raising capital from investors, this requires sound earnings. Many banks have taken major steps to reduce costs, sometimes at the expense of employees. Credit policies have generally been tightened since 2008. This is reflected in lending rates, but also in the perception of the access to borrow. Overall, firms are saving up, and when asked they generally say that they do not see finances as an impediment to production. With a view to increasing funding options for small and medium-sized enterprises, the opportunities to expand the use of corporate bonds are currently being explored. Danmarks Nationalbank welcomes this initiative, provided that it takes place on market terms. *** It has attracted considerable international attention, most recently from the European Commission, that Danish households have far more gross debt relative to income than households in other countries. The low rate of interest on variable-rate mortgage loans has often been identified as the reason why the finances of the households are, nevertheless, generally sound. This raises the question of how robust household finances are to rising interest rates, and whether an increase could jeopardise financial stability. Today we are able to provide a fairly detailed answer to these questions. The main conclusion of an extensive study of household finances is that the threat to financial stability from household debt and its composition is limited. The assessment is based on the share of the debt held by families with particularly tight budgets. Most families have robust finances and are resilient to negative events such as a strong increase in interest rates or a protracted period of unemployment if they reduce consumption or savings, although this may entail considerable lifestyle changes. And this assessment does not even take into account that a continuous rise in interest rates is very likely to go hand in hand with an economic recovery and hence better employment opportunities. Obviously this assessment of the risk to financial stability does not rule out the possibility that higher interest rates could have rather unpleasant implications for families with very tight finances. *** 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Before I step down, it might be appropriate to reflect on some of the experience I have gained during my seven years as Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank. Naturally, it will only be a brief summary. Without doubt, the financial crisis is the single event that has had the strongest impact on the financial sector during my tenure. How prepared were we? How did we tackle the crisis itself? Which follow-up steps should we take? These are important questions. Regardless of our actions, Denmark is a small, open economy and we would have been hit by the international financial crisis which from the autumn of 2008 caused international trade to contract by 20 per cent and later led to a European debt crisis that has descended like a fog of uncertainty on the European economies. The key question is whether we in Denmark had made ourselves vulnerable to the severe shock that hit us from abroad. The answer is an unqualified “yes”. Even without a financial crisis, the Danish economy would have been under pressure. In this country, the preceding international boom with ample liquidity and low interest rates was allowed to develop into an unusual overheating of the economy, which was already slowing down when the shock hit us. The tax freeze, tax cuts, growth in public spending and new mortgage types were the domestic factors behind the overheating. The banks’ lending growth, skyrocketing property prices and unsustainably low unemployment were manifestations of the overheating. Cause and effect worked both ways. It has been discussed whether Danmarks Nationalbank issued sufficient warnings against this overheating. The truth is that the Danish government in the autumn of 2006 ignored a clear encouragement to tighten fiscal policy by kr. 8 billion; in fact, it even eased fiscal policy in 2007. And the opposition wanted to spend even more. Admittedly, such tightening measures should preferably have been introduced at an earlier stage, but even in the autumn of 2006 Danmarks Nationalbank could not find support for its view.  This goes to show how difficult it is to conduct countercyclical economic policy. Often there is lack of ability and willingness to acknowledge problems in time and take action. So stabilisation policy should first and foremost be achieved by introducing automatic stabilisers in the economy, observing sustainable medium-term spending targets and aiming for structurally balanced government budgets. Labour market structures should be designed to promote growth and employment. When the crisis really hit the financial sector in September 2008, a large majority in the Danish parliament – the Folketing – implemented the first of a series of bank rescue packages which have softened the worst blows against the financial sector. It has been a great strength that these initiatives have received broad political support. The bank rescue packages were introduced as crisis measures. An actual revision of the rules on banking activities, based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis, is now underway and is to a large extent taking place at the international level. For Denmark, this will initially result in EU regulation, subsequently in Danish rules to fill in the EU framework. A large financial legislation package is currently being submitted to the Folketing. I have the draft with me here. It weighs 1.37 kg. (Although I should add that the weight can be halved by printing on both sides of the paper.) And we will see much more in the coming years. It is understandable that the rules are being tightened after the excesses of the financial crisis, and Denmark has very little scope for independent action. All the same, it is worth considering whether the growing volume of legislation and the increasing complexity of the rules will provide better assurance against future crises. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Professor and Doctor of Law Linda Nielsen, who works with banking law and investment, recently made a noteworthy contribution to the debate in the daily Politiken. Everyone working with these issues should read it. Her main point is that the number of rules aimed at regulating the financial sector’s activities is overwhelming – and more are to come – and often the contents are so detailed and complex to read that even a person with a doctorate in law finds them very difficult to understand. There is a multitude of different rules with different structures, exemptions and levels of detail. It is completely overwhelming. What does this mean to banks, their boards and their customers, and how about the legislators? Are we constructing a vehicle where the person in the driver’s seat with a firm grip on the steering wheel believes to be steering it, while the car is in fact following its own path with considerable backlash? There is no simple answer to this question, which is not unique to financial regulation. As I have already said, individual countries have little room for manoeuvre as these activities take place at the international level. However, it is important to make the rules as clear and simple as possible. That will make them easier to observe and control. Keep it simple. Let me try to illustrate this. Since 2004, Danmarks Nationalbank has prepared so-called outlier memos, i.e. identified outlier banks. On the basis of – mainly – published financial statements for a large group of banks, we have been able to point out those that achieved the lowest scores for selected key ratios, such as excess capital adequacy, high lending growth, large exposures and earnings capacity. Using this simple method, we sought to identify potentially vulnerable banks. Subsequently, we have concluded that virtually all of the banks within this group that have actually become distressed had been identified beforehand using this relatively simple method. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority was aware of this and included it in its supervisory activities. With the “Supervisory Diamond”, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has taken a step in the right direction, with focus on observing a few key ratios – and now with sanctions for non-observance. And others can also monitor these key ratios. Another interesting observation is that among the 10 banks identified before the crisis as having the highest exposures to the property sector, 8–9 have subsequently become distressed. So the conclusion is that relatively simple key ratios can be used to identify the banks that could be at risk. Aggressive lending growth combined with property speculation is the single factor with the greatest impact on the banks that have folded. *** Seen in a broader perspective, Denmark has navigated the financial crisis fairly well so far. The weeding out of unsound banks has almost been completed, and after all less than 6 per cent of the banks became distressed – measured by balance-sheet total. Despite the large house price falls, the number of enforced sales is limited – especially when compared with the housing crisis in the early 1990s. If we disregard periods of unsustainable overheating and subsequent adjustment, unemployment has not been lower for the last 40 years. Denmark has sound economic ratios and internationally it is among the countries with the highest credit ratings. The reason why we have not been more severely hit is that we had the necessary buffers. All in all, this is no bad point of departure for meeting the challenges of the coming years. *** In my seven years as Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank, 1/3 of Denmark’s banks have disappeared – in numeric terms. The decline has been steady over this period and is in keeping with a trend that goes far back – crisis or no crisis. Danmarks Nationalbank will gladly assist you in calculating when you will be able to hold your annual meeting at a decent-sized dining table – if this trend continues. As I see it, the most significant factor is the increasing 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  complexity of banking. So if I may offer a piece of sound advice to a Director of the Danish Bankers Association (chief lobbyist) who wishes to continue to have a large number of paying members, I suggest that you give priority to clear and simple rules – especially for small banks. Regardless of the path you take, I would like to thank the Danish Bankers Association, its members, its employees and its Director for our good and constructive cooperation through seven years.  Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jörg Asmussen: Agenda 2013 – the next steps in completing EMU Speech by Mr Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the “Internationaler Club Frankfurter Wirtschaftsjournalisten”, Frankfurt am Main,  19 December 2012. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you this evening. It is now almost one year since I started my term in the ECB Executive Board, and it is interesting to reflect on how Europe has changed in that time. When I joined the ECB in January, the situation looked bleak. The first 3 year LTRO had temporarily calmed the markets, but many informed commentators were predicting a very difficult year ahead. Putting probabilities on a euro break-up had become a cottage industry. Today, we have grounds to be cautiously optimistic. The fear of catastrophic tail risks has lessened. This is in part due to actions taken by the ECB to ensure monetary policy transmission, notably through our OMT programme. But it is also due to very important changes that have taken place in euro area governance. Of these, the most significant is the recognition by the euro area Member States that EMU is an incomplete project – and that it urgently needs completing. For this reason, the topic of my address will be that process of achieving a genuine EMU, focusing in particular the conclusions of the European Council last week. I will say upfront that this outcome is not the definitive vision for EMU. It necessarily balances the views of European policy makers, reflecting what is realistic in the current political circumstances, while – I hope – remaining sufficiently ambitious to give citizens and investors a sense of direction of where the euro area is heading.  Accordingly, we need to think about the process of completing EMU in two phases: those elements that can be implemented quickly and can make a real difference to the euro area already in 2013; and those elements where more progress needs to be made in the medium-term as the integration process evolves. Let me begin by focusing on the first phase: the key elements for the year ahead. 2. Key elements for 2013 a) Completing financial market union Perhaps the most important element of agreed by the European Council is the commitment to construct a real financial market union in the euro area. This will be critical in 2013 for three reasons.  First, a stable and healthy banking system is necessary to restore normal monetary policy transmission across the euro area, and hence to ensure that the ECB’s low rates are duly passed on to all parts of the euro area. Second, restoring confidence in the financial sector – of which the banking system is the bedrock – is the only way to re-integrate the single financial market and therefore disentangle banks from their sovereigns. Third, putting in place a less risky banking system and fixing the credit channel are key contributions to restarting growth across the euro area during 2013. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Towards a Single Resolution Mechanism The agreement on a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) by the EU Finance Ministers is an important first step towards a real financial market union. But it is only one component. A financial market union has to involve a Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). This is the only way to ensure that taxpayers do not end up paying for the mistakes of the private sector. Let me explain why. Banks that are “too big” or “too interconnected” to fail at the national level – making bailout the preferred strategy – would not benefit from this status at the European level. The SRM would have the legal and financial capacity, as well as independence, to ensure that viable banks survive and non-viable banks are closed down. Moreover, banks that are “too complex” to resolve via cross-border cooperation – making early action impossible – could be dealt with more effectively at the European level. The SRM would create an authority that could concentrate decisions on resolution and act pre-emptively and quickly, helping to preserve the value of the banks and save money for taxpayers. Principles for European public support However, a strong resolution mechanism cannot remove risks for taxpayers entirely. Certainly, any costs incurred from resolution should first and foremost be covered by the private sector, through establishing a European Resolution Fund raised by levies on the banking sector. But a real financial market union must also contain a public sector dimension at the European level. In this context, the European Council called for the operational framework for direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM to be ready by the first semester of 2013. I am aware that the prospect of ESM direct bank recapitalisation raises serious concerns: that European taxpayers will end up paying for the bad assets accumulated over the past decade; that mutualisation will become standard practice for dealing with banking sector problems. But let me reassure you that these concerns can be contained with what I would see as the three key principles for European support.  First, European support has to be accompanied by European control, meaning public funds can only be used after the SSM has effectively assumed its duties and on the basis of strong conditionality. Second, European support should only be granted to banks that are systemically relevant, or pose a serious threat to European financial stability, and therefore affect the common good.  Third, European support must come at the end of a sequential process, involving the following steps: • one, the beneficiary banks must undergo a thorough and independent economic evaluation of their assets to ascertain their real capital needs and reveal any legacy problems;  • two, those banks must be assessed to have a viable business model and so be deserving of additional capital, otherwise they should wound down; • three, if the banks are to be kept going, private sector sources should be exhausted first – meaning bailing-in of shareholders and bondholders, and if needed, use of the bank-funded resolution financing; • four, if there are still capital shortfalls, the financial resources of the beneficiary Member States should be drawn on;  • only in the very last step, would European public funds be used.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  This pecking order underscores that, the stronger the European resolution framework, the lower the eventual costs for European taxpayers. The more the financial sector can be bailed- in, the less it has to be bailed- out. We see in the US how this can work: the FDIC closed down more than 400 banks during the crisis, without any cost for taxpayers. This is the standard we should be aiming for in Europe – and a real financial market union is the only way to achieve it. Let me make a final point regarding the institutional set-up of the SRM and Resolution Fund, which is my own personal view: the ESM would be well-suited to perform the tasks of the SRM and to house the European Resolution Fund raised from the banking sector. b. Building economic union The second key outcome of the European Council is the aim to strengthen economic union – particularly by ensuring that national economies can remain competitive and hence prosper within a single currency area. The importance of this issue for 2013 cannot be overstated, as it is critical to ignite growth and lower unemployment. We can see before our eyes a series of cases where quick implementation of targeted reforms could have a strong impact, even in the near-term. For instance, despite the recession in Italy, unit labour costs have adjusted by only 0.1% relative to the euro area average since 2008. This is because many sectors of the economy are sheltered and wages do not respond to weak productivity. It needs product market reforms to increase competition and reinvigorate its external competitiveness.  In Spain, employment is struggling to rebound, and the burden on unemployment falling disproportionately on the young, because its two-tier labour market protects insiders. It needs labour market reforms to bring in outsiders and improve incentives to hire. The Conclusions propose to kick-start this much-needed process of reform through three avenues. First, a renewed effort to complete the Single Market, in particular by opening up services and increasing labour mobility. Second, a thorough assessment, carried out in all euro areas countries, of the compatibility of their labour and product markets with membership of EMU. And third, for the issues identified in this assessment to be addressed through the new concept of “Reform Contracts”. Let me elaborate some more on this last point. The idea behind the “Reform Contracts” is that countries would commit to specific structural reforms that have a direct positive impact on competitiveness, with those commitments formalised in a legally binding contract. The contract would be multi-annual and, to foster national ownership, initiated by the national government and approved by the national parliament. If the terms of the contract were met, financial support would be provided, targeted at the transitional costs arising from structural reforms – for instance, re-training programmes for displaced workers.  What are the benefits of this approach compared to the status quo? In my view there are three, although they depend very much on how the concept is eventually implemented. First, the contracts could be entered into as part of a concerted national reform effort, rather than being seen as an imposition from “Brussels” in the context of the EU procedures like the European Semester. Second, reform commitments could potentially be more precise, measurable and binding in the contracts than under those existing procedures. However, this effect would quickly be lost if it simply becomes another bureaucratic procedure.  Third, and perhaps most importantly, because the contracts are multi-annual they could allow for deeper reforms than are possible under existing procedures. There have been a series of recent studies that suggest that competitiveness is not only about flexibility, but also strongly connected to governance. We see clear correlations between countries’ economic 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  performance and their rankings in governance indices published by, among others, the World Economic Forum and Transparency International. The contracts provide an opportunity, if used properly, to “go deep” and address these more fundamental barriers to competitiveness. Building a stronger economic union along these lines is necessary to correct what might be called an “original sin” of EMU: the fact that the convergence criteria did not include any structural benchmarks for joining the euro, and hence structural policies remained mainly within the national remit.  3. Areas for further progress in the future What about those areas that were not outcomes of the European Council and where there is room for further progress in the future?  The most important is greater sharing of sovereignty. The importance of credible governance has been starkly demonstrated during the crisis. Countries without credible policies have been forced by markets to consolidate more rapidly than others in the downturn. This is because markets have not trusted that they can run sufficient surpluses in good times, or achieve sufficient growth, to lower debt levels and ensure long-term sustainability. Paradoxically, the lack of strong external constraints on fiscal and economic policies has led to countries losing substantive sovereignty in these areas.  By the same token, countries now need to share more sovereignty in order to regain their sovereignty. By sharing decision-making with the European level, they can restore their policy credibility with investors, while at the same time having a voice over where they are heading. This will mean going beyond the Maastricht logic of national responsibility for fiscal and structural policies, and committing to governance arrangements that are actually enforceable – for instance, allowing for intervention rights by the center to prevent unsound national budgets. Sharing sovereignty implies a number of other changes to euro area governance. First, there have to be strong institutions in order to exercise that sovereignty effectively. This will require a stronger Eurogroup. Second, those European institutions have to be properly democratically legitimated. This requires changes in the way the citizens participate in the European political process, in particular via the European Parliament. Let me stress: while I would have liked the outcome of the European Council to be more ambitious, these ideas are not intended as criticism of it. They are orientations to advance further which will need to be properly fleshed out in the years ahead as the integration process evolves. This will require a Treaty change in the medium-term in order to complete EMU in a comprehensive way. 4. Conclusion One year ago, the euro area was facing an uncertain future. But those painted a dark picture at that time have been proven wrong. One year later, Europe has proven its ability to act and we have begun to set the euro area on a more convincing path.  It is now critical that, over the next year, we continue down this path and provide EMU with institutions it needs to advance. Putting in place a genuine financial union and a stronger economic union must be our key priorities for 2013. It is essential that the appearance of calm on financial markets does not distract from the urgent need to address the euro area’s fundamental challenges.  Moreover, we should also not row back on what has already been achieved. Implementing the Fiscal Compact and adopting the “Two Pack” of legislation in 2013 are essential to strengthen the fiscal framework. We should not undermine this by re-opening discussions on what constitutes “good” or “bad” deficits by arguing for exemptions for public investment. All 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  deficits have to be financed on financial markets and increase public debt stocks – and this is the opposite of what we need next year. However, this focus on 2013 does not mean we should lose sight of the big picture. It is instructive to notice how little markets are reacting to the “fiscal cliff” debate in the US, while they are jolted by the prospect of earlier than planned elections in Italy.  Our long-term goal is a situation where the essential functioning of the euro area is unaffected by events in individual countries, because sovereignty is shared and exercised in strong common institutions – and those institutions have a longer time horizon than politics.  This is what Jean Monnet understood when he said: “Rien n’est possible sans les hommes, rien n’est durable sans les institutions”. “Nothing is possible without men, but nothing is lasting without institutions”. These words have never been more true than today. Thank you for your attention.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jens Weidmann: Sound public finances for a stable monetary union Speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Institute for Law and Finance, Frankfurt am Main, 12 December 2012. *      *      * 1.  Introduction Professor Baums Ladies and gentlemen Thank you very much for your invitation. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to you today at the Institute for Law and Finance. There are many transmission channels between the “House of Finance” and the Bundesbank. The lively exchange of ideas between the two institutions has proven to be exceptionally fruitful, and it gives me great pleasure to further strengthen this dialogue today. I will, however, resist the temptation to speak about “regulatory and fiscal policy aspects of the change of course in energy policy”. Fascinating though this subject may be, giving a qualified lecture on this topic might ask a little too much of the central banker standing before you. And after all, it is the Bundesbank itself that regularly warns against too much being asked of central banks. These warnings normally centre around central bankers’ traditional fears about an excessively close relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy. Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, once summed up these concerns in slightly exaggerated terms by saying: “Central banks are often accused of being obsessed with inflation. This is untrue. If they are obsessed with anything, it is with fiscal policy.” But where does this “obsession” come from? Why does escalating government debt pose problems for monetary policy? The reasons for this are not immediately apparent. After all, monetary policy – in the industrial countries, at least – is usually independent and equipped with a clear mandate to safeguard price stability. One could, therefore, incorrectly conclude that unsound public finances are not relevant to monetary policy. However, a closer look reveals that monetary policy is reliant on fiscal policy with regard to safeguarding price stability. Escalating public debt inevitably drives prices higher. But growing government debt can still pose a threat to price stability even before it begins to spiral out of control. Furthermore, a host of empirical studies suggest that high levels of public debt dampen growth over the long term. Seen from this angle, the prevailing situation in the euro area  – but also in other industrial countries such as the United States and Japan – might lead one to assume that there is a broad consensus in favour of rapidly and resolutely reducing budgetary deficits. Yet critics raise a number of objections to these arguments. First, they claim that the risks to price stability in the current environment are not acute, that inflation rates are low and inflation expectations are still firmly anchored. Second, they warn that rapid consolidation in these countries would set off a cyclical downward spiral – they would “save themselves to death”, as it were. Bearing this in mind, I would therefore like to focus on three topics in a little more detail: first, the importance of sound public finances for price stability; second, the preconditions for sound public finances in the monetary union; and third, the cyclical effects of fiscal consolidation.  To begin with, let us consider why monetary policy can only be successful in the long run if public finances are sound. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  2. The importance of sound public finances for monetary policy High levels of government debt make it difficult to safeguard price stability in more ways than one. As I have already indicated, an excessive debt level can cause growth impetus to slacken over the long run as the increased public borrowing requirement pushes up interest rates, making investment more expensive and thus diminishing growth. If the central bank does not identify this slowdown in growth in good time, its monetary policy stance will be too expansionary and thus ultimately raise the spectre of inflation. But even if the central bank does correctly identify the deceleration of growth, it might come under mounting pressure to adopt an excessively expansionary monetary stance in order to stimulate the economy and thus maintain the usual rates of expansion. The longer the central bank tries to use monetary policy means to mask the structural slowdown in growth, the less credible it becomes in terms of its price stability objective. This can send inflation expectations higher and ultimately fuel inflation.  However, a structural slowdown in the growth outlook is not the only problem that excessive public debt holds in store for monetary policy. If a government has already racked up high levels of debt in economically good times, fiscal policy can no longer fulfil its role as a buffer when a crisis occurs. Under normal circumstances, fiscal policy measures can stabilise aggregate demand during a cyclical downturn, for example via unemployment benefits or an automatically falling tax burden. This path is not available if such fiscal policy measures call the sovereign’s solvency into question. This applies not only to the traditional countercyclical fiscal stimulus measures I have just mentioned, but also to cases where the crisis has hit the banking system and government support is essential to prevent credit institutions from collapsing. If fiscal policy cannot provide this support, the central bank may, in the last resort, be forced to prop up the banking system. These measures considerably increase the central bank’s balance sheet risks and might thus impair the credibility of monetary policy.  A high level of public debt can increase the pressure on monetary policy not only to provide an economic stimulus or to step into the breach in the event of a crisis, but also to generally ease the financing conditions for government. The monetary policy measures that can be deployed in this case range from interest rate cuts to bond purchases through to direct monetary financing by the central bank. Government interest expenditure depends not least on the interest rate level and thus on monetary policy. If a country is only growing at a slow pace but has already run up high deficits and debt levels, its interest costs must be kept below a certain threshold, or else the government debt ratio could explode. If the sovereign then – for the purpose of maintaining its solvency – obliges the central bank to set a lower interest rate than price stability would require, demand would rise too quickly, thus leading sooner or later to inflation. Among economists, this state of affairs is known as a regime of “fiscal dominance”: interest rates are no longer set on the basis of what is needed to safeguard price stability but are geared instead to the government’s need to lower its financing costs. Providing economic stimulus, taking on fiscal policy tasks in a crisis, financing the sovereign: the pressure that unsound public finances exert on monetary policy comes in many different guises. To resist these influences, legislators conferred a high degree of independence on central banks. This came in response inter alia to the experience of the 1970s and 1980s, a period in which oil price shocks posed a major challenge to monetary policy. It became evident that countries with independent central banks had significantly lower inflation rates than those in which central banks followed politicians’ instructions – while simultaneously achieving equal or even higher levels of growth.  What we learned back then was that price stability does not run counter to economic prosperity but complements it. This has proved to be one of the key economic policy lessons of the past thirty years. The decision to make central banks independent of government instructions was a resounding success in fighting inflation. And the level of public debt no 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  longer appears to have influenced inflation levels over the past few decades, at least in the industrial countries. Yet to conclude from this that an independent monetary policy alone is a sufficient condition for stable money would, in my view, be premature, if not to say naive. For if a sovereign runs up so much debt that the burden soon becomes unsustainable, the central bank comes under much greater pressure. This can raise concerns as to whether the central bank is truly independent and can undermine its credibility – even if it has not yet actually changed its monetary policy course. Once the first doubts emerge as to whether monetary policy can assert its independence, the central bank runs the risk of losing control over inflation expectations, and thus over inflation itself.  At this point, sceptics like to raise the objection that high inflation expectations do not necessarily imply rising inflation rates, claiming that only expanding demand can fuel inflation. However, inflation rises as soon as inflation expectations increase, even if demand does not go up per se.  The wage-setting process is a good illustration of how this mechanism works. Wages cannot normally be changed at any point in time but are usually set on a given date for a given period. Employees therefore take account of anticipated price developments when negotiating their wages in order to prevent their earnings from deviating too strongly from a suitable level during the subsequent period in which they cannot renegotiate their wages. If they overestimate inflation, their wages would be too high and they would not be competitive. If they underestimate inflation, they would lose real income and their purchasing power would shrink as a result. Inflation expectations are thus factored into today’s wages and thus into today’s prices as well. DE-anchoring inflation expectations can therefore lead directly to higher inflation.  Recent research findings1 suggest that it can take some time for a central bank that has a credible track record to forfeit its credibility. Indeed, this is a process that could well last several years.  However, once a central bank has lost its credibility, inflation expectations may surge dramatically. Bringing them back under control can be both time-consuming and costly for the economy. 3. Preconditions for sound public finances Sound public finances thus remain a necessary precondition for price stability. And ensuring sound public finances is even more crucial in the monetary union. This is because one of the fundamental problems of a monetary union featuring decentralised fiscal policies is that member states have a greater incentive to incur debt. When government debt in one country rises, the consequences are spread across the entire monetary union and are thus effectively diluted – for example, via rising interest rates for all of the member states. This makes incurring higher deficits more attractive to each individual country. To counteract this moral hazard, the European monetary union was placed from the start on a stability-oriented foundation. In addition to the prohibition of monetary financing, this foundation is underpinned by the strict deficit rules enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact and the no bail-out principle with regard to other member states.  So long as the no bail-out principle maintains its credibility, it sends an important signal to the financial markets. If investors believe that they themselves could face potential losses, it was assumed that they would demand higher interest rates in return for the increased risk. The guiding principle of monetary union was therefore based on individual responsibility: both on                                                 1  Bianchi, Francesco, and Leonardo Melosi (2012), Dormant Shocks and Fiscal Virtue, Duke University, mimeo. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the part of the member states, by assuming individual responsibility for the consequences of their policies, and on the part of the financial market agents, by assuming individual responsibility for the consequences of their investment decisions. Despite these rules, however, member states’ borrowing has not been effectively curbed since the introduction of the euro. In fact, quite the opposite has happened. With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, the rules were not only circumvented but also actively bent. A key shortcoming was that a majority of all member states had to vote to impose sanctions on countries which exceeded the deficit limit. A second problem was that the financial markets did not exert the expected disciplining effect. Investors tolerated the fiscal and economic policy failures of several member states for far too long, either because they overlooked the growing risks or because they did not see the no bail-out policy as being credible. The fact of the matter is that, in the case of the no bail-out policy, a key factor was underestimated, namely contagion effects via the member states’ financial systems. The introduction of the euro led to an intensified integration of the financial markets. But the crisis has shown that this is not always a blessing, as the probability of contagion effects increase significantly across closely interconnected financial markets. This means that when a crisis occurs, not providing assistance can prove very expensive. Financial assistance, at least in the short run, seems to be the lesser evil, especially where banks have already been weakened on account of past failures and the financial and economic crisis. In spite of this, many of the considerations which shaped the construction of the monetary union at the end of the 1990s essentially still remain valid. Fiscal rules can certainly play an important role in reducing the incentive to run up debt – at least where governments are bound by them. A number of measures have been taken since the outbreak of the crisis to improve these rules. The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact has made it much harder to undermine the deficit rules. And the Fiscal Compact additionally strengthens the excessive deficit procedure and anchors the rules for pursuing a sound budgetary policy at the national level. It now remains to be seen how these new rules will be put into practice. For experience shows as well that, in addition to rules, a stability-oriented policy approach also calls for a fundamental consensus both among politicians and the general public which upholds and protects these rules. There is also reason to fear that the crisis measures have tended to further amplify the aforementioned incentive to incur debt. This can be attributed to the fact that while risks have been extensively mutualised in the wake of combating the crisis, the control over fiscal policy still remains in the hands of each country. This divergence of liability and control makes it even easier to shift the consequences of unsound fiscal policy onto others. Essentially, there are two conceivable approaches to realign liability and control and, in doing so, to create a stable monetary union. The one is to take a quantum leap towards a genuine fiscal union, featuring an extensive transfer of budgetary policy sovereignty to the European level. The other is to try to reassert the principle of individual responsibility, which is the basis of the Maastricht Treaties, in practice. To overcome the remaining weaknesses of monetary union, further integration would be required in this case, too, though it would be less extensive than in a fully-fledged fiscal union. Unfortunately, it must be said that currently neither of these two approaches is being pursued resolutely. Taking the path of fiscal union would require countries to surrender a substantial amount of their sovereignty. However, such a significant increase in integration lacks majority support in many member states. In fact, I have noticed that it is precisely the people who most vociferously call for mutual liability are the ones who most vehemently reject transferring national decision-making powers to the European level. A crucial requirement of the second option – returning to a system of national fiscal responsibility – is that solvency risks are not extensively mutualised and that financial market 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  players bear the risks of their investment decisions themselves. This would lead to financial market discipline playing an even greater role. However, with a view to a future stable regulatory framework, it is not helpful that decisions have been made that weaken this disciplinary effect. Regardless of which path monetary union takes, it must be ensured that, in future, budgetary imbalances of one country do not automatically jeopardise financial stability. Otherwise, other countries would feel compelled to use all means necessary to prevent a sovereign insolvency for the sake of safeguarding financial stability, so that a disciplining effect on fiscal policy would be unlikely from the outset.  For this reason, too, a resilient financial system is central to a stability-oriented monetary policy and a functioning monetary union. A well-structured banking union, which severs the problematic ties between sovereigns and banks, can make an important contribution to this. I could easily speak about banking union for another half an hour, but I will leave it at that for now.  Instead, I would like to sum up this issue as follows. Price stability requires sound public finances, and sound public finances call for a coherent framework for monetary union. However, the question of designing the overall framework does not solve the problem of the current deficits. 4. Consolidation versus growth Since the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis, a number of euro-area countries have introduced steps to consolidate their budgets. Critics, such as the American economist Paul Krugman, caution that such consolidation will cause more harm than good in the present circumstances. In order to reduce the deficit, he argues, countries either have to cut public spending or increase taxes. But , he adds, both of these measures are the wrong remedy in the light of the current economic slowdown as they would further dampen the already weakened aggregate demand and hence trigger a downward economic spiral.  This debate has gathered further momentum following a study performed by the IMF2 on the size of fiscal multipliers in the crisis. This multiplier indicates how strongly economic growth reacts to a change in budgetary policy. The IMF’s study arrives at the conclusion that the multiplier amounts to approximately 1.7 and is thus larger than originally assumed. This would imply that growth losses would be much greater than the consolidation savings. In this case, budgetary consolidation would actually trigger a downward spiral. However, the IMF’s findings are disputed among economic researchers. The sceptics criticise, first, the small number of observations and, second, the high dependency of the results on the choice of countries in the sample. Furthermore, the situation in the individual countries is likely to vary greatly, but this variation is not sufficiently accounted for in the IMF’s cross-section analysis. There is no disputing that austerity measures can impede growth in the short term. But it is equally indisputable that the debt situation in the countries concerned is simply unsustainable. I therefore believe that there is no alternative to resolute consolidation. This is the logical consequence of the fact that this crisis is essentially a crisis of confidence. In order to restore confidence in public finances, fiscal policymakers must now show that they are able and willing to improve their structural budgetary position. Although fiscal consolidation is hard, it is unavoidable in a debt crisis – constantly deferring the necessary measures will only increase uncertainty and thus likewise dampen growth. And a deliberately                                                 2  International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook 2012. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  protracted consolidation of public finances would also make it harder to maintain political support. Incidentally, the way in which consolidation is carried out also plays an important role in determining how quickly a country returns to healthy growth rates. Studies3 show that countries which reduce their deficit by cutting government expenditure sustain significantly smaller growth losses than countries which do so by increasing taxes. The rationale behind this is that many measures such as streamlining the administrative apparatus or privatising state-owned enterprises not only yield potential savings for the public sector but could also improve macroeconomic productivity.  5. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen The high level of public debt is one of, if not the, greatest economic policy challenge of our time. This applies also, and especially, to monetary policy. Sound public finances are a precondition for a stable currency, a precondition that monetary policy cannot create itself. In order to ensure sound public finances in the euro area over the long term, the architecture of monetary union has to be further developed in a coherent manner. In doing so, particular attention must be paid to keeping liability and control in harmony. And it is crucial that such a culture of stability is actively embraced by both policymakers and the general public. Consolidation and growth do not conflict with one another. Instead, the one is the precondition for the other. To say it in the words of the American economist Paul Romer: “A crisis is a terrible thing to waste”. That puts it in a nutshell. If Europe resolutely executes the necessary reforms, monetary union will end up stronger. Of this I am certain.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jeremy C Stein: Dollar funding and global banks Speech by Mr Jeremy C Stein, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Global Research Forum “International Macroeconomics and Finance”, co-organised by the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Frankfurt am Main, 17 December 2012. *      *      * Thanks very much. It’s a pleasure to be part of this panel on the future of financial globalization. I will focus my remarks on one important aspect of this issue – namely, the growing use of wholesale dollar funding by global financial institutions. I’ll begin by briefly discussing research I’ve been doing, along with my coauthors Victoria Ivashina and David Scharfstein, which examines some of the consequences of this funding model during times of market stress.1 I’ll then touch on the policy implications of this and related work. But first, the usual disclaimer: The views that follow are my own and do not necessarily reflect the thinking of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.  By way of background, the dollar liabilities of foreign banks have grown rapidly in the past two decades and now stand at about $8 trillion, roughly on par with those of U.S. banks.2 A significant proportion of foreign banks’ dollar liabilities are raised via U.S. branches, most of which are legally precluded from raising deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The main source of funding for these branches, therefore, comes from uninsured wholesale claims such as large time deposits, making the cost and availability of such dollar funding highly sensitive to changing perceptions of these banks’ creditworthiness. In our work, we asked how shocks to the ability of foreign banks to raise dollar funding might lead to changes in their lending. We began with a simple conceptual model: Imagine a European bank that lends in euros to European firms and in dollars to U.S. firms. To finance its euro-denominated lending, it funds itself by issuing insured euro deposits to its local retail deposit base. By contrast, to finance its dollar-denominated lending, it raises funds in the wholesale dollar market.  Because the bank’s dollar liabilities are uninsured, an adverse shock to the bank’s perceived creditworthiness will result in a spike in its dollar funding costs. At the same time, the cost to the bank of funding in euros is unchanged to the extent that its euro deposits are insured. So we might expect such a shock to induce the bank to shift its funding away from the U.S. wholesale market and toward the European deposit market. But what are the consequences of this adjustment, both for the geographic distribution of its lending and for the functioning of foreign exchange (FX) swap markets?3 Note that if the bank wants to maintain the volume of its dollar-based lending, it will have to tap its insured deposit base to raise more euros and then swap these euros into dollars using the FX swap market. However, if the induced funding realignment is big enough, and if arbitrageurs have limited capacity to take the other side of the trade, this large swap demand can cause a breakdown in the usual covered-interest-parity (CIP) relationship – a breakdown of the sort that we have seen during times of extreme market stress. In this case, the                                                 1  See Victoria Ivashina, David S. Scharfstein, and Jeremy C. Stein (2012), “Dollar Funding and the Lending Behavior of Global Banks (PDF),” Finance and Economics Discussion Papers 2012-74 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October). 2  For the dollar assets and liabilities of foreign banks, see Bank for International Settlements (2012), “Locational Banking Statistics (PDF),” December. For the assets and liabilities of domestically chartered U.S. banks, see Table H.8, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 3  A foreign exchange swap is the simultaneous exchange of one currency for another in the spot market and an agreement to reverse this transaction at a later date at a pre-specified exchange rate. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  direction of the deviation would be such that the cost of synthetic dollar borrowing – in other words, euro borrowing combined with an FX swap – would go up and would approach that of the now-elevated cost of funding directly in the wholesale dollar market. And given that any method of dollar funding – direct or synthetic – has become more expensive relative to euro funding, it then follows that an adverse shock to a global bank’s perceived creditworthiness leads to a decline in its dollar-denominated lending relative to its euro-denominated lending. So, two principal effects of the dollar funding shock are intimately connected: a widening of the so-called CIP basis in the FX swap market, and a reduction in credit supply to firms that borrow in dollars.4 To test the model’s implications, my coauthors and I focused on events in the second half of 2011, when the credit quality of a number of large euro-area banks became a concern and U.S. prime money market funds sharply reduced their lending to those banks. In a span of four months, the exposure of money funds to euro-area banks fell by half, from about $400 billion in May to about $200 billion in September.5 Coincident with this contraction in dollar funding, the CIP basis widened in the direction predicted by our model, increasing the cost of obtaining synthetic dollars via the FX swap market. We used data from the international syndicated loan market to test the model’s predictions about the reaction of lending to this type of funding stress. We found that dollar-denominated lending by euro-area banks fell relative to their euro-denominated lending, while this result did not hold for U.S. banks. We also found that, even holding fixed the identity of the borrowing firm, a syndicate formed to make a dollar-denominated loan during this period was less likely to include euro-area banks, while the same was not true of syndicates making euro-denominated loans. Finally, euro-area banks that relied most on funding from U.S. money market funds also cut back most sharply on their dollar-denominated lending.6 This last result is similar to one in recent work by my Fed colleagues Ricardo Correa, Horacio Sapriza, and Andrei Zlate.7 They documented that the U.S. branches of foreign banks that experienced the most shrinkage in their dollar-denominated large time deposits – funding that had been mostly provided by money market funds prior to mid-2011 – cut their U.S.-based commercial and industrial lending by more than banks that fared better on this score. Taken together, these findings have two types of policy implications: one for central bank responses to dollar funding pressures and another for measures to regulate foreign banking firms that rely heavily on short-term wholesale funding. This analysis underscores that the Federal Reserve’s temporary dollar liquidity swap lines with the European Central Bank and other central banks are an effective response to stresses in dollar funding markets. Last week, the FOMC approved the extension of these swap lines through February 1, 2014. These lines have helped avert fire sales of dollar assets and maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and firms. Although we documented cutbacks in dollar lending in the latter half of 2011 by foreign banks reliant on                                                 4  The CIP basis is typically measured as the difference between the interest rate differential embedded in FX swap prices and the differential implied by foreign- and domestic-currency Libor rates. 5  See U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (2012), “SEC Releases Money Market Fund Portfolio and ‘Shadow NAV’ Information to the Public,” press release, January 31. 6  Money-fund reliance is defined as liabilities held by money funds divided by total short-term debt plus deposits. 7  See Ricardo Correa, Horacio Sapriza and Andrei Zlate (2012), “Liquidity Shocks, Dollar Funding Costs and the Bank Lending Channel During the European Sovereign Crisis (PDF),” International Finance Discussion Papers 2012-1059 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November). 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  wholesale dollar funding, those cutbacks likely would have been more pronounced in the absence of the swap lines I will now turn to regulation. It is useful to bear in mind that our current regulatory regime evolved during a period when the U.S. operations of foreign banks were largely net recipients of funding from their parents. However, their reliance on less stable, short-term wholesale funding increased significantly in the decade leading up to the financial crisis, when U.S. branches of foreign banks began borrowing large volumes of dollars to send to their foreign parents. Such activity increases the vulnerabilities I described earlier. And it may not only pose the risk of a cutback in lending, but could also threaten the safety and soundness of the foreign banks themselves – and of the U.S. entities exposed to those banks. The regulation of U.S. branches of foreign banks has changed little over the past decade, even in the face of these significant changes in the global banking landscape. However, last week, the Federal Reserve Board proposed new rules for foreign banking organizations that would address some of the concerns that I’ve discussed and thereby mitigate the attendant risks to U.S. financial stability. These proposed rules apply enhanced prudential standards to foreign banking organizations and are designed to increase their resiliency. Importantly, the rules will not disadvantage foreign banks relative to domestic U.S. banking firms, but rather the rules seek to maintain a level playing field. To avoid or mitigate potential disruptions in wholesale dollar funding markets, the proposed rules require foreign banking organizations to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet expected near-term net outflows in a stress scenario. These rules should reduce the pressure on foreign banks that rely heavily on short-term dollar funding to either sell illiquid dollar assets or cut back on dollar lending in times of financial stress. By helping to alleviate disruptions in dollar funding markets the rules should also reduce the reliance on swap lines in a future stress episode.  Finally, the central role played by money market funds in the 2011 episode is a reminder of the fragility of these funds themselves – and of the risk created by their combination of risky asset holdings, stable-value demandable liabilities, and zero-capital buffers. The events following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 provide even starker evidence of the risks that money market funds pose for the broader financial system. In light of these vulnerabilities, I welcome the recent proposed recommendations by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for further money market fund reforms.8 To conclude: Financial globalization undoubtedly brings with it substantial benefits. At the same time, it creates important challenges for financial stability and for the appropriate design of regulation. The research discussed in conferences such as this one will help us better understand and respond to these challenges. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.                                                 8  See U.S Department of the Treasury (2012), “Financial Stability Oversight Council Releases Proposed Recommendations for Money Market Mutual Fund Reform,” press release, November 13. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Josef Bonnici: Economic growth in turbulent times Address by Professor Josef Bonnici, Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, at the annual dinner of the Institute of Financial Services – Malta, Saint Julian’s, 14 December 2012. *      *      * Hon. Minister, Excellencies, Members of the Institute, Distinguished Guests Let me start by thanking the Malta Institute of Financial Services for extending this opportunity for me to address this distinguished audience. Mr President, your Institute’s leading role in banking and financial education in Malta is well known, as are its endeavours to establish forms of collaboration with other educational institutions. As a result, a wider range of relevant courses are available to professional staff within the financial services industry. I understand that a notable development over the last year was the relationship that you established with the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investments as a strategic partner for the offering of specialised Investment-related courses. I also note with interest the recent introduction of a Masters in Wealth Management, a development which will certainly enhance the skills and expertise of many. This is a relevant achievement and we look forward to further success in expanding your reach to all members of the financial community through the activities that your Institute organises and the training facilities it provides. The economic crisis in Europe is now in its fifth year, and a number of countries remain in various degrees of distress, while most forecasts continue to revise downwards their output and employment projections. The latest Eurosystem projections published in December 2012 indicate a small euro area GDP contraction of 0.3% in 2013. Deleveraging goes on in several member states as banks continue to repair their balance sheets, limiting their lending activity and hence impeding the transmission of monetary policy in those member states. The build-up of these problems took place over a fairly long number of years, and the resolution is proving to be a gradual and hesitant process. In this light, it may be useful to start by taking stock of the general euro area situation and then make a number of related remarks on the domestic economy. Retrospective on the euro area As is well recognized, the origins of the crisis can be traced back to the excessively high public sector debt, slippage in competitiveness, inappropriate banking practices and weak bank regulatory environment on both sides of the Atlantic. The crisis has had various intertwined dimensions, each with implications for the avoidance of similar problems in the future. One observes that in several countries, fiscal problems led to sovereign debt downgrades that in turn damaged the banks’ balance sheets. The consequences of the lack of fiscal discipline were aggravated by the erosion of competitiveness and the failure to implement structural reforms. However, in several instances, banking sector difficulties were the trigger for fiscal problems. Indeed, adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact was not a sufficient condition to keep countries out of difficulties. For example, in Ireland and Spain, banking sector difficulties have necessitated bail-outs by the governments concerned. This led to sovereign downgrades which in turn increased the government 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  borrowing costs, in some cases to unsustainable levels. All these problems were compounded by instability in financial markets and volatility in sentiment. Chart 1 shows that prior to the formation of the monetary union yields started to converge – regardless of the fiscal position or economic fundamentals – and then stabilised within a fairly narrow band during the first years of the euro until the crisis of 2009. Many countries failed to reduce the debt to GDP ratio during this period as shown in Chart 2. The market’s focus and sentiment changed drastically in 2009, by giving full recognition to the importance of fiscal sustainability, such that yield spreads widened sharply. Market complacency turned into market volatility, and it is only lately that this has been somewhat mitigated after the announcement of the OMT programme, a subject that I will come back to later. Fiscal excess and inappropriate banking practices were not the only causes of the crisis. There was also an erosion of private sector competitiveness, as shown by the relative increase in unit labour costs in several of the weaker economies (see Chart 3). In many countries, the deterioration in competitiveness was the result of wage increases that were not matched by higher productivity. Fiscal excesses in several countries camouflaged the erosion of competitiveness, resulting in a wider deficit in the external trade accounts, as shown in Chart 4. Inside a monetary union the alarm bells caused by current account deficits are not as loud as they are when each country has its own currency. Before monetary union, such problems were countered, with questionable effectiveness, by currency depreciation. But inside the monetary union these current account deficits were simply financed by capital inflows, largely flowing from the countries in the north to most countries in the periphery. Chart 4 also highlights the separation within the euro area between selected countries in the north, running a generally current account surplus, and selected countries in the periphery with a negative balance. The upper band depicts the maximum and minimum of the data range for Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Similarly, the lower range depicts the corresponding boundaries for Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. It is not surprising that those countries in the lower part of the chart featured prominently in the unfolding crisis. Eventually, when markets reoriented their focus towards economic unsustainability, the flow of capital reversed direction; market discipline now took the form of capital flight. There is also no doubt that financial institutions took on excessive risk, including investments in complex and, as is now well known, mispriced financial instruments. Crucially, the heightened degree of riskiness was not complemented by adequate capital buffers. In addition, cross-country debt holdings and linkages between financial institutions led to contagion and the spread of systemic risk. Moving on to the macroeconomic dimension, it can be observed that in various countries, governments with large fiscal imbalances have now resorted to the narrowing of such imbalances, through the application of inevitable fiscal consolidation measures. These corrections have often met strong social dissatisfaction and political resistance. And yet, the budgetary restraint has not always been viewed as adequate from the point of view of the financial markets that seem to have limited patience for the measures to have a discernible impact on fiscal imbalances. For many governments, bond spreads remain wide. This fiscal restraint has also slowed down economic growth and this in turn has aggravated the budgetary deficit. Chart 5 shows the deficit as per cent of GDP for the euro area as a whole, along with the corresponding cyclically adjusted ratio. The light blue line in the chart shows where the deficit would have been without the economic 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  slowdown that was caused in part by fiscal consolidation. The gap between the two lines illustrates the inevitable contribution of the economic slowdown to the deficit ratio. Still, the relatively small size of this gap post 2009 indicates that there is a strong structural element in the fiscal deficit. This explains why structural adjustments are so necessary. In response, the ECB has taken policy rates lower than any time during its history (as can be seen in Chart 6). It has also provided ample liquidity to the banking system, as shown in Chart 7, in which the red lines represent the rise in the monetary base (which consists mainly of central bank provision of bank reserves). However, as I have noted on previous occasions, a large part of this liquidity has been deposited back with the ECB, as reflected in considerably slower growth in loans (the blue lines). This is an indication of the hesitancy on the part of the banks to buy securities, or to extend loans, whether to other banks or to the non-financial sector. Some concern has been expressed about the size of the build-up of liquidity across various economies that could be mobilized by the banks in the eventual post-crisis expansion of loans. However, it must also be noted that the excess liquidity can be eventually reabsorbed by the central banks. In any case, it should also be noted that the provision of additional liquidity by the ECB (as shown by the red lines in Chart 7) has been somewhat more moderate than is true for other major central banks such as the Federal Reserve, as shown in the chart. The ECB has now gone a step further by announcing an Outright Monetary Transactions programme, designed to repair the link between policy rate cuts and ample liquidity provision, on the one hand, and lower borrowing costs, on the other. It is also meant to counter the so-called redenomination or convertibility premium that compensates investors for the perceived risk of a breakup of the monetary union. It ties intervention to strict conditions: it will be used only for countries under an EFSF or ESM programme. Transactions are limited to the shorter end of the yield curve, and would complement ESM intervention at the longer end. Moreover, the ECB will not take on a senior position in the debt’s structure, therefore safeguarding the interest of private-sector investors. As is well known, the announcement of the OMT programme has already helped to stabilize the financial markets and reduce sovereign spreads (see Chart 1). It is really equivalent to traditional open market operations that central banks have long resorted to in order to provide stability and a better functioning of the monetary transmission process that can get impaired in certain circumstances. The Maltese situation The Maltese economy has encountered some persistent headwinds. Still, the recession observed in the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 was relatively short and mild. Since then, the economy has shown a modest recovery. During the second and third quarters of this year, real GDP was up 1.6% on the same period of 2011. The inflation rate in Malta has recently exceeded that of the euro area average. The HICP measure of the year-on-year rate of inflation stood at 3.2% in October 2012, compared with a rate of 2.5% in the euro area as a whole. In recent months, Malta’s HICP inflation may have been biased upwards because of methodological changes related to the measurement of tourist accommodation. Meanwhile the RPI, which is unaffected by accommodation prices, stood at 2.9%. It is the RPI that determines with a lag the COLA increase. The core RPI inflation rate, which is a good gauge of persistent inflation, stood at 2.0%. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  On the other hand, a number of labour market indicators remain positive. As seen in Chart 8, the most recent LFS unemployment rate is 6.5%, the same as it was on average in 2007, prior to the euro area crisis. In fact, Malta’s unemployment rate is at the lower end of national unemployment rates across the euro area. Meanwhile the latest registered unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, in June. Malta has avoided the two essential sources of the Euro area crisis: the deficit ratio has been moving in the right direction while the banking model followed by the core domestic banks remained prudent. In Malta, the core banks generally rely on traditional, domestic sources of funds, specifically retail deposits. Malta’s banks remained largely unaffected by the euro area crisis, averting the need for any government assistance and avoided what in other countries became a major source of fiscal overruns and distress. Malta must position itself in a way that builds on the strengths of the economy and minimises its vulnerabilities. In doing so, it would steer clear of the pitfalls that other countries have fallen into and maintain its growth path. In this respect, I will focus on a number of important considerations. On the fiscal side, government spending can be increased on a sustainable basis if government revenue increases on the back of a growing economy. Furthermore, increased expenditure on pensions and health services must be financed in a sustainable way. As the population ages we have to pay sufficient attention to the dynamics that this implies, and of the options available, such that the chosen path would not impinge on economic growth. Government policies must, above all, enhance the efficiency of the productive system, promote investment and incentivise entrepreneurial initiative. Labour market The local higher level of labour force skills and qualifications, as well as its adaptability, have been instrumental in attracting investment in new areas of activity and have therefore reduced the vulnerability of the domestic economy to shocks in foreign demand. Chart 9 shows how Malta’s wages compare with those abroad. On the basis of the purchasing power standard which measures wages by taking into account the cost of living, the average Maltese wage ranks towards the middle of a broad range of selected countries that are shown in the chart. The issue arises as to how to increase living standards in a sustainable way, without losing competitiveness. One should be mindful of the relationship between all costs (including wages) and productivity. A subject that often comes up for discussion is the cost of living allowance or COLA. It has to be recognized that in Malta the allowance is determined on the basis of a basic or social wage, and COLA is a flat euro amount, granted regardless of the level of pay. This limits its impact on competitiveness. Nevertheless, the award of COLA is disconnected from productivity gains and hence may constrain firms’ ability to respond to changing market conditions. It also raises the risk of secondary cost increases after an initial price shock, which may come for example from an increase in imported prices. It may not be possible to neutralise such increases in imported prices and simply compensate for them in wages without significantly losing competitiveness of the enterprises concerned, especially if our competitors are absorbing these external shocks through an internal devaluation. It is relevant to note that the world economy is going through unusual times where some countries are undergoing internal devaluations. Malta cannot afford to be oblivious of the impact that these realities exert on its competitiveness. The list of euro area countries passing through significant corrections is impressive, namely: Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, Cyprus and Greece. This apart from other non-euro area member states that are also going through difficult and corrective changes in their economies. These developments may place our 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  competitors in an advantageous position once the recovery is underway, and this will raise the bar that must be exceeded if competitiveness is to be maintained and improved. Returning to the COLA issue, this should not be imposed on collective agreements by legislation as happens today, but really should form part of the negotiation process. Indeed, already a number of collective agreements incorporate the COLA increase, and I suggest that this should be the norm. It is the whole wage that has to be supported by productivity, and negotiations at the firm level are best placed to ensure that the balance between productivity growth and wage increases is not lost. Otherwise competiveness would be eroded and jobs endangered. Moreover, the COLA is not the sole impediment to adjustments in relative wages. In particular one has to realize that the minimum wage too constrains wage adjustments. It should be kept in mind that this wage is the legally set minimum compensation of employees with limited or no skills, such as school-leavers who unfortunately have not acquired any particular skills. Returning to the minimum wage issue, one commonly used criterion of the impact of minimum wages measures the minimum wage relative to the average wage level, and then compares it with other countries, as shown in Chart 10. As one can see in the chart, the relative minimum wage in Malta is the fourth highest in the euro area, and this may impact the incentive to acquire additional skills or pursue more advanced education. It is worth reflecting on the experience of other countries in this respect. For example, Slovenia increased the minimum wage by 23% in 2010. The IMF, in its reaction to this increase, remarked that this will “hurt employment in labour intensive sectors and put upward pressure on the general wage level, exacerbating already high unit labour cost compared to regional peers. The increase is also likely to reduce incentives for workers to increase their human capital by compressing the wage differential between unskilled and specialized low-skilled workers.”1 From discussions I have had with officials from the Central Bank of Slovenia, it is their considered opinion that the IMF as well as the Commission were right in their assessment. Indeed, a major reason for Slovenia’s increased fiscal gap and loss of competitiveness can be laid at the door of this large increase in minimum wage a few years ago. A similar picture emerges from the experience of Greece and Cyprus that also had significant increases in minimum wages, while labour market inflexibilities have contributed to the loss in competitiveness in Spain and Italy. The most sustainable way to raise living standards is through structural reforms along with investment in education and physical capital (that is, through the promotion of investment in human and fixed capital.) Wage increases are not sustainable unless they are financed from higher productivity and economic growth. Financial stability The financial sector clearly plays a crucial role in the economy. This sector is a prominent employer of trained professional staff, with financial and insurance activities on their own employing 7,280 persons or 4.3% of the gainfully occupied population and contributing 8.5% of gross value added in 2011. The gap between these two ratios is a sign of the relatively high level of productivity in this sector.                                                 1  International Monetary Fund 2011 Article IV Consultation – Staff Report, May 2011. 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  As a matter of fact, as shown in Chart 11, productivity – as measured by the value added per employee in the sector – has risen considerably in recent years and in 2011 stood at nearly EUR 65,000, significantly more than the corresponding per capita value added in the services sector in general, which stands at around EUR 34,000. Bank credit remains the main source of external funding for non-financial businesses in Malta. Moreover, as in most other European countries, bank financing is regarded as the main, if not the only, avenue of external financing for SMEs. External funding is however primarily suitable for large corporates, given the costs and regulatory requirements associated with debt issuance. A more active and innovative debt market is in the interest of the country’s economic growth potential. Undoubtedly this needs to be harnessed through an appropriate macro-prudential policy safeguard of financial stability. Additional sources of financing that deserve further exploration are through the European Investment Bank, and in particular through the European Investment Fund. The latter offers a venture capital facility whereby it helps venture capital and private equity fund managers to provide risk capital to SMEs. Companies can also benefit from the JEREMIE programme (Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises), which promotes increased access to finance for the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU. Over 80% of the balance sheet value of the core domestic banks is funded through customer deposits, considerably higher than the 30% average in the euro area.2 Indeed, customer loans extended by core domestic banks continue to be fully funded from customer deposits. Meanwhile, Maltese banks’ recourse to Eurosystem funding has been modest, as shown in Chart 12, which measures Eurosystem funding as a proportion of the balance sheet. This in itself is a good sign, reflecting the absence of banking distress. Banks must also exercise caution in the use of such sources. Although conditions are currently very favourable, it must be clear that such terms will not last forever. Banks are thus encouraged to continue using such facilities but not become overly dependent on them. Business models which are based on a disproportionate use of Eurosystem funds are not banking models that the Central Bank feels comfortable with. However, the word “disproportionate” is very relevant, since it seems that some Eurosystem funding could be put to a better purpose than lying idle as deposits with the Eurosystem. For example, one possible use is to extend low cost credit for investments that promote restructuring and competitiveness and thus improve potential economic growth. For instance in the case of hotel upgrading or manufacturing restructuring to higher value added activities, banks could explore areas of growth that would benefit the economy and such niche markets could be kept distinct from existing uses of funds, to avoid cross-overs and refinancing of existing loans. The interest rates on such loans may be linked to the MRO rate, plus of course a margin for credit risk. This would provide a clear link to the provision of lower cost funding by the ECB and serve to break this apparent barrier in Malta of providing lower cost loans in tandem with ECB policy. On this issue of interest rate charges in Malta, it is somewhat paradoxical that despite the excess liquidity in the system, several institutions seem to be competing through higher deposit rates offered to customers. Competition is healthy and certainly depositors are better served by having such competition leading to higher returns.                                                 2  ECB, Changes in bank financing patterns, April 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  However, it would be more appropriate if depositors are more fully aware of the basic fact of finance: higher returns are generally accompanied by a higher degree of risk and possible volatility, and depositors should be fully aware of this fact. The deposit guarantee scheme should not be exploited to hide this basic fact of finance. Furthermore, higher deposit rates would require increased loan rates or investments in higher yielding assets. Both of these carry risks which, in the current lower interest rate environment, may lead to greater risk being assumed than perhaps would be the case in normal circumstances. It is therefore prudent for such institutions to hold an increased level of capital buffers so as to compensate for the elevated risk. Indeed, in recent discussions which I had with another euro area central bank governor, an approach that his institution uses is to require higher capital requirements when deposit rates exceed Euribor by more than 300 basis points. This is an interesting proposal which merits further analysis. At the international level, the limitations of current regulation and supervision have become more and more evident with the severity of the financial crisis. Too much attention was focused on individual institutions thereby overlooking the macro-prudential risks. In reaction to this, European institutions and member states have engaged in a major overhaul of bank regulation and supervision, with the objective of making financial institutions safe, sound and transparent. One step towards effective early intervention is the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). This will endow the ECB with the ultimate responsibility for specific supervisory tasks related to the financial stability of banks across the euro area. The need for a single supervisory mechanism arises from the increasing interconnectedness between financial institutions and financial markets across the euro area, such that problems that originate at a national level can quickly spread across national borders and imperil the entire European banking system. A central authority is better placed to spot these risks. However, the SSM framework alone will not be sufficient to successfully address significant threats to financial stability across the euro area, particularly in the light of the possibility of cross-border spill-over effects in the event of bank crises and the link between sovereign debt and bank debt. The European Commission has therefore identified the need for a banking union to strengthen the banking sector and restore confidence in the single currency, and this is projected as part of a longer term vision for economic and fiscal integration. Hence, the idea goes beyond the SSM or single-rule book. As President Van Rompuy points out in his report entitled Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union, the components of this integrated financial framework have to include not only bank supervision (as delivered by the SSM), but also bank resolution as well as bank deposit insurance. Vitor Constancio, Vice-President of the ECB, defines the banking union as a transfer to the European level of the regulatory and institutional framework responsible for safeguarding the robustness and stability of the banking sector. More recently, the Liikanen Report recommends a structural reform of the EU banking sector to limit the likelihood of banking crises, to improve the resolvability of banks and to protect taxpayers’ interests. In this respect, the Liikanen Group concludes “that it is necessary to require legal separation of certain particularly risky financial activities from deposit-taking banks within a banking group.” This form of separation is also being discussed in the U.S. and U.K., although with some variations. It is evident that if this separation is effected, the resilience of banks will be enhanced, systemic risk reduced and tax payers safeguarded. The implications of this proposed framework will also have to be taken into account by the banking industry so as to adjust the banking models used to this now safer but more constrained model. 
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Closing an institutional gap The concept of sustainability can also be applied to the funding of the government’s capital expenditure programme. In particular, the funding of infrastructure and public utilities through fiscal resources may also have to be reviewed in light of the public sector funding constraints. The domestic financial sector has witnessed remarkable structural developments over past years. However, there still appears to be an institutional gap in respect of the financing of certain types of projects for which the hitherto traditional sources of funding – commercial bank loans and government budgetary resources – may not necessarily remain the ideal financing avenues in view of the new challenges facing the financial system. I firmly believe that a development or promotional bank needs to be established. Such a public sector institution would be geared to the promotion of economic activity in its wider sense complementing commercial banks. In my speech during the course of last year’s IFS annual dinner, I had made reference to the important role that the possible establishment of such a bank could play in promoting the economy and assisting the Government in social and environmental projects. Tonight I would like to elaborate further. In my view, a promotional or development bank could be instrumental in contributing to a more effective mobilisation of the substantial excess liquidity characterising the financial sector and to a more efficient deployment of certain types of Government assets, especially underutilised real estate. It should also serve as a catalyst to support the structural, economic, social and environmental policies of the Government, particularly in connection with the long term financing of priority projects. Moreover, there are strong indications that the deceleration in domestic credit activity in Malta is not due to any shortage of liquidity in the banking sector but rather to the reluctance on the part of banks to extend their exposure beyond certain limits to a number of economic sectors. A promotional or development bank could enable such sectors to gain better access to financing support that may not be readily available from other sources on reasonable terms. A promotional or development bank can thus complement the domestic financial sector in instances where free market conditions may appear to be insufficient to achieve the desired public policy objectives. Such an institution would normally be underpinned by certain privileges geared to optimise promotional activities and therefore one would need to ensure that the promotional operations of such a bank would not give rise to any distortions in competitive conditions in the market. More specifically, it would have to ensure that its activities will be fully in line with EU State Aid regulations at the final beneficiary level. A promotional or development bank would be on similar lines as in many EU countries, particularly Germany, where such banks undertake very successfully at a regional level a role in promoting the economy and assisting the government in social and environmental projects. Such banks have the backing of a government guarantee and thus can borrow on the basis of the sovereign rating of the government either locally or from supranational institutions. In this way such an institution can serve to unlock further the financial potential available to spur competitiveness and economic growth without adding to the debt burden of the government. The funding model is based on the repayment of loans and thus is on a sustainable path separate from that of the national debt. This is why such loans raised by such institutions are not captured under the Maastricht criteria of debt to GDP ratios. However, such an institution has to be managed and administered in a prudent and responsible manner. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9  The Central Bank has been looking more thoroughly into this matter and intends to put forward its submissions to the Government with respect to the rationale and feasibility regarding the setting up of such an institution. Conclusion: The importance of sustainability At a time of recession in Malta’s export markets, the preservation of competitiveness is a must, in order to sustain continuing economic growth. In today’s world, economic sustainability requires the adaptation to an evolving external environment and allows the continued improvement of the standard of living without jeopardizing that of future generations. In the eventual post-recession world, many of Malta’s competitors will have gone through a restructuring process and would pose an even stronger challenge. Sustainability has three dimensions. First, a sustainable financial system requires a prudent business model on the part of the banks and other financial institutions and a vigilant oversight of these institutions. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is an EU-level body established with a mandate to oversee the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system, recommended the setting up of an authority or body to make recommendations on macro-prudential aspects of the financial system. The Central Bank in its capacity as the macro-prudential authority has agreed with the MFSA, to set up a Joint Financial Stability Board which will be formally constituted in a few weeks. The objective is to enhance the cooperation between the two bodies for the assurance of the stability of the financial system. The intention is to strengthen the resilience of the financial system and to mitigate the build-up of systemic risks. To these ends, the Board’s mandate includes the development of mechanisms that would identify risks to financial stability, and the establishment of the necessary macro-prudential policy tools. The Joint Financial Stability Board will also be able to make recommendations to the CBM or MFSA boards on macro or micro prudential issues, as the case may be. The board is also responsible to follow-up on recommendations made by the ESRB. Second, in the current situation, it must be ensured that fiscal consolidation is not compromised and the commitments under the Fiscal Pact are achieved. The room for fiscal manoeuvre is very limited at this present juncture of contraction in the euro area economy and the current debt-to GDP levels in the Maltese economy. Third, higher productivity allows sustainably higher wages and living standards. The quality of human capital has to evolve to meet the changing needs of both the domestic and export markets, and for that purpose the educational system must provide the required skills and qualifications profiles. For productivity to maintain its upward trend there must be a continuous upgrading of current investment and a stream of new investment to maintain the necessary structural change to higher value added activities. As I have emphasised in various parts of this presentation, the financial sector plays a crucial role in maintaining the momentum of change in the economy and meeting the financing needs of an evolving economy. In addition it is also a sector of expansion in itself, with its own dimension to the contribution of further growth. Current financial stresses in the euro area will also require updating banking business models and ensuring that new regulatory requirements are met. Prudent banking practices remain a cornerstone of our present stability in a period of heightened international financial stresses and strains. Thank you for your attention.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Benoît Cœuré: SME financing – a euro area perspective  Speech by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Conference on Small Business Financing, jointly organised by the European Central Bank, Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, Centre for Economic Policy Research and Review of Finance, Frankfurt am Main, 13 December 2012. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,1 It is a pleasure to welcome you to the conference on “Small Business Financing” organised jointly by the European Central Bank, the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, the Centre for Economic Policy Research and the Review of Finance. At the ECB, we regard small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as a crucial component of the euro area economy. Indeed, our deliberations on monetary policy systematically take into account the financial health of, and the growth prospects for, euro area SMEs. In particular, the financing environment and access to finance for euro area corporates are important elements in our policy-making process, both for standard and non-standard monetary policy decisions. To illustrate the importance of small businesses in the euro area, consider the following facts: SMEs constitute about 99% of all euro area firms, they employ around three-quarters of euro area’s employees, and they generate around 60% of value added. At the same time, unlike large firms which are generally more profitable and have access to alternative sources of finance, such as bond or equity finance, SMEs are highly dependent on bank loans and credit lines. Due to asymmetric information and a higher risk of failure2, SMEs tend to face higher costs for bank finance and higher rejection rates than larger firms. While finding customers – potentially due to weak aggregate demand – is usually cited as a bigger problem for SMEs than access to finance, it is still the case that they are particularly vulnerable to adverse real-financial feedback loops or supply disruption in the provision of bank credit. Nevertheless, the years prior to the financial crisis were a period of smooth transmission of monetary policy, and there was little evidence that euro area SMEs were constrained over and above levels expected in the context of a sound financial system. After mid-2007, however, the costs of finance started to rise and access to finance started to deteriorate relative to the pre-crisis period. In some euro area jurisdictions, the financial crisis first and the sovereign debt crisis later led to a reduction of the supply of credit to both households and corporates. In particular, rejection rates and rates on granted loans increased, and so did the share of firms citing access to finance as their dominant concern. On average, loans extended to non-financial corporations and households have declined more than during previous crises, mainly because bank funding shocks have been larger than in the past (Chart 1). The ECB has strived to alleviate funding stress by reducing policy rates, as well as by implementing non-standard monetary policy measures to provide liquidity to the banking system, where acute stress has occurred. This has also helped to mitigate the                                                  1 I wish to thank Alex Popov for his contribution to this speech. I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. 2 Small firms as a rule do not enter into publicly visible contracts with employees, suppliers, or customers, do not issue securities that are continuously priced in public markets, and do not have audited financial statements. In addition, about a quarter of new small businesses disappear within two years, and more than half disappear within four years. See: Berger, A., and G. Udell, 2012.

2 BIS central bankers’ speeches risks of disorderly bank deleveraging and to ensure adequate credit supply conditions in the euro area. Since 2010, the sovereign debt crisis has aggravated the funding conditions of euro area corporates and SMEs in particular, both by hurting their growth prospects and by forcing banks exposed to the sovereign debt of a number of euro area countries to rebalance their loan portfolios. By the same token, it is reasonable to argue that by counteracting undue risk premia on government bonds, the ECB’s non-standard measures, such as the OMTs, will contribute to restoring access to finance for the private sector. Let me first talk about the financial situation of euro area SMEs. Before the crisis, survey evidence indicated that the main source of SME finance was retained earnings (around two-thirds). 10% was in the form of trade credit from suppliers or customers, and around 10% from external non-bank sources. About 15% of SMEs’ capital investment and operating expenses were financed with bank loans and credit lines. This average dependence on bank financing was as low as 8% in Portugal and as high as 22% in Ireland3, indicating that small businesses relied substantially on the smooth functioning of the euro area’s banking sector.  At the same time, there was a strong increase in credit growth in the euro area following a persistent easing of bank lending standards. According to the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey, euro area banks steadily relaxed their credit standards for loans or credit lines to enterprises during all but two quarters between Q2 2004 and Q3 2007. While the situation was broadly similar with respect to housing loans and consumer credit, which contributed to the build-up of housing bubbles in several euro area Member States, the corporate sector was still a substantial recipient of an overall euro area credit expansion. One of the adverse consequences of this credit expansion was that the euro area corporate sector had accumulated, on the eve of the global financial crisis, considerably higher leverage than during the early 2000s (Chart 2). This effect was largely driven by micro and small firms, for which financial leverage increased from 0.14 in 2004 to 0.19 in 2007.4 After August 2007, a sharp reversal of this process was observed. Credit standards on loans to enterprises tightened by on average 46% during each quarter between Q3 2007 and Q4 2008 (Chart 3). This process was accompanied by a rapid deleveraging by non-financial corporations. Nevertheless, as late into the financial crisis as the second half of 2009, the ECB’s Financial Stability Report singled out euro area SMEs as particularly vulnerable to further adverse credit market developments, on account of their low profitability and relatively high leverage levels.  The euro area sovereign debt crisis which started in the first half of 2010 and intensified in 2011 further contributed to the already restricted access to bank finance by the euro area corporates. While weakening demand resulting from deteriorating growth prospects in a number of euro area jurisdictions certainly played a role, tensions in sovereign markets affected the supply of bank credit as well. Because potential losses on sovereign debt securities have a direct negative effect on the asset side of the banks’ balance sheets and also affect their ability to pledge collateral to secure wholesale funding, the sovereign debt crisis effectively raised bank funding costs. To the degree that higher bank funding costs force banks to shrink and rebalance their loan portfolio, there should be a negative relationship between the riskiness of sovereign debt holdings and bank credit supply.  Recent evidence supports the view that the sovereign debt crisis has had a negative impact on the supply of bank credit. For example, since early 2010, banks exposed to foreign sovereign debt under stress have been lending substantially less on the syndicated loan market than otherwise similar banks with negligible exposure to foreign sovereign debt under stress (Chart 4). This overall reduction in lending is not driven by changes in borrowers’                                                  3 See the 2004 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 4 Financial leverage is defined as the ratio of the sum of debt securities and bank loans to total assets. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 demand and/or quality or by other types of concurrent balance sheet shocks. Part of the effect is due to the fact that investors update their views on the capacity of the domestic sovereign to support the banking system (the bailout channel). In addition to that, syndicated lending in the countries that have experienced the highest sovereign debt stress has been rebalanced away from domestic lending, reflecting deteriorating profit opportunities at home. This is markedly different from the “flight home” effect observed during the 2008–09 financial crisis.5 Syndicated lending, however, targets large non-financial corporations and so studies based on such data do not easily lend themselves to conclusions on the effects of the sovereign debt crisis on SME access to finance. Moreover, large public firms routinely substitute corporate debt for bank loans, especially during financial crises,6 a shock-absorbing mechanism that is not available to SMEs. A simple comparison between very small loans (typically to SMEs) and very large loans (typically to large corporations) shows a substantial divergence across euro area jurisdictions which has worsened since the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis (Chart 5). More detailed information on SME access to finance can also be extracted from the ECB’s biannual survey on access to finance of SMEs in the euro area (SAFE). The survey suggests that the number of firms citing access to finance as the biggest problem they face has increased from less than 15% in the first half of 2010 to 18% in the first half of 2012 (Chart 6). At the same time, firms do not report an increase in financing needs (Chart 7), implying that loan supply factors dominate. While this picture is purely descriptive, the SAFE also contains detailed firm-level information that allows us to calculate a component of credit constraints which is independent of agency problems. Preliminary analysis suggests that in 2010 and 2011, firms in countries whose sovereign debt was under stress faced on average a 20% higher probability of being credit constrained7 than identical German SMEs. When decomposing the country-level effect into effects due to aggregate demand, credit risk, funding costs and the business cycle, the real interest rate that firms have to pay for credit stands out as the factor explaining the largest share of the cross-country variation in credit constraints. Such an analysis based on our survey on SME finance indeed suggests that for each 100 basis points by which lending rates decline, access to finance for euro area SMEs will improve by about 9%. Emerging case studies also support the view that, by weighing on bank balance sheets, the sovereign debt crisis has led banks to tighten credit supply. For example, micro evidence from bank lending to SMEs in Italy suggests that since the start of tensions in sovereign debt markets, lending by banks exposed to sovereign debt has grown by 3 percentage points less than lending by unexposed banks, and that the interest rate they charge has been between 15 and 20 basis points higher. These effects are stronger for banks relying on domestic interbank funding.8 The Bank Lending Survey by the ECB is another source of information on realised bank lending standards to SMEs. According to the survey, after a period of rapid tightening, lending standards across the euro area had stabilised by the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010. However, starting in the second quarter of 2010 credit standards started tightening                                                  5 Popov, A., and van Horen, N., 2012.

Sette, 2012. Credit supply during a sovereign crisis. Bank of Italy mimeo. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches again, and in December 2011 overall euro area lending standards to SMEs were twice as restrictive as two years earlier. This aggregate development hides important cross-country heterogeneity: for example, over the same period banks in Germany have actually loosened lending standards. This combined evidence implies that, since the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis, credit supply in the euro area has become segmented. In most countries whose banking sectors are insulated from tensions in sovereign debt markets, access to bank credit has not decreased much and credit standards have not tightened more than what is typically observed during this phase of the business cycle. Conversely, in countries where the banking sector has experienced large balance sheet shocks related to deteriorating sovereign debt, access to bank credit has tightened substantially. Elevated premia in such market segments have in turn had repercussions on access to finance for corporates in general and for SMEs in particular. While growth prospects have deteriorated too, and consequently weak aggregate demand may be the dominant problem faced by euro area SMEs right now, impaired access to finance by the corporate sector in a number of euro area countries is clearly a problem that cannot be neglected and will come to the forefront when aggregate demand recovers. Recognising that the sovereign debt crisis has impaired the smooth transmission of monetary policy, the ECB has responded vigorously. First, it has significantly eased the monetary policy stance. In July of this year, the ECB cut the main policy rate to 0.75%, the lowest in its history, and reduced the interest rate on its deposit facility to zero, in an attempt to reduce general market interest rates and to stimulate interbank lending. The ultimate aim of these actions is to restore the smooth provision of credit to euro area corporates and households. In addition to that, the ECB has embarked on a number of non-standard measures: long-term liquidity provision up to three years, enlargement of the collateral set to be used in refinancing operations, direct intervention in the secondary market for government bonds with the SMP programme, and more recently the announcement of the OMTs. The objective of all these measures has been to help restore the transmission of monetary policy and address emerging heterogeneity by relaxing the balance sheet constraints of lenders (banks) and borrowers (firms and households). In this context, the Eurosystem has supported euro area SMEs both directly and indirectly, by allowing banks to pledge corporate loans as collateral with the Eurosystem. The goal is to ensure that firms, and especially SMEs, will receive credit as effectively as possible under the current circumstances. At present, the ECB holds on its balance sheet approximately €35 billion worth of ABSs with underlying SME assets, and approximately €60 billion worth of NFC credit claims. Importantly, even though the policy rate is the same for all EA member states, non-standard monetary policy measures have benefited banks in jurisdictions which have been most severely hit by the crisis. In this sense, the non-standard measures of the ECB have addressed the different funding and stress conditions of the banking system in the euro area. Liquidity provisions, in particular, have helped banks to avoid disorderly deleveraging and have mitigated the decline of finance to the real economy. Research evidence suggests that liquidity policies, such as the fixed-rate full allotment (FRFA) and the longer-term refinancing operations (LTRO), have been associated with a significant economic effect, in that the level of industrial production is 2% higher and the unemployment rate 0.6% lower relative to a scenario with no such non-standard measures.9 It also confirmed the view that, by providing ample liquidity through the FRFA and the LTROs, the ECB has been able, throughout the financial crisis, to reduce the costs arising to banks from restricted access to private liquidity                                                  9 Gianone, D., Lenza, M., Pill, H., and L.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 funding and induce a softening of lending conditions, including to SMEs. This effect has been particularly strong in countries with weaker banking sectors.10 Reactions from the market so far imply that the ECB’s measures have contributed to alleviating stress in sovereign debt markets. The mere announcement of the OMTs, for example, has already helped to ease uncertainty in the system. The effect on confidence, a key factor for growth, has also been significant, and rightly so. Excessive government bond spreads have gone down, corporate bond and covered bond spreads have tightened. The latest Bank Lending Survey suggests that the announcement of the OMTs seems to have mitigated the adverse impact of sovereign risk on banks’ funding substantially by enabling a number of banks to regain market access, particularly in distressed countries. These developments are very important for the prospective financing of the real economy. Let me conclude. Tensions in euro area sovereign markets brought the financial system under stress at a time when it was stabilising in the wake of the global financial crisis. Both market and survey indicators suggest that these tensions have resulted in a deterioration of bank lending, in particular to small businesses. Unconventional monetary policy measures have so far contributed to mitigating funding stresses in the banking system and disordered deleverage. In turn, this has allowed firms and households to maintain access to finance. But the non-standard measures have also helped to remove uncertainty and restore confidence. The ECB will continue to pay particular attention to the situation of euro area SMEs when implementing its non-standard measures. Nevertheless, all actions from central banks, although crucial for alleviating frictions and dysfunctionalities in financial intermediation and the transmission mechanism, and also for guaranteeing financial stability and the sheer survival of the system, cannot replace reforms in individual euro area countries aimed at reducing fiscal and external imbalances and creating an innovative and competitive economic environment. Only such reforms can foster sustainable growth and employment in the future. Thank you.                                                  10 Ciccarelli, M., Maddaloni, A., and J.-L. Peydró, 2012.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Thomas Jordan: Review of the Swiss economy and global economic outlook Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 13 December 2012. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is leaving the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro unchanged. The Swiss franc is still high. An appreciation of the Swiss franc would compromise price stability and would have serious consequences for the Swiss economy. Consequently, the SNB will continue to enforce the minimum exchange rate with the utmost determination. It is prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities for this purpose. In addition, the SNB is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor at 0.0–0.25%. If necessary, it stands ready to take further measures at any time. Essentially, the SNB’s conditional inflation forecast is unchanged from its September forecast. In the short term, price movements will again be subdued by a somewhat weaker economy in the euro area. In addition, the impact which past appreciation of the Swiss franc is having on the price level is rather stronger than had originally been expected. From mid-2013 onwards, the path of the new conditional inflation forecast is almost identical to that of September. The forecast is based on an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.0% over the next three years. Given this assumption, the Swiss franc weakens over the forecast period. Nevertheless, forecast inflation remains low for the next few years. For 2012, the inflation rate will amount to –0.7%. For 2013, we expect inflation of –0.1% and for 2014, 0.4%. In the foreseeable future, therefore, there is no risk of inflation in Switzerland. The third quarter of 2012 saw weak growth and a decline in trading activity worldwide. Although growth in the US economy and some of the emerging economies picked up, a mild recession persisted in the euro area. In Switzerland, real GDP in the third quarter increased again following a temporary downturn. For the fourth quarter, however, we expect significant weakening in growth. Consequently, economic growth in Switzerland for the year 2012 is likely to remain unchanged at around 1.0%. For 2013, we expect growth of 1.0–1.5%. The downside risks for the Swiss economy remain considerable. Although the measures announced by the European Central Bank (ECB) have significantly reduced the probability of extreme developments in the monetary union, there is still substantial uncertainty in connection with the management of the debt crisis in the euro area. It also remains to be seen how far the upcoming budget consolidation in the US will hamper growth. This question is weighing on the sentiment in the financial markets and the real economy. Moreover, momentum in the Swiss residential mortgage and real estate markets remains strong, and has led to a further increase in risks for financial stability. Global economic outlook I would now like to outline the outlook for the global economy and Switzerland in more detail. Then I will look at monetary and financial conditions and the SNB’s monetary policy. In the third quarter of 2012, global economic growth remained weak, while the volume of international foreign trade actually declined. A mild recession persisted in the euro area, and Japan recorded strongly negative growth figures. In the US, growth was supported by private consumption as well as the improvement in residential construction investment. The situation varied in the emerging economies. In some countries, there was scarcely any improvement in economic momentum, while in others – such as China – a supportive economic policy led to some consolidation. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  We still expect that the global economy as a whole will gradually recover. However, we have adjusted our forecast for 2013 slightly down from the last monetary policy assessment. This revision mainly affects the short-term outlook for the euro area. We expect that the euro area will only emerge from the recession during the course of 2013. In the US, the moderate recovery is likely to continue, partly as a result of the favourable developments in residential construction. In the emerging economies, growth should continue to gain momentum. The downside risks for the global economy remain high. The crisis in the euro area continues to weigh on the economic outlook. In September, the ECB initiated a new securities purchasing programme, Outright Monetary Transactions. Although this announcement substantially reduced the probability of extreme events and led to an easing in the financial and credit markets, the economic situation in the monetary union remains vulnerable and the level of uncertainty is still considerable. A further source of uncertainty are the upcoming fiscal decisions in the US. Swiss economic outlook In Switzerland, real GDP in the third quarter increased again following a downturn, due to a temporary recovery in exports. For the fourth quarter, however, we again expect significant weakening in growth. Consequently, economic growth for this year is likely to come to around 1.0%, as forecast to date. For 2013, we expect growth of 1.0–1.5%. While the gradual revival in the global economy is having a supportive effect, the strength of the Swiss franc will hold back export momentum and corporate investment expenditure. Domestic demand is also likely to be restrained over the next few quarters. In view of the modest pace of growth, production capacity in Switzerland will probably remain underutilised in 2013. The rate of unemployment is likely to rise further. Given the fragility of global conditions, the downside risks also remain high for Switzerland. Monetary and financial conditions I will now turn to monetary and financial conditions, which are almost unchanged as compared to the situation in summer 2012. Interest rates in the Swiss franc money market continue to fluctuate around zero. Since mid-June, the three-month Libor has fallen from some 9 basis points to only 1 basis point. Interest rates in the repo market are predominantly negative. In addition, the yield on ten-year Confederation bonds attained a new historical low. This shows that the demand for safe investments remains high. Over the past few months, as before, movements in the Swiss franc mainly reflected the changing risk assessment of market participants. Following the ECB’s announcement in early September that it would purchase unlimited quantities of bonds of crisis-hit euro area countries under certain conditions, the upward pressure on the Swiss franc lessened. The M1, M2 and M3 monetary aggregates, which measure the amount of money held by households and companies, have increased substantially over the past few months. For this reason, some fear that we are heading for high rates of inflation. However, this is not the case. The inflation forecast for Switzerland continues to be low. At present, the inflation rate is still in negative territory. Inflationary pressure remains minimal because of the strong Swiss franc and the relatively unfavourable global growth outlook. Moreover, the underutilisation of production capacities in Switzerland is restraining the inflation outlook. Surveys on inflation expectations show that households and companies continue to assume that prices will remain stable, also in the medium term. Given the current low interest environment worldwide, enforcement of the minimum exchange rate is necessary to ensure suitable monetary conditions in Switzerland. Global uncertainty will persist for the foreseeable future and drive demand for secure investments. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  As a result the exchange rate situation will remain fragile, despite the calmer environment that has come about as a result of the measures taken by the ECB. However, the very low interest rates around the world are also associated with risks. The longer a low interest rate phase persists, the greater the potential danger of speculative price developments and misallocations. Investors searching for yields could place increasing amounts in real estate, and this can lead, in particular, to a rise in real estate prices and thus, to a distorted pattern of incentives. Momentum in the domestic residential mortgage and real estate markets remains exceptionally strong. Mortgage lending continues to grow briskly compared to the economy as a whole. In addition, real estate prices, already at a high level, continued to rise. As a result, risks for financial stability increased further. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will give you an assessment of the situation in the financial sector from the point of view of the SNB. Monetary and investment policy The minimum exchange rate provides us with new challenges for our monetary policy but also for our investment policy. I would therefore like to close with a few words on our foreign currency investments. As you know, in the months May to August, in particular, we had to purchase large quantities of foreign currency in order to enforce the minimum exchange rate. Consequently, the SNB’s foreign currency investments have significantly increased. Also, we cannot exclude the possibility that we will have to intervene substantially again. From the beginning we made it clear that enforcement of the minimum exchange rate was associated with risks. We are endeavouring to reduce the balance sheet risks through suitable diversification of our foreign currency investment. However, the exchange rate risk on the foreign exchange reserves is based on monetary policy considerations and the SNB is therefore obliged to bear it. My colleague, Fritz Zurbrügg, will talk about the management of the foreign exchange reserves in his remarks. Through its monetary policy, the SNB serves as a buffer for the Swiss economy and cushions the effect of severe shocks. Because it has a long-term focus, it is in a position to carry substantial risks. This means we can react flexibly in exceptional situations in order to fulfil our mandate, which is to ensure price stability while taking due account of economic developments.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Fritz Zurbrügg: Financial market developments, management of foreign currency investments and Libor issues Introductory remarks by Mr Fritz Zurbrügg, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Media News Conference of the Swiss National Bank, Berne, 13 December 2012. *      *      * In my remarks, I would like to examine three topics. First, I will expand on what, in our view, are the most important developments in the financial markets since the news conference in June. Afterwards I will address the management of our foreign currency investments. Finally, I will explore some of the issues surrounding the Libor rate, and the global discussion on reference interest rates in money markets generally. Developments in the financial markets As already mentioned by my colleagues, the situation on the international financial markets has eased somewhat since the last news conference. This stabilisation was mainly due to the announcement in late summer by various central banks of a further expansion of unconventional measures. In Europe, the unequivocal declaration by the European Central Bank (ECB) to safeguard unity in the euro area had an especially calming effect on markets. Under its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme, the ECB announced that it would purchase, under certain conditions, unlimited quantities of government bonds with a maximum term of three years. The bonds of peripheral euro area sovereigns, in particular, benefited from OMT. Yield spreads over German government bonds have declined, although they remain at a high level. The euro recovered, on a trade-weighted basis, after having fallen to an eight-year low in July. It appreciated against the US dollar, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling and – to a lesser extent – the Swiss franc. In the US, the Federal Reserve embarked on a third round of asset purchases, intervening in the market to buy agency mortgage-backed securities. Equity markets initially registered distinct gains. The S&P 500 stock market index, for example, climbed 10% between mid-June and mid-September. This was followed, however, by a consolidation phase from October onwards, which reflected the high levels of uncertainty persisting in the market environment. This uncertainty is largely connected to the emergency policy measures in Greece and Spain, the deterioration in the global economic outlook, and the looming ‘fiscal cliff’ in the US. Government bonds perceived as safe benefited from this, with yields persisting at extremely low levels. Against this backdrop, it is notable that the volatility of risky investments has continued to decline. The VIX index, which measures implied volatility on the US stock market, and which is based on option prices, is virtually back down to the level last seen prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007. A very similar picture emerges from implied volatilities on the foreign currency and bond markets. The low volatilities are due to comparatively low demand for options to hedge price movements. This suggests that market participants’ misgivings about prevailing uncertainties have dissipated somewhat, which is likely not least of all a consequence of monetary policy measures by major central banks. In addition, some investors appear to expect that central banks will continue to pursue expansionary monetary policies for the foreseeable future, with low interest rates and an ample supply of liquidity. In Switzerland, interest rates remain at a very low level. The yield on ten-year Swiss Confederation bonds declined to a new low at the beginning of December, at 0.39%. No other government has ever recorded nominal ten-year financing costs at such a low level. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Money market rates also continue to be very low. Interest rates on the repo market are predominantly negative. At 1 basis point, the three-month Libor lies only just above zero. Based on Libor futures contracts, the interest rate expectations of market participants are that the low rate environment will continue for the foreseeable future. Management of foreign currency investments Our foreign currency purchases in early summer to enforce the minimum exchange rate have resulted in high inflows to the SNB’s foreign currency holdings. These holdings have increased by CHF 167 billion since the beginning of the year to CHF 425 billion at the end of November. This is a direct consequence of our monetary policy. In the event that foreign currency purchases are necessary to implement the minimum exchange rate, our foreign currency reserves increase, and the balance sheet expands. Monetary policy requirements also have highest priority when it comes to managing the foreign currency reserves. This is reflected, on the one hand, in the conditions on which we base our investment decisions, namely security, liquidity and performance. On the other hand, the primacy of monetary policy is also evident in the way we implement our investment policy. We proceed here with great caution to avoid causing distortions in the markets. We take account of the security and liquidity requirements for foreign currency investments by ensuring that a substantial part of our portfolio comprises high-quality government bonds. At the end of September, 83% of foreign currency holdings were invested in foreign government bonds or held as sight deposits at other central banks and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). A further 5% were held in other investments, mainly corporate bonds. Approximately 96% of our fixed-income securities are rated AAA or AA. Around 12% of the foreign currency investments are in – exclusively foreign – equities. The SNB thereby holds equities to a value of about CHF 50 billion. I would like to emphasise that all of our equity investments are managed passively. We first decide in which markets we want to invest, and then replicate appropriate share indices. The primacy of monetary policy clearly differentiates the SNB from most other investors. In contrast to these, the exchange rate risk on our foreign currency investments cannot be hedged. This would directly conflict with our monetary policy, since any hedging would be equivalent to a purchase of Swiss francs against foreign currencies, which would intensify the upward pressure on the Swiss franc. Therefore the broadest possible diversification of our foreign currency investments is our sole means of reducing exchange rate risk. At the end of September, 48% of foreign currency holdings were invested in euros, compared with 60% at mid-year, with 28% invested in US dollars, and 24% in other currencies. We are continuously evaluating new asset classes and currencies in both advanced and emerging economies; this year, the SNB began investing in the South Korean won. Our goal is to further diversify our foreign currency investments and thereby reduce risk concentration. To avoid undesirable third-market effects, our entire investment activity is invariably undertaken with a high degree of prudence and caution in respect of potentially adverse effects on markets. This applies equally to inflows and reallocations of investments, as well as to the establishment of new positions. If, for example, we see ourselves confronted with very high foreign currency inflows, we might place these in sight deposit accounts at other central banks, before investing them in securities. The SNB has absolutely no interest in causing market distortions or influencing currency movements in other countries. Issues surrounding the Libor and reference interest rates I would like to conclude by exploring some of the issues in connection with the Libor rate, and the global discussion on reference interest rates in money markets generally. Incidents of the Libor being manipulated, whether already admitted or suspected, are problematic for the reputation of the banks involved, and for the financial sector as a whole. This discussion 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  on the Libor is also significant for us, because we use the three-month Libor in the implementation of monetary policy. No Swiss franc Libor distortions relevant to monetary policy have thus far been ascertained. Furthermore, an SNB survey conducted among banks this year confirmed that the Libor remains an important variable for credit transactions, namely for mortgages. Of the banks surveyed, 80% indicated that they use the Libor as a benchmark for pricing loans. It also continues to play a key role in the pricing of financial products and derivatives. Neither the sharp decline in unsecured loans on the interbank market nor the incidents of manipulation have so far changed this. In July 2012, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK was commissioned to undertake a review on reforming the Libor. At the end of September, the working group convened for this purpose presented its findings in the Wheatley Review, which included a series of proposed measures. These aim to prevent further attempts at manipulation, and to restore confidence in the Libor. The report recommends, inter alia, that rate-setting processes and their oversight be improved, and that certain maturities and currencies be withdrawn. Under the proposals, the three-month Swiss franc Libor will continue to be determined. Thus at present, there are no consequences for the implementation of our monetary policy. Discussions are also currently underway at the international level on the meaning and structure of benchmark interest rates on money markets. The SNB, as member of a BIS working group, is also involved in these discussions. From the point of view of monetary policy and financial stability, the working group identifies core requirements for credible and robust reference rates. Central banks or banking oversight bodies could play a supportive role in reform efforts, inasmuch as the extensive use of benchmark rates affects the general public. However, since reference interest rates are primarily there to cover the needs of the financial markets, market participants are themselves ultimately under obligation.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Stanley Fischer: Recent developments in the Israeli economy – interview with Richard Quest Interview with Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, and Mr Richard Quest, at the Globes Israel Business Conference, Tel Aviv, 10 December 2012. *      *      * Q: On the Israeli economy – we know there is a slowdown, we know it won’t necessarily be as bad as some people have forecast. But you are optimistic. A: The economy is doing well in most respects, and we’re predicting growth for next year of about 3 percent, which until the European economies started declining we thought we might do better than that, we’re not sure about that now. The things that are going well, the inflation rate is in the middle of the target range, the exchange rate is at a reasonable level, the balance of payments is in pretty good shape. Q: What’s not going well? A: Well, the next government is going to have a very large budgetary problem. The Treasury announced last week that the deficit this year will be 4.2 percent of GDP. We’re at full employment now, and that’s a large deficit to have in this situation. And it’s known that they have to cut about NIS 15 billion out of planned expenditure, and they possibly will also have to raise taxes a bit more than they have so far…that’s a huge budgetary problem. One of the reasons for the Prime Minister choosing to go to elections was that he couldn’t get a budget through the coalition – well, its going to have to be done with a new coalition. Q: As far as the growth rate of the Israeli economy – growth rate of 3 percent – are you satisfied with that level of growth, bearing in mind that it seems to be non-inflationary and therefore gives you room for further monetary activity? What will you do in the future? A: Well, the markets think that the interest rate is going to decline once more in the next twelve months. Clearly there is room if necessary to cut interest rates, we hope we won’t get there. We keep a watchful eye on the price of homes, whenever that starts showing signs of going up we have to consider what further cuts in the interest rate will do, or find other macroprudential measures. Q: Is the weakness in the Israeli economy that you are seeing primarily because of external reasons, or is there something going on within Israel? A: A large part of the weakness undoubtedly comes from the global economy and from the fact that exports are not growing as rapidly as they have in previous years. Within the economy, investment demand grew very, very rapidly in 2011 and in some part of 2012. That has slowed down significantly – that presumably means that people looking ahead are less impressed by 3 percent growth than by 5 percent growth which is what we had until 2011, for some time. So I think that’s a potential source of difficulty, and for the rest, I think there is a great deal of uncertainty – geopolitical uncertainty, and there is also governmental uncertainty, about what the next government will do- Q: Let’s talk about that. What are you most worried about what the next government might or might not do? A: Well, that’s a major worry – its not going to be easy to deal with this budgetary problem, in light of the fact they were not able to pass a budget a few months ago. The major challenge is whether the next government will be able to do what was done in 2003, which was to put 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the economy on a very successful course of growth, based on the plan which got the budget into shape and which started liberalizing the economy. That seems to be the major challenge. What’s the concern? That instead of that, because of the political situation or whatever, there will be a budget which just scrapes by. That means that next year, in 2014, we’ll find ourselves again scrambling to get close to a budget target that is not as ambitious as it should be. The deficit for this year, which is supposed to be 2 percent, will be around 4.2 percent. One guesses that next year they’ll be aiming at 3 percent; when they said that 3 percent was the target for this year, we were arguing for something a little bit less. It’s difficult to be ambitious at the beginning; it’s much more difficult to be ambitious later, down the road, when you’ve already not done it once or twice. So that’s really a major concern. The second issue is one which is much more difficult to deal with, which is the issue of the business climate, as seen both from outside and from within. The World Bank issues a report each year called “Doing Business” which ranks countries in terms of how easy it is, or how difficult it is, to do business. In the last two years, we declined from being number 32 on that list, which is not great, to being 38 on the list, which is much less great. That reflects a general feeling that the business climate has deteriorated. It relates to bureaucracy, it relates to places where we stand out as having problems, in the construction process, in a variety of other bureaucratic processes, of registering property, in all of those things we are not doing well. We went far behind on paying taxes…these are things we have to deal with, if we want to get the economy growing again. Q: You are basically saying, the budget is not in great shape and could get worse, the economic situation is slowing down and could get worse, and the business climate which is the engine of growth is not performing as it should and could get worse. Is that what you’re saying? A: Well, it’s always good to have someone translate what I’m saying into English and I greatly appreciate that. But I can say all those things, but I can also say we’re growing at 3 percent, we don’t have a balance of payments problem, we don’t have an inflation problem, and we’re growing faster than almost any economy in the West. Q: If the next government misses its budgetary forecast, and the deficit continues to be above target, that means you, or your successor, will have to take action to rebalance, to maintain the equilibrium. A: Well it depends on the reasons for missing the budgetary targets. If the reason for missing the budgetary target is that the economy has slowed down, and tax revenues have gone down, and the government has stood by its expenditure plans, it’s not obvious that they should try to reduce the deficit at that point. If the deficit has risen because spending has gone up, or something like that, then you’re looking at a different situation. So we have to wait and see. One of the many things that the governments of Israel have fought in the last 6–7 years is to have moved from having one of the highest debt ratios in the Western world to having one of the lowest. Now we moved from 100 percent to 75 percent debt to GDP ratio. The others moved from below 75 to 100. So we have more room to run an expansionary fiscal policy if we absolutely have to do it, in a situation of unemployment and low growth. We don’t need to do that now. Q: Where do you stand in terms of tax rising or spending cuts to help balance the budget – or does it not make much difference to you and the central bank? A: Most research shows that changing expenditures – cutting spending – is more effective than raising taxes as a way of dealing with the budget deficit. But we’ve cut taxes a lot in the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  past years, and the Bank of Israel has argued that the cuts were a little too fast, and they have in fact been rescinded to some extent.  You can’t do these things independent of asking what you are spending on. If we have to increase our defense budget, if we have to increase our education budget, then we’ll have to finance these things. Q: Do you believe there should be an increase on social spending, on education? A: Increasing the efficiency of spending in these areas would be very useful. We have a very big educational problem in this economy, and at some point we are going to have to deal with it. We have been dealing with it, we probably need to do more. Q: Whichever government takes office, there won’t be much time and there won’t be much wiggle room to get this right…If you don’t get a budget deficit under control, it can get out of control very fast. A: If you don’t get it under control in the first year, that is 2013, which will be about half a year, or a little over half a year, it will be much harder to do in the future. Putting off these problems very rarely works. Q: When you go to those meetings, at the IMF and other international forums, and you meet your European colleagues, you’re enormously respected, you’re very well known, your views count – do you ever not want to just say to the European ministers, get your act together – you’re causing mayhem and mischief? A:What are the Europeans trying to do? They’re trying to build a federation at a time of enormous difficulty – enormous economic difficulties and political difficulties. So they’re taking more than a year or two to do it. That’s very frustrating. On the other hand, if they get it done, they will have created a different Europe for the long term, and that’s what we need them to do. Q: You know as well as I do that they built that house badly to start with, and they knew they were building it badly- A: Richard, I must say that I don’t put a lot of weight on what people tell me they knew, when something happened some time ago and they forgot to mention it to me – everyone now knows that they had to get to fiscal union right away. Well, I didn’t hear that in 1994, I didn’t hear it in 1997. I think that we’re all much wiser after the fact. So I’m a little less tough on these guys who didn’t see things. Just as when an economic crisis shows up there are always at least 5 people who saw it coming, and then you say, why didn’t I pay attention to them; and there are another 50 who saw something else coming and you way thank goodness I didn’t pay attention to them. So I have to blame myself. I didn’t see it – I don’t think many people saw it. Q: What do you tell those people in the US who say – lets go over the “fiscal cliff”, because it is the only way that long term structural change will take place – when we see the pain? A: The short term argument is that all the tax reductions of the past decade, and those of this crisis, will expire on December 31 of this year. That means tax rates will have gone up, and then Obama will be in a position, when he wants to cut tax rates, and Republicans want to cut tax rates, and its argued that he will then be in a better position to reach an agreement…I don’t have a lot of faith in this “we’ll cause a lot of pain to the politicians so they’ll do the right thing”. We’ve heard that story all the time, I haven’t seen anything happen yet. I think we better rely on them trying to reach a deal right now. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Q: Central bankers are often in the headlines these days. Has there been a time during recent crises when you – the major central bankers in the world – met and said, we’re doing this, we just don’t know if this is going to work? A: First, “we” does not include “me” – we are not yet members of the G7, the G10, or of the G20…there were meetings where we said something like, “this is what we have to do, we are not certain how it will work out, but this is the very best thing we can do”. Q: What happens to politicians when they get their hands on a budget? A: There’s a natural tendency to want to spend more money, because everybody asks you to spend more money, and the pressure is always people coming along and wanting money for this and for that. That’s why in some countries you need to have a very powerful Treasury, as we have in Israel. There is this spending tendency, governments prefer to run deficits. It’s very interesting that in two cases that culture changed dramatically – Canada in the 1990s and Australia in the 1980s – were chronic-deficit countries In Australia now it’s bad for the government to run a deficit, and in Canada they worry about the deficits much more. Why? Because they cut the deficits and they grew much faster in both cases, they saw the results of running a decent economic policy. Can you rely on that? Not really, it depends on each country. Q: What do you see as your responsibility when house prices, or property prices, get out of kilter? A: We have to do what we can to prevent that happening. The main problem for a central bank is that it operates on the financing side, which is to say on the demand side of the housing market. We can raise the interest rate, impose regulations on the banks, which we’ve done, that will moderate the impact of low interest rates on demand for housing. But…reducing the price of housing on the demand side does not cause more houses to be built, it causes less houses to be built. The real place that you can get action that will solve the housing problem is on the supply side…if you increase the supply of land in this country more rapidly, you will be able to get housing prices down. If you can speed up the pace at which it’s possible to get planning permission, which is the place we’re worst in the Doing Business study – If we can deal with those prices, we’ll get the supply of houses to go up, which will increase production and reduce prices. We have to do what we can because we operate on the demand side, but we don’t have the control over supply that would enable Israel to solve its housing problems. One of the reasons we’ve been growing reasonably is that housing activity has been very strong. Q: You are term-limited to 2015. If I could sign a law giving you a third term – would you want it? Would you take it? A: I believe very strongly in term limits. I have hardly seen anybody get better after ten years on a job. I believe very strongly in this ten year term limit for governors. I thought that I should stop teaching when I stopped being sick to my stomach when I went in and lectured. I lost my fear of the students, I really don’t want to lose my fear of these people and the journalists among them, by being on the job too long. It is still extremely challenging, and it’s a great privilege to have that job. Q: Will you stay in Israel after your term is up? A: I very much want to stay strongly connected with Israel, we have family in the States and we’ll have to decide what we do. But I’m not going to disappear from the local scene, that’s for sure. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Q: I’m choosing my words carefully here…Do you have a desire to play a public role in Israel after you have been Governor of the Bank of Israel? A: There are a few jobs that I would prefer over this one and I don’t think any of them are available, or likely to be available. Q: What brought you to Israel? A: My wife and I, and my family, have been involved with Israel since we were young. We visited pretty regularly…spent Sabbaticals here, we knew Israel reasonably well. In 1983–85 I had the privilege of working with George Shultz when the United States and the Israeli government cooperated to stabilize the Israeli economy We’d always been close to Israel, somebody gave me the opportunity to try to contribute something to Israel, and I said well, I’d always wanted to do that, and I’ll never get another opportunity like this The current Prime Minister was very influential and persuasive, he was the finance minister at the time. We are extremely happy we did it; it’s been a wonderful experience. Q: Is it fair to say that after 2015 we will not have heard the last from you? A: I hope my voice will still be heard. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Matthew Elderfield: Effective enforcement – encouraging compliance and good practice Opening remarks by Mr Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Central Bank Enforcement Conference, Dublin, 11 December 2012. *      *      * I would like to welcome you to the first conference on enforcement that we are hosting at the Central Bank of Ireland. We are very glad to be hosting this event and that you are able to join us here today. Enforcement is an important element of our regulatory strategy at the Central Bank. Our approach of assertive, risk-based supervision is underpinned by having a credible enforcement deterrent in place. Effective enforcement certainly has a corrective element that is designed to ensure accountability for non-compliance with regulatory requirements, both by firms and – as I would like to talk about briefly in a moment – ideally also for individuals. But effective enforcement is much more powerful than simply being about bringing a particular firm or its management to account.  The broader benefit, which supports supervision, is the deterrent effect of enforcement. If firms think there is a credible risk that their own non-compliance with regulatory standards would lead to sanctions from the Central Bank, then that provides a very powerful motivation to boards of directors and senior management teams to ensure a high standard of conduct. The fact that the Central Bank has sanctioned firms and has published details of these sanctions has made some in the industry uncomfortable and leads to pleas to ease up on the use of the enforcement tool. We do not apologise for taking enforcement actions or publicising them. There is no deterrence value unless firms, investors, consumers and the public are aware that we will respond with enforcement action where behaviour and practices fall short. I am firm in my belief that this is a necessary and best practice element in the regulatory toolkit of the Central Bank. And, unless these sanctions are published with enough detail about what occurred and the sanctions imposed the deterrent effect will be diluted. We have purposefully made an effort to be more explicit and detailed in the publicity statements involving enforcement sanctions. The purpose of this is to provide greater transparency to industry, the markets and the public about the nature of breaches that have been committed. The publication of the enforcement action has a reputational impact on the firm and management concerned. A consequence of this approach is that the impact of our enforcement efforts is greater because, frankly, the message is clearly communicated to industry and the public that breaches will not be tolerated. Consequently all firms are powerfully incentivised to avoid enforcement action by being more diligent in respect of regulatory compliance.  This raises standards generally in the financial services sector. It shows that there are consequences for non-compliance. And it is an efficient use of resources. Rather than trying to individually mark all the firms that we supervise, the risk of enforcement action has a multiplier effect across the regulatory population in terms of encouraging compliance and good practice. It is, for example, particularly useful for the large population of smaller, low impact, firms where we cannot have a routine supervisory interaction. The benefits of enforcement are therefore very clear in terms of raising standards. These benefits are not only recognised in Ireland but, of course, across many other jurisdictions in Europe and more generally internationally elsewhere. Enforcement actions are taken by supervisors in Ireland, in the UK and the US, and also across the European Union including France, Germany, Sweden, Malta and Luxembourg for example. So, I think concerns over the competitiveness impact of taking enforcement actions, which is a point sometimes put to me, is somewhat overstated.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  And to be clear, I don’t think it makes sense to somehow ring fence international firms from the scope of potential enforcement action. We see weaknesses in governance, systems and controls and other breaches amongst international firms, just as we do for domestic ones. Protecting Ireland’s reputation as an international financial centre is important and means that both firms and the Central Bank need to be vigilant about standards in this sector. What about the argument that it’s not fair to take enforcement action for mistakes? Or that when a management team self-reports a breach they should get an exemption from enforcement? These are, frankly, well-trodden and somewhat hackneyed arguments. These are certainly relevant factors to consider during the enforcement process, and typically would be given consideration when assessing the correct sanctions. But the clear international practice is that enforcement still takes place in such circumstances. It is important that the deterrent effect still applies to inadvertent breaches and to self-reported ones as well. To do otherwise, would be to effectively turn a blind eye to the requirements which we are required to uphold and would encourage a culture of slackness that would sow the seeds of significant detriment to consumers and damage the financial stability. So, let me be clear, enforcement in the financial sector in Ireland is here to stay. We aim to be transparent about our particular enforcement priorities in any given year and publicly state what these are. We are clear that certain types of breaches will be more likely to attract enforcement action than others. Additionally, we allocate resources to take cases on a reactive basis so that we can respond appropriately to serious breaches. Enforcement is not automatic for all breaches and involves collaborative effort between the supervisory teams and the enforcement directorate. We exercise judgement and discretion in using the tool.  I’m very pleased by the progress we have made over the past three years with our enforcement strategy. We have established a good track record of taking cases against financial services firms for a wide range of breaches. In the last three years, the Central Bank has concluded 30 administrative sanctions cases and imposed approximately €13.3 million in fines. We can see the benefit of this in terms of behaviour in the industry. For example, financial firms’ efforts to provide restitution in overcharging cases tended to drag on interminably prior to setting a strict deadline backed up by the threat of enforcement action – and by taking a couple of cases. We have targeted transaction reporting as an area of concern and see firms tightening up the procedures as a result. We have sent a strong signal to firms both domestic and international that their systems and controls need to be strong and robust. We have also, as part of our mandate to protect consumers, focused on how firms handle complaints from their customers, emphasising to firms the importance of consumer protection and professional interaction. I would like to thank the staff of the enforcement directorate of the Central Bank and also those supervisors will help prepare enforcement cases for the good work in making this happen. But while we have quickly delivered on our enforcement strategy in terms of actions against firms, we still have some way to go to conclude successful actions against individuals involved in the management of financial firms. Generally speaking, firms tend to settle but individuals tend to fight their corner to the bitter end. So be it. That means that the process is protracted, both for financial regulators and other enforcement authorities. So, there is a need for considerable patience and determination. The introduction of the fitness and probity regime was an important step forward in developing a comprehensive and effective regime. The ability to remove persons occupying important functions within regulated firms where they fail to meet the required standards of fitness and probity, and indeed prevent those who do not meet such standards from entering the industry, will ensure greater confidence and trust in persons occupying important functions within regulated firms.  All that said, I think it would be useful to find an appropriate mechanism to provide a measured analysis of and reflection on our overall structures in Ireland for taking cases 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  against individuals for breaches of financial regulation or indeed for cases of white collar financial crime. This is a challenging area in most, if not all, countries, but I think many people in Ireland have the impression that the national track record here could be stronger. The Central Bank, and its predecessor the Financial Regulator, has only applied financial sanctions to seven individuals during the past 10 years. We do have some substantial cases against individuals in the pipeline, but they are taking a lot of time. Similarly, on the criminal front, despite the efforts of the Gardaí, DPP and ODCE, we are still some way from the start of criminal proceedings, never mind their successful conclusion, of the cases arising from the financial crisis. Looking further back, we can see that it has taken a long time for high profile cases and tribunals to reach their conclusions.  Taken together, this track record arguably undermines public confidence in the “enforcement system” broadly defined and weakens its deterrent impact to head off the next crisis or scandal. Surely, then there is a case to step back and ask some rather fundamental questions. This is not just a question of delivering speedier enforcement action against individuals – but without cutting corners – although that is part of it. It is about examining whether the current enforcement system is able to really deliver results when it comes to individuals who are responsible for financial failures that impose costs on society, for breaches of financial regulatory standards and for financial white collar crime more generally.  This is clearly a difficult area where frankly many other countries struggle as well. But let me very briefly suggest a few possible areas that could be explored. A coordinated strategic approach is necessary for effective enforcement. At a high level, it would first make sense to examine the respective roles and missions of the principal enforcement bodies involved with financial white collar crime and, as part of this, to assess the capabilities and resources for delivering their objectives. It would additionally make sense to assess whether there are best practice enforcement techniques that can be adopted from other leading jurisdictions. It would also be useful to carefully review whether the existing legal framework for collecting evidence and pursuing cases is appropriately calibrated to ensure success. In November 2010 the then Director of Corporate Enforcement made a commendable submission to the Department of Justice on their White Collar Crime white paper, highlighting the problems with the current system, and suggesting possible reforms. He also raised a concern over the rules governing questioning of suspects and, to its credit, the government is acting quickly on this matter. It seems to me that these proposals have merit.  More fundamentally, I would argue that we should use the opportunity to examine some of the underlying legal offences in the area of financial white collar crime and to consider whether they need amendment or bolstering. For example, regarding administrative sanction cases taken by the Central Bank, how strict a test of responsibility should be applied to directors and senior management – i.e. the individuals themselves – of a firm that has been in breach of regulation and is itself subject to sanctions? Should we, like the FSA has proposed and the UK Treasury committee is considering, introduce some degree of presumptive liability or sanctions for directors of banks which failed and required public support? Should there be a general offence – either civil or criminal – for reckless trading of a financial services company? What other adjustments to the legislative framework might result in more effective enforcement action against individuals in cases of financial white collar crime? These matters require close scrutiny and careful debate, and not all should necessarily make it to the statute book. But it is important that these issues are examined systematically in a thoughtful and considered way as part of a broader, strategic initiative to strengthen Ireland enforcement capability and effectiveness. These matters deserve some public debate, as well as expert study. Indeed such an approach can be seen from the Department of Justice’s white paper on Crime – currently 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  being prepared – which includes a section on organised and white collar crime, and has been the subject of public consultations and submissions, with many of the matters referred to here being raised. This may usefully lead to a package of policy proposals to enhance the Irish enforcement system. This will not change the rules of the game or prospects of the financial crisis cases that are currently in the pipeline at the Central Bank or shortly before the courts (although the lessons from the proceedings should also inform the reform agenda) – but it will strengthen the system for the future. What is the best way to go about this? The Law Reform Commission? A Government Green Paper? A Wise Persons Report? Some mechanism for a measured and careful analysis of the issues in the round would seem to make sense, alongside a thoughtful public debate on the issues. Perhaps some of the leading academic bodies in Ireland might facilitate and stimulate discussion in this area, for example. But we should somehow take the opportunity to ask some searching questions about how we can raise our collective game to ensure that we have a truly effective enforcement system that delivers deterrence where it really counts: at the door of the individual who breaks the rules. Only then will we be able to take comfort that we have created a system that will help deter the origins of the next financial crisis. Just as the impetus for our internationally lauded criminal assets bureau came from the tragic circumstances surrounding Dublin’s gangland problem in the 1990s, so too should the recent financial crisis provide a catalyst and opportunity for Ireland to create a truly effective system to assist in the fight against white collar crime, bringing with it individual responsibility for the actions of persons who hold senior positions in financial institutions.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mark Carney: Guidance Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, 11 December 2012. *      *      * Introduction It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss guidance. Guidance is fundamentally about managing expectations, so let me manage yours up front. This speech is primarily about policy guidance; it will not itself provide new policy guidance. We all need guidance from time to time – we look to our parents, teachers, partners and peers for their help to make life, career or major financial decisions. Ultimately, though, these decisions are ours to make, and the consequences ours to bear. Taking responsibility is why you became Chartered Financial Analysts: to learn how to analyse information, to make difficult valuation and credit decisions, and to bear the risks and reap the rewards that result. You rely on accurate and full disclosure by the companies you analyse. Without it, you could not do your jobs; and, indeed, financial markets could not do theirs of bringing together savers and investors to allocate capital efficiently. With more CFA Charter holders per capita than any other major jurisdiction, Canada is favoured by such an emphasis on fundamental analysis at the core of our system. Beyond disclosure, what else can be usefully conveyed? Does the communication of companies’ expectations of performance serve a purpose? What about central bank expectations about future policy? In my remarks, I will discuss where such guidance can be effective and when it may be warranted. My main message is while transparency is critical to well-functioning capital markets and effective monetary policy, forward guidance of policy is best used sparingly in normal times. In extraordinary times, however, conditional guidance can be used to resolve time inconsistencies and achieve a better path for the economy. First, allow me to address the private sector use of guidance and its impact on the financial markets. Company disclosure An ongoing focus of regulators is ensuring that company disclosure is full, fair and timely. The crisis demonstrated the need for better disclosure by financial institutions. Insufficient and inconsistent disclosure by financial institutions contributed to uncertainty and eroded market confidence. This led to a withdrawal of market liquidity, depressed valuations and increased funding pressures. Regulators and market participants are addressing these shortcomings. An Enhanced Disclosure Task Force was formed last May at the initiative of the Financial Stability Board. This private sector Task Force is a unique undertaking that brings together senior officials from the banking sector, investors, analysts, rating agencies and audit firms, in consultation with international standard-setting bodies and national regulators. In its October report, the Task Force outlined principles and recommendations for improved risk disclosures that are better aligned with banks’ risk management and business strategies. Together with regulatory initiatives and capital increases, these measures will contribute to improved market confidence in financial institutions. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Earnings guidance That companies should communicate material facts about their businesses, and do so to everyone at the same time, is no longer controversial.1 There are, however, differing views as to whether companies should also provide their expectations of how their businesses will perform. Most research finds little evidence that earnings guidance systematically improves company valuations, increases shareholder returns or reduces market volatility.2 Some even argue that forward earnings guidance can be harmful, focusing both financial market and company management attention on a short-term “numbers game” at the expense of long-term business fundamentals.3 Accordingly, a number of companies have stopped providing earnings guidance, with research finding that these companies do see a subsequent increase in analyst forecast dispersion and a decrease in forecast accuracy – but no change in actual market volatility.4  Is central bank communication different? First and foremost, central banks pursue transparency to be accountable in democratic societies. Moreover, research and experience demonstrate that clear and open communications also enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, successful monetary policy requires transparency around two aspects of the policy approach – what we are trying to achieve and how we go about achieving it. With respect to the former, Canada has benefitted from a clear objective for monetary policy since the adoption of an explicit inflation target in 1991. As Canadians have come to understand the Bank’s policy objective and have gained confidence in its attainment over time, inflation expectations have become firmly anchored around the 2 per cent target. This confidence allows households and firms to make longer-term plans with greater confidence, aligning their savings, investment and spending decisions with a common inflation-control objective. These actions collectively serve to make the inflation target self-reinforcing. They also give the Bank greater latitude to respond aggressively to economic shocks without fear of dislodging longer-term inflation expectations. In short, the common understanding of our monetary policy objective makes its attainment easier. Of course, it would be quite remarkable if simply communicating the monetary policy objective were sufficient to ensure its achievement. The conduct of policy obviously matters as well. The Bank of Canada implements policy through changes in the target overnight interest rate, which has a limited direct impact on saving, investment and spending decisions. Far more important is the impact the Bank’s actions have on the broader spectrum of market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate. What matters to these asset prices, however, is not so much the current setting of the policy interest rate but, rather, its expected path over time. Thus monetary policy affects the                                                 1  Regulation Fair Disclosure was adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000 to address the problem of selective disclosure of information by publicly traded companies and other issuers. Regulation FD provides that when an issuer discloses material non-public information to certain individuals or entities, the issuer must make full public disclosure of that information. 2  J.L.

We now explain our decisions eight times a year and provide rich supplemental detail in our quarterly Monetary Policy Report.7 These communications are designed both to report the Bank’s views on the forces at work on the Canadian economy and to help households, firms and financial market participants understand how the Bank will respond to those forces over time. The goal here is, in effect, to allow markets and the public to “think along with us,” not only promoting the appropriate formation of policy expectations given current information, but also allowing those expectations to evolve efficiently as new information is received. We would have an easy time communicating our “reaction function” if we followed a simple mechanical rule. Life would indeed be easier if we could be so rigid. But achieving our target requires that we take a flexible policy approach, one informed by considered analysis and judgment. That is one reason why transparency – and occasionally guidance – matters. Guidance in normal times to help achieve the monetary policy goal In a perfect world, guidance would be unnecessary. The inherent uncertainty in economic outcomes and thus in the policy path would be widely understood. With full information and efficient markets, monetary policy expectations would effectively take care of themselves – knowing a central bank’s inflation objective and its reaction function would be sufficient for markets and the public to form and evolve their expectations, without the need for any direct guidance from the central bank. In the real world, monetary policy guidance can be useful in providing additional information. But this is not assured. How to get guidance right remains a subject of considerable debate. One approach is to provide advance signals to markets, using stock phrases or code words. Not surprisingly, this sort of signalling helps market participants predict policy decisions in the near term.8 But it is not clear that fulfilling promises helps market participants understand why those decisions are taken.9 Without this understanding, market participants may be even less able to form efficient expectations over time, thus increasing their reliance on explicit guidance from the central bank. Ultimately, the risk is that markets turn into an echo chamber, to the benefit of no one. Some other central banks directly disclose their policy interest rate forecast. “Putting it all out there” is, on its face, an appealing approach. It avoids the challenge of trying to perfectly                                                 5  J. Boivin, “How People Think and How It Matters,” a speech delivered to the Canadian Association for Business Economics, Kingston, Ontario, 23 August 2011. 6  Note the contrast here to company earnings guidance, where expectations are essentially irrelevant to how the business actually performs, except indirectly through their effect on valuations and, thus, company funding conditions. 7  J.

4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  calibrate verbal guidance. It also makes it easier to illustrate how monetary policy interacts with the economy.10  In practice, however, it does not appear that markets take systematic account of the guidance offered by a published path beyond the very near term. Overall research has not generally found that publishing a path leads to better outcomes.11  At the Bank of Canada, we take a different approach. We seek to provide the appropriate degree of transparency regarding how we intend to achieve our policy objective by regularly reporting on the forces we see at work on the economy and helping markets and the public understand how policy responds. The Bank occasionally provides guidance in normal times to give some sense of the imminence and degree of prospective policy action. We seek to place that guidance in the context of the most important economic and financial factors that will determine whether it is prophetic. This guidance is never a promise, however. Actual policy will always respond to the economic and financial outlook as it evolves. Market expectations of policy should do the same, reflecting differences in perspectives amid a common understanding of our objective. Let me offer some specific examples where the provision of additional guidance in normal times on the path of interest rates might be helpful. Headwinds and the neutral policy rate First, through the spring and summer of 2011, it became clear that some Canadian market participants were making the short-hand assumption that the policy interest rate needed to be at neutral when inflation was on target and the output gap was closed.12 It was not fully appreciated that, in an environment of material headwinds, the last two conditions would only be satisfied if the policy rate remained at a more stimulative level to offset the impact of weaker foreign demand on the domestic economy. To clarify our approach and guide market participants, we inserted a Box in our July 2011 Monetary Policy Report (Charts 1 and 2). This helped reduce unrealistic views of the pace of future tightening. Communicating the links between price stability and financial stability A second example concerns the links between price stability and financial stability. Our flexible inflation-targeting framework requires that we re-evaluate – and communicate – the optimal path for returning inflation to target, taking due consideration of the consequences for volatility in output and financial markets. The variation in that optimal path has resulted in an inflation-targeting horizon as short as 2 quarters and as long as 11 quarters since the Bank began publishing its projections for inflation in 1998. The global crisis was a stark reminder that economic stability and financial stability are inextricably linked, and that pursuing the first without due regard for the second risks                                                 10  Publishing the policy rate forecast path corresponding to the central bank’s forecasts of growth and inflation helps to communicate both the central bank’s prevailing views on the economy and its policy reaction function, which in turn should help policy expectations evolve efficiently as new information arrives. 11  11.

Hofmann, “Gauging the Effectiveness of Quantitative Forward Guidance Evidence from Three Inflation Targeters,” European Central Bank, Working Paper No. 1098, October 2009; C. E.

While the primary tools to deal with financial stability are micro- and macroprudential regulation and supervision, it may be appropriate in some circumstances for monetary policy to contribute to financial stability directly by complementing macroprudential policy.13  More specifically, because the consequences of financial excesses may be felt over a longer horizon than other economic disturbances, the potential may exist for tension between price and financial stability considerations over the typical monetary policy horizon. In current circumstances, the Bank may want to set interest rates higher than would otherwise be warranted to bring inflation back to target within the typical six- to eight-quarter time frame. But that flexibility does not exist in a vacuum, and should never be used by stealth. The most recent Financial System Review elaborates on risks related to household imbalances in Canada. Their evolution may be a factor affecting the timing and degree of any withdrawal of monetary stimulus. If the Bank were to lean against such imbalances, we would clearly say we are doing so, and indicate how much longer we expect it would take for inflation to return to the 2 per cent target. Our current guidance is that “some modest withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus will likely be required, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. The timing and degree of any such withdrawal will be weighed carefully against global and domestic developments, including the evolution of imbalances in the household sector.” Our current guidance indicates that some policy action may be necessary, encouraging a degree of prudence in household borrowing. The share of new fixed rate mortgages has almost doubled to 90 per cent this year, reflecting the combination of attractively priced fixed-rate mortgages and the tightening bias of the Bank of Canada. Guidance as an unconventional policy tool While the Bank believes it appropriate to be sparing in forward policy guidance under ordinary circumstances, the calculus changes under extraordinary ones. When conventional monetary policy has been exhausted at the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, the additional stimulus that is likely to be called for is impossible to achieve using the conventional interest rate tool. Extraordinary forward guidance is one unconventional policy tool, along with quantitative easing and credit easing.14  The Bank of Canada used extraordinary forward guidance in April 2009, when the policy interest rate was at its lowest possible level and additional stimulus was needed. At the time, we committed to holding the policy rate at that level through the second quarter of 2010, conditional on the outlook for inflation. In effect, we substituted duration and greater certainty regarding the interest rate outlook for the negative interest rate setting that would have been warranted but could not be achieved. The Bank’s conditional commitment succeeded in changing market expectations of the future path of interest rates, providing the desired stimulus and thereby underpinning a rebound in growth and inflation in Canada (Chart 3).15 When the inflation outlook – the explicit condition – changed, the path of interest rates changed accordingly.                                                 13  Bank of Canada, Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target, November 2011. 14  Bank of Canada, “Framework for Conducting Monetary Policy at Low Interest Rates,” MPR, April 2009. 15  See Z.

6 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Our conditional commitment worked because it was exceptional, explicit and anchored in a highly credible inflation-targeting framework. It also worked because we “put our money where our mouths were” by extending the almost $30 billion exceptional liquidity programs we had in place for the duration of the conditional commitment. And it worked because it reached beyond central bank watchers to make a clear, simple statement directly to Canadians. Obviously the optimal policy path will differ for central banks, depending on their circumstances and mandates. For example, the Federal Reserve indicated at its September meeting that its policy rate could be expected to remain at exceptionally low levels until mid-2015, and provided additional certainty with respect to its reaction function by linking future unconventional monetary policy to substantial improvements in the outlook for the U.S. labour market. Further, it indicated that it will leave highly accommodative policy in place “for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.” The Fed also expanded its large-scale asset purchases, dubbed “QE3,” consistent with this enhanced forward guidance.16  Guidance and time inconsistency Doing more may require overcoming the familiar monetary policy challenge of time inconsistency – but not as it has been conventionally understood.17  Today, to achieve a better path for the economy over time, a central bank may need to commit credibly to maintaining highly accommodative policy even after the economy and, potentially, inflation picks up. Market participants may doubt the willingness of an inflation-targeting central bank to respect this commitment if inflation goes temporarily above target. These doubts reduce the effective stimulus of the commitment and delay the recovery. To “tie its hands,” a central bank could publicly announce precise numerical thresholds for inflation and unemployment that must be met before reducing stimulus.18 This could reinforce the central bank’s commitment to stimulative policy in the future and thus enhance the stimulative impact of its policies in the present, helping the economy escape from the liquidity trap. Further enhancing guidance may require a change in framework From our perspective, thresholds exhaust the guidance options available to a central bank operating under flexible inflation targeting. If yet further stimulus were required, the policy framework itself would likely have to be changed.19 For example, adopting a nominal GDP (NGDP)-level target could in many respects be more powerful than employing thresholds under flexible inflation targeting. This is because doing so would add “history dependence” to monetary policy. Under NGDP                                                 16  U.S. Federal Reserve, Federal Open Market Committee Press Release, 13 September 2012. 17  In the days before independent central banks, governments could not credibly commit to maintaining low and stable inflation, since they subsequently had the incentive to violate that commitment by engineering a growth-boosting inflation surprise. This time inconsistency led to the unfavourable stagflation equilibrium of the 1970s, and ultimately resulted in the widespread operational independence of central banks. See F. Kydland and E. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,” Journal of Political Economy 85 (3) (1977): 473–92. 18  See, for instance, C. L. Evans, “Perspectives on Current Economic Issues,” a speech delivered to the Bank of Ann Arbor Breakfast, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 18 September 2012. 19  In most jurisdictions, including Canada, a change in the policy framework would require the approval of the political authority. In some others, it would require a change in the constitution. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7  targeting, bygones are not bygones and the central bank is compelled to make up for past misses on the path of nominal GDP (Chart 4). Bank of Canada research shows that, under normal circumstances, the gains from better exploiting the expectations channel through a history-dependent framework are likely to be modest, and may be further diluted if key conditions are not met. Most notably, people must generally understand what the central bank is doing – an admittedly high bar.20  However, when policy rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, there could be a more favourable case for NGDP targeting. The exceptional nature of the situation, and the magnitude of the gaps involved, could make such a policy more credible and easier to understand.21  Of course, the benefits of such a regime change would have to be weighed carefully against the effectiveness of other unconventional monetary policy measures under the proven, flexible inflation-targeting framework. Conclusion Companies can talk about their future performance, but cannot guarantee its delivery. Central banks can talk about the future path of policy, and we can, at least on the surface, deliver. However, in ordinary times, achieving our objective will mean delivering a path of policy that adjusts as economic circumstances evolve. Therefore, that path cannot be predicted with certainty in advance. In the Bank’s view, this limits the effectiveness of policy guidance to relatively special circumstances. In extraordinary times, policy guidance may be more appropriate, and, as the Bank has demonstrated with its conditional commitment, it can be highly effective. But, in more extreme circumstances, even such a conditional commitment may prove insufficient. In order to provide even greater stimulus when at the ZLB, central banks can further “restrain” their future policy path through pre-commitment or history-dependence. In all cases, central banks must be mindful of the impact on financial stability of what amounts to a “low for long” interest rate environment. This puts a premium on co-ordination among the relevant authorities to provide active macroprudential management. Our goal, as always, is to ensure that households, firms and investors can make their decisions in a stable macro environment. That will ensure that the fundamental analysis that CFAs perform every day plays a central role in capital allocation, business investment and ultimately jobs and growth.                                                 20  In particular, for the benefits of a history-dependent monetary policy framework such as NGDP targeting to be realised, people must be forward-looking, fully conversant with the implications of the regime and trust policy-makers to live up to their commitment. As Bank research has shown, if these conditions do not fully hold, these approaches could in fact prove destabilising to the economy and damaging to the central bank’s credibility. 21  21. Depending on the depth and duration of the ZLB episode, our calculations suggest that the adoption of a (temporary) price-level target, if well understood and credible, could eliminate more than half of the losses associated with the impossibility of providing additional monetary stimulus through a lower policy rate.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Barry Whiteside: Fiji’s new flora and fauna banknotes and coins Welcome address by Mr Barry Whiteside, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the unveiling of Fiji’s new design flora and fauna banknotes and coins, Lami, 12 December 2012. *      *      * Your Excellency, The President of Fiji, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau First Lady, Adi Koila Nailatikau The Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama Ministers Members of the Diplomatic Corps Board Directors of the Reserve Bank of Fiji Distinguished Guests Management and Staff of the Reserve Bank Ladies and Gentlemen Bula vinaka and a very warm welcome to you all on this very special occasion. I say “special” because it is extremely rare that we get to change the designs on all our currency denominations at one time! Today, we will unveil Fiji’s new flora and fauna banknotes and coins, a new $2 coin to replace the $2 note and, for the first time, a banknote using the polymer (plastic) substrate. These are the biggest currency design changes the Reserve Bank has undertaken in recent times and we are indeed honoured that you could be here with us today to celebrate this milestone. While we are all eager to unveil our new currency and see what the response is, please allow me to take you back in time for just a few moments and reminisce a little over the old currency with which many of us were raised. For the younger generation, this is a piece of history that I wish to share with you. Our first truly Fijian currency was introduced 78 years ago in January 1934, emulating the pounds, shillings and pence system of our British colonial period. It took us 35 years to realise that a decimal system was much easier on the brain and it was in January 1969, that we made the changeover to the present decimal currency, or dollars and cents. Those of us old enough will recall that we started with the 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 cent coins and 50 cent, $1, $5, $10 and $20 notes. Over the years as transaction patterns and volumes changed we adapted by changing our notes and coins structure. In 1970, the 50 cent note was coined. In 1995, we coined the $1 note and introduced a higher $50 note denomination.12 years later in 2007, we introduced the $100 note which is currently our “flagship” denomination. At the same time we also issued banknotes of different sizes, mainly to assist the visually impaired. In 2008, we ceased the issuance of 1 and 2 cents coins and in 2009 we introduced smaller and lighter coins to achieve cost efficiency. These new coins featured different edges, again to assist the visually impaired. This currency journey has been a long and interesting one, with many fascinating chapters. At each new stage of our progress towards currency modernisation, changes were introduced, either in the form of design, size, security features or metal composition. Our notes, however, have always been of the cotton-based/paper variety – until today! Some of us may be still keeping a few old notes and coins. I suggest you keep them well, for they will appreciate in value over time. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in 78 years, with the exception of our two millennium banknotes which featured Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, we will be parting ways from a long standing tradition of having the effigy of a British Royal on the obverse or front of our notes and coins. We started with King George V in 1934 and are now ending with Queen Elizabeth II. While some of us will be saddened by this we need to look ahead and embrace change, especially when it is a change that embraces our very own heritage and unique biodiversity. Our currency, from today, will feature a number of Fiji’s iconic flora and fauna. Some of these species are not found anywhere else in the world. Some of them are critically endangered and some of them are sadly believed to be extinct, since they have not been sighted for some time. So what better way to embrace and share our uniqueness and heritage than on our own currency. All Fijians will get to know and recognise the importance of what we have. Who honestly knew what a saqāmoli was before we put it on the $1 coin? Today we will all probably learn something new about the flora and fauna around us. In fact I could almost guarantee this. And like the saqāmoli, these Fiji treasures will become everyday reminders when we look at our coins or notes – everyday reminders to protect the uniqueness with which we have been blessed. Ladies and Gentlemen, like all other issuers of currency, the Reserve Bank must ensure the integrity of our notes and coins. We need them to be readily acceptable to the public and easily distinguishable from counterfeits or the currency of other countries. Print and copy technology development moves so fast now and it is imperative that we move with the changes. If we don’t, the counterfeiters will have a field day. Usually, as custodians of Fiji’s currency, the Reserve Bank will undertake a review every 10 years, or sooner if there is a need. Changing the designs and security features on our currency is a complex exercise; one that requires a lot of research and planning. It is also important to have a vision of what we wish to achieve and a consensus from the decision makers. In this latest review I am pleased to say that we were able to strike a perfect balance between these requirements. We were able to bring together the necessary pre-requisites from within our local community and our very reputable international suppliers to achieve what we think are outstanding results. The proof however remains to be seen after the unveiling, when you will also be the judges. Let me briefly take you through the journey of this latest review which began in February 2010, the period when we were commemorating the International Year of Biodiversity. In July 2010, the Reserve Bank obtained approval from the Cabinet to carry out a review of our existing designs, banknote substrates and possible coining of the $2 note, an exercise that the RBF is mandated to carry out under the RBF Act. This approval also included the replacement of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s effigy with abstract or non-portrait designs. It was at this time that we had an initial meeting of the Reserve Bank’s internal Currency Technical Committee (CTC) which was mandated to explore new design banknotes and coins that would exclude the royal effigy and that would reflect our national and cultural heritage. This committee is chaired by the Governor and includes four other members of executive management and members of the Bank’s Currency team who provide technical expertise. The CTC was also requested to review the current banknote substrate and the option of coining the existing $2 note. We were looking for a modern new currency design and structure that would reflect Fiji and suit the Fijians of today. The selection of the all-important subjects and designs for our currency was the job of the Currency Design Committee (CDC) which was established in July 2010, with the approval of the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. The members of the CDC were drawn from various cross sections of our Fiji community, some of whom had already provided their valuable expertise in previous currency review exercises. Each are experts in their respective fields. We also sought other expert advice when necessary. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The CDC in the early stages of its deliberations, considered a number of options including historical landmarks, Fiji’s Coat of Arms, various industries, national heritage items and our unique flora and fauna. After a series of meetings entailing many hours of discussion on short listing design subjects, the Currency Design committee selected the final design subjects in November 2010 keeping in context the relevance of the designs to our culture, daily lives and the unique bio diversity of Fiji. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are indebted to the members of the Currency Design Committee for their vital contribution. I would like to therefore take this opportunity to acknowledge and warmly thank them. They are: -  Mr. Robin Yarrow (Chairman)  Ms. Sagale Buadromo  Ratu Isoa Gavidi  Mr. Ikbal Jannif  Mr. Radike Qereqeretabua  Mr. Manoa Rasigatale  Dr. Dick Watling Vinaka vakalevu to all the members of the Currency Design Committee for a job well done. With the Design Committee having set the platform by providing the design subjects it was then left to the Technical Committee to work with the artists from the selected Mint (Royal Canadian Mint) and Printer (De La Rue Currency) to put the final designs together. This also involved, among other things, obtaining permission to use copyright photographic material, deciding on the metallic content, sizes and edges of the coins including finalizing the new $2 coin, deciding on the banknote substrates, colours, sizes and security features. All of this entailed many hours of work and I take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to our Technical Committee. In particular, I would like to single out and thank Susan Kumar, Chief Manager Currency & Corporate Services and Ravi Kamoda, Manager Currency. Susan and Ravi worked tirelessly around the clock with their team to ensure work progressed smoothly towards the deadline we had set for today. Ladies and Gentlemen, the final designs and other technical characteristics of the new currency were approved by the Reserve Bank Board in November 2010. The approval included, for the first time ever, a $2 coin and a polymer or plastic note in the $5 denomination. I am pleased to say that the Cabinet further approved the recommendations in March 2011 and it was then left to the Technical Committee to work with our suppliers to produce the final products.  At this point, I would just like to add that it is only prudent to undertake these structural developments over time to achieve cost efficiencies where possible given the rising cost of metals and raw materials required to produce currency. A $2 coin is estimated to yield an average of 15 years in circulation compared to the current $2 banknote which only yields less than a year’s circulation life due to its lack of durability contributed by the high level of usage. Polymer banknotes also have their own benefits in terms of durability under normal conditions, lasting approximately two and a half times longer than paper banknotes but costing approximately 1.5 times more. This means that we will be ordering fewer notes thereby saving costs for the nation. Ladies and Gentlemen, the introduction of our first polymer banknote should not be necessarily seen as a sign of future changes. We are quite pleased with the performance of our higher denomination paper substrate banknotes which are wearing well in circulation given our geography, climate conditions and cash handling practices. These paper banknote 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  substrates have also been strengthened with a platinum coating giving them extra durability. We should therefore see overall improvements in banknote quality with the new series. At this point let me acknowledge the presence here today of executives and technicians representing our banknote and coin suppliers. From De La Rue Currency, we welcome Tim Jones, Brooke Banks, Gill Sugg, Dani Douglas, and artist and senior designer Luis Morris. During the early design stages, Brooke and Luis were in Fiji and worked closely with both the Design and Technical Committees. Luis’ drawings are truly special. From Royal Canadian Mint, we welcome Ian Bennett, Beverly Lepine, Peter Ho, and Jeff Hanke. As with the notes, the artwork on the coins is equally special. Thank you all for accepting our invitation and travelling the long distance to celebrate this milestone with us. We are truly appreciative of the dedicated support and goodwill you have shown us during our collaboration towards what is a unique set of currency notes and coins. I also take this opportunity to thank those who have provided their rare, unique photographs and images of the flora and fauna we have used on our new notes and coins, on our educational and promotional materials, and on our collector’s items. Thank you to: - • Dr. William Beckon and Post Fiji Limited for an image of a beautiful parrot found in the misty highlands of Kadavu. • James Siers of Ba for an image of an iconic Fijian flower. I understand Mr. Siers is not well and we wish him a speedy recovery. • Jone Niukula for images of an endemic insect species that only emerges once every so many years, • Dr. Jorg Kretzschmar for images of a truly iconic bird that graces our ocean for days at a time and which is otherwise rarely seen. • Dr. Paddy Ryan and Aaron Jenkins for images of a fresh water fish species with truly unique characteristics. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am led to believe by all who have collaborated on this project that we have something truly special. We have a new set of currency in vibrant colours featuring true national treasures. There will be many local and international collectors of currency notes and coins who are looking for something unique. The celebration of our biodiversity on our money is just that. The interest is so promising that we have already received numerous enquiries and a number of orders from banknote and coin collectors around the world even before the unveiling. We recognize this growing interest and have worked with our suppliers to provide limited numbers of special collector items. Let me say a few words on what we have. For the first time, the Reserve Bank has produced a limited edition all-denomination set of coloured coins. This is a one-of-a-kind coin set depicting the flora and fauna designs in their natural colours on the front of each coin. Specially packaged uncirculated coin sets will also be available for those who just want to own a piece of history. For the notes, collectors can either buy specially packaged individual denominations or the full set with matching serial numbers. Uncut banknote sheets of 20 notes and 25 notes will also be available. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Ladies and Gentlemen, my sincere apologies for the self-advertising. I will not draw out the suspense any longer. I am confident that we all will be proud of our new banknotes and coins. On behalf of the Board, Management and staff of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, I once again extend my sincere gratitude to His Excellency, The President for agreeing to be our Chief Guest and to you all for kindly accepting our invitation. We are truly humbled by your presence. Vinaka vakalevu and God bless Fiji!  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Global financial stability and the internationalisation of financial systems in emerging economies Speech by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Euromoney-Qatar Conference “Global financial stability and the internationalisation of financial systems in emerging economies”, Doha, 11 December 2012. *      *      * It is my honour to be here in Doha to speak at this Euromoney-Qatar Conference on “Global Finance Re-designed”. I wish to thank the Qatar Central Bank for the invitation to speak at this event. In this current global environment, the unprecedented and wide ranging global policy responses have yet to produce financial stability and a sustainable recovery of the global economy. The intensification of the globalization of finance in this decade has resulted in an even more connected and interdependent world. While the financial systems and economies in most parts of the world felt the effects of the recent global financial crisis, it has not discouraged the pace of internationalization of financial systems, in particular, in emerging economies. My address this morning will be on financial stability and the internationalization of financial systems in emerging economies. My remarks will cover the benefits and challenges of such internationalization, the lessons that can be drawn from the recent global financial crisis, the Malaysian experience on the internationalization of our financial system.  Benefits and challenges of internationalisation of financial systems While there are significant benefits from internationalization of financial systems, the resulting increased international financial integration brings with it new risks and challenges. The case for increased financial liberalization and internationalization maintains that it would foster the development of a more efficient and robust financial system. While the resulting more competitive financial system will enhance the efficiency in the financial intermediation process and contribute towards reducing the cost of intermediation, the supervisory oversight needs to ensure over competition does not result in the mispricing of risk with adverse consequences on financial stability. Other benefits are the increased opportunities for technology transfer, new expertise and greater innovation and new product offerings. Increased foreign participation in the domestic financial markets would also contribute to increased liquidity and more competitive pricing in the domestic financial markets and encourage a more efficient allocation of capital within the economy. It is also maintained that it will contribute to the expansion and development of the domestic financial markets in particular, the capital market, proving an important access for financing of investment activity. With the more efficient functioning of domestic financial markets, it would also improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Meanwhile, the increased capital inflows following the capital account liberalization represents another source of financing that would contribute towards increased investment and growth. It will allow jurisdictions with surplus funds to be channelled to those regions with productive investment opportunities and thus contribute towards a more efficient allocation of funds across international borders. The stronger cross border financial linkages has the potential to enhance international trade and investment opportunities. It allows countries to leverage on the respective comparative advantage and complementarities to reinforce mutual growth. This would be important in the current environment to facilitate cross border economic activity. The liberalisation of the capital account in the form of removing restrictions to foreign exchange transactions would also increase the flexibility of managing such foreign exchange transactions. This would increase the potential to better manage its associated risks, while 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  the increased efficiency gains would also reduce the cost of doing business. Finally, it is also argued that in a more liberalised environment, there would be greater market discipline which would in turn promote financial stability in the domestic financial system. This however, relies on a sufficient level of disclosure and transparency to allow the efficient functioning of the markets. The internationalization of financial systems is however, not without risks and challenges. The risk of contagion following from the increased connectivity increases significantly, in terms of the extent and speed. The contagion can result from external events and developments that can range from failure of large and important international financial institution to the eruption of wars or political incidents that have regional or global repercussions. Meanwhile, global developments including from global policy spillovers have also resulted in more volatile capital flows. The increased openness of the financial system also increases the vulnerability to economic cycles in other parts of the world. The increased interdependence of financial systems and economies and the contagion effects can be expected to be among the significant outcomes of financial internationalization. Financial liberalization could for example amplify further the implications of financial stress from other parts of the world on the domestic financial system. It could also accentuate and amplify asset bubbles and boom bust cycles. Other implications are that it could contribute to the widening of income disparities and also to the marginalization of domestic financial institutions if they are not able to perform in a more competitive environment. Finally, volatile capital flows may not only affect the efficient functioning of the financial markets but could result in misaligned exchange rates that do not reflect underlying fundamentals. These potential risks and vulnerabilities continue to be a challenge not only to emerging economies but also to the more developed financial systems and economies. Lessons from the financial crisis  While there are benefits to be gained from the internationalization of financial systems, the risks to financial stability have also increased immensely. The risks generally emanate from the greater prospects for contagion following the greater degree of interdependence. These risks would be even more pronounced in emerging economies in which financial systems have yet to become more developed and matured. To be better positioned to reap the benefits from internationalization of financial systems in emerging economies, the crisis provides us with several lessons. Firstly, is to recognize that the different parts of the domestic financial system is highly interconnected. This also includes those parts that may not be under the regulatory capture. Financial stress in a specific segment may no longer be confined to that segment but may rapidly be transmitted to the rest of the financial system. Thus, a piecemeal policy response would not be sufficient. It would require a comprehensive response to ensure that such stressed conditions does not evolve into a major financial crisis. Secondly, the build-up of risks to financial stability need to be identified early. Pre-emptive action would reduce the cost of the crisis on the financial system and the economy. Third, the regulatory authorities need to be accorded the necessary powers to manage the risks to financial stability. Fourth, the optimal policy mix may not only include policy actions to address immediate term issues but would also need to simultaneously address the underlying structural problems. Fifth, is to give recognition to the importance of enabling conditions that will render the implemented policies to yield the desired outcomes. Finally, to facilitate effective policy decision making there needs to be a platform and governance process for policy coordination across agencies within an economy and for this to be extended for regional and international collective action. Following the recent global financial crisis, the policy response at the national level has been extensive and on an unprecedented scale. While there has been wide ranging financial reforms at the international level to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, the cross 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  border dimension of policy-making has not been as extensive. This is despite the swift spread of financial and economic shocks throughout the global economy and international financial system following the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008. Despite these increased challenges, the institutional arrangements for policy cooperation and coordination have yet to reach the levels that are commensurate with the degree of global economic and financial integration. While the individual efforts by any single economy is vital, it can no longer guarantee global financial stability. Emerging economies that are more open and integrated with the global economy and international financial system are the most affected by these developments. The crisis has forcefully demonstrated the importance of the international dimension of policy. Finally, a consequence of financial crisis that deserves increased attention is the widening of income disparities within economies. The recent crisis has worsened this trend given the conditions of high unemployment in many parts of the world. At the national level, the development of inclusive financial systems and the development of social safety nets will contribute to containing this trend. Financial internationalisation and the Malaysian experience In pursuing financial sector liberalisation to transition to a more internationalised financial system, Malaysia adopted a gradual and sequenced approach. This was to ensure that the necessary preconditions were in place so that the benefits of increased financial internationalisation would be realised, while ensuring that the associated risks inherent to a more open economy and internationally integrated financial system could be effectively managed. Seven preconditions were identified as being important to this process. The first was to accord priority to building the capacity of the intermediaries in the financial sector, and to strengthen their resilience and competitiveness. At the time of the Asian financial crisis, Malaysia had a highly fragmented banking sector with more than seventy banking institutions, many of which were small and highly vulnerable. During the financial crisis, a major restructuring exercise was undertaken. This was followed by an industry-wide merger exercise, prompted by an increase of the capitalisation requirements. The restructuring strengthened the balance sheets of the banking institutions, while the consolidation produced larger and stronger financial groups. The second was to undertake financial reforms which focused on the transition to a more market-oriented financial system. This involved interest rate reforms that would support the more efficient pricing of financial products and services. The more competitive environment that was generated became an important driver of efficiency gains and innovation in the financial system. Equal attention was also given to the development of the financial infrastructure, in particular, the payment and settlement system and the modernization of the legal framework to give greater clarity to the legislation governing the financial sector. This involved seven new legislation that have been enacted in the areas of central banking, the payments system, money services, deposit insurance, and the regulation of the banking, insurance, Islamic finance, development financial institutions and cooperatives. This has given greater certainty and predictability in the functioning of the financial system. Importance was also given to strengthening the surveillance capabilities of the Central Bank and the effectiveness of the regulatory and supervisory regime. This involved the transition from a rule-based regulation to an enhanced principle-based regulation regime with focus on governance practices and risk management. This was reinforced by the shift to a risk-based supervision. The supervisory oversight has however continued to remain intrusive, with a pre-emptive intervention framework to ensure that the potential risks to financial stability 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  would continue to be addressed including in a more regionally and internationally connected financial sector. In parallel with these efforts was the development of the securities market. From a financial system in which there was an over-reliance on the banking system for financing, the financial system has now become more diversified with greater access to financing from the bond and sukuk market. The domestic securities market has now evolved to become a vibrant part of the Malaysian financing ecosystem, and has served to disperse the concentration of risk in the financial system thereby contributing towards preserving financial stability. The Malaysian securities market has expanded significantly to become the largest in the ASEAN region. Malaysia also made significant investments in talent development for the financial services sector. Given its significance in defining performance and resilience of the financial sector, comprehensive institutional arrangements have been put in place for all levels of the industry; at the entry point, at the working and specialist levels, at the professional level and at the leadership levels including for the boards of financial institutions. Finally, as the financial system became more regionally and internationally more integrated, regional financial stability arrangements have also been established. These included advancing collective initiatives in the areas of regional surveillance, the development of regional financial markets and payments infrastructure, and cross-border supervision. Forums for assessment of risks to regional financial stability have also been initiated, and work on establishing an integrated crisis management and resolution framework for the region is in progress. As part of these initiatives, a regional support mechanism has also been established. With these pre-conditions in place, Malaysia commenced initiatives to internationalise our financial system beginning 2003. The internationalisation of the financial sector entailed the advancement in two main areas; financial sector liberalisation and capital account liberalisation. In pursuing greater regional and international financial integration, the aim was to enhance the diversity of the financial system in terms of its product offerings, to improve further the competitiveness of the financial system and to strengthen our economic linkages with the region and other parts of the world. The financial sector liberalisation involved increased foreign entry and participation in our financial system. New licences were issued to foreign conventional and Islamic banking institutions, while the minimum foreign strategic stakes in the insurance and takaful industry were increased. Increased operational flexibilities were also accorded to the existing foreign banking institutions in the financial system which now account for about 30% of the banking system. At the same time, the foreign participation in our securities market was liberalised in 2007 to allow foreign corporations to raise financing either in domestic or foreign currency. The capital account liberalisation throughout the first decade in the 2000s has involved the progressive removal of restrictions on foreign exchange administration rules. This liberalisation was intensified after 2005, taking into account the state of readiness of the financial system and the economy to manage the consequential increased cross border financial flows. In July 2005, Malaysia migrated from a fixed exchange rate regime to a flexible exchange rate regime to accord greater flexibility to adjust to changing structural conditions in the region and the global economy. With the progressive dismantling of restrictions, businesses now had the flexibility to manage their financial exchange exposures. This encouraged two way capital flows and contributed towards stabilising the volatile capital flows to our economy. Finally, in addition to being accorded with the necessary powers in the new legislations, the policy toolkit of the Central Bank has also been expanded to address the potential build-up of financial imbalances and its risks to financial stability following increased internationalisation. This includes macro-prudential and supervisory measures to collectively address the underlying causes of financial stability. A platform has also been established for the greater 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  coordination among policy makers within the country, among the regulators and the public sector. Conclusion Let me now conclude my remarks. While many lessons can be drawn from the various episodes of financial crisis experienced by the world economy, there is no one approach to the liberalization and internationalization of financial systems. Its success depends on the prevailing circumstances and the state of readiness of financial systems and the economy and its capacity to manage its associated risks. Premature internationalization can result in highly destabilizing conditions. The liberalization process also needs to be pragmatic, taking into consideration the different objectives that need to be achieved. With sufficient development of the financial infrastructure, the safeguards and the buffers, emerging economies have every potential to participate in a more internationally integrated financial system that will facilitate mutually reinforcing global growth and development. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Deepak Mohanty: Perspectives on India’s balance of payments Speech by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the School of Management, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, 7 December 2012. *      *      * The assistance provided by Rajan Goyal & Rajeev Jain is acknowledged. I thank Professor Sar for inviting me to address this young audience. In the recent years, India’s integration with the global economy has increased significantly. This is reflected in our expanding volume of external trade and financial transactions. While this process has several benefits arising from wider access to consumption and investment, there is attendant cost of periodic instability. Over the last two years, the Reserve Bank has been drawing attention to the widening current account deficit (CAD) in our balance of payments (BoP). The risks to our BoP have increased both in the global and domestic context: first, following the global financial crisis trade volumes have slumped and capital flows have become volatile; second, slowing domestic growth coupled with a large fiscal deficit alongside a high CAD poses twin deficit risks. In this context, I propose to capture the evolution of India’s BoP in the historical context and trace how did we respond to risks to external stability from time to time? Let me start from the basics. What is BoP? It is our transaction account with the rest of the world. It can be better appreciated in terms of the national income accounting identity: GDP = C+G+I+X-M. In other words, domestic output (GDP) is equal to private consumption (C), plus government consumption (G), plus domestic investment (I), plus net exports (X-M). If net exports of goods and services (X-M) are negative, the domestic economy is absorbing more than it can produce. In other words, absorption (C+G+I) by the domestic economy is greater than domestic output (GDP). This is reflected in current account deficit (X-M) which needs to be financed by external borrowings and/or investments. In normal times external finance may not be a problem. However, it could be challenging if both the global and domestic economic outlook are not very favourable. Against this background, my scheme of presentation will be as follows: identify the key events those shaped India’s BoP since independence; examine the changes in the composition of capital inflows; and in conclusion highlight a few risks and make some suggestions to reinforce India’s BoP. India’s BoP evolved reflecting both the changes in our development paradigm and exogenous shocks from time to time. In the 60 year span, 1951–52 to 2011–12, six events had a lasting impact on our BoP: (i) the devaluation in 1966; (ii) first and second oil shocks of 1973 and 1980; (iii) external payments crisis of 1991; (iv) the East Asian crisis of 1997; (v) the Y2K event of 2000; and (vi) the global financial crisis of 2008. I will analyse the BoP trend in this sequence.  The first phase can be considered from the 1950s through mid-1960s. In the early 1950s, India was reasonably open. For example, in 1951–52, merchandise trade, exports plus imports, accounted for 16 per cent of GDP. Overall current receipts plus payments were nearly 19 per cent of GDP. Subsequently, the share of external sector in India’s GDP gradually declined with the inward looking policy of import substitution. Moreover, Indian export basket comprised mainly traditional items like tea, cotton textile and jute manufactures. Not only the scope of world trade expansion in these commodities was less but additionally India had to face competition from new emerging suppliers, such as Pakistan in jute manufactures and Ceylon and East Africa in tea.  During this period, policy emphasis was on import saving rather than export promotion, and priority was given to basic goods and capital goods sector. It was argued that investment in heavy industries would bring in saving in foreign exchange, as output from such industries would replace their imports in the long-run. Import-substituting strategies were expected to 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches gradually increase export competitiveness through efficiency-gains achieved in the domestic economy. But this did not happen. Hence, exports remained modest. In fact our external sector contracted in relation to GDP from the level observed in the early 1950s. By 1965–66, merchandise trade was under 8 per cent of GDP and overall current receipts and payments were below 10 per cent of GDP (Table 1).  Notwithstanding the contracting size of the external sector, as imports growth outstripped exports growth, there was persistent current account deficit (CAD). Emphasis on heavy industrialisation in the second five year Plan led to a sharp increase in imports. On top of this, the strains of Indo-China conflict of 1962, Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 and severe drought of 1965–66 triggered a major BoP crisis. India’s international economic relations with advanced countries came under stress during the Indo-Pak conflict. Withdrawal of foreign aid by countries like the US and conditional resumption of aid by the Aid India Consortium led to contraction in capital inflows. Given the low level of foreign exchange reserves and burgeoning trade deficit, India had no option other than to devalue. Rupee was devalued by 36.5 per cent in June 1966.1 Though India’s export basket was limited, the sharp devaluation clearly increased the competitiveness of India’s exports. Concurrently, India had to undertake a number of trade liberalising measures. Even though the net impact of devaluation was a contentious issue among the leading economists,2 data show that exports growth, though modest, outpaced imports growth (Chart 1).                                                   1  Official rate increased from Rs.4.76 per US dollar to Rs.7.50 per US dollar. 2  For example, Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1975) argued that the effective devaluation was more for imports than the exports. “Foreign Trade Regimes and Economic Development: India”, National Bureau of Economic Research, New York. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  In fact, the current account turned into a surplus in 1973–74 as not only the exports growth was significant but invisible3 receipts also showed a sharp turnaround from deficit to surplus mainly on account of official transfers which largely represented grants under the agreement of February 1974 with the US Government on the disposition of PL 480 and other rupee funds. Since surplus in current account balance (CAB) was used for repaying rupee loans under the same agreement with the US, accretion to reserves was only marginal.  Surplus in India’s CAB was, however, short-lived as the first oil shock occurred by October 1973. Sharp rise in international oil prices was evident in higher imports growth in 1973–74 and 1974–75. The share of crude oil in India’s import bill rose from 11 per cent in 1972–73 to 26 per cent by 1974–75. As exports improved, particularly to oil producing Middle-East countries, BoP recovered quickly from the first oil shock. By this time, the Indian rupee, which was linked to a multi-currency basket with pound sterling as intervention currency, depreciated against the US dollar (Chart 2).                                                    3  Comprises services, transfers and income. 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Depreciating rupee along with other policy incentives to exporters acted as a supporting factor for India’s exports. At the same time, invisible receipts grew sharply stemming from workers’ remittances from the Middle East. Consequently, the current account balance turned into surplus in 1976–77 and 1977–78 (Chart 3).  Thus, the private transfers added a new positive dimension to India’s BoP after the first oil shock. Further, with the official exchange rate nearly converging to market exchange rate, there was not much incentive for routing remittances through unofficial exchange brokers. The rapid growth of private transfers reinforced the trade account adjustment to make the current account situation much more comfortable (Chart 4).  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 During the 1980s, BoP again came under stress. The second oil shock led to a rapid increase in imports in early 1980s. Oil imports increased to about two-fifths of India’s imports during 1980–83. At the same time, India’s external sector policy was changing towards greater openness. Various measures were undertaken to promote exports and liberalise imports for exporters during this period. However, several factors weighed against external stability. First, despite a number of export promotion measures, the subdued growth conditions in the world economy constrained exports growth. Second, the surplus on account of invisibles also deteriorated due to moderation in private transfers. Third, the debt servicing had increased with greater recourse to debt creating flows such as external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits. Fourth, deterioration is the fiscal position stemming from rising expenditures accentuated the twin deficit risks. Given the already emerging vulnerabilities in India’s BoP during the 1980s, the incipient signs of stress were discernible which culminated in the BoP crisis in 1991 when the Gulf War led to a sharp increase in the oil prices. On top of that, a slowdown in the world trade following the recessionary conditions in industrialised countries and the economic disruption in Eastern Europe including the erstwhile USSR had begun to affect India’s exports. A large number of Indian workers employed in Kuwait had to be airlifted to India and their remittances stopped. Foreign exchange reserves had already dwindled due to significant drawdown for financing of CAD in earlier years. During 1990–91, at one point of time, the foreign currency assets had dipped below US$ 1.0 billion, covering barely two weeks of imports. With increasing recourse to the borrowings on commercial terms in the previous years, financing of CAD had also become more sensitive to creditors’ confidence in the Indian economy. Short-term credits began to dry up and the outflow of NRI deposits was also very substantial. Downgrading of India’s credit rating below the investment grade also constrained India’s access in the international markets for funds, especially ECBs and trade credit. Even though the stress in India’s BoP was unprecedented, the Government decided to honour all debt obligations without seeking any rescheduling (Reddy, 2006).4 In response to the BoP crisis, a combination of standard and unorthodox policies for stabilisation and structural change was undertaken to ensure that the crisis did not translate into generalised financial instability. Such steps included pledging gold reserves, discouraging of non-essential imports, accessing credit from the IMF and other multilateral and bilateral donors. While dealing with the crisis through an IMF programme, a comprehensive programme of structural reforms was undertaken simultaneously with special emphasis on the external sector.  The broad approach to reform in the external sector was laid out in the Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments (Chairman: C. Rangarajan, 1993). Trade policies, exchange rate policies and industrial policies were recognised as part of an integrated policy framework so as to boost the overall productivity, competitiveness and efficiency of the economy. In addition, to contain the trade and current account deficits and enhance export competitiveness, the exchange rate of rupee was adjusted downwards in two stages on July 1 and July 3, 1991 by 9 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. A dual exchange rate system was introduced in March 1992 which was unified in March 1993. Subsequently, India moved to current account convertibility in August 1994 by liberalising various transactions relating to merchandise trade and invisibles. The impact of policy changes was reflected in lower CAD and its comfortable financing in subsequent years. India could manage the external shocks that emanated from the East Asian crisis in 1997 and subsequently, the rise in international oil prices and bursting of                                                  4  Reddy, Y.V.

6 BIS central bankers’ speeches dotcom bubble in 1999–2000. Indeed, the Indian economy remained relatively insulated from the East Asian crisis owing to the reforms undertaken in previous years and proactive and timely policy measures initiated by the Reserve Bank to minimise the contagion effect. Monetary tightening coupled with flexible exchange rate and steps to bolster reserves through issuance of Resurgent India Bonds (RIBs) helped in stabilizing the BoP. The BoP came under some stress again in the first half of 2000–01 due to a sharp rise in oil prices and increase in interest rates in advanced countries. At the same time, India’s software exports got a boost following the demands to address the Y2K challenges. This also encouraged migration of Indian software engineers to the advanced countries. As a result, the surplus in the services exports and remittance account of the BoP increased sharply which more than offset the deficit in the trade account. Software exports rose from 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1999–2000 to a peak of 3.8 per cent of GDP by 2008–09. Private remittances also rose from 2.7 per cent of GDP to 3.8 per cent during this period. Thus, in the 2000s software exports and private remittances emerged as two main financing items for the current account mitigating to a large extent the merchandise trade deficit (Tables 2 & 3). Owing to a combination of factors, in fact, the current account recorded a surplus during 2001–04. Subsequently, as international oil prices started rising and domestic growth picked up, deficit in current account re-emerged during 2004–05 to 2007–08 albeit remained range bound.   After a period of stability, India’s BoP came under stress in 2008–09 reflecting the impact of global financial crisis. As capital inflows plummeted, India had to draw down its foreign currency assets by US $ 20 billion during 2008–09. Stress since the collapse of Lehman Brothers largely emanated from decline in India’s merchandise exports and deceleration in growth in services exports. Though there was some improvement during 2010–11 on the 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 7 back of a strong pick-up in exports mainly led by diversification of trade in terms of composition as well as direction, it proved to be short-lived. BoP again came under stress during 2011–12 as slowdown in advanced economies spilled over to emerging and developing economies (EDEs), and there was sharp increase in oil and gold imports. Let me now turn to the financing aspects of the current account. India’s openness, both in terms of trade flows and capital flows which increased in the 1990s accelerated in the 2000s (Chart 5). This was made possible due to substantial liberalisation of the capital account and greater openness to private capital.  In the first three decades after the independence, CAD was mainly financed by external assistance and drawdown of forex reserves. Since much of India’s planning strategy was conceived in terms of a closed economy theoretical framework, private investment inflows into the economy were not encouraged much. Therefore, foreign resources came primarily in the form of official transfers. The private investment came mainly through technology transfer, but played a minuscule role. During this period, the development efforts and stress on BoP from time to time led India to tap diverse aid sources for specific projects. In the 1980s, as the traditional source of official concessional flows dried up there was a need to access private capital. But, this came in the form of debt creating flows though costly external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and NRI deposits. The limitations of financing CAD through debt creating flows were exposed in the 1991 crisis. Subsequent reforms and opening up the capital account to non-debt creating flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity flows not only completely transformed the sources of financing of the BoP but it also resulted in substantial addition to reserves in the 2000s (Table 4 & Chart 6).  
8 BIS central bankers’ speeches   Concluding remarks With the gradual external liberalisation of Indian economy, not only the size of BoP has increased manifold, but the pattern of current and capital account has changed. Even though the reform process has strengthened resilience of India’s external sector, at the same time vulnerabilities arise with greater exposure of the economy to the rest of world through liberalised trade and investment environment.  India’s current account particularly remains vulnerable to developments in the trade account. It is evident from the size of trade deficit growing from 0.5 per cent of GDP during 1951–55 to 8.7 per cent during 2007–12. In 2011–12, the current account deficit has widened to a record 4.2 per cent of GDP (Chart 7). Over the years, current account derived some resilience from surplus generated by invisibles, particularly software exports and private transfers, but trade deficit continues to dictate the overall trend in the current account. Whenever trade account worsens reflecting downswings in the global business cycle or rise in international oil prices, 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 9 the current account also comes under stress as is evident in the present context. Going forward, since India’s linkage with the world economy, in terms of trade and finance, is likely to grow further, it is important that resilience in its trade account is built up mainly by promoting productivity based export competitiveness and improving domestic fundamentals that are supportive of least costly non-debt creating flows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI). In this context, I make a few suggestions.  First, the current level of CAD is far above the level sustainable for India. As per estimates, at a nominal growth rate of about 13 per cent, the sustainable current account to GDP ratio is 2.3 per cent (Rangarajan, 2012).5 Reserve Bank’s own research shows that economy can sustain CAD of about 2.5 per cent of GDP under a scenario of slower growth (RBI, 2012).6 A slowing global economy and protracted high levels of unemployment in advanced economies make it difficult to boost services exports in the short run. If the slowdown continues, it could also have an adverse impact on inward remittances. Hence, there is a need to reduce imports and boost merchandise exports to bring the CAD to sustainable levels.  Second, structural policy measures are needed to reduce vulnerability emanating from high oil and gold imports. While oil has been a major component of India’s imports, the sharp increase in demand for gold has put an additional pressure. During 2008–09 to 2011–12, on average, the net gold imports stood at about 2 per cent of GDP, almost double the level recorded during 2004–05 to 2007–08. Thus, during the same period, CAD-GDP ratio, excluding net gold imports, would seem less problematic at 1.1 per cent as compared to a surplus of 0.2 per cent. In addition to the traditional motive of gold demand for jewellery, gold seems to have become a safe investment asset and a hedge against inflation as is observed in other advanced economies. Its dematerialisation like any other financial product can                                                  5  Rangarajan, C.

10 BIS central bankers’ speeches reduce its physical imports (Gokarn, 2012)7. Furthermore, inflation indexed bonds could also be another option to offer investors the inflation linked returns and detract them from gold investments. In the case of oil, we need to become more energy efficient to reduce our dependence on oil imports. Stepping up of production of electricity could reduce oil demand from backup generation systems. Moreover, the domestic pricing of oil should be aligned further to the international prices to rationalise oil consumption. Third, current policies towards further diversification of India’s export basket, both destination and products, needs to be stepped up. Indian exporters need to accelerate efforts to move up in the value chain at the global level. Fourth, given the global uncertainties and volatility in capital flows, the resilience of capital account needs to be further enhanced by encouraging FDI inflows.  To conclude, the Indian economy is much more open and globalised now than ever before. The periodic pressures on BoP have been addressed through policy changes. While the BoP has again come under stress since 2011–12 as emphasised by Governor Dr Subbarao, the situation is not as serious as it was in 1991.8 This is because the structure of the economy has changed in a fundamental way with flexible exchange rate and greater depth in financial markets, besides much larger foreign exchange reserves than those in 1991. However, there is a need to bring the CAD to sustainable levels in the short run and over the medium-term to accelerate efforts towards structural reforms that help boosting our competitiveness, raise growth potential and bring in more stable flows into the economy.                                                   7  Gokarn, Subir (2012), “India’s Gold Problem: Finding Solution through Financial Products”, speech at BANCON, on 25th November, 2012 at Pune. 8  Subbarao, D., “Macroeconomic Situation Assessment and Prospects”, Speech delivered at Indian Merchants’ Chamber, Mumbai on June 19, 2012. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Norman T L Chan: Global deleveraging – the right track Speech by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the Hong Kong Economic Summit 2013, Hong Kong, 10 December 2012. *      *      * At this very same forum last year, I put forward my view that excessive leveraging, or over-borrowing, in major industrialised countries was the root cause of both the global financial crisis and the more recent sovereign debt crisis plaguing Europe. Today, I’d like to expound my view on this very important issue. As you may recall, I pointed out that during the period between mid-1950s and early 1980s, the total debts of households, businesses other than financial institutions and the government in major industrialised countries remained relatively stable at about 150% of GDP. However this ratio kept increasing after the 1980s, reaching an alarming 320% even after the outbreak of the global financial crisis. As we all know, it is wonderful to have a credit line to meet our funding needs. We can use it to pay hefty tuition fees for our children studying abroad. We can use it to meet emergency needs, such as footing medical bills for a family member suddenly fallen ill. But more often than not, people borrow to fulfil their desire to consume, or to finance their property and equity purchases. In the case of companies, loans may be crucial to their business expansion plan, which would hopefully increase sales. On the government level, borrowings would really be handy when it wants to keep up public expenditure and to enhance welfare payments, healthcare and the military. This would not only improve the standard of living and employment, but also help boost national power and speed up economic growth. The list of wonders that borrowed money can bring goes on, but we almost forget there is a catch, that is, debts must be repaid somehow some day; and the higher the interest rates, the more we will have to pay back over time. For individual borrowers, except for those with a handsome pay rise, they can only hope to pay off earlier debts by reducing consumption in the days ahead. Well-run enterprises should have no problem servicing their debt if their business expansion financed by loans does indeed enhance their productivity and competitiveness. Likewise, heavily indebted governments will be able to service their debts only when they have sustained economic growth and rising tax revenues. In other words, the ability to repay debt hinges on increased productivity and improved income, or otherwise, reduced future spending and increased savings.  But despite the substantial GDP growth in major industrialised countries in the past 30 years, debts in these countries have piled up concurrently at an even more alarming rate. Advanced economies from across Europe and the US to Japan have all sought to boost economic prosperity, standard of living and employment with ever more borrowings and increased consumption and public spending. To me, this seemingly euphoric approach to growth was in fact driving their countries into a “debt abyss”. That was clearly unsustainable. Indeed it presented great risks to global financial and economic stability. For too long a time, the “deep abyss” – a danger masked by financial innovation and market failure – has gone largely unnoticed. In a convoluted twist of logic, some even commended debt-for-prosperity as being one of modern finance’s greatest contributions to the well-being of mankind. Then the crisis hit in 2008. Only then did the millennia-old wisdom of “Don’t Spend Beyond Your Means” suddenly dawn on the folks. Meanwhile, as the financial markets acted to correct their excessive tolerance for over-borrowing by households, businesses and governments, market failure began to be rectified. I explained last year how excessive leveraging became the root cause of the global financial crisis and the turmoil that followed, and the only solution was to deleverage or cut debt. Deleveraging is an extremely difficult and painful process, resulting in job losses, pay cuts, bankruptcies, and reduced public 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  services and social welfare. The standard of living stalls if not declines. My view is that for all the suffering and pain necessitated by the process, this is the only way to put global finance and growth on its right track. There is no alternative cure, unfortunately. My theory of excessive leveraging being the main culprit of the financial crisis may not be shared by everyone. But make no mistake – deleveraging is now a cold and hard fact of reality in many advanced countries. Let’s look more closely at the sectors involved: (1) Households: Take the US as an example. We all know that the Americans are quite used to spending on credit. But we should note in particular that the growth in US household debts, which doubled between 2000 and 2007, had been driven mainly by more and more people looking to buy a house on mortgage. This trend has in turn caused house prices to double in a short period unseen before. Looking further back, the ratio of average debt to after-tax income of the US households had remained at 80% in the past 50 years. But it shot up to a peak of 130% in end-2007 and has been on a downward trend following the burst of the US property bubble, falling to the current level of 109%. Forced to cut debt but with rather subdued pay rises, many US households have no choice but to lessen their spending. It is still uncertain whether this process of deleveraging, i.e. increased savings and decreased spending combined, will continue. But the one thing we are certain about is that this will be a major factor affecting consumer demand in the US. Over in Europe, many countries are similarly beset with huge debts. Despite the prevailing low interest rates, efforts to cut debt have to be kept up, which can restrain consumption and impede short-term growth. (2)  Corporates: Corporates have always sought to increase profits by using loans to increase investment and expand operations. When the economy continues to boom, revving up demand, increased leveraging looks like an enterprising approach to increase profits. But once circumstances shift, companies building up a mirage of prosperity after years of reliance on loans will suddenly find themselves mired in massive debts. This is what we have witnessed across the major industrialised countries. Though the debt levels of businesses differ from country to country – with those in Spain, the UK and France among the highest, it is obvious that they all have no alternative but to reduce debt when demand has ceased to grow rapidly as before. Those that are not healthy enough financially might even have to go bankrupt. (3)  Banks: When we talk about deleveraging or cutting debt, we must also look at the role played by banks in the process. Of course, banks are not the sole provider of credit. Capital markets and the shadow banking sector are indeed among the other sources contributing to the rapid expansion of credit in the past two decades. However, the banking sector is beyond doubt the key player leading the major industrialised countries deeper and deeper into the debt abyss. When the global financial crisis finally hit in 2008, many large international banks fell into complete disarray, sending governments to their rescue with huge amounts of public funds. After this, the Group of Twenty (G20) decided to reform the banking system. A series of regulatory measures are introduced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, aiming to strengthen the quality and quantity of capital requirements for banks. Basel III will take effect in January 2013, and a more stringent Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Leverage Ratio will be put in place. Besides, the FSB has requested additional capital requirements and more stringent regulatory oversight on global systemically important banks. To address moral hazard in banks which are considered “too big to fail”, they are required to establish a so-called “living will” and recovery and resolution plan. I do not intend to go into details about these measures. But I would like to point out that from now on banks will require more capital and more liquid assets for their financial intermediation activities, and that this is going to reduce their credit-creating ability. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  This will inevitably drive up the cost of borrowing for individuals, companies and governments alike, thereby adding impetus to the process of deleveraging and debt reduction in the major industrialised countries. (4)  Government: It is now apparent that many major industrialised countries have over-borrowed. The problem has been exacerbated by the global financial crisis in 2008. Following a prolonged period of incubation by market failure, the European debt crisis was finally precipitated by Ireland and Greece. The crisis has since remained unresolved, and has even spread to core countries like Spain and Italy. Other countries of the European Union, including the UK and France, are faring not much better, though the markets have been more accommodative of their plight so far. The whole Europe is in fact mired in the “debt abyss”. For all the hard efforts by the European Central Bank (ECB) to minimise the risk of a total euro collapse, President of the ECB, Mr Mario Draghi, once said that these were merely attempts to buy time, so that the euro zone countries could implement fiscal and structural reforms. Hopefully the markets would be convinced that these reforms would help those countries reduce government debt and regain competitiveness.  As regards fiscal reforms, the EU agreed on and signed the Fiscal Compact in March 2012. If implemented, the European countries concerned will have to pursue rigorous deficit reduction plans and lower their total sovereign debt to GDP ratio to 60% or below within  years. Take Italy as an example. It will have to keep on reducing its government debt by an amount equal to 3% of GDP annually for the next twenty years so as to reduce its current debt-to-GDP ratio of 120% to the target of 60%. This shows how formidable and painful it will be for the European countries to re-establish fiscal discipline. The short to medium term economic outlook for Europe is hardly optimistic. What I would like to point out here is that implementation of the Fiscal Compact will lead to significant deleveraging by the various European governments. Although the US may fare better than Europe, its economy is heading towards the “fiscal cliff”. Similar to Europe, it is also necessary for the US to make significant cut in expenditures in the medium to long term in order to regain fiscal balance and discipline. The situation in Japan is even more worrying. Public debt in Japan has now exceeded 200% of GDP, excluding civil service pension and other contingent liabilities. Currently, the market is not concerned about Japan’s repayment ability as it is believed that the Japanese government will continue to address the ever-increasing deficits by maintaining an exceptionally low interest rate environment. However, it is worth noting that the market was treating the European countries in the same way until recently. Once market sentiment changes, the situation can take a sharp turn and it would be very difficult to arrest a deteriorating trend. In addition to the pain brought about by deleveraging, I would also like to talk about the different forms of “quantitative easing” implemented by the various central banks. Why did these economies implement “quantitative easing”? If we agree that the root cause of the global financial crisis is excessive leveraging, then the only solution would be deleveraging. However, in reality, the process of deleveraging is just too painful. “Quantitative easing” is able to provide the much desired relief for everyone, be it a household in negative equity that has overstretched itself, an over-expanded enterprise or a government faced with social unrest as a result of the stringent measures it is forced to implement. Yet, quantitative easing is the exact opposite of deleveraging. Quantitative easing aims at: 1. reducing the interest burden of highly leveraged individuals, enterprises and governments, and 2. propping asset prices, lessening the negative wealth effect or even trying to create positive wealth effect, enhancing people’s confidence so that they will be more willing to spend, and increasing employment. However, quantitative easing is not a panacea. In the past three years, quantitative easing had limited stimulating effect on the real economy. There are several reasons. First, household deleveraging has reduced households’ propensity to consume, particularly for the 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  lower income households. Secondly, with interest rate close to zero in the US, and the cost of current consumption already very low relative to future consumption, further interest rate cuts would have little effect in stimulating households to bring forward future consumption. Thirdly, regulatory reform and economic uncertainty are restraining banks’ ability and incentive to lend. And we must not forget there is a price to pay for implementing quantitative easing, the interest income of depositors, including investment funds and retirees, is greatly reduced. Asset markets supported by an artificially low interest rate environment rather than economic fundamentals will skew resources allocation in society from expanding the productive sectors to pursuit of asset price appreciation. Such a shift will easily lead to investment mismatch, thereby eroding medium to long term productivity growth as well as growth potential of the economy. In addition, the more sizable and prolonged quantitative easing becomes, the more difficult and riskier will be the exit plan. Central banks should realise that there is not much they can do. In order to solve the structural imbalances built up in the past two decades, we must get to the bottom of the problem. Ladies and Gentlemen, up until 2008, the industrialised countries and various emerging economies had been enjoying a golden period of development which lasted for two to three decades. Income levels and living standards continued to rise. Some academics call this a period of “Great Moderation”. However, no one is sure why life during this period was so easy. Some say that this is due to technological and financial innovation of modern society, the so-called “paradigm shift”. We should now be awakened to the reality that this golden period was probably underpinned by little more than excessive debts, and is in fact unsustainable. If the major industrialised countries will have to undergo deleveraging in the foreseeable future, how will the global economy evolve? I think it is highly probable that the following situations will emerge: (1) The more a country is indebted, the more deleveraging it has to undergo. It is inevitable that economic growth and employment will be weak and the living standards in some places where the problem is more serious may even deteriorate. (2) Some advanced and many emerging economies do not need to bear the pain of deleveraging due to their low level of debt. However, as other advanced economies have to undergo deleveraging, it will not be possible to go back to the “good old days” with everybody enjoying a prosperous economic development. Countries around the world will have to strive to enhance their productivity and competitiveness so as to capture a bigger share in the international trade arena where growth has slowed down. More importantly, major emerging economies, such as China, India, Brazil and Russia, would have to try their best to expand domestic demand and carry out reforms to improve productivity, so as to reduce their reliance on exports to the advanced economies and to achieve slower, yet more balanced and sustainable economic growth. Another question we would like to ask is: what will the global asset market be heading? I wish I have a crystal ball. All I can do is to make some assumptions and analyse different possibilities. (1) The first possibility builds on the assumption that the process of global deleveraging is not affected by quantitative easing. Under these circumstances, if asset price inflation is driven by excessive leveraging, in theory, asset prices might drop first in search for a new equilibrium, and then stabilise at that point. Subsequently, asset prices will resume rising alongside economic recovery and a rebound in people’s income. (2) The second possibility is that quantitative easing produces the desired results. Asset prices go up, stimulating consumption, and employment improves significantly as a result. This buys time for the relevant authorities to carry out reforms to enhance productivity so that, ultimately, asset price increases will be supported by economic 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  fundamentals. This is, of course, a very desirable scenario as global economy will return to its normal growth path. I surely hope that this will be what eventually happens. (3) What bothers me however is the third possibility, under which the process of deleveraging is disrupted by quantitative easing, leading to sharp increases in asset prices in the first place. Yet, since such increases are not supported by economic fundamentals, any increase in wealth will be seen as transient. As a result, households are unwilling to increase spending and in the end, the real economy fails to rebound. If inflationary pressure builds up alongside asset price increases, central banks may consider exiting the market and raise interest rates. When economic performance, inflation or monetary policy falls short of market expectation, asset prices might drop sharply and remain volatile.  I am not sure which of these three scenarios will happen or whether a fourth scenario will emerge, as the current situation is something we have never experienced before. However, what I am certain is that since the outlook for macro economic and financial environment is very uncertain, it is highly possible that we will continue to see large fund inflows and outflows as well as sharp fluctuations in the financial markets. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to ask everyone to stay alert to the risks ahead and be aware that the current environment is highly abnormal and uncertain. We should all take precautionary measures and get to the bottom of the problem, learn from others’ experiences and avoid overstretching ourselves. Otherwise, we may find ourselves being trapped in the debt abyss with no way out. Thank you. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: A central banker’s perspective on European economic convergence Speech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the Anchor 2013 Conference, organised by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (the central bank of Hungary), Budapest, 7 December 2012. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here in Budapest and to participate in the annual Anchor conference. I understand that this will be the last Anchor conference for András Simor in his position as Governor of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank. So this is an excellent opportunity for me to pay him a sincere tribute for his work here and as a valued member of the General Council of the European Central Bank (ECB). In my remarks today, I would like to focus on the process of economic convergence in Europe. As the experiences of recent years have made clear, this process does not end with a country’s adoption of the euro. Nor does participation in the single monetary policy provide automatic delivery of convergence. I will first talk about the challenges facing the euro area as a result of shortcomings in the process of convergence and integration. I will then discuss the challenges of convergence for those members of the European Union (EU) that have not yet adopted the euro.  1.  Two challenges in the process of European integration The institutional challenge Over a period of many years, the EU has provided an unprecedented framework for successful regional integration. The process of integration has involved not only the creation of a common market and the harmonisation or coordination of several economic policies, but also the conduct of some of these policies at a supranational level. A central pillar of the EU’s institutional architecture has always been the principle of subsidiarity. This is the rule that action shall only be taken at the supranational level if the objectives to be pursued cannot be sufficiently achieved by EU members, either at the level of central government or at the regional and local level. While we should continue to preserve the principle of subsidiarity, the recent challenges for the euro area have provided us with a major institutional lesson: maximising the benefits of the single currency requires not only a strong ECB; it also requires additional strong common institutions.  We need strong institutions to guarantee competitiveness and to encourage sustainable growth; to guide fiscal policies and ensure fiscal sustainability; and to supervise and stabilise the single financial market. We also need strong institutions to engage citizens more closely in the European project. In other words, the future prosperity of Europe hinges on our ability to complement monetary union with economic union, fiscal union and financial union. This more advanced institutional architecture will in turn need to be embedded in some form of political union that engages citizens more deeply in European decision-making. As a result, joining the euro area in the future should imply greater sharing of sovereignty and a deeper European accountability than it did ten years ago. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The institutional challenge is the first major challenge with which we are currently confronted. We have already made much progress in addressing the challenge. But a great deal of work remains to be done. The economic challenge The second and complementary challenge is economic. The benefits of adopting the euro are greater the more consistent the economic structures of existing and prospective members are. Convergence can be broadly defined as a process in which cross-country differences in economic structures are reduced over time. The success of the convergence process ultimately depends on the sustainability of the underlying policies. Shortcomings in the process of convergence across euro area members have been at the root of the challenges we have faced since 2010. But I am pleased to report that progress in addressing those shortcomings is being made. External imbalances and fiscal imbalances are starting to be unwound. Efforts to regain price and non-price competitiveness are bearing early fruit. Deleveraging is generally proceeding in an orderly way, even though credit flows to the real economy seem to be negatively affected in parts of the euro area. Debt is being reduced in some countries, while others are devising strategies to make debt reduction sustainable over time. And financial sector weaknesses are being addressed along with their links to sovereign risk. As I have said, progress is being made but much still needs to be done. The recent experiences of some current euro area members also serve as a cautionary tale to EU members bound by the Treaty to adopt the euro in the future. I will now turn to the challenges facing these countries in the process of convergence.  2.  The perspective of EU countries which have still to adopt the euro The framework for convergence With two exceptions, all EU members that are not yet in the euro area are expected to adopt the single currency on meeting certain convergence criteria. As you know, the Treaty defines these criteria along three dimensions.  The first dimension is the degree of nominal convergence with the euro area. This implies achieving price stability; ensuring the sustainability of the government’s financial position; realising sustainable convergence of long-term nominal interest rates; and maintaining a stable exchange rate between the national currency and the euro.  The Treaty also requires that nominal convergence is sustainable. This is not possible without it being underpinned by a high degree of real convergence. According to this second dimension, adopting the euro makes sense only if the economic structure of a prospective member has converged sufficiently towards the prevailing structures in the euro area. The success of the real convergence process in turn depends on the sustainability of the relevant policies. The challenges that we have faced since 2010 highlight the dangers that large and persistent macroeconomic imbalances pose, not only for the stability of domestic economies, but also for the smooth functioning of the euro area as a whole. We all know the dire implications of prolonged losses of competitiveness, excessive indebtedness and housing market bubbles.  Recognising this fact, EU members have moved towards stronger surveillance of domestic policies. Let me remind you of two examples. One is the new Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure, which aims to prevent the build-up of new macroeconomic imbalances and enforce the correction of existing imbalances. The other is the “fiscal compact”, which was signed by all EU members except the UK and the Czech Republic in March this year and which strengthens the sustainability and credibility of fiscal policies.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  The third dimension of convergence is institutional. The relevant national legislation, including the statute of the national central bank, needs to be compatible with the EU Treaties and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). More generally, a lesson we have learned the hard way is that the strength of the institutional environment is crucial for the sustainability of economic integration and convergence. Improvements in the institutional environment entail, among other things, better regulations, better governance, better quality of statistics and a more business-friendly environment. Removing impediments to the efficient use of factors of production helps to enhance the growth potential of each country. How to achieve a high degree of sustainable convergence?  So how can countries best prepare their economies to reap the benefits of closer European integration? There are four building blocks: monetary policy, structural policy, fiscal policy and financial policy. Let me reflect briefly on each of these. Monetary policy First, monetary policy, which, before the euro is adopted, remains a national responsibility. But a number of Treaty obligations already apply at this stage. In particular, the main objective of monetary policy should be price stability, and exchange rate policy should be treated as a matter of common interest. Monetary policy best contributes to growth through the delivery of price stability. Overall price stability creates a predictable environment that fosters the efficient adjustment of relative prices and bolsters investor and consumer confidence. It also protects the purchasing power of the most vulnerable members of the population. Different monetary policy frameworks have been devised to deliver price stability. Some EU members outside the euro area have fixed the exchange rate of their domestic currencies to the euro, which has a very good track record of low inflation. A different approach – which has been adopted by Hungary – has combined exchange rate flexibility with a regime of inflation targeting. I understand that Governor Simor will focus his remarks on the past and future of inflation targeting in Hungary. So I will limit my comments to the importance of central bank credibility for the success of inflation targeting.  The ultimate success of a central bank in maintaining price stability depends on its credibility. Credibility anchors inflation expectations in line with the definition of price stability adopted by the central bank. Well-anchored inflation expectations in turn align the choices relevant for wage and price setting.  A key prerequisite for a credible monetary policy is the independence of the central bank. This principle is enshrined in the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. Each central bank in the EU should have institutional, personal, functional, and financial independence. Institutional and personal independence protect the central bank and members of its decision-making bodies from direct or indirect influences of third parties in the performance of their tasks. Functional independence requires that the central bank has the necessary means and instruments for achieving its objective independently of any other authority. And financial independence guarantees that the central bank has access to and control over sufficient financial and human resources to fulfil its mandate.  Credible inflation targeting in small open economies also depends on central banks’ recognition of the impact of their monetary policy decisions on the exchange rate.  For example, in the presence of heavily indebted private and public sectors with large open foreign exchange positions, central banks have little space for manoeuvre when faced with a flagging economy. This is especially true when inflation is already high and there is not yet a 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  critical mass of structural and institutional reforms capable of reducing the country risk premium to sustainable levels. In these circumstances, lowering the policy rate to stimulate the economy may risk sparking depreciation pressures on the domestic currency at some point in time. Depreciation of the currency may in turn further fuel inflation and offset the impact of economic stimuli through negative balance sheet effects on consumption and investment.  Structural policies The second building block is structural policy. The sustainability of nominal convergence is to a large extent conditional on a sufficient degree of structural, or real, convergence. A broad indicator of the degree of real convergence with the euro area is the catching-up of per capita incomes and price levels of new members with those of the euro area. Convergence in real per capita GDP levels has to be fostered by far-reaching structural and institutional changes aimed at enhancing the growth potential of the economy. Such reforms typically aim at strengthening the flexibility of adjustment mechanisms in the economy and improving the business environment. When goods and labour markets are rigid, inflation and inflation expectations may remain high even in the presence of monetary regimes committed to the achievement of price stability. Both governments and social partners share responsibility for ensuring that wage determination takes sufficient account of labour market conditions and does not jeopardise competitiveness and employment. Active labour market policies should tackle persistent bottlenecks, such as skill mismatches.  Finally, protection of vested interests in the product markets and lack of mobility and adaptability in the labour markets undermine job creation, in particular for young and less qualified workers, as well as for all those who face problems entering the labour market. Lowering barriers to entry will increase competition, particularly in those domestic service sectors that are sheltered from international competition, and thus support price stability. Economic growth led by the private sector needs to be fostered by a stable and business-friendly policy environment. In this respect, governments should strive for transparency and predictability of the policy regime, a low compliance burden, and effective governance in applying the rule of law.  Fiscal policy  It is also crucial that the achievement of price stability is supported by sound fiscal positions, the third building block of convergence. Irresponsible fiscal policies can jeopardise credibility, as higher inflation becomes desirable to reduce the real value of government debt.  Fiscal policies should be sustainable and oriented to the medium term. They should further aim at mitigating undesirable trend growth differentials through “high quality” expenditure and tax policies. In particular, high and inefficient public expenditure can put a brake on economic activity by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses.  Financial policies  The fourth building block is financial policy. A sound banking sector, liquid and well-functioning capital markets are important for the sustainability of nominal convergence.  On the one hand, well-functioning banking sectors and capital markets ensure efficient financing of capital accumulation in the economy, thus supporting potential output growth. On the other hand, they sustain the smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission channels, such as the interest rate and bank lending channels. In this regard, financial sector vulnerabilities pose great challenges for the conduct of monetary policy. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  Conclusions Let me draw to a close. The experiences of the past few years have shown that participation in a monetary union places important demands on national economic policies. Euro area governments are hard at work responding to those demands. They are correcting macroeconomic imbalances. They are establishing a stronger framework of governance to keep countries on the path of sustainable convergence. And they are improving the institutional set-up underpinning monetary union. For those EU members that have not yet adopted the euro, the challenge is to achieve a high degree of sustainable convergence with the euro area. This requires credible commitment on the part of their central banks to achieve price stability and treatment of exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest. For the members of the euro area, the challenge is to achieve full compatibility of their economies with participation in monetary union. Product and labour markets must possess sufficient adjustment capacity to buffer shocks while maintaining high output and employment. It is in this area that progress is most needed. As I have indicated, much work remains to be done – in both the current and prospective members of the euro area, and both individually in each EU member, and jointly across Europe. But I have no doubt that this opportunity to continue progress will be seized and that together we will reap the benefits of sustainable economic convergence and lasting regional integration.  Thank you for your attention. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Rundheersing Bheenick: Past Imperfect, Present Tense and Future Conditional Speech by Mr Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Annual Dinner in honour of Economic Operators, Pailles, 6 December 2012. *      *      * Taking stock I have been here nearly six years and I thought it opportune tonight to look back, take stock before the past is truly past, and then try to peer into our hazy economic future as we continue to battle through what certainly looks like an extended period of economic uncertainty. The past six years The most obvious change at the Bank in these past six years has been the new and, some might say, sumptuous building. I inherited that, and since moving in, I have been conscious of the necessity for the Bank to deliver even better value for money than in the past. For as Lord Kelvin has said: Large increases in cost with questionable increases in performance can be tolerated only in race horses and fancy women. We had to pay greater attention to our performance. The Bank plays a supportive role in the economy. But the global financial crisis – which happened to coincide with my assuming the role of Governor; I trust not a case of post hoc ergo propter hoc – encouraged me to look a little beyond our traditional role to embrace that of promoting socio-development by giving new life to some of the little-used statutory powers of the Bank. So I set out to improve governance by putting in place the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). I called upon external talents and developed clear lines of communication with economic agents. The MPC has been worth its salt and I pressed for statutory changes to make it more transparent and accountable by publishing the minutes of its meetings and the individual voting pattern of MPC members. I also embraced an open-door policy responding to the concerns of the various economic stakeholders going well beyond the banking industry, to include real sector operators, academia, opinion leaders, and consumer associations. We have regular public consultations through press conferences and public addresses. I initiated, amongst others, MERI − the Mauritius Exchange Rate Index −, PLIBOR – the Port Louis Interbank Offered Rate − and the Inflation Expectations Survey to focus more sharply on expectations to help us track changing market sentiment. We initiated two new regular reports, one on Financial Stability and the other on Inflation. In addition, we have brought in some internal reorganisation endowing the institution with a flatter structure enabling more delegation, faster response, and greater flexibility in decision-making. New operating units were created to address new issues, such as financial stability and Islamic finance, or to give sharper focus to specific work areas such as financial markets and compliance. Banking supervision and regulation were strengthened; the payments system was modernised allowing for cheque truncation and bulk clearing; financial market infrastructure was spruced up with single-maturity auctions of Treasuries; financial literacy programmes were initiated. All these required strong emphasis on capacity-building and training, and continuous interaction with regional and global networks to keep up to the mark. Above all, I have been steering affairs, guided by Rabindranath Tagore’s great prayer, 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches Give me the strength never to disown the poor, nor bend my knees before insolent might. We continue to prize our independence and we defend it in the best interests of the country. Often we remind the most powerful in the land that our concerns extend not least to pensioners and those constrained to live off their savings; for our task at the Central Bank extends to promoting a stable and growing economy for all. It is vital for the Bank to respond to the interests of all sectors, not just the most powerful, the best-connected, or the most vociferous. Now if Paul Getty’s formula for success was …rise early, work late and strike oil I have had to adapt that to the circumstances of Mauritius where there is no black gold. Not finding oil here, the Bank has taken to buying gold; we bought two metric tonnes of it from the IMF in November 2009 for 2 billion rupees: that gold is now worth nearly 3½ billion rupees. The profit from this should pay for a few tower blocks or even a few new botanical gardens. And to ensure all Mauritians have easy access to a similar deal, we now offer for sale to the public solid gold bars; so do come by and make a mint while the stocks last. This offer comes during the course of our 45th anniversary year as the central bank in Mauritius and we have had a series of international events in celebration. As a more lasting commemoration, we shall be issuing a souvenir book on central banking, the economy and Mauritian society. Riding the storm Now, many theorists have speculated on the causes of the continuing international financial crisis − perhaps as many as those whose speculation promoted it! Some here have contributed to this mountain of analysis. On these occasions, I usually offer a new Law to illuminate the issue of concern. We’ve had Maradona’s law of interest rates; Einstein’s law of success; Newton’s laws on physical response; and now I offer you Poul Andersen’s law. This is the obverse of the law of Occam’s razor for simplicity of explanatory hypotheses. So I offer you tonight Andersen’s law of the shaving brush, in which he declared: I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when looked at in the right way, did not become still more complicated. This law underpins much of the writing about the recent crisis. But for my own part I prefer to go straight to the point, as Liaquat Ahmed has done in his brilliant analysis of the Great Depression, when he wrote: More than anything else…the Great Depression (1929–31) was caused by the failure of intellectual will and a lack of understanding about how the economy operated.  Similarly, I put down the lingering crisis to the dual impact of market failure in the capital market and supervisory and policy failure at the level of financial boards and the regulators. Incredibly, other banking Boards did not see the demise of Barings as prime evidence of a fatal flaw that could engulf the banking world and much beyond, as it did. To correct this flaw required just a little imagination and courage. Unfortunately, this turned out to be beyond the grasp of every western bank board, every regulator and supervising agency, every Minister of Finance and every Government. Thus the poor tax payer has had to pick up the tab for the gross failure of top financial management, leaving the banksters’ bonuses and golden parachutes largely intact. Those in charge just lacked the courage to ensure that if banks went bust so must the bankers. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Which rather reminds me of Lord Salisbury’s observation on the political scene: You will find as you grow older that courage is the rarest of qualities to be found in public life. So, where are we now in Mauritius in the lingering crisis? We’ve done rather well in fact. In the last six years the total assets of banks have expanded by 70 per cent; our 21 banks have almost 35,000 shareholders and employ over 7,000 staff. I have granted five new banking licences, the public now has access to 216 branches with 2.5 million accounts – or 2 accounts per head of population. More than half of the bankable population are internet-banking users. The footprints of our banks stretch from the Indian Ocean islands, to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe on the continent, and across to Maldives and India. The list of the Top 80 Banks in Africa in terms of assets includes three of our banks. We have consistently logged positive economic growth, and enjoyed social peace with low inflation and moderate unemployment. Despite the lingering global economic crisis, our banking and financial system has remained robust, resilient and well-managed. Strong supervision and prudent management have earned us a coveted place on the short list of countries that actually had a rating upgrade this year when the likes of the United States, France and, more recently, the European Stability Mechanism, have been stripped of their coveted triple-A ratings. Banks in Mauritius have continued to make extraordinary profits, beyond those of even our top six companies in the real economy! Let’s hope our top bankers will share this wealth judiciously with all stakeholders to the benefit of all the people of this land. A fair deal for bank customers is very much at the top of our agenda. It is not exactly a secret although it may not be very widely known in financial circles but we do have very fishy banks in Mauritius – and large ones too. It is also an area where there are many sharks. Worse, these fishy banks are all under water. Now, before you look suspiciously at the banker sitting at your table, let me give you the names of these fishy banks. Do I feel a chill running through our bankers? Out with the names then! They are Sudan bank, Nazareth bank, and Saya de Malha bank. These banks, which do not require a bank licence, are within our territorial waters of 2 million km2 and are very fishy indeed. They provide us with our white fish for the dinner table and occasionally, like now, with a fishy tale for dinner table chat as well. We have here a clear case of fishy banks without fishy bankers. If any of our scoop-hungry press is ruminating over a catchy headline: “Very Fishy Banks in Mauritius, Governor says”. let me gently remind them of the benchmark for this kind of mis-reporting set by a cub-reporter covering the visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury to the US, landing in New York.  The Archbishop had been advised to be cautious with the scandal-mongering press. “Be discreet: be very discreet; but with a smile”. On arrival he was hijacked by a bevy of press men clamouring for a story. One reporter asked “What do you think of the night clubs in New York?” Remembering to be discreet, with a smile, the Archbishop ironically responded “Are there any night clubs in New York?” Headlines next day: Archbishop’s first question on landing in New York “Are there any night clubs here?” Some people have continued to express dismay that we are not continuing to achieve the 5% growth that they had come to feel was our birth-right. May I say, this is just unrealistic. It arises from a failure to understand the dynamics of economic growth. These dynamics change as you emerge from the developing to the developed stage. To move into the higher income bracket, escaping the middle-income trap is a long haul. It requires quite different capacities and is not done at the sprint of 5% but more at the pace of a long-distance runner. It is good to remind ourselves − especially if we are inclined to agonise over the estimated 3.4% GDP growth rate this year − that 1% on our national income now is far greater than 5% 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches was twenty years ago. Why? Simply because the national cake is much bigger! Just the annual incremental output in 2012 – at an estimated nominal Rs21 billion – is greater than the entire GDP of the country was as recently as 1987. “Growth at any cost” has never been our credo. Equitable growth, inclusive growth, sustainable growth is what we have been pursuing with, as even the most carping critic must concede, impressive results in terms of rising national income, a stable multi-ethnic society, and a democratic polity. Our track record may not be perfect; our present may be tense; and our future may look conditional – that may in fact well serve as an apt diagnosis of our predicament at any point in our recent history. What we should avoid is the risk of blowing it all by pursuing an unrealistic agenda of higher growth by monetary fixes. Instead of growing at a brisk sprint, galoping inflation is the more likely outcome if we rush down this route. We must adapt to the “new normal” of reduced growth in the western economies on whose coattails our export-driven economy has been riding. What we need to power future growth is not cheap labour but increasing productivity, greater competitiveness, more innovation and a more agile, cerebral management in both the public and the private sectors. But if we have indeed weathered the storm, some of our sails are looking rather shabby, and badly in need of a refit. But what sort of refit do we need? And what sort of strategy must we devise to continue to face up to the turbulent world? Lessons we have learned We should be wise to acknowledge another of oilman Paul Getty’s maxims, this time on banking: If you owe the bank $100, that is your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that’s the bank’s problem. Which reminds me of the story of the very distinguished banker, if there are any left standing. Our banker was attending a grand international conference of bankers. The sessions that day had been long, with detailed workshops and breakout sessions. After a formal dinner he paused for a night-cap in a quiet bar in the hotel. As he was relaxing over a screwdriver, his favourite cocktail, a fashionably-dressed lady, slid into the seat beside him, flashed a smile and engaged him in conversation. He could not remember her in the conference sessions, so he explained he was a banker at the conference of international bankers taking place at the hotel. She took up his offer of a drink and settled down with a screwdriver, too. “Much obliged”, she said, sipping appreciatively, and giving him her best come-hither look. As our banker just looked into his glass, wondering who he was dealing with, she added, “I also oblige – for a fee of course.” “I oblige my clients anytime”, she went on. Our banker was trying to puzzle this out. She vaguely reminded him of a Churchillian wartime speech as she continued: “I oblige them in the train; I oblige in the car; I oblige in the office, I oblige in the lift, I oblige on the golf course…” “Oh, blow me!” interrupted our banker, as the penny finally dropped, “why − you are a banker, like the rest of us! Tell me, which bank are you with?” Now, I have sanitised the story considerably for sensitive ears, but you get the gist of it! So, be on your guard when you come across an obliging banker! If there is one thing we must learn, it is how to bring banking and accountancy back in from the righteous wind of public anger, for a refit with refreshed ethics, a new sense of corporate probity and a bolder 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 capacity for corporate governance. That is exactly what we seek to achieve by the new Guidelines on Corporate Governance that we introduced in August this year. Not to be outdone, the Banker’s Association has announced that it is coming up with a new Code of Ethics and Banking Practice. Not a minute too soon, one might be tempted to say! So I must say that I am very pleased to hear that after the Diamond era of super bonuses and the alleged massaging of the figures in rampant rate-rigging, one of the largest banks concerned is to refocus on the retail trade. Good news indeed! For here we are initiating the separation of domestic banking from international banking business, as a sound precaution against any further global infection. Let’s just hope that bankers everywhere remember whose money they are speculating on − not their own money but yours! So what can we learn from the past few years? To be sure, we should be more vigilant in identifying the first tell-tale signs of bubbles. We should be wary of unsustainable credit levels and fat profit margins. Banks must again pursue the function of promoting the optimum allocation of capital, and not just sit on it. We must also remember that real estate is just houses, buildings and land that have fundamental economic, social and environmental functions, only some of whose value appears in the accountants’ books. We need to account for all these functions more clearly.  We may also draw lessons for the future as we approach key decisions on advancing the regional integration agenda with Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Southern Africa Development Community, Association of African Central Banks and the rest. For we need forms of management in business and political governance that rise above the self-interest of the nation-state. When 90% of the people of the south western Indian Ocean are living in poverty − I speak principally of Madagascar and the Comoros − we might ask ourselves, not how we can continue to be in the lead at the top of the Mo Ibrahim Index for Africa, but what have we done with that leadership to secure development in our region to relieve poverty, and to promote growth. What we lack now is a clear vision for our future, a long-term picture of where we want to be in 2030 based on greater intra-regional cooperation and reinvigorated trade, amongst others. To turn round the famous Clinton adage on political priorities, it seems to me that on the regional integration issue: It’s all about trade, stupid! A future prospectus We have been promoting greater financial integration and facilitating regional banking initiatives. The IOC is promoting new regional ventures in air and sea transport and in communications; many businesses are extending their regional links. But we would do well to think ahead about combining regional fiscal and monetary management and the development of regional governance through some sharing of sovereignty. But if intra-regional trade is where the EU, and indeed the USA, began, we have yet to reach the starting blocks. We need free movement of capital and labour; we need social union with common frameworks for labour law, portable pensions and social security; we must foster greater international competitiveness and probity; we need fewer cartels and more competition. We need to nurture greater savings and investment with a regional fund for development and less reliance on external aid programmes. Banking union is a very distant prospect; and dare I even mention that far-off dream of a common currency? For our dreams need to keep in touch with reality and not turn into debilitating daydreams. If our dreams are to be, then as Tagore has declared: We have no time to lose, and having no time we must 
6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Scramble for our chances. We are too poor to be late… Or as Ovid remarked, for those who still have some Latin: Tempus edax rerum. And for those who don’t have the Latin, I might broadly translate that as Time [is] the devourer of all things. That is why I have put so much effort in recent years into the tasks of getting banking ready for regional lift-off. For I am doing nothing less than banking on the future of Mauritius as a regional leader in this field. We must avoid the pitfalls that are testing the EU, seeing the task not to enrich ourselves but to enrich all the peoples of these beautiful African lands.  As I close, let me say that last year some of you were kind enough to say they liked my speech. Others suffered a mild bout of indigestion and were less kind. A few are still smarting from the mere recollection. But words, whether meant in earnest, or spoken half in jest, are just precursors of greater things. I trust that, over my six years as Governor, I have adequately demonstrated that I go well beyond word-smithing. In these matters, I am a disciple of the Athenian Statesman, still celebrated for his rhetorical prowess, Demosthenes, who declared (and here I will save you from the original Attic Greek): First in oratory is action; second is action; and again third is action! 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Mario Draghi: ECB press conference – introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, and Mr Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 6 December 2012. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President, Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Owing to high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes in some euro area countries, HICP inflation rates have been elevated for some time. More recently they have declined, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% in 2013. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation rates should remain in line with price stability. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The economic weakness in the euro area is expected to extend into next year. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors and persistent uncertainty will continue to weigh on economic activity. Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, as global demand strengthens and our accommodative monetary policy stance and significantly improved financial market confidence work their way through to the economy. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. Today, we have also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2013 on 9 July 2013. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem’s special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2013. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. The rates in the three-month longer-term refinancing operations, to be allotted until June 2013, will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective longer-term refinancing operation.  Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a contraction of 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, euro area real GDP declined by 0.1% in the third quarter. Available statistics and survey indicators continue to signal further weakness in activity in the last quarter of the year, although more recently some indicators have stabilised at low levels and financial market confidence has improved further. Over the shorter term, weak activity is expected to extend into next year, reflecting the adverse impact on domestic expenditure of weak consumer and investor sentiment and subdued foreign demand. A gradual recovery should start later in 2013 as our accommodative monetary policy stance and significant improvement in financial market confidence work their way through to private domestic expenditure, and a strengthening of foreign demand should support export growth. This assessment is reflected in the December 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between  –0.6% and –0.4% for 2012, between –0.9% and 0.3% for 2013 and between 0.2% and 2.2% for 2014. Compared with the September 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for 2012 and 2013 have been revised downwards.  
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  The Governing Council continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area. These are mainly related to uncertainties about the resolution of sovereign debt and governance issues in the euro area, geopolitical issues and fiscal policy decisions in the United States possibly dampening sentiment for longer than currently assumed and delaying further the recovery of private investment, employment and consumption.  According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation fell to 2.2% in November 2012, down from 2.5% in October and from 2.6% in the two previous months. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% next year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate.  This assessment is also reflected in the December 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation of 2.5% for 2012, between 1.1% and 2.1% for 2013 and between 0.6% and 2.2% for 2014. Compared with the September 2012 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection range for 2013 has been revised downwards.  In the Governing Council’s assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as broadly balanced, with downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices.  Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued, taking into account developments over several months. Most recently, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 3.9% in October, from 2.6% in September, while M1 growth accelerated to 6.4% from 5.0% over the same period. These developments are partly due to a specific transaction leading to an increase in overnight deposits belonging to the non-monetary financial sector. At the same time, deposits from households and non-financial corporations also rose in October. Overall, more observations are needed to distinguish between shorter-term volatility and more lasting factors.  Unlike in the case of monetary developments, there has been little change in credit growth. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at –0.4% in October, unchanged from September. But this development reflects further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations, which led to an annual rate of decline in these loans of –1.5%, down from –1.2% in September. The annual growth in MFI lending to households remained unchanged at 0.8% in October. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the weak outlook for GDP, heightened risk aversion and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises, all of which weigh on credit demand. Furthermore, in a number of euro area countries, capital constraints, risk perception and the segmentation of financial markets restrict credit supply.  In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. The soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. A single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks. It is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system.  To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Further economic policy measures and progress in the reform of European governance should help to support financial market sentiment and improve the outlook for economic growth. In this context, the Governing Council looks forward to the roadmap towards genuine 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  Economic and Monetary Union to be decided at the European Council meeting on  13–14 December 2012. Initiatives to accelerate structural reforms that help restore competitiveness are particularly important to revive the growth potential of euro area countries and to increase employment. More generally, all euro area countries must ensure that their product and labour markets possess the adjustment capacity required for their smooth and effective functioning within a monetary union. Finally, continued fiscal consolidation is expected to restore sound fiscal positions, in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and the 2012 European Semester recommendations. Significant progress has already been made in reducing domestic and external imbalances and in improving competitiveness. Continued policy actions on the European, structural and fiscal reform fronts should be mutually reinforcing and send a strong signal to markets.  We are now at your disposal for questions. 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Jan F Qvigstad: Understanding macroprudential regulation Introductory remarks by Mr Jan F Qvigstad, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the workshop on “Understanding macroprudential regulation”, organised by Norges Bank, Oslo, 29 November 2012. *      *      * Dear all, It is a pleasure to welcome you to Norges Bank for this workshop on Understanding Macroprudential Regulation. The topic of the workshop is timely; Authorities in all parts of the world are now actively debating macroprudential policy. Academic research provides a necessary foundation, both for the design and the implementation of such regulations. During my years of service here at the central bank, and also some years at the Treasury, I have had my fair share of dealings with banking and financial crises in Norway. In the 1990s, Norway was hit by a severe banking crisis. Three of the four largest banks failed. Required capital injections were more than three and a half per cent of GDP. This is substantially more than the percentage share that euro area banks currently need to recapitalise. Ever since the Norwegian banking crisis in the early 1990s, our banking industry has been regulated more strictly than banks in comparable countries. For instance, bank capital definitions have been tighter, while packaging loans into complex instruments was in practice not permitted until 2007. Financial supervision has also been rather strict. As a result, the Norwegian financial system only had limited exposure to the subprime mortgage market – notwithstanding some municipalities in the northern part of Norway that got involved, with a less than full understanding of inherent risks. Our banks were therefore relatively unaffected by the recent crisis when it comes to credit risk. The downturn that our economy experienced in 2009 was modest in relation to other countries – but this is of course also due to the composition of our production and exports, with oil accounting for a large share. More than two decades ago, in the early stages of the Norwegian banking crisis, Norges Bank provided a large liquidity loan to a savings bank. The bank, however, soon became insolvent. We learnt how fast illiquidity can turn into insolvency. At the time, the bank was rescued partly by Norges Bank writing off its loan. This incident showed that it was important to clarify the division of responsibilities between the central bank and the fiscal authorities. The Government Bank Insurance Fund was established, which would be able to extend loans and inject capital into distressed banks in the future. The aim was to make sure Norges Bank avoided intruding into the arena of the fiscal authorities. It is not up to an independent central bank to spend taxpayers’ money. When Norwegian banks’ funding dried up in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, government bonds were swapped for covered bonds issued by banks. That is, the Ministry of Finance became the banks’ counterparty in the swap arrangement. We thereby avoided an expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet while improving the liquidity and funding situation of our banks. The most recent global financial crisis has taught us that it is vital to focus on the financial system as a whole, and not only on its components. Many of the risks that played a role in the recent crisis were identified by central banks and international financial institutions. However, not enough attention was paid to the ways in which these risks were interconnected and how they reinforced each other. System-wide risk amplified the financial crisis and its global repercussions. An international response to the management of systemic risk has been to introduce macroprudential regulation. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  However, incorporating systemic oversight in the financial stability framework poses considerable analytical and operational challenges for most countries. Indeed, we as economists have relatively limited understanding of the design and effectiveness of macroprudential policies. But, even when inflation targeting was introduced, not much was known about how to go about implementing it. Practice and research developed in parallel, interacting. We hope to see similar developments regarding macroprudential policies. To this end, Norges Bank, like many other national and international monetary authorities, is actively working to further develop the conceptual and analytical foundations for macroprudential policy. Several analytical approaches for the identification of the factors contributing to the building up of systemic risk may be used and different policy tools may be employed to address them. One policy instrument introduced by Basel III is the countercyclical capital buffer. In line with our past experience of dividing responsibilities, the Ministry of Finance will implement countercyclical capital requirements from 2013. Norges Bank will make recommendations for its buffer decisions. We therefore need to strengthen our understanding of macroprudential regulation and develop relevant analytical tools for our recommendations. The financial crisis called renewed attention to the fact that developments in the real economy and the financial sector are closely linked. In response, Norges Bank has decided to provide monetary policy and financial analyses in a joint report published quarterly as from 2013. The reports will form the basis for both monetary policy decisions and for our advice on the buffer. The primary objective of monetary policy is low and stable inflation over time. We operate a flexible inflation targeting regime, which also aims at stabilising economic activity. Furthermore, Norges Bank gives weight to the risk that a prolonged period of low interest rates could lead to elevated risk-taking and excessive debt accumulation in the household and business sectors. There is always room for improvement. We will seek to improve systemic risk indicators and macro-stress testing approaches, keeping them at the research frontier. We will also work to better incorporate the financial sector in our macroeconomic models. Economic research can contribute significantly to this, and in this context, some fundamental questions need to be addressed. – First, what is the macroeconomic impact of financial regulations? A greater understanding of how financial regulations act at the aggregate level is needed, both in containing systemic risk and in affecting the growth potential of economies. This would enable us to make more informed policy recommendations. – Second, how should systemic risk for banks, non-bank financial institutions and markets be identified and measured? Economists have proposed several methods of measuring systemic risk. But more research is needed in order to understand systemic risk arising from banks and non-bank financial institutions and their interaction. – Third, how should monetary policy be conducted in the context of macroprudential policy? And there are many more questions, some of which will be discussed during this workshop. We are eager to learn from the expertise and the experience of other countries. Norges Bank is committed to investing in research and supporting cooperation with other central bankers and foreign academics. This workshop is one product of this commitment. We are fortunate to have such prominent speakers contributing to the program. I wish you fruitful and stimulating discussions, and I hope you enjoy your stay in Oslo. Fortunately, the weather is on our side, motivating us to stay focused on our work. It would have been more difficult on a sunny day in June.  
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Njuguna Ndung’u: National “Chomoa Coins” Campaign – importance of coins in Kenya Address by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the launch of the National “Chomoa Coins” Campaign, Nairobi, 26 November 2012. *      *      * Mr. Richard Etemesi, Chairman, Kenya Bankers Association; Mr. Habil Olaka, Chief Executive, Kenya Bankers Association; Mr. Alfred Nganga, Chairman, Retail Traders Association of Kenya;  CEOs of Commercial Banks; Chairmen and CEOs of Represented Supermarkets; Distinguished Guests;  Ladies and Gentlemen: I am honoured to launch the 2012 National Coin Week, we dub it “Chomoa Coins Campaign” which starts today, November 26th and ends on December 7th, 2012. As you are all aware, the Central Bank of Kenya is charged with the responsibility of ensuring availability of adequate currency, that is, Banknotes and coins, across the country. Pursuant to this mandate, the Central Bank of Kenya has over the years endeavoured to ensure that there is adequate supply of coins. However, in the recent past, last year to be precise, concerns started to emerge among members of the public regarding challenges in obtaining coin-change at retail outlets. In response to these concerns, the Central Bank together with key stakeholders such as the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA), Supermarkets and the Matatu Owners Association, launched the National Coin Week initiative in July 2011. The campaign was very successful as members of the public brought out large amounts of coins into circulation, thus alleviating the perceived shortage. However, in the early part of this year, the momentum seemed to have waned and reports of perceived coin shortages have resurfaced again. Ladies and Gentlemen: it is against this background that the Central Bank of Kenya has once again partnered with key stakeholders such as the Media, the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) and the Retail Traders Association of Kenya (RETRAK) among others, to promote the re-circulation and use of coins. As mentioned last year, it is the view of the Central Bank that the current perceived shortage of coins could be addressed through circulation of the coins presently held by the public in their homes, tills, piggy banks, car pouches etc. The purpose of the coin week campaign therefore is to: • Sensitize the Mwananchi on the importance of coins in the economy; • Encourage the public to exchange coins for notes; • Promote the habit and culture of using coins in day to day transactions; • But also encourage a cost-effective circulation of coins. Ladies and Gentlemen: as you are aware, coins constitute low-value units of our currency structure and adequate availability at all times everywhere cannot be over-emphasized. Most of you must have witnessed situations at Points of Sale (POS) and retail outlets where token items such as sweets or matchboxes are offered in place of coin-change. This is a practice that we would like to see stopped. Coins should be readily available in all retail outlets to 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  ensure proper pricing and avoid undue retail price hikes or issuance of token items in lieu of coins. The Central Bank through the commercial banks has continued to ensure that adequate quantities of coins are in circulation. As of today, the Central Bank of Kenya has issued into circulation over 1.31 billion pieces of coins in various denominations with an estimated face value of Ksh.5.1 billion. We believe these coins are more than adequate to serve the economy. In the month of October 2012 alone, CBK released 9 million pieces of coins into circulation, while in November 2012, a further 12 million pieces have so far been released, yet the challenges on coin circulation still persist in some segments of the market. It must be that it is the circulation problem in the country. We believe that the bulk of coins are held by members of the public either in their homes, offices or car pouches or is it becoming expensive to make trips to the bank for coins? This trend seems to be continuing and we need to find a mechanism to end or discourage it. It is therefore clear that the problem of inadequacy of coins in circulation cannot be addressed by adding new coins but by ensuring that there is an efficient mechanism for re-circulating existing coins within the economy. The 2012 National Coin Week has therefore been appropriately dubbed “Chomoa Coins” and involves a variety of media activities which have been mooted by the Central Bank, KBA, Supermarkets and the other key stakeholders. Besides educating the public on the importance of coins, the key campaign aims at: • Encouraging the general public to utilize coins in making low value payments;  • Calling upon everyone keeping coins in homes, offices, cars etc. to instead circulate them by dropping them at designated change points in supermarkets and banks; • Informing the general public and traders in particular that they have a responsibility towards their currency and should accept all legal tender coins that are in circulation  • Partnering with commercial banks for a most cost-effective way to ensure circulation.  The Central Bank in collaboration with all the stakeholders will continue to explore ways of addressing bottlenecks in the coin circulation system and strive to provide solutions. The Bank also encourages the development of innovative approaches and mechanisms, including use of technologies that facilitate the efficient distribution, exchange and circulation of coins. May I also take this opportunity to thank all stakeholders for supporting this event. Ladies and Gentlemen: with these brief remarks, it is now my honour and pleasure to formally launch the 2012 ‘National “CHOMOA COINS” Campaign’. Thank you and God bless you 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 1  Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Opportunities facing Islamic finance and challenges in managing capital flows in Asia Outline of special address by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the 8th World Islamic Economic Forum, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, 4 December 2012. *      *      * The Prime Minister of Malaysia, His Excellency Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Razak  The President of Comoros, His Excellency Ikililou Dhoinine  The President of the Islamic Development Bank, His Excellency Ahmad Mohamed Ali Chairman of the World Islamic Economic Forum Foundation Tun Musa Hitam Ministers and distinguished guests Ladies and gentlemen Introduction  It is my pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to share some thoughts.  Let me first congratulate the WIEF on the progress it has made in establishing itself as a leading international forum for economic leaders and opinion shapers from a broad range of countries to discuss issues of interest in Islamic Finance and related themes in global finance. The theme of the Forum, “Changing Trends, New Opportunities” is particularly relevant. Allow me to first offer a brief perspective on opportunities facing Islamic finance. I will then go on to talk about the challenges we face in Asia in managing capital flows in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis.  Islamic finance: opportunities for growth  The Islamic finance industry is estimated to have grown by some 19% per year since 2006 – to record nearly US$1.3 trillion of total shariah compliant assets in 2012. But there is still considerable scope for its development: • Islamic finance presently forms less than 1% the global financial industry. • For a large number of countries, even in jurisdictions with substantial Muslim populations, Islamic finance currently constitutes less than 5% of their financial sector.1 • And despite a record level of sukuk issuance in 2012, the industry as a whole is still largely concentrated on the banking sector.2 There is much ahead in the journey to develop Islamic capital markets and the takaful (Islamic insurance) industry. I believe the next 10–15 years offer significant opportunities for the growth and diversification of Islamic finance. Let me highlight the reasons to be optimistic about its prospects:                                                 1  Based on surveys of the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB)’s members. 2  The Islamic Finance Mar 2012 report by the UK Islamic Finance Secretariat, a private sector industry body, estimated that the banking sector accounted for 93% of the global Islamic finance industry, with capital markets at 5% and Takaful at 2%. 
2 BIS central bankers’ speeches  • First, Islamic financial institutions have in the main escaped significant damage in the global financial crisis. They are well-placed to grow, at a time when many of the global banks, especially the European banks, are deleveraging or focusing on consolidating their balance sheets. • Second, Islamic finance has much potential to diversify into new growth areas such as trade and infrastructure financing in Asia and the emerging markets.  - These new areas will allow Islamic banks to reduce their exposure to the real estate sector, and to take advantage of the stronger growth potential of the emerging market economies. There are gaps to be filled in structured trade finance and in funding for infrastructural projects as the emerging markets grow, and as global finance consolidates. • Third, Islamic finance can also seek to meet the increased demand for simpler and more transparent products and ‘back-to-basics’ finance. Investors are now much more circumspect about complex products and their risks. The crisis taught investors worldwide not only about the damage they can face from the risks that are known and unsurprising, but of the risks of ‘what we do not know’. Islamic finance, with its focus on transparency, price certainty and risk-sharing, can ride this wave of demand for simpler and more basic investments. However, Islamic finance will have to overcome a few important challenges in order to grow its share in global finance and contribute to cross-border finance. These include the need to reduce fragmentation in Islamic finance markets due to differences in accepted standards of Shariah compliance between regions, jurisdictions, and in some cases even domestically within jurisdictions. This has hampered the flow of liquidity between jurisdictions, and is in part why there is yet no Islamic equivalents to the international money and bond markets.  There is considerable progress being made to address these challenges. Bodies such as AAOIFI,3 IDB’s Islamic Research & Training Institute, and Malaysia’s International Shariah Research Academy (ISRA) have made significant efforts to narrow the differences in acceptability of Shariah compliance. The Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), in conjunction with international standards setting bodies such as the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), IOSCO4 and IAIS5 and various regulators from Islamic and conventional jurisdictions, are also formulating international standards and best practices for the industry.  Islamic finance is also seeing increasing interest in Asia. We are seeing financial institutions leveraging on the strengths and expertise that have been developed in both Islamic and conventional financial markets. This is expanding the range of Shariah-compliant products and allowing the Islamic finance industry to tap on broad and deep investor pools globally and in Asia.  • Malaysia is widely recognised as a leader in Islamic finance, in particular for the issuance of sukuks. • Islamic finance is also seeing growing interest in other Asian financial centres such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo. • Just recently in mid-November 2012, institutional and private investors in Singapore and HK were the largest investors in the US$15.5 billion global sukuk issued by the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB).                                                 3  AAOIFI is Accounting & Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions 4  International Organisation of Securities Commissions 5  International Association of Insurance Supervisors 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 3  • Between our two countries, we are seeing Malaysian banks collaborating with Singapore corporates and financial players to structure S$ denominated corporate sukuk programmes. And Singapore-listed companies are venturing out to tap the Ringgit sukuk market in Malaysia. These are trends that we are keen to encourage.  To repeat therefore, I am optimistic that we can realise the significant growth potential for Islamic finance in the next 10–15 years. Managing the challenge of capital flows in the post-crisis era Let me move on now to say a few things about the challenges that many in the emerging world face in managing capital flows, particularly in the face of the extremely low interest rates being set in the advanced economies (AEs). We are in an unprecedented situation. Interest rates are expected to stay extremely low in the US and much of the advanced world for a few years, reflecting decisions by their central banks to keep monetary conditions highly accommodative until their economies resume normal growth. There is debate among economists on how effective these activist monetary policies, such as the US Fed’s QE3 strategy, will be in reviving entrepreneurial spirits and private investments. If the strategy succeeds and the US economy recovers, it will be a plus for Asia as well. In the meantime, however, there are significant implications for emerging market economies, as global investors search for better returns – better than the near-zero rates they get on cash and treasury bills. With large amounts of liquidity now moving between markets, short-term shifts in investor sentiment leads to volatility in capital flows. We have seen how a shock in the European periphery can send money that was invested in emerging markets rushing back to the US or other safe havens. To be clear about it, there is a lot that is good about capital flows, including even short term flows. They add liquidity to markets, by bringing more buyers and sellers together. However, we know too that capital inflows can also be too much of a good thing. They can lead to asset prices, or exchange rates, becoming disconnected from fundamentals. And the sudden withdrawal of capital from emerging economies when investors switch from ‘risk on’ to ‘risk off’ in their portfolios can be destabilising.  As I mentioned, the current global condition is unprecedented. The policy responses in the advanced countries too are without precedent. Globally therefore, we need some humility in understanding the benefits and costs of QE3 and easy monetary policies in the advanced countries. But it will be wise to strengthen our policy toolkits in Asia, so that we can deal with unpredictable and often excessive capital flows. There are some lessons that come out of our experiences in Asia and elsewhere, and policy responses that we can learn from each other. I will mention three sets of policy responses that will inevitably have to figure in our toolkits.  First, there is much sense in curtailing volatility in the exchange rate over the short-term. The costs of volatile and uncertain exchange rates are high in small open economies especially – which is what most of our ASEAN economies are. Accordingly, Malaysia, Singapore and several other Asian countries have not felt comfortable leaving their exchange rates entirely to market forces. Their central banks, within each of their monetary policy frameworks, have sought to instil a focus on longer term fundamentals.  There is merit in allowing exchange rates in Asia’s emerging economies to appreciate gradually over the long term, reflecting their more rapid growth. If we resist these long term trends, we are likely to see more inflation in our economies. But some stability in the short term is wise.  Second, macro-prudential policies are now an important part of the policy tool kit. Many Asian countries have introduced new macro-prudential measures to try and avoid bubbles in 
4 BIS central bankers’ speeches  their property markets over the last two years. Malaysia brought in stricter limits on loan-to-value ratios on housing loans. Singapore and Hong Kong have done similarly, and have introduced additional stamp duties or transaction taxes to discourage speculative demand for residential properties.  These targeted administrative and prudential measures are not conventional macro-economic tools. But they are likely to remain part of our policy toolkit, at least for the foreseeable future, given the real risks to macro-economic stability that an environment of very low global interest rates poses. A third and more fundamental strategy has to focus on building greater depth in Asia’s capital markets, while ensuring that our banking systems remain sound. A good example of this strategy is in fact in Malaysia. Bank Negara’s Financial Sector Blueprint II (2012–2020), released as part of the government’s Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), will build on the solid foundations of Malaysia’s financial system, including developing a deep and vibrant bond market. The banks in several leading Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are generally well-managed and well-capitalised. They were a source of strength for us during the global financial crisis. However, Asia’s capital markets, and especially the corporate bond markets, need much more depth. Broader and deeper capital markets will allow investors to invest for the long term while hedging against risks. They will help us meet the growing infrastructural and other long term investment needs of the region.  This is therefore a very important priority in the region, and there is in fact significant scope for future development of Asian capital markets. Regulators are working to harmonise rules and market practices across the region, such as issuance procedures and settlement standards. We also need to develop the securitisation markets, with appropriate safeguards, so that banks can recycle their capital. More too is being done to boost linkages between our markets and economies. We have to pool liquidity across our markets, so as to add depth to the Asian capital market. An example is how the Malaysian stock exchange, Bursa Malaysia, the Singapore Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Thailand recently launched an ASEAN Trading Link. We are also cooperating to encourage financing for infrastructure projects in the region. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF), an initiative that was led by Malaysia, is a good example. It will pool resources, knowledge and experience among ASEAN governments and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for loans to sovereign or sovereign-guaranteed infrastructure projects. The Fund will also issue bonds, so as to bring in private sector and institutional investors.  Another example of such cooperation in the region is the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) amongst the ASEAN+3 countries, which aims to help companies in ASEAN+3 countries raise long term financing for infrastructure investment by providing the governments’ guarantees on their corporate bonds, thereby reducing risk for bond-holders.  Projects such as Iskandar Malaysia are also a prime example of how intra-regional investments can be encouraged, and how countries in our region can develop competitive strengths jointly.  • Iskandar Malaysia’s performance has been impressive – poised to exceed its targeted RM100 billion investment mark by the end of this year. • I am glad there is good progress on the joint venture by Temasek Holdings and Khazanah Nasional, Pulau Indah Ventures Sdn Bhd to co-develop two separate sites in Medini.  • Other significant projects include a S$1.5 billion integrated eco-friendly tech-park by Ascendas and Malaysia’s UEM Land Berhad in Nusajaya (one of the five flagship 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 5  zones in Iskandar). Once completed, the park will accommodate a range of industries including electronics and precision engineering. • Just in the last month, we have seen other significant investment commitments in Iskandar reported by Singapore companies. Iskandar Malaysia will enhance the complementary space between our two economies. It is a win-win. To ensure continued progress in Iskandar, Singapore and Malaysia will continue to take steps to improve connectivity, cross-border trade facilitation, and immigration processes. Conclusion I would like to conclude by emphasising once again that I am basically optimistic about the prospects in our bilateral and regional cooperation. We face many challenges in this post-Global Financial Crisis era. But the opportunities for us in Asia are intact, and our ability to cooperate with each other to achieve our full potential as a region is an asset for all our countries.
