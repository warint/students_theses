1BIS Review 25/2000Mr Remsperger: Is there a New Economy in Germany?Lecture held by Prof Dr Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, in New York, on20 March 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,perhaps I have gone a step too far in asking the question I am putting today: How can one dare to askwhether there is a New Economy in Germany if economists are still debating whether the notion ofNew Economy fits to the US economy? Besides, I have been warned against using the label NewEconomy in the first place since, especially with a view to the rapid spread of computer-aidedtechnologies, the paradigm of interpretation used by the advocates of the “New Economy” is not sovery new at all.And indeed, it is quite appropriate in this context to recall the economic writings of JosephA Schumpeter. As early as 1911, in his Theory of Economic Development, he highlighted the role oftechnological innovation. Following Kondratieff, Schumpeter established that long-term developmentsare initiated by basic technological innovations. He also pointed out two characteristics: They areproduced from within the economy and generate long waves.Schumpeter, who completed his academic work in the United States, furthermore held the view thatthese new combinations of production factors are not evenly distributed through time “but appear, if atall, discontinuously in groups or swarms”.1 In another passage he wrote: “What we are about toconsider is that kind of change arising from within the system which so displaces its equilibrium pointthat the new one cannot be reached from the old one by infinitesimal steps. Add successively as manymail coaches as you please, you will never get a railway thereby.”2With these quotations from Schumpeter in mind, it is now easier for me to state what my commentstoday here in New York do and do not aim to achieve. It is not my intention to present a series ofacademic exercises on defining the New Economy. Instead, I aim to look at the German economy andeconomic policy from a perspective that has been created, as it were, in the “New Economy” of theUnited States. In doing so, I shall concentrate on four aspects: first, the labour market and inflation;second, growth and productivity; third, fiscal policy; and fourth, the financial markets.Before I continue with these topics in detail please let me emphasise how closely the subject of theNew Economy is linked to monetary policy. This applies not only to US monetary policy but also tothe two pillar approach of the European Central Bank. Regarding the first pillar - which is thereference value for money supply - the Governing Council of the ECB has pointed out that the trendgrowth of the economy could be enhanced by structural reforms on the labour and product markets.The European Central Bank would take such improvements into account in calculating the M3reference value. At the same time, the second pillar of the monetary policy approach - that is thebroadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments - would have to pay heed to traces ofa New Economy. However, it goes without saying that a conservative central banker cannot rely onhopes and expectations but only on reliable facts and established findings. To make it absolutely clear:My thoughts on some trace elements of a New Economy in Germany do not imply that I disregard theimportance of the money supply for the medium-term price development in the euro area.1Schumpeter, The Theory of Economic Development, (1911), Transactions Publishers, 1993, p. 223.2Schumpeter, loc. cit., p. 64.
BIS Review 25/20002But now let me get back to the four topics I have just mentioned. With regard to the labour market andinflation it is initially striking that the development of inflation in Germany over the last decade hasbeen fairly similar to that in the United States. However, there was a certain time lag in Germany.In the early 1990s, the German inflation rate was still around 5% owing to tight capacity utilisation.Since then it has fallen continuously. Since 1995 the inflation rate has been well below 2%. It is thuswithin a range that is consistent with price stability according to the ECB’s definition.In contrast to inflation, labour market trends in Germany during the 1990s have been fundamentallydifferent from those in the United States. Whereas the US unemployment rate has continued todecline, the unemployment rate in Germany has been rising significantly for a long time since thecyclical slump in 1992-93. And this has been accompanied by a continued decline in employmentdespite an active labour market policy and the creation of early retirement schemes. The Germanlabour market is, if you like, a classic element of an “old economy”. It is only recently that the dent ingrowth caused by the Asian crisis has been overcome, that an improvement can be detected on thelabour market.The causes of the German labour market problems are primarily structural. This can also be seen bythe comparatively large number of long-term unemployed. Wage formation is mainly geared to theinterests of “insiders” who already have a job and not to those “outsiders” who would prefer moderatewage settlements. The accelerated adjustment of east German wages to the west German standards isone example of insufficient wage differentiation. It is precisely in the lower wage groups that it wouldbe important to structure wage substitutes in a more incentive-friendly way.From a current perspective it remains an open question whether the establishment of Europeanmonetary union will ultimately also lead to a reduction in labour market rigidities. However, I shouldadd that we are witnessing a gradual erosion of industry-wide pay bargaining at least in easternGermany. And we also observe working hours becoming more flexible. However, further steps willhave to follow so that a wage policy which is in line with market requirements can help to stimulateemployment friendly growth.Furthermore, the non-accelerating rate of unemployment, or NAIRU, could also fall in Germany. Inthe United States all the signs indicate that the NAIRU declined significantly during the long boom.According to the Bundesbank’s calculations, which may like other calculations be regarded with somedegree of uncertainty, NAIRU has risen in Germany almost throughout the entire period since the endof the seventies. In western Germany, it is likely to have been above 8% towards the end of the 1990s.When I now come to the second area of my comments, “Growth and Productivity”, I do not have totell you about the US economy’s success story in the 1990s. It is well-known to you. In short: Outputand productivity growth has been very buoyant especially since the mid-1990s - that is in an advancedphase of the upturn. The scale and the timing of these productivity increases can scarcely be explainedin terms of the normal cyclical pattern. I wonder whether Schumpeter would have already interpretedthe available evidence as a long wave.In Germany, the GDP growth rate in the 1990s was almost 1½ percentage points below thecorresponding US figure. Currently, the difference in the trend growth is likely to be slightly morethan one percentage point.3 When considering the individual components of demand, the differentmomentum of capital spending is particularly striking. Whereas real investment in machinery andequipment in the United States has been growing at an annual average of almost 10% since 1993, it is3A precise quantification of this difference is not easily possible, since the forecasts of future developments are also ofimportance for estimates at the end of the series. For example, the OECD currently assumes a potential growth of the USeconomy of 3½%, whereas the IMF predicts 2¾%.
3BIS Review 25/2000only in the last two years that Germany has seen a recovery of investment in machinery andequipment, albeit not with double-digit rates of growth (1998: 9.2%, 1999: 5.1%).4If the different pace of economic growth is examined more closely, it becomes apparent that US outputgrowth is supported by a sharp increase in both employment and in labour productivity. This is astrong indication that a balanced growth process is existing, in which labour and capital complementeach other in terms of their contribution to output.With an average growth rate of 2%, labour productivity in Germany was quite close to the US figuresin the nineties.5 When analysing this development, however, it has to be remembered that theproductivity gains in Germany are also attributable to a fall in employment. The contrastingdevelopments in labour productivity and employment point to an extensive substitution of labour bycapital.It is, of course, not sufficient to look only at the highly aggregated level.6 The OECD comes to theconclusion that the development towards a services society has also made considerable advances inGermany: In a comparative study, it puts the share of “knowledge-based industries” in the UnitedStates and in Germany at just over 50% in each case.7 And within the category of investment, as in theUnited States, investment in software shows by far the highest growth rate in Germany.8 Thepioneering role which the United States has assumed in the development of new technologies is,however, likely to be unchallenged. A study by the Munich-based ifo Institute on the spread of newinformation and communication technologies, for example, concludes that generating suchtechnologies has not been a very prominent feature in Germany over the last decade as compared tothe United States or Japan.9This finding is broadly consistent with OECD studies on investment in R&D activities in theindustrialised countries: Whereas the share of these expenditures as a percentage of GDP declined inGermany during the nineties, it has been rising again in the United States over the past few yearsfollowing a decline in the early nineties.10 These facts are hardly surprising as the United States isgenerally attested a leading position in terms of the factor human capital in highly qualified,research-intensive jobs. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that Germany is known as acountry with a very good average quality of the factor human capital. This basically favours a broadapplication of new technologies and their adoption to particular enterprise-specific conditions.What do all these findings now imply for future growth prospects? Most of the currently availableforecasts agree that an economic recovery is to be expected in Germany over the next few years,whereas the pace of expansion in the United States is likely to decelerate, leading to a soft landing. Tothat extent, a certain convergence of cyclical growth can be expected. However, from the perspectiveof the debate on the “New Economy”, the key question is whether the anticipated upswing in Germanywill be more than cyclical in character and lead to a trend shift in the path of growth - in much the4An interpretation of these figures should take into account the fact that direct comparisons are complicated by thedifferent methods to adjust for price developments, especially in the capital goods sector. The depreciation components,which might differ for several reasons, should also be taken into account.5The figure relates to aggregate hourly labour productivity. The comparative value for the US corporate sector is 2.2%.6The term “New Economy” is also used especially “to describe the shift from the industrial production of goods towardsthe provision of knowledge-based services”. “The new economy has arrived in Euroland”, Goldman Sachs, EuropeanWeekly Analyst, 99/41, 199, S.1.7Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 1999. Benchmarking Knowledge-based Economies, OECD (1999).8This type of investment grew by an annual average of just over 8% in real terms in Germany in the nineties.9See in particular: Tertiarisierung und neue Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien, ifo-Schnelldienst, 29/99,p. 23-34.10Quoted from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Zur technologischen Leistungsfähigkeit Deutschlands,Endbericht 1999, p. 29.
BIS Review 25/20004same way as in the United States in the nineties. I believe this is possible if the willingness toundertake reforms is followed by action to match.What is of main importance to me in this connection is to point out that the integration of theEuropean goods and factor markets inherent in the EU’s single market programme is being acceleratedby the single monetary policy in the euro area. The resultant intensification of competition combinedwith the exploitation of increasing returns to scale in the enlarged markets might have a sustainedboosting impact on productivity. The changes in the telecoms sector are an example of how thederegulation of markets can make further progress in Germany as well. With the intensifiedcompetition, especially in an increasingly globalised competitive environment, this development willnot only act as a damper on prices. It is also likely to lead to further surges of modernisation, in whichnew globally available technologies will be employed.Before I come to the third area of my comments, I would like to touch briefly on the healthcare sector.It can be regarded as one of the engines of growth, provided it is not overly restricted by stateregulations. In Germany, this sleeping giant is still waiting to be unchained. But let me now turn tofiscal policy.Although fiscal policy is not at the actual centre of the New Economy controversy, I think it is a veryimportant player in the macroeconomic setting.In the United States, fiscal policy in the past decade has been characterised by a marked course ofconsolidation. For example, the initially quite high government budget deficits of almost 6% of GDPin 1992 were reduced completely and transformed into a slight surplus (1999: 1.0% of GDP).In Germany, reunification confronted fiscal policy with its most difficult task since the period ofreconstruction following World War II. The restructuring of the corporate sector in eastern Germanyin conformity with the social welfare system, the enormous task to modernise the public infrastructureand the adoption of the west German social security system required huge transfer payments to thenew Länder, the bulk of which was covered by public borrowing. As it happened, the opportunity ofapplying these measures as a tool for fundamental overall reforms was seized rather late and with littleenergy.In the end, there has been a significant increase in the public sector’s recourse to the resources of theeconomy as a whole: The ratio of public spending to GDP which had fallen to just under 46% inwestern Germany in 1989 rose to almost 51% by 1996. The public debt ratio increased from just under42% to almost 61% in the same period. Moreover, the taxes and social security ratio grew from justunder 42½% to slightly more than 43% owing to the sharp increase in social security contributions.These unhealthy developments in public sector finances made a reversal increasingly inevitable.Moreover, the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty had to be met. Since 1997, the deficit ratiohas been declining as a result of increased consolidation efforts. However, the fiscal framework at thebeginning of the new century cannot at all be described as optimal in macroeconomic terms.Nevertheless, the decisions taken since summer 1999 give rise to the hope that important changes inthe economy as a whole will also be supported by fiscal policy. However, the picture is very complexin this area.It has to be regarded as positive for the future development of the economy that the German federalgovernment is committed to pursuing a strict policy of consolidation. What is pleasing is that thiscourse does not just exist in theory but has already been substantiated by measures which will have arapid impact. Certainly, the savings package which envisages savings of DM 30 billion for 2000 andaround DM 50 billion for 2003 does not correspond to effective savings of the same level.Nevertheless, the public sector’s recourse to GDP is likely to fall.Moreover, there are plans to reduce the public sector deficit ratio to ½% by 2003. At a first glance, thismay not seem particularly ambitious. One might also have doubts as to whether the European Stabilityand Growth Pact target of achieving a budget close to balance or in surplus in the medium term can bemet in full. However, it should not be forgotten that the consolidation course is to be accompanied by
5BIS Review 25/2000tax reductions on a quite impressive scale. Hence, the planned reduction in public spending from48.5% of GDP in 1999 to 45% in 2003 is much stronger than the lowering of the budget deficit ratio.The twin-track approach of tax cuts and a restrictive spending policy has paved the way for a sustainedreduction of the public sector burden on the capital markets and hence the creation of greater scope forprivate investment. In addition, the conditions for investment and production in Germany are beingimproved through the tax cuts.It is possible to detect a distinct shift in focus in German fiscal policy. The Tax Relief Act which cameinto force at the beginning of 1999 primarily aimed at providing relief to lower-income earners andhouseholds with children. The economy was to be boosted from the demand side. The price paid forthis was a higher burden on enterprises and thus a deterioration in supply and investment conditions.The government’s plan for a reform of business taxation now aims to give relief to enterprises andthus create conditions that are more favourable to growth via the supply side. This reorientation isbeing accompanied by a further two-stage reduction in income tax in 2003 and 2005 which also coversthe top rates. In 2005, the top rate of income tax would then be 45% compared with 51% at present.The CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag would like to put through a reduction in the toprate of tax to 35% by 2003.The government’s planned tax reform will result in a substantial tax relief for enterprises in net termsas well, especially as a result of the sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to a uniform level of 25%.At present, the corporate tax rates are 40% on retained profits and 30% on distributed profits. The taxcut will strengthen Germany’s attraction as an industrial location. The planned tax exemption ofcorporations’ profits from the sale of equity stakes will facilitate corporate restructuring. Germany islikely to become more attractive as a location for holding companies.In all, the tax plans are an important and welcome beginning which should be followed by furthersteps. From the point of view of the tax system and in terms of a consistent and equal taxation of alltypes of income, the plans do have some shortcomings. Above all, problems are raised by the markedpreferential tax treatment of profits retained in enterprises, which cannot be justified onmacroeconomic grounds. This preferential treatment might also result in allocation distortions.Ultimately, a substantial reduction of all rates and a comprehensive widening of the tax assessmentbasis would be needed.Whereas approaches to a solution are becoming evident in fiscal policy, this cannot be said for thesevere structural problem of the statutory system of old-age provision. Here, the ageing of thepopulation has led to an implicit public sector debt building up on a major scale. With the existingsystem of old-age provision this debt can only be repaid by further increases in employees’ andemployers’ contributions. Official projections assume that this would result in the contribution ratehaving to rise to 24% by 2030. In addition, there would also be growing burdens in health and nursingcare insurance. The associated obstacles to growth and higher costs would be a severe strain on thedevelopment of the economy. The reform measures proposed so far are not enough to prevent such aquestionable development. Above all, what is needed is a restriction of the pension growth rate. Thiswould create room for supplementary privately funded pensions. This would also benefit the capitalmarkets. And mentioning the capital markets I have now arrived at the last topic of my presentation.Undoubtedly, the “New Economy” is closely connected with developments in the financial markets.For example, the sharp growth in the supply of venture capital in the United States suggests that themomentum of the real economy is being underpinned by flexible, innovative forms of financing in thecapital market.The German financial system has been traditionally characterised by the dominant role of the banks.Such more “bank-based” structures should by no means be equated with backwardness, however. Onthe contrary, the credit institutions’ intermediation can in some cases even be superior to themarket-based financial system. Just to give a particularly important example: The corporate landscapein Germany has traditionally been characterised by small- and medium-sized enterprises.Long-standing, strong business relationships with specific banks are particularly suited to covering thefinancing requirements of such enterprises at reasonable costs even in periods of economic difficulty.
BIS Review 25/20006However, from the perspective of the New Economy, market-based financing is especially important.It is precisely young, innovative enterprises with uncertain earnings prospects that often have to relyon financing sources outside the banking system.In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the rapidly increasing importance of the stockmarket in Germany. In 1999 alone, domestic enterprises issued shares with a market value of(cid:1)(cid:2) billion. This is an increase of almost 50% compared with 1998 and three times the 1997 figure.Particularly noteworthy is the high share of initial public offerings in what is known as the “NewMarket”, the market for young and innovative enterprises. More than 200 companies are now listed inthis category which has thus become an engine for financing innovative enterprises in Germany.However, the New Market is only appropriate for firms which have already established themselves inthe markets. Hence, it is of particular importance that, along with the success of the New Market,venture capital business has simultaneously taken a rapid upswing. Venture capital invested rose byDM 5 billion in Germany in 1999. At the same time, the structure of venture capital investment hasradically changed. Whereas it was more traditional sectors that attracted venture capital in the past,such investment now focuses on telecommunications, biotechnology and computing.The growth of both the New Market and venture capital are interdependent. The New Market offersideal conditions for transforming venture capital into risk capital traded on the stock exchangefollowing the phase of venture financing. In the past, the lack of such an “exit” option was one of theobstacles to the development of a broader venture capital market in Germany. The rapid growth of thestock market would not have been possible without the general public becoming increasinglyinterested in share investments. Much use is being made of indirect stock market activity throughinvestment funds.Complementing the provision of risk capital via the stock market, there has been a sharp rise in theissue volume of corporate bonds. This instrument was also used in the past year to finance mergersand acquisitions - in other words, the restructuring of the corporate sector. However, this increase isalso due to growing investor demand for higher-risk paper, since the scope of diversification hasbecome much smaller through the elimination of exchange rate risks following the introduction of theeuro. The German corporate bond market is still less developed than in the United States. However,there are indications that the emergence of corporate bonds as a means of long-term financing hasbecome increasingly prominent in supplementing the use of bank loans. The momentum and strengthof such an underlying trend seem to be influenced to a large degree by technological advances, thepace of structural change in the corporate sector and economic policy reforms, such as in tax law orold-age pension provisions. Additional impetus is being provided by European monetary union.Ladies and gentlemen, let me finally return to my initial question: “Is there a New Economy inGermany?” This question cannot be answered with a sweeping yes or no. But it can probably be statedfirstly that there are movements in Germany which are simultaneously beneficial to growth and pricestability. I see traces of such a New Economy, above all, in areas of the economy which for a longtime were subject only to limited competition, but which are now being deregulated. More growth inthose areas may even be accompanied by falling prices. Second, the new technologies are availableglobally. They are also available as growth potential outside the United States. Third, the Germanfinancial system seems well equipped not only to accommodate the changes in the real sector but alsoto support them. In Germany, we need and have both market-oriented and bank-oriented financialservices. I cannot and do not want to comment on the development of share prices in the New Marketin Germany. But I do believe that traces of a New Economy can also be found in this market segment.On top of that, ever-increasing competition and technological progress are leading to a far-reachingrenewal in the financial sector.Fourth, the economic policy decisions taken since summer 1999 suggest that an upswing in theeconomy as a whole is supported by the fiscal framework. What is especially positive is thecommitment to a strict consolidation course which is being reinforced by concrete savings measures.And, in line with Professor Issing, I would finally like to emphasise that monetary union in Europeand the completion of the single market are promoting corporate restructuring, which is improving theefficiency of the economy.
7BIS Review 25/2000Let me conclude by saying that computers and the Internet alone will not create a New Economy inGermany by themselves. Only structural reforms will reduce the impediments to growth. Acombination of technological change and structural reforms would make possible not only a better usebut also a widening of the potential for growth in Germany.
1BIS Review 25/2000Mr Remsperger: Is there a New Economy in Germany?Lecture held by Prof Dr Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, in New York, on20 March 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,perhaps I have gone a step too far in asking the question I am putting today: How can one dare to askwhether there is a New Economy in Germany if economists are still debating whether the notion ofNew Economy fits to the US economy?

Benchmarking Knowledge-based Economies, OECD (1999).8This type of investment grew by an annual average of just over 8% in real terms in Germany in the nineties.9See in particular: Tertiarisierung und neue Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien, ifo-Schnelldienst, 29/99,p. 23-34.10Quoted from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Zur technologischen Leistungsfähigkeit Deutschlands,Endbericht 1999, p. 29.
BIS Review 25/20004same way as in the United States in the nineties. I believe this is possible if the willingness toundertake reforms is followed by action to match.What is of main importance to me in this connection is to point out that the integration of theEuropean goods and factor markets inherent in the EU’s single market programme is being acceleratedby the single monetary policy in the euro area. The resultant intensification of competition combinedwith the exploitation of increasing returns to scale in the enlarged markets might have a sustainedboosting impact on productivity. The changes in the telecoms sector are an example of how thederegulation of markets can make further progress in Germany as well. With the intensifiedcompetition, especially in an increasingly globalised competitive environment, this development willnot only act as a damper on prices. It is also likely to lead to further surges of modernisation, in whichnew globally available technologies will be employed.Before I come to the third area of my comments, I would like to touch briefly on the healthcare sector.It can be regarded as one of the engines of growth, provided it is not overly restricted by stateregulations. In Germany, this sleeping giant is still waiting to be unchained. But let me now turn tofiscal policy.Although fiscal policy is not at the actual centre of the New Economy controversy, I think it is a veryimportant player in the macroeconomic setting.In the United States, fiscal policy in the past decade has been characterised by a marked course ofconsolidation. For example, the initially quite high government budget deficits of almost 6% of GDPin 1992 were reduced completely and transformed into a slight surplus (1999: 1.0% of GDP).In Germany, reunification confronted fiscal policy with its most difficult task since the period ofreconstruction following World War II. The restructuring of the corporate sector in eastern Germanyin conformity with the social welfare system, the enormous task to modernise the public infrastructureand the adoption of the west German social security system required huge transfer payments to thenew Länder, the bulk of which was covered by public borrowing. As it happened, the opportunity ofapplying these measures as a tool for fundamental overall reforms was seized rather late and with littleenergy.In the end, there has been a significant increase in the public sector’s recourse to the resources of theeconomy as a whole: The ratio of public spending to GDP which had fallen to just under 46% inwestern Germany in 1989 rose to almost 51% by 1996. The public debt ratio increased from just under42% to almost 61% in the same period. Moreover, the taxes and social security ratio grew from justunder 42½% to slightly more than 43% owing to the sharp increase in social security contributions.These unhealthy developments in public sector finances made a reversal increasingly inevitable.Moreover, the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty had to be met. Since 1997, the deficit ratiohas been declining as a result of increased consolidation efforts. However, the fiscal framework at thebeginning of the new century cannot at all be described as optimal in macroeconomic terms.Nevertheless, the decisions taken since summer 1999 give rise to the hope that important changes inthe economy as a whole will also be supported by fiscal policy. However, the picture is very complexin this area.It has to be regarded as positive for the future development of the economy that the German federalgovernment is committed to pursuing a strict policy of consolidation. What is pleasing is that thiscourse does not just exist in theory but has already been substantiated by measures which will have arapid impact. Certainly, the savings package which envisages savings of DM 30 billion for 2000 andaround DM 50 billion for 2003 does not correspond to effective savings of the same level.Nevertheless, the public sector’s recourse to GDP is likely to fall.Moreover, there are plans to reduce the public sector deficit ratio to ½% by 2003. At a first glance, thismay not seem particularly ambitious. One might also have doubts as to whether the European Stabilityand Growth Pact target of achieving a budget close to balance or in surplus in the medium term can bemet in full. However, it should not be forgotten that the consolidation course is to be accompanied by
5BIS Review 25/2000tax reductions on a quite impressive scale. Hence, the planned reduction in public spending from48.5% of GDP in 1999 to 45% in 2003 is much stronger than the lowering of the budget deficit ratio.The twin-track approach of tax cuts and a restrictive spending policy has paved the way for a sustainedreduction of the public sector burden on the capital markets and hence the creation of greater scope forprivate investment. In addition, the conditions for investment and production in Germany are beingimproved through the tax cuts.It is possible to detect a distinct shift in focus in German fiscal policy. The Tax Relief Act which cameinto force at the beginning of 1999 primarily aimed at providing relief to lower-income earners andhouseholds with children. The economy was to be boosted from the demand side. The price paid forthis was a higher burden on enterprises and thus a deterioration in supply and investment conditions.The government’s plan for a reform of business taxation now aims to give relief to enterprises andthus create conditions that are more favourable to growth via the supply side. This reorientation isbeing accompanied by a further two-stage reduction in income tax in 2003 and 2005 which also coversthe top rates. In 2005, the top rate of income tax would then be 45% compared with 51% at present.The CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag would like to put through a reduction in the toprate of tax to 35% by 2003.The government’s planned tax reform will result in a substantial tax relief for enterprises in net termsas well, especially as a result of the sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to a uniform level of 25%.At present, the corporate tax rates are 40% on retained profits and 30% on distributed profits. The taxcut will strengthen Germany’s attraction as an industrial location. The planned tax exemption ofcorporations’ profits from the sale of equity stakes will facilitate corporate restructuring. Germany islikely to become more attractive as a location for holding companies.In all, the tax plans are an important and welcome beginning which should be followed by furthersteps. From the point of view of the tax system and in terms of a consistent and equal taxation of alltypes of income, the plans do have some shortcomings. Above all, problems are raised by the markedpreferential tax treatment of profits retained in enterprises, which cannot be justified onmacroeconomic grounds. This preferential treatment might also result in allocation distortions.Ultimately, a substantial reduction of all rates and a comprehensive widening of the tax assessmentbasis would be needed.Whereas approaches to a solution are becoming evident in fiscal policy, this cannot be said for thesevere structural problem of the statutory system of old-age provision. Here, the ageing of thepopulation has led to an implicit public sector debt building up on a major scale. With the existingsystem of old-age provision this debt can only be repaid by further increases in employees’ andemployers’ contributions. Official projections assume that this would result in the contribution ratehaving to rise to 24% by 2030. In addition, there would also be growing burdens in health and nursingcare insurance. The associated obstacles to growth and higher costs would be a severe strain on thedevelopment of the economy. The reform measures proposed so far are not enough to prevent such aquestionable development. Above all, what is needed is a restriction of the pension growth rate. Thiswould create room for supplementary privately funded pensions. This would also benefit the capitalmarkets. And mentioning the capital markets I have now arrived at the last topic of my presentation.Undoubtedly, the “New Economy” is closely connected with developments in the financial markets.For example, the sharp growth in the supply of venture capital in the United States suggests that themomentum of the real economy is being underpinned by flexible, innovative forms of financing in thecapital market.The German financial system has been traditionally characterised by the dominant role of the banks.Such more “bank-based” structures should by no means be equated with backwardness, however. Onthe contrary, the credit institutions’ intermediation can in some cases even be superior to themarket-based financial system. Just to give a particularly important example: The corporate landscapein Germany has traditionally been characterised by small- and medium-sized enterprises.Long-standing, strong business relationships with specific banks are particularly suited to covering thefinancing requirements of such enterprises at reasonable costs even in periods of economic difficulty.
BIS Review 25/20006However, from the perspective of the New Economy, market-based financing is especially important.It is precisely young, innovative enterprises with uncertain earnings prospects that often have to relyon financing sources outside the banking system.In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the rapidly increasing importance of the stockmarket in Germany. In 1999 alone, domestic enterprises issued shares with a market value of(cid:1)(cid:2) billion. This is an increase of almost 50% compared with 1998 and three times the 1997 figure.Particularly noteworthy is the high share of initial public offerings in what is known as the “NewMarket”, the market for young and innovative enterprises. More than 200 companies are now listed inthis category which has thus become an engine for financing innovative enterprises in Germany.However, the New Market is only appropriate for firms which have already established themselves inthe markets. Hence, it is of particular importance that, along with the success of the New Market,venture capital business has simultaneously taken a rapid upswing. Venture capital invested rose byDM 5 billion in Germany in 1999. At the same time, the structure of venture capital investment hasradically changed. Whereas it was more traditional sectors that attracted venture capital in the past,such investment now focuses on telecommunications, biotechnology and computing.The growth of both the New Market and venture capital are interdependent. The New Market offersideal conditions for transforming venture capital into risk capital traded on the stock exchangefollowing the phase of venture financing. In the past, the lack of such an “exit” option was one of theobstacles to the development of a broader venture capital market in Germany. The rapid growth of thestock market would not have been possible without the general public becoming increasinglyinterested in share investments. Much use is being made of indirect stock market activity throughinvestment funds.Complementing the provision of risk capital via the stock market, there has been a sharp rise in theissue volume of corporate bonds. This instrument was also used in the past year to finance mergersand acquisitions - in other words, the restructuring of the corporate sector. However, this increase isalso due to growing investor demand for higher-risk paper, since the scope of diversification hasbecome much smaller through the elimination of exchange rate risks following the introduction of theeuro. The German corporate bond market is still less developed than in the United States. However,there are indications that the emergence of corporate bonds as a means of long-term financing hasbecome increasingly prominent in supplementing the use of bank loans. The momentum and strengthof such an underlying trend seem to be influenced to a large degree by technological advances, thepace of structural change in the corporate sector and economic policy reforms, such as in tax law orold-age pension provisions. Additional impetus is being provided by European monetary union.Ladies and gentlemen, let me finally return to my initial question: “Is there a New Economy inGermany?” This question cannot be answered with a sweeping yes or no. But it can probably be statedfirstly that there are movements in Germany which are simultaneously beneficial to growth and pricestability. I see traces of such a New Economy, above all, in areas of the economy which for a longtime were subject only to limited competition, but which are now being deregulated. More growth inthose areas may even be accompanied by falling prices. Second, the new technologies are availableglobally. They are also available as growth potential outside the United States. Third, the Germanfinancial system seems well equipped not only to accommodate the changes in the real sector but alsoto support them. In Germany, we need and have both market-oriented and bank-oriented financialservices. I cannot and do not want to comment on the development of share prices in the New Marketin Germany. But I do believe that traces of a New Economy can also be found in this market segment.On top of that, ever-increasing competition and technological progress are leading to a far-reachingrenewal in the financial sector.Fourth, the economic policy decisions taken since summer 1999 suggest that an upswing in theeconomy as a whole is supported by the fiscal framework. What is especially positive is thecommitment to a strict consolidation course which is being reinforced by concrete savings measures.And, in line with Professor Issing, I would finally like to emphasise that monetary union in Europeand the completion of the single market are promoting corporate restructuring, which is improving theefficiency of the economy.
7BIS Review 25/2000Let me conclude by saying that computers and the Internet alone will not create a New Economy inGermany by themselves. Only structural reforms will reduce the impediments to growth. Acombination of technological change and structural reforms would make possible not only a better usebut also a widening of the potential for growth in Germany.
1BIS Review 28/2000Mr Latter looks at the implications of e-commercefor the banking and monetary system in Hong KongSpeech by Mr Tony Latter, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at aconference on China and the New Millennium: WTO, Entrepreneurs and New Technology for GlobalTrade, held in Nansha, Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China on 24 March 2000.*      *      *The internet has quite suddenly multiplied by a remarkable degree the number of potential suppliersand customers with whom we can do business, and the number of avenues through which we canperform financial transactions. This opens up all sorts of opportunities, but it also attracts all sorts ofwarnings - about needing to know the identity of those with whom we are dealing; about needingsomehow to satisfy ourselves, remotely, as to the quality of the products or services on offer; aboutneeding to be sure of the financial standing of counterparties, be it their ability to pay or to providecredit which concerns us; and so on.Speaking as a central banker, I begin to have a specific interest in the development of e-commerce atthe point where payment has to be made for the goods or services that are traded via the internet, orwhere people deposit money into internet accounts. But I also have a broader interest relating to theoverall stablity and integrity of the financial system. The internet undoubtedly brings us the prospectof greater choice and efficiency in financial deals, but it also sparks certain concerns. These fall undertwo headings: consumer protection, with worries about scams, transparency, security, accountability,legal recourse, and so on; and systemic stability, with questions as to whether the financial systemmight become more vulnerable to crisis as a result, for example, of a major technical failure or of amassive herd movement of money in a particular direction.This is a vast subject, so I need to narrow down my focus today. I want to discuss some of the issueswhich businesses or individual members of the public may face in relation to electronic money on theinternet. And I then want to discuss some points which a central bank has to address in the monetarypolicy context when confronted with electronic money.In fact there are two types of electronic money: that which is held on the internet and that which isheld in stored-value cards. Multi-purpose stored-value card schemes have been slow to becomeestablished, despite quite lengthy pilot projects in a number of countries. Hong Kong was neverthelessone of the first places to introduce regulations governing the issuance of such cards. Meanwhile,limited-purpose cards have proved more successful; we have a particular example in Hong Kong withthe Octopus card, used to pay for public transport, which is hugely popular. Today, however, I want todevote the limited time available to talking about electronic money within the internet itself, so I shallnot be discussing card-based money any further.Many people speak of the arrival of the internet era as a revolution in business practice. From theparticular viewpoint of making payments, I prefer to regard it as a step along an evolutionary pathrather than as something revolutionary. Our distant forefathers were sceptical about the introduction ofbanknotes in place of metallic tokens and coins; and our more recent forefathers were worried as to thereliability of cheques as a substitute for cash when they first appeared. Even during the span of myown working life I can recall initial resistance by some to credit cards and debit cards on suspicionsabout the security of the arrangements, as well as opposition to autopay and direct debit schemes forfear of granting to a third party too general an authority to debit one’s bank account.But each of these innovations has, in the event, been assimilated and has taken its place in the range ofaccepted payment instruments. I would expect e-banking to follow suit, as just another step along theevolutionary path. But it is perhaps worth pausing to consider whether there is anything intrinsicallydifferent about e-banking which demands special attention from the central bank.
BIS Review 28/20002Let me begin by examining the question from the central bank’s stance as guardian of the integrity ofthe payments system and as banking supervisor. I believe there are perhaps two characteristics ofe-banking which may deserve some vigilance here.The first is the technical security of access and messaging. This is a matter of accuracy, safety andsecrecy. If we use the internet to move our money, or to hold our money, we expect messages to arriveat their destination without error or interception; we expect the system to be safe from fraudulent orunauthorised access; and we expect to enjoy the same degree of customer confidentiality as withconventional banking arrangements. We want to be assured not only that the execution process isreliable and secure, but also that there are adequate controls on any “read only” access facilities.How can we obtain these assurances? Perhaps some of you mirror my own feeling of personalinadequacy in matters of electronic technology. Inevitably we are dependent on the experts. They havedevised sophisticated methods of electronic signatures, encryption, certification, firewalls and the like.One way or another, by obtaining appropriate professional advice, by applying rigorous standards ofcompliance and computer audit, and so on, those within an organisation should be able to deliver thenecessary assurances to customers, and the regulatory or supervisory authorities will need to satisfythemselves as to the dependability of such assurances. The financial authorities within countries, andon a collective basis internationally, may also have a role to play in developing recognised commonstandards in these arenas of technology and security.The second characteristic deserving our special attention is the nature of the person or company whichis offering us banking or payment services over the internet. If we are merely using electronic servicesprovided by our usual bank, which we know to be sound and to be supervised by an acknowledgedregulator in a known jurisdiction, then we should be in no more danger of losing our money than wewould be by banking with the same bank in the conventional manner, provided of course that both thebank and the regulator have kept pace with the requirements of internet banking, such as in respect ofthe security aspects discussed already.But it is quite a different story if we are tempted to part with money to some organisationmasquerading as a bank, or which actually is a bank but is registered in a jurisdiction with lowersupervisory standards than those to which we are accustomed. In Hong Kong, in order to protect thepublic we already have legislation governing usage of the word “bank”, and governing the advertisingfor deposits within our boundaries by anyone not authorised to take deposits in Hong Kong. But wecannot protect people from the possible consequences of clicking onto a website in a far-off placewhich is luring them to part with their money. The message is clear: make sure that you know andtrust your banker.In Hong Kong there has been some talk of new banks being established for the sole purpose ofconducting internet banking. In deciding whether to authorise such a bank, the Monetary Authoritywould expect to apply very much the same criteria as for a conventional bank, but would need to payparticular attention to the business plan in order to ensure that it reflected realistic assumptions andprudent banking principles. We intend in the near future to issue guidelines for any such applications.Already, as the supervisory body for existing banks, the Monetary Authority needs to take account ofany particular risks that pertain to internet banking and to be sure that banks who conduct suchbusiness do themselves properly appreciate and allow for such risks. I would mention in particular thestrategic risk, in that venturing into a new business arena may not always be assured of success; theoperational risk, of dependence on IT networks, and the associated security considerations to which Ihave already referred; and any additional banking risks which may arise if internet transactions aredeemed to be potentially more volatile or unpredictable, or customers less reliable, than in normalbanking business.The need to be confident about the intermediaries with which you are dealing is also very relevantwhen we examine schemes for so-called digital cash or a cyberpurse. There have been some falsestarts and business failures in this field, but some potentially more durable systems are now emergingin a number of countries, albeit still mostly in only embryonic form. The concept is of a storagelocation - or account - somewhere in cyberspace, into which you transfer funds from your bankaccount or credit card, just as you would draw cash from the bank and store it in your wallet. The
3BIS Review 28/2000schemes are designed essentially for the retail shopper, who can then make payments from the pursefor items purchased over the internet: the purse operator responds to your instructions by transferringfunds from your purse to an account of the seller.You may wonder what the advantage of such schemes is supposed to be. Why not simply pay for eachtransaction by an electronic instruction to your bank or, more typically in the case of most retailinternet purchases, by credit card? The answer is that digital cash purports to offer three advantages.First, it may be cheaper than other means for a series of relatively low value retail transactions.Second, it can be used by those who cannot or do not have a credit card - for instance teenagers. Third,it offers a degree of anonymity and perhaps a stronger feeling of security, in comparison to using abank account or credit card, since account-related personal data need not be passed on to the individualsellers of the goods or services.However, people should exercise some caution before utilising such cyberpurse facilities. Regardlessof how the system may be presented, the purse operator is in effect acting very much as a bank, inparticular by holding your money in a sort of deposit. Even if you initially acquired the digital cash orcredit for free (through a loyalty or bonus point scheme, for example), the accumulated “savings”represent value which you would doubtless wish to protect. Customers will want to be assured that themoney or credit points are in safe hands. Regulators, too, may desire to verify that no banking activityis taking place that is unlawful, although they will first need to ascertain the location of this virtualoperation (a task which is itself almost a contradiction in terms) so as to identify what is the applicablejurisdiction. Although in most of these schemes the maximum sum which anyone may hold in a pursemay, for the moment, be quite modest, and so the scale of potential losses limited, we need to establishthe foundations of prudent behaviour and regulation in preparation for the time when the sums may bemuch larger.Thus far I have been looking at the phenomenon of e-banking and e-payments largely from theregulatory point of view. I would like to turn now to examine whether there are any noteworthyimplications for the key central bank responsibility of monetary policy.I want first to consider possible implications for the physical currency. Central banks or theirgovernment shareholders enjoy a steady stream of profit from the issue of currency in the form ofnotes and coin - the so-called seignorage. It is noteworthy that the public’s demand for currency hasbeen much less affected over the years than one might have expected by the emergence of successivenew forms of non-cash payment such as cheques and cards. And personally I would doubt whether thedevelopment of cyberpurses, cybercash and cyberpayments would have much impact on cash incirculation, at any rate in the near term. But suppose I am wrong. Suppose there is a completerevolution such that cybercash, including electronic stored-value cards, substantially displacesphysical currency within a few years. How should central banks react?In such circumstances, central banks would lose an important source of income and would have to findways of replacing it. Perhaps some central banks would lose their financial independence and becomedependent - or more so than hitherto - on subvention from the government budget. But in a broadersense they should welcome the development because it would be evidence that the economy as awhole was enjoying a more efficient and less expensive means of money holding and transmission.With regard to operational aspects of monetary policy in pursuit of the general macroeconomicobjective of stability in the value of the currency, the advent of this new means of payment would, if itcaught on to a significant extent, have some impact on the public’s allocation of money holdings asbetween physical currency, various forms of deposit and, now, electronic forms. This in turn mightaffect the monetary statistics and their interpretation. However, any changes would only occurgradually. Besides, nowadays there are scarcely any central banks which rely single-mindedly andexclusively upon measures of money supply to guide their monetary policy decisions. Therefore I donot believe that there is anything much to worry about on this front.Next, it has been suggested that internet banking in its various manifestations could introduceadditional and unpredictable volatility into world financial markets by enabling millions of people toswitch funds between investments or between currencies at the click of a mouse. In general I amsceptical about such worries. Global financial markets have already been exploiting the IT age with its
BIS Review 28/20004immediacy of information and electronic dealing for some years. Capital is already hugely mobile inboth scale and speed. I doubt whether the inclusion of new players at the retail level would have muchof an additional impact.In particular cases where monetary policy is supported by capital controls, however, internet bankingmay make enforcement of such controls more difficult, since it would be operationally easier for thosewishing to evade regulations to maintain offshore bank accounts. Of course, every bank in reputablejurisdictions has in place rigorous procedures to combat money-laundering, but these procedures donot normally result in customers being turned away if they are merely trying to escape capital controlsor the tax regime in their home countries.Similar considerations lead some observers to enquire whether the internet might encouragesubstitution out of the national currency, resulting in dollarisation and also perhaps weakening thecentral bank’s influence over domestic monetary conditions. If internet facilities enable or encouragepeople either to economise on the usage of money (for example by netting payments due among twoor more parties or by practising barter) or to reduce the frequency of movements of money (forexample by leaving export receipts in an internet account in order to pay for imports, rather thanrepatriating them first), then there may be a prospect of a general reduction in transactions traffic in allcurrencies. The usage of some may fall more than others. I do not, however, see anything particularlysinister in such developments, except to the extent that the internet might facilitate avoidance of ruleson remittances. The survival of the national currency and its acceptability to the public will continue todepend on the central bank carrying out a responsible monetary policy which protects the value of thecurrency. Discharge of this duty should not be materially affected or impeded by technologicaldevelopments in payment methods. The central bank’s ability to influence interest rates or theexchange rate through its market operations will not be diminished.I conclude that, all in all, there are few concerns for the central bank in its monetary policy role thatarise from the development of e-commerce; where there is an impact it is likely to be gradual andcentral banks should be able to adapt to it as readily as they have to other structural changes in thefinancial sector over the years. For the reasons discussed earlier, however, the challenge to the bankingregulatory side of the central bank is likely to be rather greater.
1BIS Review 28/2000Mr Bäckström: The current situation for monetary policy in SwedenSpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, before the Standing Committee onFinance, Stockholm, on 23 March 2000.*      *      *In my opening remarks to your Committee six months ago I noted that the Swedish economy wasdeveloping impressively. Growth was stronger than many had counted on and inflationary pressurewas moderate. New jobs were being created and unemployment was falling.Since then the economy has definitely continued to impress. Forecasters have had occasion to revisetheir assessments of activity successively upwards.GDP growth in 1999 amounted to 3.8% and the number of new jobs totalled almost 90,000 - thehighest figure in thirty years. This has been accompanied by surpluses on the current account andgovernment finances. Moreover, the upward revisions refer mainly to growth and employment.Forecast inflation has not been adjusted upwards to the same extent, which is a testimony to the goodcircle at present in the Swedish economy.Inflation in the past three yearsMeasured in terms of the consumer price index (CPI), inflation has in fact been exceptionally low forthree years; the average annual level has been 0.5%. This level for the period as a whole is made up ofCPI increases of 0.9% for 1997, 0.4% for 1998 and 0.3% for 1999.This means that the rising demand pressure in the Swedish economy in recent years has not shown upin higher CPI inflation. Contrary effects have come from other factors. To clarify this, we can take alook at inflation’s constituents.Diagram1. Inflation during 1997 until 19991. Inflation 1997-1999CPI and different measures of underlying inflation01234199719981999KPIUND1XUNDINHXUND1X = CPI excluding interest expenditure and indirect taxes and subsidiesUNDINHX = UNDIX excluding goods that are mainly importedSource: Statistics Sweden
BIS Review 28/20002From Diagram 1 it will be seen that in the past three years, underlying domestic inflation(UNDINHX)1 has been almost continuously in the vicinity of the 2% inflation target.The pressure from domestic demand has been countered, however, by a weak international price trend.This is evident from the path of UND1X inflation, which also includes imported prices. The mainexplanation for the weak development of import prices in this period is the crisis that began in Asia inthe autumn of 1997. It can be mentioned that towards the end of 1998, just the prices of coffee, petroland domestic heating oil lowered the price level in Sweden by almost half a percentage point.Because of the long lag before monetary policy changes elicit effects, parrying this impact fromimport prices would have required the Riksbank to identify the Asian crisis’ damping consequencesfor commodity prices long before they actually occurred.But the weak development of import prices is not the only explanation. Inflation in this period waslowered still further by changes in interest expenditure as well as in indirect taxes and subsidies.On several occasions I have shown the Committee how monetary policy exerts direct effects on CPIinflation through house mortgage interest expenditure. Reducing the interest rate, in order to stimulatedemand and thereby hold inflation around the target, has the initial effect of lowering the CPI becausehouse mortgage interest expenditure decreases. This effect continues until after households haverenewed the loans at the new, lower interest rate. The greater part of the difference between the CPIand UND1X in Diagram 1 is due to this interest rate effect.The Riksbank has considered the possibility of using some other index for targeting monetary policybut we concluded that there are grounds for continuing with the CPI as the overriding policy target.Among other things, the index is well known and relatively comprehensive.In the light of the problems I mentioned and the ensuing discussion, the Riksbank has chosen topresent a clearer description of how the CPI target is to be interpreted. Deviations should bepermissible if the CPI change figure is influenced by transitory factors (for example, changes inindirect taxes and subsidies or household interest expenditure) or if bringing inflation promptly back tothe targeted level would be costly for the real economy. The magnitude of these factors is to be statedin advance by the Riksbank. In this way, the members of your Committee, as well as other observers,will be in a better position to assess the Riksbank and the policy we implement. For each decision it isclear which transitory factors the Riksbank has chosen to disregard in the formation of policy.These clarifications are essentially a codification of the approach that the Riksbank has applied to theformation of monetary policy in recent years, although any deviations from the target were thendiscussed less precisely. In the period from 1997 to 1999 the path of inflation was affected to a largeextent by transitory price movements that the Riksbank considers should be of secondary importancefor monetary policy. Policy has therefore focused on the underlying or core rate of inflation asmeasured by UND1X; this averaged 1.2%, with constituent annual rates in these three years of 1.4,0.9 and 1.4%.The Report that has been submitted to the Committee today contains an appendix that is intended toserve as a foundation for the Committee’s evaluation of the implementation of monetary policy and itsoutcome in the period 1997-99. This is something that the Committee requested earlier.Let me now consider the implementation of monetary policy in the course of 1999.1As an indicator of inflation, UNDINHX has merits as well as drawbacks, as I have pointed out on many occasions.Besides excluding imported goods, the index has a tendency to eliminate prices for domestic goods and thereby disregardinflation effects from important structural factors. But it does serve to illustrate the extent to which domestic demandpressure contributes to inflation’s path.
3BIS Review 28/2000Monetary policy in the past yearThe early months of 1999 were marked by continued effects of the Asian crisis on the world economy,with weaker international demand. In order to prevent this from leading to a weaker economic trend inSweden and thereby a lower path for inflation, the Riksbank reduced the repo rate twice, in Februaryand March, bringing it down to 2.90%.The situation stabilised during the late spring and summer. The relatively relaxed monetary policy thathad been implemented for a number of years - both in Sweden and in many other parts of the worldeconomy - played an important part in the improvement that occurred during 1999 and contributed tomore positive economic forecasts.It was then important for the Riksbank to take timely action so as not to have to implement a morepronounced monetary tightening and economic retardation to cope with rising inflationary pressure ata later stage. A process was therefore initiated in November that amounts to successively taking ourfoot off the monetary “accelerator”. As the after-effects of the Asian crisis and the financial marketturbulence in the autumn of 1998 subsided, a strong economic stimulus from monetary policy was nolonger required. In November 1999 and February this year the repo rate was therefore increased by atotal of 0.85 percentage points.The analytical and monetary policy challenges that confronted the Riksbank during 1999 were notminor. The strong growth of demand in recent years has been accompanied by paths for underlyingand trend inflation that have been weaker than earlier relationships seemed to suggest. A number ofreasons have been put forward as to why these relationships may have changed.One reason may be that when inflation has been brought down to a low level, price and wage settingbehaviour is different. Households as well as firms in Sweden count on inflation remaining low.Another reason may be increased competition, for instance due to deregulations, globalisation and ITcommerce.A third reason may be that our assessments of resource utilisation are faulty and the actual level islower than we have assumed to date. Economic growth can then be higher for a time, withoutgenerating increased price pressure.A fourth reason may be a higher productivity trend and an ability to produce more goods and serviceswithout generating increased prices; in other words, a higher potential growth rate. This could lead tohigher growth being feasible for longer without inflation taking off.There are arguments in favour of each of these explanations but the empirical support is not clear-cut.The issue of potential growth and higher productivity has recently attracted particular attention in thelight of economic developments in the United States, for example. Productivity growth in Sweden hasimproved but we do not yet have any notable evidence that potential growth has risen as it has in theAmerican economy.An expected increase in trend productivity can also affect components of demand. The prospect ofhigher corporate profits leads to higher share prices for listed companies. Besides promptingcompanies to step up investment and improving the supply of venture capital, the appreciation ofshareholdings may make households feel more wealthy and stimulate consumer demand. The strongupward stock market trend in Stockholm in recent years may be a sign that players have incorporatedexpectations that economic growth in Sweden will be appreciably higher than earlier.The relative paths of supply and demand in the Swedish economy and the development of the inflationpropensity are obviously central issues in the assessment of inflation. If supply and demand develop atthe same rate, no inflationary pressure will build up. This is what seems to have happened for a time inthe United States. But there is, of course, a risk of one of them predominating and that would alter theconclusions for monetary policy.The questions about trend productivity and other matters that may have altered the relationshipbetween growth and inflation are one of several elements of uncertainty in the Riksbank’s forecasting
BIS Review 28/20004work. When constructing assessments and material for decisions it is therefore important to checkwhat is happening and be alert to any signs of changes that should be taken into account.The current assessmentThe Inflation Report we are publishing today presents a picture of the Swedish economy that remainsbright, with good growth and moderate, though rising inflation.External economic prospects have gone on improving. It is above all GDP growth in the US economythat continues to be remarkably positive but it also looks as though growth in the euro area and theUnited Kingdom could be higher than assumed earlier. International consumer prices, however, arenot expected to move up to the same extent. Less relaxed monetary policies among a number ofcentral banks and growing pressure from international competition are judged to hold external pricesback. But partly because the krona is not expected to appreciate quite as rapidly as we counted onearlier, import prices to producers are now assumed to be somewhat higher. On account of strongcompetition, however, we do not foresee a full pass-through to consumer prices.Domestic demand is also expected to be stronger than we foresaw in the December Report,notwithstanding the subsequent repo rate increase of 0.5 percentage points. Rising asset prices andincreased household wealth are also contributing to the growth of private consumption. Moreover, thestrong economic activity and good stock market trend should contribute to a favourable developmentof investment.Diagram 2. GDP growth between 1994 and 2002The Riksbank foresees GDP growth rates of 4.0% this year, 3.5% in 2001 and 2.6% in 2002. These arehigh rates compared with the 1970s and 1980s. By itself, the upward revision of GDP growth impliesthat unutilised resources in the economy are brought into production more quickly.The strong economic activity points to a higher rate of wage increases in the coming years. At thesame time, it is possible that changes in the labour market will hold wage increases down. A growingproportion of wage increases is being allocated locally, for example. Moreover, inflation expectationsamong labour market organisations are still in line with the target. This means that, as we have seen inrecent years, a real wage increase can be secured without such a large increase in nominal wages.2.

5BIS Review 28/2000Historically high real wage increases in recent years should likewise contribute to a moderatedevelopment of wages.Against this background, we judge that the level of nominal wages can move up at an annual rate ofjust over 4%. This is marginally less than foreseen in the December Report. In the longer run,however, wages cannot go on rising at this rate because they would then exceed the room that nowlooks like being provided by the probable trend for productivity growth. One illustration of this is thatin the coming one to two years, underlying domestic inflation will be somewhat above 2%, though thisis countered by downward effects from import prices.In our main scenario we judge that overall inflation prospects are in line with the target one to twoyears ahead but that UND1X inflation will be marginally above the target at the end of the period.With an unchanged repo rate, UND1X inflation is expected to be 1.6% one year ahead and 2.1% aftertwo years.Diagram 3. UND1X forecast with uncertainty intervalsThe transitory factors that the Riksbank should disregard in the formation of monetary policy arejudged to be small in the coming one to two years.Moreover, the Riksbank considers that the risk spectrum for inflation is balanced. In other words, therisks of inflation being higher and lower, respectively, than in the main scenario are equal.On the one hand, inflation could be lower than in our main scenario if there is a marked correction toAmerican stock markets or if deregulations and trade liberalisation have greater effects than we haveallowed for. On the other hand, inflation could be higher if oil prices do not fall at the rate we assumeor if the growth of demand, instead of slackening at the end of the forecast period as we foresee,remains strong.The strong economic activity and gradually growing inflationary pressure point to a future need for afurther repo rate increase. The timing and size of the increase are considered in the light of, forexample, new information and its significance for the Riksbank’s overall inflation assessment. Ourcurrent assessment is that in the greater part of the coming one to two years, inflation is expected to bebelow 2%. This speaks in favour of leaving the repo rate unchanged for now.3.

1BIS Review 27/2000Mr McDonough discusses sound bankingsystems: a new growth imperativeSpeech by Mr William J McDonough, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, beforeThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, Singapore, on 24 March 2000.*      *      *I am delighted to be with you today. It’s a special pleasure to be among so many old friends andcolleagues.It’s also a great pleasure to be in Singapore under such happy and promising circumstances. Just twoyears ago, financial and economic conditions throughout Asia were rather grim and the outlook wasuncertain. But since then, to the great credit of the people of Asia, significant progress has beenachieved. In Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and especially Korea, meaningful headway has been madetoward recapitalizing the banking systems, ridding banks’ balance sheets of problem assets, andimproving supervisory and regulatory frameworks.And that hard-earned progress on the banking front is already bearing fruit. The economic contractionthat devastated so many in the region has generally been halted and even, in some countries,impressively reversed. Equity markets have rebounded impressively, and yields on governmentsecurities have been cut by nearly two-thirds as foreign capital has begun to return. Without question,this is truly a remarkable turnaround.It must also be acknowledged that the economies of Asia are not out of the woods just yet. Importantand even difficult work still lies ahead. At this critical juncture in the Asian recovery process, I think itis worth reviewing just how important a stable banking and financial system is to the health andvitality of any market economy - and particularly emerging market economies - and the crucial rolethat supervision plays in achieving and preserving financial stability. Indeed, effective supervisionrepresents a crucial cornerstone of financial stability, both locally and globally. It is also clear that,given the accelerating pace of change and innovation in the financial services industry, our notion ofsupervision must encompass discipline applied by the marketplace, as well as official supervision.With these thoughts in mind, and noting the critical role banks play in a market economy, in myremarks today I will discuss the nature and form of an effective supervisory framework for the21st century, addressing the role to be played by banks themselves, the broader marketplace andofficial supervisors. On the subject of official supervision, I will address the Basel Committee’s CorePrinciples for Effective Supervision, and then conclude with a discussion of the Committee’s majorinitiative to revise and refine the 1988 Capital Accord.Banks’ role in a market economyLet me first discuss the crucial role banks play in a market economy. While specific arrangements mayvary from country to country reflecting differences in history, custom and culture, the basic principlesare common to nearly all market economies.Bringing savers and borrowers togetherAs we all know, starting a business, expanding an existing business, or embarking on any other kind ofcreative or entrepreneurial enterprise, requires money - investment capital. Therefore, any society’slong-term economic prospects are best served when households and businesses freely decide to savepart of their current income.But the decision to save is not, in itself, sufficient to ensure economic growth and prosperity. Someinstitutional mechanism must exist through which society’s savings can be collected and channeled
BIS Review 27/20002into productive investments. Moreover, because savers will naturally perceive risk in parting with theirmoney, they must be induced to entrust their savings to that institution that can then put their capital towork in sound and productive ways.For this to happen, a class of financial institutions must exist that the public views as a safe andconvenient outlet for its savings, where at least some fraction of those savings are maintained in theform of highly liquid assets, and assets by which payments for goods and services can be madequickly, easily and safely.The single dominant class of institution that has emerged to play this crucial role of intermediatingbetween savers and borrowers is the commercial bank. In virtually all countries, banks function as therepository of a large fraction of society’s liquid savings and the entities through which payments aremade. Even in mature industrial societies with highly developed capital markets, the commercialbanking system continues to be the most important single element of the financial system.Transaction accounts - the means of intermediationThe prominent position of banks in the financial systems of market economies around the world stemsfrom their unique role as the issuers of transaction accounts. Transaction accounts are bank liabilitiesthat are immediately payable on demand at face value - “at par” - and that are readily transferable tothird parties. Because a depositor may transfer or convert into currency the balance of a transactionaccount on demand, such accounts are often referred to as “demand deposits”. Owners of transactionaccounts can withdraw deposited funds, write checks up to the full amount in the account, or transfer aportion or the full amount of the account to a third party. The liquidity, acceptability andtransferability of these accounts induce savers to entrust their savings to banks, and facilitate the broadrange of transactions that sustain economic activity.The unique capacity to incur liabilities that are payable on demand at par distinguishes banks from allother kinds of institutions, and is the determining characteristic that enables banks to perform theiressential functions in a market-based economy. Banks are also the only type of institution that cancreate transaction accounts by way of the lending function, and thereby expand the money supply byway of the money multiplier. The flexibility of credit and liquidity that banks provide - stemming fromthis unique capacity to create transaction account liabilities - is vital to the smooth development andgrowth of market-based economies.Other essential functionsThis money-creating capacity also enables banks to perform other essential functions. For example,banks serve as the primary and back-up source of liquidity for other classes of institutions, financialand non-financial. Even in advanced financial systems, the capital markets rely heavily on the bankingsystem to meet day-to-day cash flow needs and to provide standby financing facilities. In addition, thebanking system is the mechanism, or transmission belt, by which the policies of the central bankregarding money and credit creation are implemented, and the pace of economic activity determined.Simply stated, without an effectively functioning banking system for encouraging, collecting anddeploying society’s savings, providing the means for quick and reliable payment, and performingthese other essential functions I’ve just mentioned, there would be little hope for any economy tomobilize the real resources necessary for economic growth and stability. If money and credit are thelifeblood of a market economy - and they are - the banking system is its beating heart.Public confidence - the key to intermediationBut banks’ ability to collect and mobilize society’s savings by attracting deposits is only half of thestory. Their ability to retain those deposits is just as critical. This may seem an obvious point, but theretention side of the banking equation is too often forgotten or overlooked.The willingness of savers to entrust their money to a bank presupposes that those savers haveconfidence in the financial integrity of the institution - in other words, that their savings will be
3BIS Review 27/2000available when they need or want access to them. If that confidence is undermined, society’s ability tocollect and deploy its savings will be impaired, and the principal means to economic growth and risingliving standards - intermediation by banks - will be short-circuited. With this reality in mind, it mustbe acknowledged that, in the final analysis, commercial banks have only one asset that really matters -public confidence.Sound lending - the key to preserving public confidenceThe key to maintaining the financial integrity of any banking company - and, therefore, to preservingthe all-important asset of public confidence - is the credit process. If credit is extended carelessly,banks are likely to incur losses, which in turn will undermine their ability to honor deposit obligations.And if banks’ ability to honor deposit obligations falls into question, if the public’s confidence isundermined, households and businesses will likely rush to redeploy their savings, raising the specter ofa flight to cash and real assets with all the associated implications for inflation and destabilizing runson banks. The best defense against this serious and very real threat is for banks to extend credit wisely,objectively and impartially.In this connection, it should be emphasized that, because of the inherently partisan nature of politics,and for other reasons as well, the government or state is not well-equipped to make credit decisions.Recent experience here in Asia, and before that in the former command economies of Eastern Europe,makes clear just how dangerous “policy lending” can be. Decisions as to who gets credit and who doesnot must be left to private initiative within a context where those making the decisions have a majorstake - their own capital and economic livelihood. If the system is working properly, those receivingcredit will be the most efficient, competitive, and profitable - those most capable of producing thestream of goods and services that will enable the economy to grow and, as a result, for living standardsto rise.The purpose of supervision - preserving financial stabilityThis, then, is the fundamental tension of commercial banking - how to meet the credit needs of ahealthy and expanding market economy, which necessarily entails the taking of calculated risks, andyet preserve the confidence of depositors whose savings are the raw material that enable banks toperform their essential functions. Negotiating that tension, helping banks meet that challenge, is thecritical task of supervision.And so what is the purpose of supervision in the 21st century? What are the objectives? How can thoseobjectives be best pursued? Let me say first of all that there is no quick-fix or single answer. The21st century financial marketplace is too dynamic, too complex, and supervisors must work within thepolitical realities of our respective nations. Instead, what I envision is a flexible, multi-faceted strategythat emphasizes prudence and prevention, compatibility with the market, and that fosters a close andcooperative partnership between the private and public sector.With these priorities in mind, I believe there are three essential elements of a modern supervisionframework:• effective bank-level management;• market discipline; and• official supervision.Let me discuss each of these in turn, noting that each should reinforce the others to effectivelypromote a safe and sound financial system.Effective bank-level managementPrimary responsibility for the safe and sound operation of a banking institution lies with its board ofdirectors and senior management. The purpose of the board of directors is to oversee the development
BIS Review 27/20004of the overall strategy of the organization and the decisions made by senior management in pursuit ofthose strategic objectives. The role of senior management, in turn, is to oversee day-to-day decisionsmade within the organization and to ensure their consistency with long-term objectives and policies asdetermined by the board.There are several aspects to effective bank-level management. First, I would underscore theimportance of good corporate governance, the basic elements of which include:• independent and competent outside directors;• capable and experienced management;• a coherent corporate strategy and business plan; and• clear lines of responsibility and accountability.Together, these elements contribute to an overall operating process conducive to long-term health andprosperity. A tightly run ship with a disciplined crew led by an experienced and competent cadre ofofficers is far better able to survive a long journey that will inevitably confront sudden storms.Closely related to good corporate governance and critical to any banking institution’s well-being is arigorous internal control apparatus. Of course, effective internal control systems have always beencentrally important to sound banking. This point becomes clear if we consider for a moment theirbasic purposes:• to provide reasonable assurance that the bank’s and its customers’ assets are safeguarded,that its information is timely and reliable, and that errors and irregularities are discoveredand corrected promptly;• to promote the bank’s operational efficiency; and• to ensure compliance with managerial policies, laws, regulations and sound fiduciaryprinciples.With these purposes in mind, it is clear that the success of any banking organization depends on theeffectiveness of its internal control apparatus. And never has this been more true than today. As theactivities of commercial banks have become increasingly diverse and complex, internal controls havebecome critically important to the sound and successful execution of banks’ strategic objectives.I want to stress this point as strongly as I can. As a former commercial banker myself, I know there isa powerful temptation for management to focus its attention and resources on the front office - thoseareas and individuals that generate profits for the institution. But if something goes wrong in the backoffice, it can quickly become the most important aspect of a bank’s operations. It is essential thatsufficient resources, staff and managerial attention are devoted to the back office and internal auditfunctions.Firmly rooted on the foundation of good corporate governance and rigorous internal controls is thecentral importance of effective risk management. As I mentioned earlier, banking by its very nature isa business of taking calculated risks. If they didn’t take risks, banks could not perform their essentialfunctions in a market economy. But sound banking also entails the prudent management of thoseunavoidable risks. Each banking institution must have in place the technical systems and managementprocesses necessary to identify the risks associated with its activities - lending and otherwise - and toeffectively measure, monitor and control those risks.But even if an institution has an effective risk management and control structure in place, that structuremust also be accompanied by the institutional management culture required to ensure that writtenpolicies and procedures are actually translated into practice, with buy-in at all staff levels. Andultimately, an institution’s culture is determined - once again - by the board of directors and the seniormanagement it chooses to install. Management must take active steps to ensure that their commitmentto an operating environment that includes effective risk management and rigorous controls filtersdown the line of the organization.
5BIS Review 27/2000To summarize, these aspects of effective bank level management - good corporate governance,rigorous internal controls and effective risk management - constitute a kind of internal safety net andrepresent the first and most important line of defense against potential problems. And this willincreasingly be the case as the activities of banks and other financial institutions become morecomplex and more global.Market disciplineAfter effective management at the bank level, the second line of defense against financial instability ismarket discipline. As financial institutions and their activities become more complex, diversified andglobal, market discipline becomes an even more important ally of the official supervisor.Of course, effective market discipline is not possible without meaningful public disclosure. Whilesignificant progress has been made in recent years, it unfortunately remains the case that disclosurepractices have not kept pace with the rapid changes in banks’ business activities and risk exposures,and with how these exposures are measured and managed. For this situation to be fully remedied,notions of what is proprietary information and what should be in the public domain need to change.Knowing a company’s appetite for risk and its approach to, and methodologies for, managing risk isessential to understanding the risks of being a shareholder, a creditor or a counterparty. I stronglyencourage all financial market participants to approach the issue of disclosure as users of financialstatements rather than as issuers. What we all need to know about each other to be comfortable andsecure in making our credit decisions should drive the debate, rather than concerns about proprietaryinformation.There is little question about the urgency of achieving dramatic progress in this area. Clearly, a fullappreciation of risk cannot be achieved without sufficient information. All of us know that there is nogreater enemy to a stable financial marketplace than a loss of confidence - and nothing underminesconfidence more than a lack of reliable information. Discipline imposed by markets might not alwaysbe pleasant, but more, higher quality information - in a word, transparency - bolsters the confidence ofdepositors and other creditors and therefore makes doing business easier and more secure.Here in Asia, as in other markets, more work needs to be done to improve the quality of disclosuresregarding traditional banking activities. Time and again experience has shown that in periods of stress,insufficient or inaccurate information about asset quality can lead to rumors and overreactions in themarketplace, creating the potential for problems to spread to institutions that may otherwise be in goodhealth.Of course, progress on the disclosure front will be limited until accounting standards are enhanced toensure proper valuation and to reflect innovations over the past decade, both in terms of new productsand modern risk management techniques. Accounting systems serve a variety of purposes, but nonemore important than helping creditors make rigorous decisions as to which enterprises meet markettests of efficiency, competitiveness, and profitability that are necessary for those enterprises to fulfilltheir obligations. Sound accounting systems also enable investors to determine the value ofenterprises, and, in so doing, assist in attracting capital, both foreign and domestic. With theseimportant purposes in mind, ongoing efforts to enhance accounting standards worldwide shouldcontinue and even intensify.There is also a need for greater harmonization of accounting standards across countries. We simplymust get to a point where supervisors and market participants alike can analyze and compare allinternationally active financial institutions on a consistent basis. And it will not be possible to haveuniform capital standards until we have achieved some consistency in accounting standards acrosscountries. I’ll have more to say about market discipline and its role in the evolving framework ofregulatory capital in a few moments.Role of supervisorsWhile effective bank level management and meaningful market discipline are crucial elements of anoverall strategy for promoting and preserving financial stability, neither can substitute for the critical
BIS Review 27/20006role played by official supervision. While banks perform functions that are indispensable to thesuccess of any market economy, these same functions, by their very nature, introduce risks that arecapable of undermining the prospects for such success. This reality was acknowledged by AdamSmith over two centuries ago in his seminal tract The Wealth of Nations. And it is with thisfundamental reality in mind that governments have long recognized that banking and other financialinstitutions must be subject to at least some form of regulation and official oversight.The reasons for official supervisory intervention in the banking system, and in the financial systemmore generally, can be summed up as promoting financial stability and minimizing systemic risk. Thisis a broad mandate - one that encompasses the responsibility to ensure that markets operate in a fair,transparent and efficient manner, and that participants comply with the rules of the game.Indeed, supervisors bring a number of comparative advantages to the table that enable them to playthis critical role in the broader supervisory framework. First, supervisors have clear incentives tomonitor risks to the financial system as a whole. While each financial institution is best positioned tomonitor its own risk exposure, it does not have the incentives to internalize the costs it may impose onother financial institutions should it experience difficulties.Second, supervisors are able to obtain and monitor proprietary information about an institution’s riskexposures, its management information systems and its internal controls when such information is notpublicly disclosed.Third, supervisors are in a unique position to observe trends across groups of financial institutions and,based on these insights, to provide the industry with a perspective on what constitutes best practice.Fourth, official supervision is needed to enforce compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Wehave observed that poor compliance, beyond simply being wrong, can result in serious operationalproblems, including capital allocation deficiencies, managerial oversights and increased reputationalrisk. As we have seen, such problems can threaten the wellbeing of a financial institution and carry thepotential for systemic risk.Finally, supervisors are able to assure that prompt corrective actions are taken when serious financialor other problems are identified, particularly if the problems are not known to the market. Theimportance of the role supervisors can play in problem cases, both through public enforcement andthrough other less visible means, cannot be overstated.Changes in the financial services industry present new challenges for how official supervision is to becarried out most effectively. It is clear that the fundamental approach, scope and methodologies ofofficial supervision must evolve in line with the way financial institutions manage their activities,which increasingly is along business lines rather than legal entities.With this in mind, we as supervisors should continue our efforts to develop a more dynamic,risk-focused and process-oriented framework, reflecting the reality that banks and other financialinstitutions are increasingly able to alter their risk profiles at will. By “risk-focused”, I mean thatsupervisory resources should be directed at the most material risks to which the institution and itscapital are exposed, given its array of business activities. By “process-oriented”, I mean that examinersand auditors should ascertain whether management processes and methodologies are sufficientlyrigorous and effective, given the institution’s identified risks. Institutions that demonstrate a soundcontrol structure and effective management processes should be subject to less intrusive supervisionthan institutions that do not have this essential infrastructure in place.As I alluded to earlier, specific supervisory arrangements, practices and techniques vary from countryto country depending on differences in culture, financial system structure and internal politicalrealities. Having said that, a set of basic principles can be identified that should guide all supervisorsin an increasingly interconnected, global financial marketplace. In 1997, the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision issued a set of twenty-five Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervisionintended to serve as a benchmark against which the effectiveness of particular supervisory regimes canbe assessed. If you’re not familiar with the Principles, I’m pleased to bring them to your attentiontoday.
7BIS Review 27/2000The Core Principles document brings together concisely all of the fundamental elements needed tocarry out effective bank supervision - a remarkable achievement in its own right. Equally important, inmy view, the document also balances the desire to set high standards for supervisory practices with thepragmatic recognition that not all countries are in the same stage of financial market development. Assuch, the Core Principles document is of particular importance for developing market economies, as itestablishes a clear set of standards against which each country’s current approaches and progress canbe measured.It should be emphasized that, in attempting to craft a document that would have the legitimacy, qualityand flexibility to meet the needs of bank supervisors around the world, the Committee made aconscious effort to consult broadly throughout the various stages of the project, and particularly withsupervisors from emerging market nations. Some might argue that such extensive consultation slowsdown the process and dilutes the final product. I strongly disagree. Only through this inclusiveapproach could we design comprehensive principles with broad applicability and support.Last October, the Basel Committee, in cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank, produced afollow-up document called the Core Principles Methodology. This report was initiated in response torequests from a number of countries for additional guidance on how to interpret and implement theCore Principles. The methodology document provides specific criteria for evaluating andimplementing each Core Principle. One set of criteria focuses on issues deemed essential for theminimum implementation of the Core Principles; the other focuses on those issues deemed torepresent “best practice”. The IMF and the World Bank currently use the new methodology to assessthe banking sectors in individual countries.It should be stressed that the most important efforts to implement the Core Principles are occurring inindividual countries and, with this in mind, I am pleased to say that approximately 120 countries -including many here in Asia - have now endorsed the Core Principles. Without the support andbacking of national authorities to follow through with the implementation of these principles, ourbroader efforts simply cannot be effective.In this connection, the Basel Committee has long recognized the need for effective training ofparticipants in the global supervision community, and over the years has sponsored numerousprograms which have been beneficial in allowing supervisors from different countries to shareexperiences and exchange ideas for improved practices. In 1998, the Basel Committee, along with theBank for International Settlements, jointly established the Financial Stability Institute, which conductsleadership training of supervisors in emerging market countries and facilitates technical assistance.This May, the Basel Committee plans to bring together supervisors from emerging market countriesand representatives from the IMF and World Bank to discuss the lessons learned from this initiative.The May meeting is part of the Committee’s ongoing commitment to ensure that the Core Principlesremain current and relevant to bank supervisors worldwide.Let me move on to the Basel Committee’s initiative to revise the 1988 Accord. As you know, capitalhas played, and continues to play, an important role in the supervisory tool kit. Adequate capital helpsensure that shareholders monitor the risk of financial institutions, and that management puts in placeand maintains appropriate oversight mechanisms to help prevent problems from surfacing in the firstplace. Should an institution experience difficulties, capital serves as a buffer to absorb losses andreduce the risk of spillover from a problem institution to other financial institutions.The primary tool of capital regulation currently is the set of minimum ratios that were devised in 1988by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. They were set forth in an agreement known as theBasel Accord, and were adopted, among other reasons, to address the slide in international capitallevels that was occurring over the previous decade. The Accord was clearly a milestone achievement -for the first time, supervisors in G10 countries were able to use a common yardstick for assessingbanks’ capital adequacy.But the Accord has a number of serious shortcomings. For example, it does not adequatelydifferentiate among degrees of credit risk and, as a result, banks have had incentives to take on higher
BIS Review 27/20008risk exposures within broad risk categories. Banks have also tended to engage in transactions thatlower capital requirements without reducing economic risk.In addition, it has proved difficult to incorporate into the Accord’s simple risk-weighting scheme theinnovations of the last decade in the way banks manage and mitigate risk. As market risk managementtechniques developed, we were able to incorporate a state-of-the-art, value-at-risk approach in a 1996Market Risk Amendment. Still, as credit risk management techniques have advanced, and as theimportance of operational risk management has increasingly been recognized, it has become apparentthat the long run relevance and efficacy of the Basel ratios as an indicator of capital adequacy has beeneroded.Supervisors have long known that analyzing simple capital ratios in isolation can lead to incorrectconclusions about the relative strengths of institutions. Thus, we also have relied on a review of banks’capital plans and on market discipline to assess capital adequacy. In June of last year, the BaselCommittee formalized the link between these elements when it released a Consultative Paper layingout our vision for a new, more refined capital adequacy framework.In addition to establishing minimum capital requirements, the proposed framework places increasedemphasis on the supervisory review of capital adequacy and the role of market discipline. We refer tothese elements - minimum standards, supervisory review and market discipline - as the “three pillars”.Together these pillars mutually reinforce safety and soundness by aligning capital relative to risk andby encouraging prudent risk management. This evolution in the Committee’s thinking about capitaladequacy follows from much of our recent work on risk management and the surveys we haveconducted on banks’ disclosure practices. It is also consistent with the broader notion of supervisionI’ve discussed today.We encourage comments on the Committee’s proposals from both supervisors and industryparticipants through 31 March 2000 - which is next week - and plan to publish, hopefully early nextyear, a comprehensive set of proposals that will be responsive to the comments and input we havereceived.Let me highlight briefly each of the three pillars and provide some perspective on the key challengesthat the Committee faces in relation to each. The first pillar is minimum capital requirements. Toaddress the shortcomings in the 1988 Accord, the Basel Committee has proposed two primaryapproaches:• an enhanced standardized approach that ties risk weightings to external credit assessmentssuch as credit ratings; and• an internal ratings-based approach that would begin by mapping internal risk ratings intostandardized risk weightings, but might eventually evolve into something closer to the fulluse of credit risk models.Each approach treats the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy somewhat differently and thus oneor the other is likely to be relevant to banks with different levels of sophistication. Most importantly,both proposed approaches attempt to introduce greater risk sensitivity into the minimum capitalstandards to address the unfortunate incentive problems that have evolved from the 1988 Accord.Some observers - including, perhaps, a few in this room - have noted that the effort to incorporategreater risk-sensitivity into the framework inevitably introduces procyclicality into our standards. Thatis, the capital requirements for loans to troubled borrowers will tend to increase at just the point whensuch trouble is becoming apparent. This is an important point, and one that we at the Committee areworking to address. It is my view that the global financial system needs to move toward addressingpotential credit problems preemptively - before these problems have time to grow from minordisturbances into major disruptions. To best accomplish this objective, any supplements to regulatorycapital should be incremental or graduated, rather than a sudden ratcheting that could potentiallyreinforce a cyclical downturn.The second pillar in the proposed new capital adequacy framework has to do with the supervisoryreview of capital - a critical complement to minimum capital requirements. The Consultative Paper
9BIS Review 27/2000proposes that supervisors should ensure that each bank has sound internal processes in place to assessthe adequacy of its capital based on a thorough evaluation of its risks. In evaluating the strengths andweaknesses of a bank’s internal allocation process, supervisors would draw on, among other things,their knowledge of best practices across institutions.I want to stress that this proposed approach in no way intends to replace the judgment and expertise ofbank management, or to shift responsibility for capital adequacy to supervisors. On the contrary, it iswell understood that bank managers have the most complete understanding of the risks theirinstitutions face, and it is they and the bank’s directors who have primary responsibility for overseeingthose risks. The task for supervisors in this framework is to evaluate how well banks are assessingtheir capital needs relative to their risks, including whether banks are appropriately addressing therelationship between different types of risks. Most importantly, in proposing this second pillar theBasel Committee intends to foster a more active dialogue between banks and their supervisors.The third element in the proposed new capital adequacy framework is market discipline. As Idiscussed earlier, more extensive disclosure and a greater dependence on market disciplinecomplements improvements in bank-level management, official supervision and minimum capitalstandards. Some areas that we at the Federal Reserve believe are good candidates for greaterdisclosure would include components of regulatory capital, risk concentrations and transactionsinvolving recourse, such as securitizations.To the extent that banks develop disciplined internal approaches to evaluating capital adequacy, andgreater disclosure enhances market discipline, supervisors will be able to place greater reliance on allthree pillars and reduce regulatory inconsistencies. The common interest is to keep the Basel standardsas a floor sufficient to ensure financial soundness, but above which banks themselves will choose tooperate.ConclusionIn conclusion, we clearly have an ambitious agenda for perfecting and refining the supervisoryframework for the twenty-first century. In implementing this agenda, we should always keep in mindthe fundamental objective - preserving financial stability so that banks and the broader financialsystem can effectively perform their critical functions in a market economy. There is no question thatthe more effectively a banking and financial system operates, the more likely the economy is toflourish and the citizens of that society to prosper.This is particularly true in many emerging market economies that have a relative scarcity of savings inrelation to their large-scale investment needs. The banking sector in emerging market economies alsotends to be more concentrated and represents a larger share of the domestic financial system,suggesting that, if problems occur, they are likely to have an amplified effect on the real economy andon the fiscal cost associated with bank rescue and resolution costs.In pursuing the objective of financial stability, we must also acknowledge that both the public andprivate sectors have a critical role to play. While the perspectives of market participants and officialsupervisors may differ from time to time, our objective is the same - to maintain a strong and vibrantfinancial system over the long term. Indeed, it is clearly evident to me, as a former commercial bankerand now as a supervisor, that only if we work together, each meeting our responsibilities andreinforcing the other, will we be able to successfully manage and supervise a rapidly evolving,ever-more complex financial services industry.
1BIS Review 17/2000Mr Roth remarks on the euro and Swiss franc: two sister currencies?Speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank,at the Swiss Business Association Annual General Meeting, Singapore, 24 February 2000.*      *      *For more than a year now, the euro has been a reality. It has crowned a decade long process ofmonetary integration in Europe. The introduction of a common currency in eleven closely related, butindependent countries is an unique experiment. It is still too early to assess all the far-reachingimplications of this monetary revolution. Therefore, the thoughts and remarks I am going to expresstoday can only be intermediate and provisional.1.Consequences of the euro for the Swiss economySwitzerland is not part of the Monetary Union. It is nonetheless deeply integrated in its Europeanenvironment through its geographic situation and its strong historical, cultural and economic links withEurope. Over 50% of our exports go to countries of the euro-zone, while 70% of our imports comefrom there. But, besides that, Switzerland has strong traditional links overseas, too. The US, Canadaand Japan account for 10% of our imports and 15% of our exports while emerging markets represent4% and 10% respectively. Although concentrated on Europe, our foreign trade is geographically morediversified worldwide than that of other small open European economies such as Austria, theNetherlands or Belgium.For the first time in its history, Switzerland is surrounded by countries all sharing the same currency.Even without being a member of the Union, it is affected by this new monetary situation. De facto, ourtrade with Europe is already taking place in one currency only - the euro - because the parities of theformer national currencies have been definitively locked. That means that our foreign trade is lessdiversified by currencies than earlier and that fluctuations of the SF/euro exchange rate have an evenstronger impact on the Swiss economy than the former SF/DM or SF/FF exchange rates. At the sametime, a common monetary policy for Europe is likely to lead - over time - to a strongersynchronization of business activity in the EMU member states. This, in turn, means that the impact ofthe European business cycle on the Swiss economy will become more even and thus also stronger.More than ever, Switzerland’s economic destiny will be linked to that of Europe.Today, Switzerland benefits already from the technical simplification induced by the substitution often different currencies by a single one. Monetary unification brings advantages to internationallyoriented firms as it simplifies their foreign currency management and their accounting procedures.From the year 2002 onward, when the euro will exist in the form of cash, the single currency willmake things even easier for a broad public, not only for the Europeans, but also for every Swisstravelling through the euro-zone. At that time, the euro will probably also be easily accepted forpayments in Swiss border regions and tourist areas.As final advantage, the single currency greatly enhances market transparency and stimulatescompetition. On the one hand, Swiss importers can now directly compare euro denominated offersfrom different countries. On the other hand, exporters can less easily differentiate prices according tothe market destination of their products. In the long run, transparency will promote efficiency forEU-members and non-members. The almost daily news about mergers and acquisitions in Europe isan expression of the ongoing fight for a favorable position on the unified European market.2.Extraordinary stability of the Swiss franc/euro exchange rate in the past ...After these remarks on the general consequences of the euro for Switzerland, let us now turn to themore specific, but nonetheless central, question of the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the
BIS Review 17/20002euro. As already mentioned, the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro is of crucialimportance to the Swiss economy. So far, the relation between the two currencies has been remarkablystable. Since the introduction of the single currency, the Swiss franc/euro exchange rate has fluctuatedin an extremely narrow band of only 2%. Thus, exchange rate volatility has until now been even lowerthan the 8% volatility observable between the Swiss franc and the Deutsche mark during the threeyears preceding the monetary unification.The extreme stability in the exchange rate has surprised many observers, including the Swiss NationalBank itself. It has led to the notion of “sister currencies”, the euro being the big sister and the Swissfranc following her everywhere like a shadow. But is the Swiss franc really the euro’s little sister? Letme discuss this question in detail.If one examines the reasons for the extraordinary stability in the exchange rate, one quickly finds thatconvergence in fundamentals has played a central role. Both Europe and Switzerland have sufferedfrom slow growth in the 1990s and from deflation fears in the aftermath of the international financialcrisis of 1998. Rising unemployment and weak economic activity led the ECB and the SNB to adoptan expansive monetary stance and to cut interest rates. Broad similitude in business cycle andmonetary stance has created conditions leading to an almost fixed exchange rate between the euro andthe Swiss franc. At the same time, converging fundamentals explain why both currencies have beenequally weak against the US dollar: the American business cycle is well in advance of the Europeanand Swiss business cycles, requiring a different policy response from the Fed.While fundamentals play a key role in explaining long run exchange rate developments, politicalfactors can also be of some importance in the short run. By political factors I mean, for example,elections, government crises, political conflicts or new legislation, but also the relation between thegovernment and the central bank, and the credibility of both. In 1999, these widely defined politicalfactors may have played some role for the relation between the euro and the US dollar. The conflictbetween the former German finance minister Lafontaine and the European Central Bank, the Europeanundecidedness in the face of the Kosovo conflict, and the plans for a harmonization of taxes on interestpayments, for example, may have contributed to the weakness of the euro against the dollar. Inaddition, the not always clear communication strategy of the European Central Bank concerning itsviews on the exchange rate of the euro may also have created some uncertainty.However, it is puzzling to see that the relation between the Swiss franc and the euro has not beendisturbed by these factors. It may be that the markets perceived Switzerland as so strongly integratedin Europe that they almost forgot that the Swiss franc is an independent currency. Or, they believedthat the Swiss National Bank, as declared in the early and uncertain days of the introduction of theeuro, would not tolerate a sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc. Expectations of a SNB reactioncertainly played a role.In my view, a further factor may explain the greater stability of the Swiss franc vis-à-vis the Europeancurrencies. One cannot exclude that the emergence of a large market for the euro has had a structuralimpact on the demand for Swiss francs. Today, the currency diversification of international portfoliosoccurs between blocks (dollars, euros, yen and Sterling). Given its size and its traditional low volatilityvis-à-vis the DM, the market for Swiss franc denominated assets does not offer an attractive way tocounterbalance the risks born by large holdings of key currencies. Our currency is thus less demandedas reserve currency and less involved in speculative capital movements. This is basically good newsfor the Swiss economy.3.... and what about the future?What conclusions can be drawn from the past? Will the Swiss franc remain stable vis-à-vis the euro, orwill we see a more independent development of our currency? Again, the answer to this question willdepend crucially on economic fundamentals in Switzerland and in the euro-zone. In both areas, theeconomy is now recovering from the recession, following a steady upward path. The expected growthrates for this year amount to 2.2% for Switzerland and 2.9% for the euro-zone. The central question
3BIS Review 17/2000for the exchange market is to what extent the economic upturn could endanger price stability, and whatkind of central bank’s reaction can be expected.3.1Uncertainty about lasting convergence in European and Swiss fundamentalsWhile Europe is now growing faster, it still suffers from an unemployment rate of roughly 10%. Atfirst sight, one might think that this big labor reservoir would allow the economy to grow withouttensions on the labor market and without large wage adjustments. Inflation would remain subdued, andthere would be no need for an all too restrictive monetary policy. This, however, is only the “firstsight” scenario. European unemployment is largely structural, meaning that although there is ademand for labor on the part of the firms, this demand is not necessarily matched by the supply on thelabor market. Under these circumstances, the labor market could constitute a bottleneck for growthand lead to inflationary pressure. To prevent inflation from rising, the European Central Bank wouldhave to further increase interest rates. Clearly, structural adjustments are of the essence in Europe. Inthe absence of flexibility, the unemployment rate cannot be lowered significantly and doubts existabout the actual room of maneuver of the monetary authorities.Expected growth for Switzerland, on the other hand, looks quite moderate by international standards.Thus, one might think that there is little danger of inflation and that the Swiss National Bank shouldfurther support the seemingly fragile economic upturn. A look at the labor market, however, showsanother picture. Unemployment has fallen steadily since the summer of 1997 to a low rate of 2.3%only. Its recent increase to 2.6% is due to seasonal factors. Moreover, there are already clear signs of ashortage on the labor market. Stronger growth could thus fuel the well-known wage-price spiral.Under these circumstances, a further tightening of monetary policy is a realistic hypothesis.To make things even more difficult, there is a high degree of uncertainty concerning the developmentof labor productivity in both Europe and Switzerland. The rise in labor productivity is usually seen asthe main factor behind the spectacular performance of the US economy, characterized by high growthand low inflation. Will productivity now also start rising in Switzerland and Europe? Where will it risemore? In Switzerland, where the labor market is more flexible and structural reforms are moreadvanced, or in Europe, where the large common market and the single currency are expected to breakup old structures?We have good reasons to believe that there is a potential for non-inflationary economic growth inSwitzerland. Investment has been strong in 1998 and in the first part of 1999, deregulation andcompetition have made spectacular progress, large-scale adjustments have taken place in variouseconomic sectors and more flexibility is now accepted in the labor market. Some adjustments in theinterest rate have been made in order to restore a more neutral monetary stance. In one word, thedegree of competitiveness of our economy is stronger today than it was 5 or 10 years ago, productioncapacities have not been fully exhausted and monetary conditions have been adjusted. Switzerland willthus benefit from the recovery in Europe without major risk of inflationary pressures.Indeed, the assessment of the future stability in the exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the eurodepends crucially on what will happen in Switzerland and in the surrounding countries. If theconvergence in fundamentals goes on, the exchange rate should remain relatively stable; otherwisesome adjustment will be needed. I am convinced, however, that the exchange market will not behaveirrationally. Following the pattern of the DM/SF relationship of the past, it will not depart substantiallyfrom what fundamentals would suggest.3.2Political uncertaintiesWhat about the political factors influencing the exchange rate? I would like to mention here two majorthemes that could possibly affect the relation between the Swiss franc and the euro.The first factor is the uncertainty about Switzerland’s future policy towards Europe. As you mayknow, the Swiss people rejected Switzerland’s membership in the European Economic Area (EEA) inDecember 1992. This vote was regarded as an anti-EU signal by the government, which has since thenshelved its plans for adhesion to the EU. As an alternative, Switzerland has negotiated Bilateral
BIS Review 17/20004Agreements with the EU in order to gain free access to the EU internal market for goods and services.The agreements need to pass a popular vote next May. The prospects for an adoption of theAgreements are good. Sooner or later, however, the question of Switzerland’s accession to the EU willbe considered again. Should the Swiss people still favor a Switzerland outside of the EU, then roomfor monetary independence will remain.The second political factor is the uncertainty about the EU enlargement. There is a long list of EasternEuropean and Mediterranean countries pushing into the EU. Of course, EU enlargement will be aprogressive step-by-step process. Nevertheless, it is uncertain today how an enlargement will changethe EU’s face in the future. How will these countries be integrated? How will the decision-makingprocess inside the EU be affected? And finally, how will the EU enlargement be financed? All theseopen questions constitute a potential risk factor for the euro.4. ConclusionsLooking back at the first 14 months of the euro from a Swiss perspective, the most strikingobservation is the extraordinary stability of the Swiss franc/euro exchange rate. A detailed analysisshows that this stability was due to a high degree of convergence in economic fundamentals and in themonetary reaction of the two central banks. Thus, solid economic reasons have been behind thisstability and not some artificial strategy of currency pegging implemented in secret by the SNB. In thefuture, the exchange rate should evolve depending on the development of the fundamentals - inSwitzerland and in the euro-zone - and on the answers to some important political questions. Exchangerate stability, on the scale that has been experienced so far, is not guaranteed to last forever. However,the risk of erratic movements seems limited because the presence of large currency blocks has loweredthe attractiveness of the Swiss franc as reserve currency.Nevertheless, I would hesitate today to qualify the euro and the Swiss franc as “sister currencies”. Ifyou have a sister, she remains your sister for life and not just in case of common interests. We shouldrather consider these two currencies as travel companions: they share the same objective - a soundmacroeconomic development - and follow the same road towards price stability. It is up to theirrelative fitness to see whether they will continue hand in hand.
1BIS Review 16/2000Mr Meyer answers the question “How does a surplus affect theformulation and conduct of monetary policy?”Speech by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the 16th Annual Policy Conference, National Association for Business Economics,Washington, D.C. on 23 February 2000.*      *      *This is a conference on fiscal policy, specifically on how to allocate any potential future surplusesamong debt reduction, tax cuts, and spending increases. The question you and I might be asking rightnow is: what is a monetary policymaker doing here? You know, of course, that I always enjoy visitingwith my fellow NABE members. But what contribution can I make to this important topic?My assignment is to answer this question: How do the prevailing surplus and, especially, decisionsabout the allocation of future potential surpluses affect the formulation and conduct of monetarypolicy? The best way to understand the issues involved, in my view, is through the concept of thepolicy mix. Using this concept will allow us to focus on the implications of alternative combinationsof monetary and fiscal policies - yielding the same level of aggregate demand - for the real interestrate, the composition of output, and the current account balance. And it also will help us understandthe key source of the interdependence of monetary and fiscal policy decisions.In planning my remarks today, I intended first to discuss the analytics and the politics of the policymix and then to illustrate the power of the analysis by using it to explain some of the importantfeatures of our current experience. For example, the swing in the structural budget balance clearlyhelps to explain the increase in the national saving rate and the high level of investment relative toGDP in this expansion. However, other important features of recent macroeconomic experience -specifically the absence of a large decline in real interest rates and the significant deterioration in thecurrent account balance - appear at least superficially inconsistent with the predictions from thestandard analytics.One problem, I believe, is the assumption that the recent dramatic swing in the structural budgetbalance has been driven exclusively by policy. Perhaps even more important are other developmentsthat have affected real interest rates and the current account balance over the same period. I could sumup these problems by noting that “ceteris” aren’t always “paribus”.I conclude by discussing the implications for monetary policy of options for the allocation of the“potential” surplus. Because these options involve alternative policies, the standard framework shouldprovide appropriate guidance about projected outcomes - ceteris paribus, of course. I focus on twoways in which fiscal policy choices could affect monetary policy. First, fiscal policy choices willaffect the interest rate consistent with full employment and price stability. Second, a gradual reductionand ultimate retirement of the federal government debt would require changes in the way monetarypolicy is implemented.The analytics of the policy mixThe policy mix is a very useful device for understanding the interaction of monetary and fiscalpolicies. There are infinite combinations of monetary and fiscal policies that yield the same level ofaggregate demand. The different combinations result in different outcomes for the level of real interestrates, the composition of output, and the current account balance. The composition of output at a giventime has implications for the level of output over time. So the policy mix has quite importantimplications for macroeconomic performance.The policy mix can be easily represented in a simple IS-LM diagram, shown in Figure 1 (6 KB). Thisillustrates a simple model of macroeconomic general equilibrium. The IS curve shows the
BIS Review 16/20002combinations of interest rate (R) and output (Y) consistent with equilibrium in the output market. TheLM curve shows the combinations of interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in the marketfor money. The intersection of the curve shows the unique combination of the interest rate and outputconsistent with equilibrium in all markets simultaneously.Let’s start from a simple case in which the level of capacity is given at a moment in time and theintersection of IS and LM curves determines the prevailing level of aggregate demand. As long as thisintersection occurs at or to the left of the capacity limit, potential output (Y*), it determines the levelof output, at least in the short run. I will assume that the intersection takes place at potential output, sothat the outcome is consistent with the broad objectives of monetary policy: price stability and fullemployment. Evaluating alternative fiscal policies at an unchanged level of output - and specifically atpotential output - also allows us to abstract from cyclical changes in the deficit and thereby to focusexclusively on changes in the structural budget balance.The position of the LM curve is determined in part by the stance of monetary policy. I have drawn theconventional upward sloping LM curve predicated on a constant money stock. In this case, we couldview the level of the money stock as being adjusted by open market operations to be consistent withthe Federal Reserve’s target for the interest rate. Alternatively, we could draw the LM curve as ahorizontal line at the prevailing interest rate target set by the FOMC. The position of the IS curve isdetermined in part by fiscal policy, including the level of discretionary spending and benefit and taxrates. The latter rates also affect the slope of the IS curve, but I will abstract from that detail.In Figure 1 (6 KB), I depict two of the infinite number of combinations of IS and LM curves thatintersect at potential output - the intersection at B corresponding to a looser fiscal and tighter monetarypolicy than the intersection at A.The first question I want to answer is, What difference does it make where the intersection of IS andLM curves occurs for a given level of output? The answer is, It makes a world of difference. Acombination of tighter fiscal and looser monetary policy (point A compared with point B in Figure 1(6 KB)) implies a lower interest rate, a higher share of investment (and, in general, of interest-sensitivecomponents of spending) in GDP, a lower value of the dollar, and a higher level of net exports andhence of the current account surplus. Therefore, by selecting a particular policy mix, policymakers canaffect the amount of capital formation and the current account balance.
3BIS Review 16/2000The above simple version of the IS-LM model does not begin to do justice to the topic. In moresophisticated models, we would see explicitly the long-run increase in output associated with a shift inthe composition of output today toward more investment. In addition, more sophisticated modelswould also show explicitly the increase in the exchange rate and the associated decline in the currentaccount balance in response to a policy mix that resulted in higher real interest rates. Finally, moresophisticated models could also take into account a second dimension of fiscal policy changes. Notonly do changes in tax rates and spending affect aggregate demand, they can also affect aggregatesupply, for example, when they alter after-tax wage rates and after-tax rates of return to saving andinvestment. The effect of any change in the policy mix will also be affected by supply-side incentivesincorporated in the fiscal part of the mix.The politics of the policy mix: does monetary policy respond to fiscal policy?How does the choice about the policy mix get made? An interesting question! No, we do not have ajoint committee on the policy mix that considers the benefits of alternative mixes and reaches ajudgment. The policy mix is determined by sequential decisionmaking, subject to an understanding ofthe structure of the economy and of the likely responses of the other policymakers to one’s policyactions.In my view, the process works as follows. The Administration and the Congress together makedecisions that determine the fiscal part of the policy mix. Over the last 20 years, these decisionsgenerally have been based on considerations that have more to do with long-run objectives such aspromotion of higher longer-term growth, than with short-run stabilization. Making these decisionstakes considerable time because of the dynamics of the annual budget process and the legislativeprocess. The current year’s decisions are incorporated and the following years’ decisions areanticipated in the fiscal policy assumptions underlying the Federal Reserve’s forecast, extending out ayear or two. The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it,specifically, price stability and full employment. Fiscal decisions are, in turn, affected by budgetforecasts that are partly contingent on monetary policy assumptions.In effect, fiscal policymakers make the fundamental decision about the policy mix. Monetarypolicymakers smooth the transition to the new equilibrium, by minimizing the effect on output relativeto full employment and on prices. Because monetary policy adjusts continuously to changes in theeconomy, including those resulting from fiscal policy, it makes sense to think that fiscal policydecisions are made first and monetary policy decisions are conditional on the fiscal decisions.So does this mean that monetary policy responds directly to fiscal policy actions? I believe it is moreaccurate to say that the Fed’s response is indirect. That is, monetary policy responds to changes infiscal policy in much the same way that it responds to other influences on the economy, such as equityprices, exchange rates, or the demand for US exports due to changed growth prospects abroad. Eachand all of these developments affect both the macroeconomic developments and the forecast that driveadjustments in monetary policy in pursuit of full employment and price stability.It is also important not to overstate the role monetary policy plays in shaping the policy mix. Indeed,the fiscal policy decision uniquely determines the policy mix. In terms of our diagram, the game isfundamentally over when the fiscal decision pins down the intersection of the IS curve and the verticalline at full employment. The only question remaining is how the LM curve will come to intersect atthe same point.One possibility, of course, is that the Federal Reserve adjusts its open market operations to move theinterest rate to this point. In a regime in which the Fed implements policy by choosing a target for themoney stock, either the money stock could be adjusted to move the LM curve to this point, or priceflexibility would ultimately get the job done, with the emphasis on the ultimately. The role of activemonetary policy is to avoid the need for price flexibility - that is, to prevent the fiscal decision fromeither temporarily lowering output below its full employment level or permanently increasing prices.In an interest-rate regime, holding the funds rate unchanged following a shift in the IS curve wouldresult in an escalating disequilibrium. For this reason, an interest-rate regime has to be modeled in
BIS Review 16/20004terms of a policy reaction function. Under a plausible policy rule - for example, utilizing actual orforecast output gaps and inflation rates - the interest rate would be reset over time until it wasconsistent with the intersection of the IS curve and the vertical line at potential output and pricestability.The message of such an interest rate rule is that monetary policy responds only indirectly to fiscalpolicy. That is, the rule specifies the adjustment of the interest rate to changes in output and prices (theindirect approach), not the adjustment to changes in tax rates or spending (as would be the case in adirect approach). However, if we look at the reduced form equation for the now endogenous monetarypolicy instrument, we shall, to be sure, find - lurking on the right-hand side - the exogenouscomponents of the fiscal policy decision - the level of discretionary spending and the benefit and taxrates. That the response may be indirect does not make it any less systematic.In the “real world”, of course, many factors besides fiscal policy are likely to be affecting inflation andoutput. So we may rarely actually observe the interrelationships implied by the analytics of the policymix. That is, ceteris are rarely paribus, which brings me to my next topic.Comparing the theoretical prediction to recent experienceThe swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when thefiscal year 1994 budget was adopted. Such a dramatic swing in the budget balance might have beenexpected to yield a particularly dramatic confirmation of the predictions of the analytic model, in theform of a sharp decline in real interest rates and a significant improvement in the current accountbalance.In fact, during the period of a dramatic swing in the budget balance, real interest rates have notdeclined, and the current account balance has significantly deteriorated. If you hadn’t alreadysuspected, we are about to find out that the real world is always more complex, and much moreinteresting, than our simple models. Two explanations for this conflict between theoretical predictionand recent experience are possible. First, the preceding analysis is fundamentally flawed. Second, it isat least incomplete. I will take the second route and argue that the problem was that ceteris were notparibus in this episode.Ceteris paribus, of course, means “all other things being equal”. In our models, it is a way ofexamining the effect of one shock, holding constant all other shocks that could effect the variables inquestion. In class and in model simulations, we can always impose ceteris paribus. Indeed, ceterisparibus was implicitly assumed all the way through the section on analytics. In the real world, we donot have this option. In addition, in the analytics, by holding output fixed at potential, we abstractedfrom the effect of cyclical influences on the budget balance, on interest rates, and on the currentaccount.The key to getting the right answer in the analysis is to identify correctly the multiple shocks thatinduced the swing in the ratio of deficit to GDP and that affected the real interest rate and currentaccount, as well as to take into account the effect of the cyclical developments. I assumed in theanalytics of the policy mix that any non-cyclical change in the deficit was due to a change in policy -some combination of increases in tax rates and cutbacks in government spending. Indeed, specificfiscal policy actions make this characterization appear qualitatively correct. But to explain the real-world outcomes we also have to allow for the role of other influences, specifically structural change.A portion of the swing in the budget balance was of course due to the cyclical upswing. In ouranalytics, we were able to control this by holding the level of output constant at potential output. Butto apply this to our dynamic economy, we have to allow for uncertainty about the level of potentialoutput at a given time and the growth in potential output over time.A unique feature of the recent cyclical experience has been the divergence between the cyclicalstrength of the US economy and that of its major trading partners - that is, the weak expansion inEurope, the long period of stagnation in Japan, and the crises among many emerging marketeconomies from late 1997 through 1998. This divergence in cyclical strength was accompanied for
5BIS Review 16/2000several years during this episode by a persistent appreciation of the dollar, further contributing to adeterioration in the current account.However, the more serious problem with the application of the conventional framework is the failureto account for structural change, specifically a decline in the non-accelerating inflation rate ofunemployment (NAIRU) and an increase in trend growth. The decline in the NAIRU, for example,would raise the equilibrium level of output and increase imports, worsening the current accountbalance. More rapid trend income growth would also increase the growth of imports and hence cause adeterioration in the current account. In addition, higher trend productivity growth, driven by anincrease in the profitability of investing in new technology, would raise the equilibrium real interestrate and encourage capital flows to the United States to take advantage of higher returns on capital.This in turn would lead to an appreciation of the dollar, further augmenting the current account deficit.Once again, it appears that the increase in the economy’s trend rate of productivity growth is playing astarring role in our explanation of recent macroeconomic developments.In discussing the interaction between the swing in the federal budget and the increase in theproductivity trend, I have focused on how the latter may have offset the tendency of the former tolower real interest rates. But, of course, the interaction works in both directions. The increase in theequilibrium real interest rate, expected as a result of an increase in the productivity trend, is also aceteris paribus result. It depends critically on the assumed fiscal policy rule. For example, if tax ratesare constant and government spending remains a constant share of GDP, then the higher productivitytrend will, in general, yield a higher equilibrium real interest rate. However, if real (or nominal)government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, puttingdownward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate ofthe higher trend productivity.The surplus conundrum and the policy mixAlthough the discussion of the policy mix did not fully explain recent economic performance, I stillbelieve it offers important insights into the alternative options for dealing with the current andprojected surpluses, at least if ceteris really turn out to be paribus. But the recent episode underscoresthe difficulty of actually predicting real interest rates and the current account when unknowable shockswill surely intervene along the way.My assignment is not to evaluate how much confidence we should have in projected surpluses or toassess the merits of alternative allocations of projected surpluses. Rather, my assignment is to connectfiscal and monetary policy decisions. I have emphasized the value of evaluating fiscal policy optionsin models that incorporate reasonable monetary policy reaction functions. Doing so builds in theindirect response of monetary policy to fiscal policy changes, consistent with the logic of the policymix. This is, in effect, the approach I followed in my discussion of the analytics of the policy mix byassuming that monetary policy is reset - albeit indirectly - in response to a change in fiscal policy.Retaining the projected non-social security surplus in the CBO baseline is one alternative. The otheroptions involve increased fiscal stimulus and, as a result, will be accompanied, ceteris paribus, by ahigher equilibrium real interest rate in the long run. They would also likely result in a lower share ofinvestment in output and a higher current account deficit than the option that preserves highersurpluses. The specific outcomes will depend on the details, especially on the nature of supply-sideincentives in any spending or tax changes. Ceteris paribus, monetary policy - run off a sensiblereaction function - will end up validating the higher equilibrium real interest rate, to keep prices fromaccelerating indefinitely.The implications of debt retirement for monetary policy operationsOne additional consequence of the choice among these options is that preserving the surpluses wouldlead to a gradual decline in and ultimately the retirement of the federal government debt. Theprospects for such an outcome depend, of course, on the realized growth rate of income and hence taxrevenue and one’s assumption about the starting base of expenditures and the appropriate baseline for
BIS Review 16/20006its rate of growth. I have already noted that such an outcome should not be viewed as a foregoneconclusion. And, even if the Treasury debt were to be fully retired, that outcome would be likely to betransitory. Once the baby boomers begin to retire, the social security trust fund will be progressivelyrun down, and at some point, the overall budget will likely move from surplus to deficit again.Today, Treasury securities account for the bulk of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of assets. Treasurysecurities are a convenient and natural choice for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio because they pose nocredit risk and because the depth and liquidity of the Treasury market facilitate open marketoperations. Although the Treasury market has been the traditional vehicle for monetary policyoperations in recent decades, the Federal Reserve Act provides authority for the Federal Reserve topurchase a fairly wide range of other assets - including obligations of federal agencies, certainobligations of state and local governments, foreign exchange, and sovereign debt. Moreover, theFederal Reserve often supplies reserves through repurchase transactions in addition to outrightpurchases. If the Treasury market became less liquid, we could substitute longer-term RPs againsteligible collateral for some outright purchases of securities. If the existing classes of assets that theFederal Reserve is authorized to purchase or to acquire were deemed too narrow, we could pursuetechnical changes in the Federal Reserve Act to authorize transactions with a broader range of assets.Still another option would be to expand the role of the discount window in the provision of reserves tothe banking system. The key point is that declining Treasury debt does not pose any insurmountablelong-term problem for the Federal Reserve. There would, of course, be transitional issues as monetarypolicy operations adapted. But we surely maintain the effectiveness of our monetary policy operations.So a decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately retire the governmentdebt should not be affected by any concern that this option might undermine the effectiveness ofmonetary policy.Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at crosspurposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines inlonger-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economicactivity to a more sustainable rate. To date, the main impact of Treasury operations and debtmanagement prospects has been on longer-term Treasury rates, with only a small spillover effect onthe financial variables that affect private spending decisions - short- and longer-term private interestrates, equity prices, and exchange rates. To the extent that Treasury debt management operations affectthe private interest rates or other financial conditions that matter for private spending decisions, theFOMC can always adjust its policy settings as appropriate to achieve its objectives.ConclusionIn debt management as well as other fiscal policy decisions, the Administration and the Congressshould make the decisions that are in the best long-run interest of the economy. Monetary policycannot affect the long-run consequences of such policy decisions, but it can adjust to smooth theeconomy’s transition to the new equilibrium. Monetary and fiscal policies should therefore be thoughtof as working as partners, rather than in competition with each other. In addition, decisions about theallocation of the government surplus or about debt management operations should not be limited byany concern that a gradual decline in or even ultimate retirement of the government debt wouldundermine the ability of monetary policy to achieve the broad objectives that the Congress hasassigned to it.
1BIS Review 26/2000Mr Hayami: Price stability and monetary policySpeech given by Mr Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Research Institute ofJapan, in Tokyo, on 21 March 2000.*      *      *I am honored to be invited to this meeting and given an opportunity to address such distinguishedguests.More than a year has passed since the Bank of Japan launched the zero interest rate policy in February1999. During that time, Japan’s economy has shown significant improvement thanks to aggressivemonetary easing, fiscal stimulus measures, and the restoration of financial system stability. Underlyingconditions for the recovery of private demand such as business fixed investment and householdconsumption have also continued to improve. Nevertheless, we still need to carefully monitor theeffects of such improvement on the spending behavior of households and firms, particularly since theeconomy is faced with various structural problems. And, in view of the fact that Japan’s budget deficitis the largest among major industrial countries, it should be noted that further stimulus from the fiscalpolicy side is not an easy option.Under such circumstances, voices calling for additional measures on the monetary policy front havetended to become louder. And, some have begun to argue for tolerating a little bit of inflation. In fact,we have been receiving an increasing number of questions asking our views on “inflation policy” andinflation targeting. Though there is no single definition of inflation policy, it includes all policieswhich somehow artificially create inflation or inflationary expectations. Before responding to thequestions, we first need to review the significance of price stability. In this regard, the Bank of Japanhas recently announced that it will conduct a comprehensive study on price stability, and today’sspeech can be regarded as a prelude to such study.1.Why is price stability important?Significance of price stabilityThe new Bank of Japan Law which came into effect in April 1998 stipulates that the objective ofmonetary policy is to “contribute to the sound development of the national economy through thepursuit of price stability”. When we emphasize the importance of price stability, we are sometimescriticized that the Bank of Japan is only concerned with inflation regardless of current economicconditions. Let me start by explaining that such criticism is not to the point.Price stability is important because it provides the foundation for all kinds of economic activity andthe people’s livelihood.The market economy is a structure within which firms and households make decisions regardingconsumption and investment based on prices of individual goods and services. And, the general pricelevel is a concept that consolidates individual prices of various goods and services traded in a country.In other words, the levels of individual prices can be evaluated against the general price level as ayardstick. In this framework, price stability means that this yardstick is reliable. If so, changes inconsumer preferences and the progress of technological innovation will be efficiently translated intochanges in individual prices. Thus, firms will be able to use changes in relative prices as a signal fortheir future business strategy. From a macroeconomic viewpoint, when the economic environment iscontinuously changing, stable prices facilitate the smooth reallocation of such resources as labor andcapital and also technological innovation in response to, for example, consumer trends, therebyensuring sound economic growth over the long run.
BIS Review 26/20002If prices fluctuate considerably and the yardstick becomes unreliable, then the signaling function ofindividual prices will be greatly weakened. In this case, labor and capital will not be easily transferredto growth industries, and the inefficient allocation of resources will ensue. In addition, an economywith unstable prices will likely experience unstable business cycles. This, in turn, will make it difficultfor firms and households to formulate prospects regarding profits and income, which obstructs soundinvestment activity. Thus, if price stability is impaired, the long-term growth rate will decline.Furthermore, price fluctuation distorts income distribution. For example, if inflation occurs, those withfinancial assets which are fixed in nominal terms, such as bank deposits, will see a fall in their realvalue. Conversely, those with financial liabilities will benefit from a reduction in their real value. As aresult, inequality between those with assets and those with liabilities will arise. In contrast, if deflationoccurs, the reverse inequality will follow.Policy objective of the Bank of JapanAs such, price stability lays the foundation for sound economic development from the viewpoint ofboth efficiency and fairness.The Bank of Japan has been aiming at price stability that is neither deflationary nor inflationary. It is amistake to think that the Bank is concerned only with inflationary risks.This can be understood from the conduct of monetary policy in the recent period. In February 1999,the Bank embarked on drastic monetary easing, namely the zero interest rate policy. And in April, itmade clear its firm intent to maintain this policy until deflationary concerns are dispelled.In view of current economic conditions and price developments, Japan’s economy is judged not to bein the middle of deflation. What is frightening about deflation is that it induces a vicious circle called adeflationary spiral whereby price declines reduce corporate profits and wages which, in turn, leads to aslowdown in business activity and further price declines. These can be called “pernicious pricedeclines”. In fact, there was a very high risk of Japan’s economy falling into a deflationary spiral upuntil around the spring of 1999, but concern over such risk materializing has greatly subsided in thepast year. Both CPI and WPI have been almost level. Corporate profits have been increasing andeconomic activity gradually picking up. Though it is true that prices of a number of products havebeen declining, this is against the backdrop of various revolutionary changes including the so-called ITrevolution, that is, the progress of technological innovation in information and telecommunications, aswell as the revolution in distribution networks represented by the emergence of so-called “categorykillers”. Such phenomena cannot necessarily be regarded as pernicious price declines.Nevertheless, the Bank has been continuing its extremely accommodative policy symbolized by thezero interest rate policy. This is because, in our judgment, we might again face the risk of perniciousprice declines until such time we can be confident that Japan’s economy has achieved a recoveryunderpinned by private demand.As such, the Bank of Japan has been conducting monetary policy by paying due consideration not onlyto inflation but also to deflation.2.Problems with inflation policyTwo views of inflation targetingRecently there have been various discussions on setting a specific numerical target to the inflation ratein order to achieve price stability, namely inflation targeting.At the outset, it should be noted that two different views have been discussed in Japan under the titleof inflation targeting. Originally, inflation targeting is a policy framework to enhance the transparencyregarding the conduct of monetary policy and to strengthen the credibility of the commitment to pricestability. However, not a few advocate so-called inflation targeting in the same vein as inflation policy.
3BIS Review 26/2000Thus, before discussing inflation targeting in its original concept, let me say a few words about theproblems involved with inflation policy.Inflation policy is not a well-defined concept. Most typically, as Professor Krugman of MITadvocates, it is a policy which aims at a somewhat high inflation rate of 4 to 5% and mobilizes allpossible measures to achieve this target. Professor Krugman appears to have asserted this ratherextreme policy prescription based on a very pessimistic view of Japan’s economy. As a matter of fact,however, Japan’s economy has started to improve. And, it is our judgment that, under such economicconditions, we should never adopt a policy that is contrary to price stability.There is a variation of inflation policy that says a moderate inflation rate of 2 to 3% is tolerable and itmay vitalize economic activity. However, given the current situation in Japan where prices are almostlevel, such a proposal is tantamount to artificially creating inflation. Furthermore, to implement such aproposal, many have suggested that the Bank of Japan should increase its outright purchase ofgovernment bonds or underwrite them. Some even advocate that the Bank of Japan should purchasestocks or real estate. Thus, what started as a proposal aiming at a moderate inflation rate of 2 to 3%under the disguise of inflation targeting for price stability has ended up being the same as inflationpolicy in that inflation should be artificially created at any cost.Inflation is no solution to economic problemsRegarding inflation policy, first and foremost, I would like to point out that inflation is no solution toeconomic problems. Inflation policy assumes that moderate inflation will revitalize economic activity,alleviate the debt burden of firms as well as financial institutions, and relieve the fiscal deficitproblem. Apparently those who advocate inflation policy argue, while taking due account of itsnegative effects, that the intended positive effects would be greater than the negative effects under thecurrent situation. But, if we look more closely, the intended positive effects themselves would notlikely be achieved.Needless to say, financial markets today are sufficiently developed in major industrial countries,including Japan, and integrated on a global scale. And thus prospects for the economy and prices inJapan are of considerable interest to investors worldwide. Here, let us assume that the Bank of Japanannounces a target inflation rate and market participants both at home and abroad believe that theannounced target will be achieved. A well-developed financial market would immediately discountthis announcement and long-term interest rates such as the yield on government bonds would rise evenbefore we actually observed inflation. In theory, the nominal interest rate is defined as the sum of thereal interest rate and the expected rate of inflation. Therefore, with such an announcement, the nominalinterest rate would be pushed up by the same degree as the rise in the expected rate of inflation,leaving the real interest rate, which influences economic activity, unchanged.Furthermore, since uncertainty regarding the future normally increases as inflation rises, there wouldbe a greater possibility that long-term interest rates might rise more than the amount corresponding tothe increase in the expected rate of inflation because of risk premium accompanying higheruncertainty. If this happened, the debt burden of firms and the fiscal deficit would likely increaserather than decrease in real terms. The increase in long-term interest rates would also have an adverseimpact on economic activity such as business fixed investment. Therefore, a policy to create inflationwould most likely turn out to be counterproductive to the objective it was initially intended to achieve.Those proposing the solving of economic problems by way of inflation often refer to the experiencesof history or developing countries. But, compared to such experiences, Japan today is placed in atotally different situation in terms of the development of its financial markets and globalization.Indeed, we would face the problem I just mentioned whether the target inflation rate were 4 to 5% or2 to 3%. In this regard, it should be emphasized that what Japan needs now is an increase in realeconomic growth, not a rise in inflation.
BIS Review 26/20004Difficulty of controlling inflationThe second point is that inflation is most likely uncontrollable once triggered. Once inflationaryexpectations take a firm hold on society, they tend to proliferate. Workers would demand higher wageincreases than would otherwise be the case. If wage costs rise, firms would try to pass them on toproduct prices. Such an economy has a built-in risk of increasing inflationary pressure.Some argue that since the Bank of Japan is an independent central bank, it can raise the inflation rateto 2 to 3% and then contain it around that level even if there exists further upward pressure. However,if we tried to contain inflation after it had gained momentum, we would need very strong monetarytightening, which might result in a substantial deterioration of economic activity and a steep climb inunemployment. While it is true that the Bank of Japan has the power to contain inflation, it is also truethat enormous costs would be imposed on society to suppress inflation once triggered.In fact, prevailing thought in major industrial countries until the 1970s held that economies would bebetter off if a little inflation were tolerated. Partly because of such lax monetary policy, the worldeconomy experienced high inflation from the 1970s through the first half of the 1980s. And to containsuch inflation, many countries had to experience such hardships as higher unemployment. Because ofsuch bitter historical experience, major industrial countries have now discarded the idea that a little bitof inflation will improve economic activity. Mainstream thinking now says that price stability shouldbe maintained by a policy which prevents inflation from arising in the first place.Problems with further monetary easingThe third point concerns measures to create inflation. In Japan, we have already exhausted orthodoxmonetary easing measures. Even if we wanted to create very modest inflation, we would have to resortto such unorthodox measures as an increase in our purchase of government bonds or evenunderwriting them. But here it should be noted that there is a risk that the negative side effects mightbe quite large once the Bank implemented such unorthodox measures. The severity of Japan’s fiscalsituation has attracted attention from all over the world. Thus, if the Bank of Japan started purchasinggovernment bonds in large quantities, credibility in them would most likely be impaired. Long-terminterest rates would rise because of a higher risk premium occasioned by a deterioration in thecreditworthiness of the Japanese government. Adoption of such a drastic policy would run the highrisk of eroding not only fiscal discipline and the smooth functioning of financial markets but also thecredibility of Japan itself.Effects of the zero interest rate policyHaving said all this, we should ask ourselves whether there is anything more to do in terms ofmonetary policy. As a matter of fact, the zero interest rate policy is an extremely powerful policy toolfor monetary easing. Under the framework that the zero interest rate policy will be maintained untildeflationary concerns are dispelled, if uncertainty about the economic outlook increases, the timing oflifting the zero interest rate policy will be automatically delayed. By taking account of this automaticprolongation of current monetary policy, long-term interest rates will promptly decline. Thus, the zerointerest rate policy is powerful in that it possesses flexibility of automatically absorbing, to a certainextent, the effects of any negative shock on the economy.Currently, Japan’s economy has started to improve. Industrial production continues to rise, and theincrease in corporate profits is being confirmed. Though there remains uncertainty regarding thefuture, we have been observing quite a number of new developments in such areas as information andtelecommunications. At this juncture, I believe it very important to promote structural reform andcreate an environment conducive to revitalizing the corporate sector while the economy is underpinnedby fiscal and monetary policy.
5BIS Review 26/20003.Inflation targetingOriginal inflation targetingNext, let me talk about the original concept of inflation targeting. Basically, it is a policy frameworkthat emphasizes the strong commitment of the central bank to maintaining price stability and enhancesthe transparency regarding the conduct of monetary policy.Inflation targeting has been adopted by such countries as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, andSweden since around 1990. For example, in the United Kingdom, the target inflation rate is set at2.5% for a price index roughly equivalent to CPI. At its monthly Monetary Policy Committeemeetings, the Bank of England discusses the outlook for inflation and determines any necessarychange in interest rates taking due account of the time lag for the effects of monetary policy tomaterialize so as to bring inflation to around 2.5% over the span of two years. Once every quarter theBank of England releases an inflation report in which it explains the conduct of monetary policy anddescribes prospects for the economy and prices during the course of the following two years.While implementation of inflation targeting differs from country to country, the fundamental commonfactors are (a) setting a target inflation rate, (b) conducting monetary policy with the aim of achievingthe target over the medium term, and (c) making available a substantial amount of informationincluding the economic outlook which is the basis for policy judgment. It should be noted that thecentral bank is not required to achieve the target inflation rate in the short run. The aim of inflationtargeting is to contain inflationary expectations and enhance accountability regarding monetary policyby making a numerical target the medium-term objective.This original concept of inflation targeting may have some merits. In fact, we have discussed thesubject a number of times in our Monetary Policy Meetings. However, at the moment, I think adoptionof such a framework in Japan presents many difficult problems.Price developments in JapanAs far as prices are concerned, they have been very stable in Japan.Inflation targeting was originally adopted as a policy framework geared toward price stability by thosecountries who were suffering from high inflation. For example, in the United Kingdom, the averagerate of inflation was more than 5% during most of the 1980s, reaching 7 to 8% in 1990 and 1991. Andin 1992 inflation targeting was introduced. In the case of the United Kingdom, setting a target inflationrate at 2.5% is equivalent to announcing a strong commitment to containing inflation and maintainingprice stability.In contrast, since the early 1980s when the effects of the Second Oil Shock waned in Japan, theaverage rate of CPI increase has been very low at around 1%, and was only 3% at the peak of thebubble period when the economy was overheated. In the case of Japan, prices have been extremelystable for nearly twenty years. Thus, we have not been put in a situation where we have to set anyinflation target to maintain price stability even if we have not solved such difficult problems asdefining and measuring price stability.New price revolutionThe problem of defining and measuring price stability is whether we can set an appropriate numericaltarget for inflation based on a specific price index.In addition to this rather difficult problem, we need to consider the possibility that major industrialcountries, including Japan, are entering a “new price revolution era”. Such development has been bornof the rapid expansion of economic activity related to information and telecommunications, in otherwords the “IT revolution”. This is characterized by extremely rapid technological innovation whichinduces price declines through the improvement in productivity and the development of new products.Since the mid-1990s the United States has witnessed stable and low inflation under extremely low
BIS Review 26/20006unemployment, partly because economic expansion has been supported by the IT revolution. Thisphenomenon contradicts past experience.In addition to this worldwide IT revolution, Japan has been experiencing dramatic changes in itsdistribution and service industries which can be seen as a revolution in distribution networks.The progress of technological innovation and the revolution in distribution networks raise two bigquestions when analyzing prices. The first is whether prices of new products and price developmentsunder the new distribution networks are appropriately reflected in price indexes. This is theoft-discussed issue of biases in price indexes. In view of the large number of new products anddistribution networks available, this issue might have become more serious than previously envisaged.The second question is how to assess the price declines due to such revolutionary changes. If the ITand distribution network revolutions continue under the current situation of zero inflation, we cannotrule out the possibility that the economy could recover while the inflation rate is negative in terms ofthe existing price indexes, even though they may not sufficiently incorporate these revolutionarychanges. And, in the case where cost reductions continue thanks to technological innovation, even ifthe inflation rate is statistically negative it would not be appropriate to judge the economy as beingdeflationary as long as it is recovering steadily.When the environment surrounding prices is likely experiencing dramatic changes, we have tocarefully examine whether it is possible to set an appropriate target for inflation based on existingprice indexes.Desirable rate of inflationWhether an optimal inflation rate should be exactly zero percent or a small but positive number isanother argument worth noting. Following are some of the reasons why the optimal inflation ratecould be a small but positive number. First, as I mentioned, it appears not so easy for existing pricestatistics to fully incorporate actual price declines due to such factors as the revolution in distributionnetworks. This is the problem related to the upward bias of price indexes. Second, since nominalwages hardly ever decline, which is because of the so-called downward rigidity of nominal wages,economic adjustment would proceed more smoothly with a positive rate of inflation. Third is the zeroboundary problem for interest rates. Since nominal interest rates, which can be controlled by thecentral bank, never fall below zero, room for further monetary easing would be limited if conditionsworsened. In this regard, there is an argument that it is better to have a positive rate of inflation as acushion so that the central bank can maintain room for maneuvering when a policy response is needed.Indeed, this argument may be related to the fact that countries which adopted inflation targeting set, inprinciple, a positive target for inflation, including the United Kingdom which has 2.5% inflation as atarget.However, careful examination seems warranted as to whether these discussions and the examples offoreign countries could be directly applied to Japan. In view of the fact that bonuses have fallensubstantially and labor costs have been reduced by utilizing part-time workers and temporaryemployment agencies over the past one to two years, the downward rigidity of nominal wages inJapan’s labor market may not be so strong as has been argued. The idea of tolerating a certain positiverate of inflation to ensure a cushion for monetary policy seems to be something like putting the cartbefore the horse. As you may know, Japan has had an average inflation rate of only slightly over onepercent for nearly twenty years. Thus, it would need a very good reason to accept an inflation rate of2 to 3%. At this juncture, we should carefully examine the content of price stability that bestcontributes to the sound development of the national economy by taking due account of the featuresand structure of Japan’s economy.Toward enhanced transparency of monetary policyAs I have just described, there seem to exist a number of difficult problems in applying inflationtargeting to Japan in the way it is adopted in some foreign countries. As a matter of fact, not only theBank of Japan but also the Federal Reserve Board and European Central Bank are cautious about
7BIS Review 26/2000adopting such a framework. Nevertheless, it is true that the Bank of Japan is keenly aware that thetransparency of monetary policy should be further enhanced.Since it is impossible to foresee the economic outlook with certainty, we can neither predetermine thetiming of any future policy changes nor set mechanical criteria for deciding policy changes. In fact,even in countries adopting inflation targeting, there is no rule whereby the central bank automaticallytightens monetary conditions if inflation hits a certain target rate. In any country, monetary policy isbased on the central bank’s judgment of future price developments, which are influenced by variousfactors such as demand at home and abroad, wages, oil prices, foreign exchange rates, andtechnological innovation. In the conduct of monetary policy, the central bank needs to make an overalljudgment by examining the effects of all these factors on prices. In this sense, the overall judgment ofthe central bank is important regardless of whether a framework like inflation targeting is adopted ornot. In other words, adoption of inflation targeting does not mean that people will be able to know inadvance when and by how much the policy interest rate will be changed.The transparency of monetary policy is, after all, nothing more than clarifying what monetary policy isaiming at, and disclosing, to the extent possible, the overall judgment of the central bank with respectto current and future economic and financial conditions. With respect to the former, the new Bank ofJapan Law clearly stipulates that price stability is the objective of monetary policy. With respect to thelatter, the Bank has been trying to explain its overall judgment as clearly as possible in its MonthlyReport on Recent Economic and Financial Developments and minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings.Such disclosure is stipulated in the new Bank of Japan Law. We thus believe that the transparency ofmonetary policy has been considerably enhanced compared with the situation under the old law.At the same time, we should be well aware that behind the heated discussion on inflation targeting,market participants and the public are calling for more transparency with respect to monetary policy.Truly, greater transparency is also important for the central bank from the viewpoint of the smoothtransmission of policy effects. Furthermore, we recognize that it is an important mandate of the Bankof Japan to plainly explain our thinking on the conduct of monetary policy and price stability.Bearing such recognition in mind, the Bank has decided to conduct a comprehensive study on theconcept of price stability and issue a report by around summer. The issues for study include:(a) our basic thinking regarding price stability;(b) the measurement of prices, namely, issues regarding price indexes;(c) the evaluation of recent price developments in Japan; and(d) issues related to the numerical quantification of price stability.Since I have often been asked about the relationship between this comprehensive study on pricestability and the lifting of the zero interest rate policy, let me say a few words on this issue.The comprehensive study that we have undertaken is intended to review our basic thinking regardingprice stability with a view to enhancing the transparency of monetary policy over the long run. And itshould be understood that it is independent from the current conduct of monetary policy. Hence, it isnot directly related to such issues as the timing of lifting the zero interest rate policy or conditionswhich must be fulfilled for lifting such policy. In other words, it does not imply that the zero interestrate policy will not be lifted until the study is completed nor that it will be lifted once the study iscompleted.Conditions for lifting the zero interest rate policy can be likened to those for a patient in a hospitalcoming out of the intensive care unit, while our basic study on price stability is similar to a medicalstudy of how to maintain health and physical strength in normal times.With respect to the condition for lifting the zero interest rate policy, we have clearly stated that we willmaintain the current zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns are dispelled.
BIS Review 26/200084.Concluding remarks: until deflationary concerns are dispelledI would like to conclude my remarks today by addressing the question of how we might decide that theeconomy has reached a stage where deflationary concerns have been dispelled.What is of central concern in our conduct of monetary policy is to avoid a deflationary spiral, which isa vicious circle of price declines and recession. However, it is difficult to define this spiral by suchsimple figures as a certain percentage decline in CPI. To reiterate, we cannot necessarily conclude thata situation is deflationary solely from a negative inflation rate when the IT and distribution networkrevolutions are in full swing. To the contrary, even if inflation is level statistically, stagnant demandwould indicate future declines in prices and corporate profits, which means that deflationary concernshave yet to be dispelled. Thus, price developments must be assessed together with underlying factors.Furthermore, the most important point when judging whether deflationary concerns are dispelled is toanalyze whether there exists pressure for pernicious price declines stemming from shrinking demandor a widening output gap.In other words, if we become confident that economic recovery is sustained and that the output gapcontinues to narrow, then we can say that deflationary concerns have been almost dispelled andJapan’s economy could leave the intensive care unit. In this regard, we need to have clearer indicationthat the economy is on a self-sustained recovery path led by private demand, not by policy andexternal factors.Private demand basically consists of household consumption and business fixed investment. Whileboth are necessary for sustainable growth, business fixed investment is believed to play, in manycases, a more important role in giving impetus to a virtuous circle of a self-sustained recovery.Recently, the environment surrounding private demand has been gradually improving as evidenced byhigher corporate profits and the improved sentiment of firms and consumers. It is crucial whether suchimprovement will lead to increased spending. The Bank of Japan will carefully monitor the economywith focus on the strength of private demand centering on business fixed investment.Today, I have tried to share our thoughts with you on price stability and the conduct of monetarypolicy by referring to inflation policy and inflation targeting. As always, I would appreciate it if youwould continue to give us your understanding and support.
1BIS Review 26/2000Mr Greenspan remarks on some of the economic challengesfacing the United States in the new centuryRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Annual Conference of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, held inWashington, DC, on 22 March 2000.*      *      *Over the past several days, you have been engaged in sharing a good deal of practical information ondevelopments in the financial services industry and on the evolving set of laws and regulations thatinfluence the availability of credit in the communities that you serve. No doubt, many of you are herethis morning because of your long-standing interest in the Federal Reserve’s implementation of theCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA). However, because we are now in the final stages of draftingregulations on the Sunshine Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, I am prohibited fromcommenting at this time. Instead, I would like to discuss with you, in broader terms, some of thechallenges facing businesses, workers, and consumers - including those in your communities - as theU.S. economy embarks on a new century.As you know, we have recently established a record for the longest economic expansion in thisnation’s history. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that this business cycle differs in avery profound way from the cycles that have characterized post-World War II America. Not only hasthe expansion achieved record length, but it has done so with far stronger growth than expected. A keyfactor behind this impressive performance has been the remarkable acceleration in labor productivity,with output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate sector increasing since 1995 at nearly double theaverage pace of the preceding quarter-century. And because technological change has spawned somany opportunities for businesses to expand the range and value of their goods and services, theintroduction of new efficiencies has not led to higher unemployment. Rather, the recent period oftechnological innovation has created a vibrant economy in which opportunities for jobs and newbusinesses have expanded, enhancing the living standards of a large majority of Americans.Our challenge, then, is to ensure that we - both policymakers and community leaders - extend thefavorable macroeconomic performance and strive to bolster the capabilities of all Americans to sharein the prosperity that is being generated.When historians look back at the latter half of the 1990s a decade or two hence, I suspect that they willconclude that we are now living through a pivotal period in American economic history. Newtechnologies that evolved from the cumulative innovations of the past half-century have now begun tobring about dramatic changes in the way goods and services are produced and in the way they aredistributed to final users.How did we arrive at such a fascinating and, to some, unsettling point in history? While the process ofinnovation, of course, is never-ending, the development of the transistor after World War II appears inretrospect to have initiated a special wave of innovative synergies. It brought us the microprocessor,the computer, satellites, and the joining of laser and fiber-optic technologies. By the 1990s, these and anumber of lesser but critical innovations had, in turn, fostered an enormous new capacity to capture,analyze, and disseminate information. It is the growing use of information technology throughout theeconomy that makes the current period unique.For the consumer, advances in technology and in the flow of information have greatly facilitated thedevelopment of a wide range of new financial products that are better suited to meeting thepreferences of diverse populations. Similarly, in the case of consumer and business credit, computerand telecommunications technologies - the same forces that are shaping the broader economy - havelowered the cost and broadened the scope of financial services. As a consequence of thesedevelopments, borrowers and lenders are increasingly able to transact directly with each other, and we
BIS Review 26/20002have seen a proliferation of specialized lenders and new financial products that are tailored to meetvery specific market needs. At the same time, the development of credit-scoring models and thesecuritization of pools of loans hold the potential for opening the door to national credit markets for abroad spectrum of businesses operating in local and regional markets. Indeed, the CRA data on smallbusiness lending show that institutions located outside the local community are an important source ofcredit for many businesses.Much attention is focused on the role of corporate giants in fostering innovation, but we would befoolish to understate the extent to which America’s innovative energy draws, and will continue todraw, from the interaction of both large and small businesses. Nowhere in the world are the synergiesof small and large businesses operating side by side in a dynamic and competitive market economymore apparent than in this country. Of course, the surging growth of young high-tech firms and theflashy presence of new Internet businesses capture the most public attention. But judging from ourcontacts through our regional Federal Reserve Banks and information collected in surveys of smallbusinesses, times have been good for expanding traditional lines of business as well. The mostcommon complaints include the difficulty of finding qualified workers in the midst of strongcompeting demands for labor. In the current expansion, the vast majority of small businesses have notlisted access to credit as their top concern, although, as you know, many business owners are quiteapprehensive about the future as the familiar ways of financing business undergo sometimes dramaticchanges.Several recent developments hold the promise of improving links between financial institutions andthe small businesses in your communities. First, major banks and finance companies are tryingmass-market approaches to small business finance, similar to the approaches used in the consumercredit arena for many years, and this effort has greatly expanded the competition for loans. In addition,new innovative intermediaries - such as community development corporations and multibank andinvestor loan pools - are seeking to develop expertise in specific segments of the marketplace for smalland minority businesses.I would like to emphasize, however, that credit alone is not the answer for small businesses. Theymust have equity capital before they are considered viable candidates for debt financing. Equity acts asa buffer against the vagaries of the marketplace, and it is, accordingly, a sign of the creditworthiness ofa business enterprise and the commitment of its owner. This is especially true in lower-incomecommunities, where the weight of expansive debt obligations on small firms can severely impedegrowth prospects or more readily lead to business failures.Overall, our evolving economic and financial systems have been highly successful in promotinggrowth and higher standards of living for the majority of our citizens. But we need to reach further toengage those who have not been able to participate. One way is through the education and training ofour workforce - that is, enhancing our stock of “human capital,” which is a necessary complement toour ever-changing physical capital. A major consequence of the fast-paced technological change ofrecent years and the growth of the conceptual emphasis of our nation’s output has been to increase thedemand for skilled workers. In today’s economy, skill has taken on a much broader meaning than ithad only a decade or two ago. Today’s workers must be prepared along many dimensions - not onlywith technical know-how but also with the ability to create, analyze, and transform information andwith the capacity to interact effectively with others. Moreover, they must recognize that, with newtechnologies coming rapidly on line, the skills that they develop today will likely not last a lifetime.Traditionally, broader human capital skills have been associated with higher education, andaccordingly the demand for college-trained workers has been increasing rapidly. The result has beenthat, over the past several decades, the economic returns to workers with college training have onaverage outstripped those to workers who stopped their formal schooling with a high-school diplomaor less. In the past few years, real wage gains for college-educated workers have continued to be rapid,but owing to dynamic economic growth and tightening labor markets, increases for other workers, onaverage, have kept pace. Nonetheless, a wide gap between the wages of college-educated workers andthose of high-school-trained workers remains.
3BIS Review 26/2000Another consequence of rapid economic and technological change that needs to be addressed is ahigher level of worker insecurity, which is the result, I suspect, of fears of potential job skillobsolescence. Despite these tightest labor markets in a generation, more workers currently report thatthey are fearful of losing their jobs than similar surveys found in 1991 at the bottom of the lastrecession. The marked move of capital from failing technologies to those at the cutting edge hasquickened the pace at which job skills become obsolete. The completion of high school once equippedthe average worker with sufficient skills to last a lifetime. That is no longer true, as evidenced by thetrends in workers returning to school and in businesses expanding and upgrading their on-the-jobtraining.Certainly, higher education will continue to play an important role in preparing workers to meet theevolving demands for skilled labor. But the pressure to enlarge the pool of skilled workers requiresthat we recognize the significant contributions of other educational programs in your communities.Community colleges, for example, have become an important provider of job skills training not justfor students who may eventually move on to a four-year college or university but for individuals withjobs - particularly older workers seeking to retool or retrain. In some cases, community colleges areproviding contract training for employers, part of a broader trend in which employers and theirworkers are recognizing that to maintain human capital, investment in formal training programs mustcomplement experience on the job.As one might expect, greater worker insecurities are also creating political pressures to reduce thefierce global competition that has emerged in the wake of our 1990s technology boom. Protectionistmeasures, I have no doubt, could temporarily reduce some worker anxieties by inhibiting thesecompetitive forces. However, over the longer run such actions would slow innovation and impede therise in living standards. They could not alter the eventual shifts in production that owe to enormouschanges in relative prices across the economy. Protectionism might enable a worker in a decliningindustry to hold onto his job longer. But would it not be better for that worker to seek a new career in amore viable industry at age 35 than to hang on until age 50, when alternative job opportunities wouldbe far scarcer and when the lifetime benefits of additional education and training would be necessarilysmaller? To be sure, assisting those who are already close to retirement in failing industries is animperative. But that can be readily accomplished without distorting necessary capital flows to newertechnologies through protectionist measures. More generally, we must ensure that our wholepopulation receives an education that will allow full participation in this dynamic period of Americaneconomic history.No doubt, in your communities many workers may view the changing needs of their employers as athreat to the security of their job; and perhaps students preparing to enter the workforce see thedemand for rising skills as a hurdle too high to overcome with the limited resources available to them.You, as community leaders, can continue to explore ways of developing creative linkages betweenbusinesses and educational institutions to better prepare students for the rising demands of theworkplace and to help workers, who must keep up with those changing demands and who must copewith the consequences of global competition, renew and upgrade their skills.As I indicated earlier, one notable aspect of the remarkable performance of our economy in recentyears has been the substantial, and relatively broadly based, rise in real income. During the pastseveral years, workers, including those at the low end of wage distribution, have seen noticeableincreases in the inflation-adjusted value of their wages; more comprehensive Census Bureau figureson the real money income of families also show gains in each quintile between 1996 and 1998, andpresumably when the 1999 data become available further improvement will be evident. These recentincreases for low-income workers, however, have not reversed the rise in wage inequality thatoccurred during the 1980s and early-1990s when the gap in wages between those at the top and thebottom of the distribution was widening considerably. Nonetheless, the leveling off in that disturbingtrend is an encouraging sign of what can be achieved if we can maintain strong and dynamic labormarkets accompanied by low inflation.Of course, we need also to consider trends in wealth, which, more fundamentally than earnings orincome, represent a measure of the ability of households to consume. The Federal Reserve’s Survey of
BIS Review 26/20004Consumer Finances indicates that the median real net worth of families increased 17½% between 1995and 1998. As one might expect, the rising stock market coupled with the spreading ownership ofequities was an important factor. However, even in the face of the strong aggregate trend, median networth declined over this period for families with incomes below $25,000, and medians for non-whitesand Hispanics were little changed.That families with low-to-moderate incomes and minorities did not appear to fully benefit from thehighly favorable economic developments of the mid-1990s is, of course, troubling, and the surveyresults warrant a closer look. In the details, we find that families with incomes below $25,000 didincrease their direct or indirect holdings of stock, and more reported that they had a transactionsaccount. However, they were less likely to hold nonfinancial assets - particularly homes, whichconstitute the bulk of the value of assets for those below the top quintile according to income. At thesame time, one encouraging finding from the survey is that the homeownership rate among minoritiesrose from 44 percent to 47 percent between 1995 and 1998, which may be a sign of improved accessto credit for minorities.Although market specialization, competition, and innovation have vastly expanded credit to virtuallyall income classes, under certain circumstances this expanded access may not be entirely beneficial,either for customers in general or for lower-income communities. Of concern are abusive lendingpractices that target specific neighborhoods or vulnerable segments of the population and can result inunaffordable payments, equity stripping, and foreclosure. The Federal Reserve is working on severalfronts to address these issues and recently convened an interagency group to identify aberrantbehaviors and develop methods to address them.I have no illusions that the task of breaking down barriers that have produced disparities in income andwealth will be simple. It remains an important goal because societies cannot thrive if significantsegments perceive their functioning as unjust. Although we have achieved much in this regard, moreremains to be done. Despite the considerable progress evident in recent decades in reducing racial andother forms of discrimination, this job is far from complete.Discrimination is against the interests of business - yet business people too often practice it. To theextent that market participants discriminate, they erect barriers to the free flow of capital and labor totheir most profitable employment, and the distribution of output is distorted. In the end, costs arehigher, less real output is produced, and national wealth accumulation is slowed. By removing thenon-economic distortions that arise as a result of discrimination, we can generate higher returns toboth human and physical capital.We are experiencing an extraordinary period of economic innovation. At the policy level, we mustwork to configure monetary policies that will foster a continuation of solid growth and low inflation.Beyond this primary mandate, we at the Federal Reserve are also responding to the challenge ofensuring that all communities can fully participate in our growing prosperity. With our CommunityAffairs program we provide information, instruction, and technical assistance to a diverse range ofconstituents regarding community reinvestment, community economic development, fair lending, andrelated issues. Our reach is broad: during 1999 more than 15,000 participants attended our conferencesand seminars, and we responded to more than 800 requests for in-depth technical assistance. We arealso increasing the research focus on topics related to community and economic development and in2001 will host a second national conference, this one focusing on the theme of changing financialmarkets and community development. Your participation in, and support of, these activities isimportant because you play such a crucial role in helping communities respond to the evolvingfinancial, educational, and technological demands of this new century.As I indicated in my opening remarks, future historians are likely to conclude that the past five yearshave been a pivotal period in American economic history. I trust they will also conclude that it was aperiod that set in place policies to foster the eventual emergence of full participation of that segment ofthe workforce that has not fully shared in our economic progress.
1BIS Review 15/2000Mr Latter takes a central banker’s lookat new challenges in a rapidly changing environmentSpeech given by Mr Tony Latter, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, atThe Asian Treasury Forum 2000, held in Hong Kong on 22-23 February 2000.*      *      *There was a time, many years - or more likely decades - ago, when it seemed that the main role of thecompany treasurer, if indeed there was any such identifiable position in the company, was to makesure that enough money had been transferred from time deposits to current account before eachmonth’s pay day; and it seemed that the main, possibly the only, function of a company’s financedirector was to make sure that the accounts were compiled, audited and filed on time.How times have changed. Not only has there been a ceaseless escalation in the range and complexityof financial instruments available to us all, and in the sophistication of accounting, but there has alsobeen an inexorable rise in the expectations which others, such as shareholders or executive boards,have as to what can be delivered from the financial side of a business. As a central banker I feel someempathy with those who find themselves sandwiched between pressure on one side from their mastersto achieve ever lower funding costs or ever better returns from financial investments, and persistententicements on the other side from bankers claiming that you could be freed of all that pressure if yousimply subcontracted everything into their capable hands.Treasury has come to be regarded in many instances as a separate profit centre. The treasurers of somemajor corporates are nowadays acknowledged as being at least as significant players in the financialmarkets as are the banks themselves. There are some well-known examples where the profitability ofan enterprise in the manufacturing or services sector has been sustained by deft treasury and financialmanagement for considerable periods when the mainstream business has itself been floundering. Andthere are also examples, alas, where reputable companies have been brought to their knees by flawedfinancial management. You probably don’t have an easy life, but you won’t need me to tell you that.I find myself wondering whether or for how long the financial scene will continue to be one of suchrapid change as we have been witnessing in recent years; and what the implications are, for any or allof us here, of recent and prospective developments in financial products and infrastructure.It is difficult to put a starting date on the financial revolution which I am attempting to describe - Imean the era of sophisticated asset and liability management techniques, of ever more exoticderivative and hedging products, and so on. But I guess it got going during the 1970s. Why notbefore? It seems that for most of the preceding postwar years banking and finance enjoyed a rathercosy and protected existence around the world. Capital controls and domestic regulation tended toconstrain the scope for competition or diversification; many domestic banking sectors were cartelisedto a significant degree, or in some cases state controlled; cross-border migration was, for one reason oranother, rather rare. All in all, the incentive and scope to innovate were weak by today’s standards.The environment changed quite quickly when national administrations began to deregulate theirfinancial sectors at the micro level and to free up movements of capital at the macro level.Just as importantly, the electronic data processing revolution began to open up avenues for financialengineering that could never have been dreamt of before. In the dealing rooms of London - then asnow the world’s leading international financial centre - professional mathematicians moved inalongside, or even displaced, the “barrow boys”. Perhaps I should explain that the barrow boystereotype was a Cockney young man from the east end of London with probably no veryaccomplished formal education but with strong mental arithmetic and trading skills, acquired fromworking on market stalls. Such people were until then regarded by many as possessing the bestqualifications to become dealers or floor traders in the City of London.
BIS Review 15/20002The IT revolution has not of course been a static one. Since the introduction of the first computers intofinancial product development and trading, computing power has grown exponentially. New vistas andpreviously unimaginable complexities for trading strategies have thus continually opened up; and theever-increasing speed of processing and communication has progressively rewritten the definition of“time critical”.The stream of innovation requires us not only to master the mathematics but also to assimilate a wholenew vocabulary of jargon - designed, no doubt, to make the underlying mathematics more easilydigestible. For example, I received a document from a leading international bank the other dayexplaining to me that the butterfly involved three tenors where the middle was the bullet and the wingwas the barbell; moreover I could long a two-five-ten by being long the two and the ten, each for aPV01 of half the sum for which I should short the five; in so doing I could profit from a bow at fivebut would be indifferent to any directional move provided it was parallel. Meanwhile, our universitiestoday probably devote more teaching time to gamma trades than to gamma rays; I’m not sure whetherwe, as citizens of the world at large, should be elated or depressed by this.But the world of finance is moving forward not only in the realms of such highly complex orsometimes - dare one say - gimmicky instruments. Continuous change and innovation are observableat the more prosaic level too. Looking at Hong Kong alone, over the past year there has been animpressive list of innovations, actual or planned, in the financial sector. These are not necessarily allof specific interest to the corporate treasurer but are nonetheless significant in a more general context.Thus, first, we have established a reciprocal link with South Korea for access to each other’s bondsettlement and custody systems (following earlier links of this sort with Australia and New Zealand).Next, Hong Kong has launched the Tracker Fund as a means of disposing of part of the ExchangeFund’s Hong Kong dollar equity portfolio; although this bears many characteristics of a conventionalindex-tracking unit trust, it also has some unique innovative features. In addition, the Hong KongMortgage Corporation has successfully introduced its first mortgage-backed securities programme.And notes issued by HKMA and HKMC have been listed on the stock exchange for the first time.Finally, we are preparing a US dollar clearing system which we hope will offer a wider range offacilities than any other offshore clearing; I would not want today to anticipate the more detailedannouncements about the planned timetable for this project, which we expect to make shortly.The foregoing is not necessarily an exhaustive list of changes which are being implemented here. And,assuming that Hong Kong is by no means the only place where new ideas are being developed acrossthe financing spectrum, I am led to the conclusion that there is little prospect of any immediate let-upin the pace of global product innovation in finance.That is a conclusion reached from merely observing what is at present happening in the financialworld, but it does raise questions as to where in all of this lies the scope for extra value added andprofit. If one assumes that the overall levels of savings and of investment demand in the economy arelittle affected by micro developments in the financial sector, then it follows that innovations, in orderto be profitable, must be continually exploiting new arbitrage opportunities, new and more efficientways of serving customers, and so on. One can understand how, over the years, the increased level ofcompetition in finance, both within and between countries, as well as the communications revolutionand the IT revolution, have provided the basis for extraordinary gains in efficiency. But will this trendcontinue? Indeed, can it? Might the financial sector now be encountering sharply diminishing returnsfrom innovation, in which case much of the new effort put into designing new products would prove tobe an expensive mistake? Or would it perhaps be more accurate to describe it as an expensivenecessity, since, if you don’t do it, someone else will? In the intensely competitive environment youcan’t afford to be left behind, but will, or can, everyone still make profits?I pose these as questions, but I’m afraid I don’t have any conclusive answers. Yet I suspect that wemay continue to be pleasantly surprised by the fruits which this ongoing revolution can bear. While itis certainly clear that finance is by and large a hugely competitive business, we observe that many ofthe participant institutions are enormously successful and profitable. At the same time, however, thoseof us with responsibilities for regulation, whether for purposes of consumer protection or in order toensure systemic stability, are surely justified in imposing capital and liquidity requirements designed
3BIS Review 15/2000to make the institutions proof against the sort of setbacks which too intense competition mayeventually bring to some.Of course, the scare story of impending diminishing returns and so on has been told many timesbefore. What, if anything, is new, as we set off into the new millennium? I believe there are two newingredients, both concerning the internet. They are access and speed. They are of course related.We can all now enjoy direct access to almost anyone and anything, anywhere, without having to gothrough intermediaries - other than electronic ones. We are all aware that a degree of caution isrequired here. For example, the HKMA supervises the banks that are located in Hong Kong, and it isunlawful for anyone to solicit for deposits in Hong Kong without authorisation. But if you click ontothe website of someone in a far-off country and are seduced into transferring funds into a deposit withthem, we may not be able to help you if things subsequently go wrong. This is a fairly simplisticexample and I’m sure that everyone in this audience, at least, would be alert to the risks and would actwith the necessary caution. But the proverbial man in the street, who may nowadays have his owninternet access, may be more gullible. Moreover, there may be products on offer that are more subtleand beguiling than a straight deposit, and very seductively packaged too; all of us here today arepotential victims to some sort of dupe; it is a brave person, or perhaps an arrogant one, who woulddeny that vulnerability.A still more significant manifestation of the internet, with potentially sinister consequences, is thespeed which it brings to all dealings. Generally we marvel at the instant availability of up-to-dateinformation, and the capability to act upon it, if we so desire, by a return click of the mouse. If theresponse is simply an e-mail message to a friend or colleague, the scope for loss or damage may belimited, but, even then, how often do we later rue the impulsive riposte? How many times do we go tobed composing the most fantastic letters or office memos, only to wake up the next morning to realisethat they were wholly over the top, too effusive or too offensive, tactless, or whatever. The trouble isthat nowadays we do not have to wait to respond until we can reach the other person on the phone thenext day, or mail him a letter, or hand him an office memo; by the time we awake the next morning itmay already be too late to censor our folly; we may have clicked the send button the night before.Worse still, in an increasing number of instances our counterparty will actually expect a responsealmost immediately. The phrase, “Let’s sleep on it”, wasn’t born for nothing, but now it may not beallowed. If you are executing major financial decisions by a mouse click, the scope for subsequentembarrassment may be substantial, to say the least.What I find slightly worrying is that the economics of, or business case for, continuing financialinnovation and the quest for new efficiencies may depend in large part on successful exploitation ofopportunities that can be seized only if you are able and willing to respond with lightning speed. Theultimate manifestation of this is programmed trading, where the computer virtually takes the decisionfor you. As history bears witness, such strategies are as good, but only as good, as the assumptions thatare programmed in, be they about economic forecasts, covariances between various events, orwhatever.But even if we felt that these particular strategies were foolproof, there are a myriad of other financialtransactions which can only really be consummated by a conscious human decision. The home buyerfaced with a choice between taking a mortgage from bank A or bank B is unlikely to have asophisticated and reliable mathematical model with which to compare the offers and determineconclusively his choice. But the culture nowadays, bred at least in part by the technologicalfeasibilities of the IT era, is one which is likely to place the home buyer under much greater pressureto reach a quick decision than his parents would have been a generation ago, or even his brother fiveyears ago, for fear of losing the best offer - if only he could assess which was the best. There is lesstime to reflect; less time to seek out disinterested advice.There are of course some areas of finance which appear relatively untouched as yet by this revolution.In the realm of corporate finance, in every jurisdiction so far as I am aware, the documents seekingshareholder support for a merger, for example, are still required to be sent by post, and with areasonable minimum notice period for response. I wonder how long it will be before documents willbe deemed to have been delivered to shareholders so long as they were sent by e-mail or posted to the
BIS Review 15/20004person’s interactive television; and the response period may be compressed on the assumption that youcan pick up your mail wherever you are and at any time. All of this may sound fanciful for themoment, but is not impossible at some stage.What we still need, but may be in danger of losing, is the chance to pause for breath. We need time notonly to think things through for ourselves but also to consult others. If, having dispensed with yourhuman stockbroker because you resented paying his level of commission, you buy a company’s sharesvia the internet at what you think is a bargain price, but in ignorance of the fact that a couple ofminutes previously the company issued a profits warning, you have only yourself to blame. But youmay have felt forced into dealing in that manner by peer pressure, or for fear of loss of face if somecolleague in the office starts boasting about what a killing he has been able to make on such-and-sucha “day-trading” deal. If that is indeed a fair characterisation of the atmosphere which many of usnowadays breathe, then I have to say that I find it rather distressing. We ought not to feel embarrassedto confess confusion, to seek advice or indeed to pay for advice.So, we live in a very challenging and pressurised environment. I am in no doubt in my own mind thatthe revolution which has swept through finance in the past quarter century has been beneficial toinstitutions and customers alike. We have, I think, now entered a phase where the basic margins maybe narrower, where temptations may be greater and more varied, where the pressures to move quicklymay be much stronger, and where of course the risks may therefore be rather greater. We all need toexercise skilful discernment and judgement, and I am sure this is as true for corporate treasurers andfinance directors as for the rest of us. But it is not my intention to be a killjoy; as I have suggested,there will continue to be exciting new opportunities to explore; and I wish you all a fruitful couple ofdays here doing just that.
1BIS Review 15/2000Mr George paints a broadbrush picture of challenges and change for themarkets as the year unfoldsSpeech by the Rt Hon Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, to the EuromoneyInternational Bond Congress at the QEII Conference Centre in London on 16 February 2000.*      *      *It’s a pleasure, as always, to have been invited to bring proceedings at this great annual event to aclose. You seem to go from strength to strength - from what I hear your sixth Congress has been aslively and interesting as its predecessors.Lively and interesting are pretty good words to describe the last twelve months in the markets too.When we were together here last year there were still plenty of clouds around. The emerging marketsin Asia were still only in the early stages of patchy recovery. Russia was still fragile and there werereal fears of another round of financial upset in Latin America, particularly Brazil. In the industrialcountries, too, the prospects were for slow growth - some were even still forecasting recession. Iconcluded that we’d all need strong nerves in the year ahead.Well, by and large we kept our nerve, and the skies have brightened over the past year as the clouds offinancial instability and global economic slowdown dispersed. The focus now is not on how we keepthe ship afloat but how we keep her on a steadier course - which, if you’re a sailor is a comparativeluxury. That still leaves us with quite enough to worry about - and who ever met a central banker - or asailor - who didn’t worry about what was coming next - it would be a contradiction in terms. Theimmediate challenge is to cope with the imbalances within and between the industrial countries, andwe have more work to do to improve our defences against volatile international capital flows moregenerally.But for the time being, the rate of world output growth, which had fallen to only about 2% in 1998,about half its long-term trend rate, and which was widely expected to fall further, is now expected tobounce back to around trend over the next couple of years. And whereas, a year ago, many industrialcountries were still in the process of easing monetary policy, to offset the impact on world demand ofthe interruption of the flow of credit and investment to emerging market countries and transitioneconomies, we have recently seen a quite widespread increase in interest rates, designed to moderatethe pace of domestic demand growth. And rising interest rates - I need not remind you - are areflection of a strengthening economy.Against this backdrop of strong economic growth and official tightening, it is not surprising that bondmarkets in most developed economies have responded with higher yields over the last 12 months.Since this time last year 10-year government bond yields in the major markets - with the notableexception of Japan - have all risen by over 100 basis points. And with credit spreads widening duringmuch of the summer, the rates that corporate borrowers have faced have shown even greater increases.Despite this, however, it has been another very active year for you all.Over the past few years a notable feature of the international bond markets is that each subsequentyear has set a new record in terms of volume, and 1999 has certainly been no exception to this. Whatis of particular note about issuance in 1999 though is the scale of this increase: up by almost a halffrom the level of 1998 - a pretty remarkable performance.I think that there are two major reasons for this increase:First, and most obvious, is the successful introduction of the euro. I can best demonstrate this with thefact that international issuance in the euro in 1999 was more than double that of the level that legacycurrency issuance reached in 1998. This is a clear indication that the euro has established itself as acurrency for international finance in its first year of existence. Not only did the volume of issuancerise, but perhaps even more strikingly, the diversity of issuers increased too. This illustrates how the
BIS Review 15/20002creation of the euro has opened up new funding sources for a wider range of issuers, and I have nodoubt that the euro-denominated high-yield bond market will continue to grow as confidence in theeuro bond market increases.A second reason for the large increase in issuance in 1999 was the increase in confidence of bothinvestors and issuers as the effects of the emerging market crises subsided. With this increasedconfidence came increased appetite for credit, and this not only gave borrowers from further down thecredit spectrum the opportunity to access markets - which they took - but also allowed issuers who hadpulled out of the markets during those turbulent times to return.So overall it is satisfying to note that the bond markets were not only more active than they have beenin previous years, but that they have also been accessible to a wider range of borrowers than inprevious years.Finally, right at the end of the year - literally - we all faced the challenge of preparing for Y2K. As weknow now, the world’s financial markets survived the dreaded Millennium Bug, thanks in large part tothe efforts of very many of you, and your IT colleagues, in making sure that we would. And we at theBank like to think we played our part too. Now I am not one of those who feel that all our work, yoursand ours, was unnecessary. If I had to choose a motto for a central banker, I think “better safe thansorry” would be very high on the list! More importantly we collectively showed that the Londonmarkets were equal to the challenge - even a once-in-a-millennium challenge - and were determined tomake sure that come the first day of the new year London would be “open for business as usual”.What of the coming year? Well, I can predict that, after two years of new year working, we will all beable to enjoy our New Year’s Day bank holiday for a change next year! But beyond that, my crystalball is no better than yours, and I am afraid that if you are looking for me to predict the course ofexchange rates or interest rates over the next 12 months I am going to disappoint you. I would likeinstead to pick out a few themes which I think will be of increasing importance as the year unfolds.Firstly, I think we will increasingly see a fall in the absolute size of government bond markets,although once again Japan remains the exception. This is already happening here in the UK and in theUS, as fiscal surpluses reduce bond issuance, and as the recovery in the rest of Europe continuesbudgets will increasingly move towards balance there too. One side effect of this is of course thatoutstanding government bonds can become very much sought after, and nowhere is this more true atthe moment than in our own market. But I think a much more significant change will be to encouragecorporate issuers to take up the slack, as it were, and fill the resulting hole. Europe does not yet have acorporate bond market to compare with the US market, but I think the current situation in the markets,with reduced government issuance, the opportunities afforded by Monetary Union and growth of theprivate pension industry in continental Europe, all combine to provide a very promising environmentfor the establishment of a genuine European corporate bond market.Secondly, the electronic revolution will continue to gather pace. There are those who wonder if all thehype about dot.com this and e-that is overdone, and certainly some of the current IT stock valuationsseem to build in expectations not readily captured by traditional valuation methods. But in thefinancial markets, I think if anything the effect of the electronic revolution will exceed even theboldest predictions. I am told that there is at least one major securities house which is assessing theongoing viability of each of their current functions in a future where both data storage and datatransmission are characterised by infinite capacity and zero cost. If the function adds value even undersuch a scenario, then it will be retained, but if not, then the house concerned sees no long-term futurefor it. I think the challenge facing financial markets and market participants is to identify where theycan add value and which services the consumer will continue to pay for: not all will pass the test andsurvive.My third theme combines both my earlier ones, and concerns the role of market intermediaries.Disintermediation is an ugly word, but it is a trend that exists today and will I am sure continue togrow in importance. Electronic secondary trading of securities is becoming more common, and wehave also begun to see electronic primary distribution - the issuance of securities on the Internet, and,in some cases, without the involvement of an issuing house. Now some people see in this a threat tomarkets themselves: everything, they fear, will migrate to the web and fragment, with a loss of the
3BIS Review 15/2000transparency and regulatory framework that organised and official markets provide. I do not share thisview, nor do I think that there is no future role for markets and market intermediaries. But I do thinkthat the marketplace of 10 years hence will be very different from the one we have now - just as thescreen-based markets of today are very different from the physical market floors of the past.Earlier I offered you a possible motto for central bankers. Let me complement that with one formarkets: “Adapt and survive”. But let me add the positive rider - “Those who survive will thrive”.What is the role of the authorities in this future I have described? It is, very simply, to provide as bestwe can the economic and regulatory environment in which financial markets can do their job - ofallocating capital to where it can be most productively deployed - more effectively. On the economicfront that means steady growth with low inflation. On the regulatory front it means a framework ofrules that provide for the transparency that is essential for the proper assessment and management ofrisk and sets clear behavioural standards which do not unnecessarily distort business decisions butprovide clear guidance to market participants - whether they are end-users or intermediaries - as towhat is expected of them and what they can reasonably expect of others.The picture I have painted is one of challenge and change. The flip-side of course is great opportunity.In fact there has never been a time when the markets here in London did not face change anduncertainty. But there has never been a time either when you, we, all of us, did not rise to thechallenge. I am sure we will all do so again - and I wish you all possible success.
1BIS Review 24/2000Mr Yam: Risks and challenges in coping with international capital flowsOpening address by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at theSixth Manila Framework Group Meeting, held in Hong Kong on 20-21 March 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,On behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to allof you to this Sixth Meeting of the Manila Framework Group.1As you will no doubt recall, the Manila Framework Group was founded in the deep throes of the Asianfinancial crisis in November 1997 to develop a concerted approach to restoring financial stability inthe region. With the worst clearly behind us, and with signs of a strong economic recovery in theregion, the mission of this group has still not ended. This forum embodies a valuable spirit ofcooperation, with wide participation of emerging market economies in the dialogue. The value of thisforum lies in its quality dialogue on regional surveillance and on reform of the international financialarchitecture.There is no doubt that economic recovery in the region has gathered considerable momentum.Economic growth for most economies has been better than expected, external balances have improvedremarkably, international funds have renewed interest in the region’s asset markets, and yield spreadsof Asian sovereign bond issues over the US treasuries have narrowed notably. According to estimatesby the Institute of International Finance, net private capital flows into emerging markets in Asiaincreased nearly six times from 1998 to US$39 bn in 1999, and are forecast to increase again by 50%to US$59 bn in 2000. There is therefore a real danger that we might forget the severe pains inflicted bythe Asian financial crisis over the past two years. It is also easy to forget the lessons learnt and tobecome complacent. However, if the recovery in the region is to be sustainable, we should remainvigilant and beware of the risks lurking under these bubbling activities.Risks and challenges in coping with international capital flowsChallenges of domestic structural reformsIn order to address such risks, we would need to tackle three challenges faced by Asia. The firstchallenge is that the globalisation and liberalisation of markets require structurally sound andresilient domestic systems. Prior to the crisis, the banking systems were often inadequately supervisedand were prone to incurring excessive maturity mismatch risks by borrowing short-term funds tofinance long-term investments. Moreover, the corporate sectors of many Asian economies wereover-stretching themselves by engaging in risky or unproductive investments. To make things worse,both the banks and the corporates were taking excessive currency risks by borrowing in foreigncurrencies to fund projects that could only generate income in domestic currencies. Poor riskmanagement on the part of banks, ineffective banking supervision, political interference, and a criticallack of transparency prevented disciplinary mechanisms from functioning properly. The result is astaggering bank restructuring cost of an estimated 25% of GDP for the crisis-hit economies in Asia.1The Manila Framework Group is a forum comprising senior finance and central bank officials from 14 economies,namely, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, NewZealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the United States of America. Senior representatives of the InternationalMonetary Fund, the World Bank, the Bank for International Settlements and the Asian Development Bank also attend themeeting. The Group meets twice a year.
BIS Review 24/20002Since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis, economies all over the region have taken importantstrategic steps to promote conditions that foster a full and speedy recovery. But recovery cannot besustained unless it is accompanied by thorough structural reforms. It is encouraging to see that notableinitiatives are taking place in Asia where extensive programmes are in progress to restructure andrecapitalise banks. There are also efforts to tackle the problems posed by over-stretched and highlyindebted corporations. But there is a risk that the problems that were so evident then will be sweptunder the carpet in the face of rapid growth. It is crucial that the reform momentum should not beallowed to falter, as it could undermine the fledgling recovery.Challenges of monitoring and surveillance of capital flowsThe second challenge I see is to understand better the risks posed by volatile capital flows and how tocapture data to facilitate our understanding of such flows. For a long time it has been taken forgranted that capital flows are analogous to trade flows: that, wherever they occur, and in whateverform, they invariably benefit long-term economic development, and that therefore the more liberal theflows, the greater the benefit. But between the processes of trade liberalisation and financialliberalisation there lies a great difference. In the case of trade liberalisation, there are well-establishedstatistical systems to capture data on international trade, and hence their impact on the real economy.In addition, there has been parallel development of institutional framework and rules to deal with trademeasures like tariffs, quotas, subsidies and dumping, and also counter-measures, and there aremechanisms for dispute settlement and arbitration. In contrast, the statistical framework for capitalflows is, relatively speaking, very modest. And we do not have any framework to deal with disruptioncaused by volatile capital flows comparable to the World Trade Organisation’s mechanisms forhandling disruption from trade in goods and services.The volume of global merchandise trade, valued at US$5.4 trillion in the year of 1998, in fact palesbeside the scale of global international finance. The average daily turnover in the world’s foreignexchange market stood at US$1.5 trillion in 1998, or roughly 70 times that of merchandise trade. Ontop of that, the OTC derivative contracts had a daily turnover of US$1.3 trillion in 1998, and thenotional amounts outstanding at end-June 1998 came to US$72 trillion. There is no doubt that thegrowth of foreign exchange and OTC markets, together with advances in information technology, hascontributed to cross-border capital flows and enhanced risk management standards. It is, however,legitimate to ask what lies behind these vast numbers. What does it mean for the underlying markets ifthe financial derivatives trading continues to multiply? Do we understand exactly what theseUS$72 trillion worth of derivative positions represent? Do we really understand the nature of the fundflows generated from the financial derivative trading in the OTC markets?The problem is that we do not have the answers to most of these questions. To start with, there is noteven an adequate statistical framework to capture capital flow data. The current data on balance ofpayments, international investment position, or flow of funds accounts have two major short-comings:(a) low frequency of quarterly data; and (b) limited breakdown of data by currency, sector, instrument,etc. The BIS, IMF and OECD are examples of institutions which have made some attempts to collaterelevant statistics but they are far from complete or timely.This is not just a statistical issue for the data compilers but a major policy issue for the authorities andother users. The compilation of high-frequency and detailed data is going to be resource-intensive andthere is keen competition for statistical resources. It seems to me high time to take a fresh look at theadequacy of data on capital flows and if necessary review the priorities currently assigned to collectionof real sector or other statistical data.Challenges of coping with the destabilising impact of highly leveraged institutionsThe third challenge I should like to touch upon is how to cope with the destabilising impact of highlyleveraged institutions (HLIs). The issue is how to improve the stability and functioning of the financialmarkets for all market participants. As there have been extensive international discussions in thisregard, I shall briefly recapitulate the key developments and the challenge ahead.
3BIS Review 24/2000The Asian financial crisis has shown that the highly competitive and globalised financial world hascreated individual market participants that are huge enough to mobilise, often with the help ofleverage, financial resources larger than the GDP of smaller economies. They can build up dominatingpositions in the markets of smaller economies and influence short-term market movements eithersingly or through acting in concert. Combined with the lack of information on the OTC market, thehighly leveraged institutions can develop potentially excessive and destabilising marketconcentrations, whether consciously or unconsciously.Under these circumstances, there are two types of scenario where HLIs could pose concerns in theirinteraction with financial markets. The first scenario is a situation in which HLIs taking excessivelylarge positions are overwhelmed by market forces. Rapid deleveraging of positions in marketsassociated with the default of an HLI of the size of LTCM could have systemic impact even in largeand mature markets, thereby threatening the global financial system. It has been said that a repeat ofthe like of an LTCM debacle is most unlikely to occur, given the downsizing of hedge funds. Icertainly hope that this is the case but I also notice that the recovery of investor sentiment has seenmore money from institutional investors as well as high net worth individuals flowing to the hedgefunds.The second scenario, commonly known as the “Elephants in the Pond” problem, is a situationwhereby the HLIs take very large and concentrated positions in smaller financial markets and adoptaggressive trading practices that could be destabilising to such markets. It is very encouraging that the“Elephants in the Pond” problem is by now recognised quite extensively as a real issue to be tackled.What is being done and is it enough?Different approaches have been floated to tackle the problems arising from the two scenarios I justdescribed. The prevailing approach is through improving counterparty risk management. This is doneindirectly by asking the banks and other financial institutions to be more prudent in granting creditlines to the HLIs, and directly by encouraging the HLIs to enhance their own risk managementstandards. This is eminently logical and sensible, since with more cautious bank lending and enhancedrisk management within the HLI sector, it should be very hard for the HLIs to build up excessiveleverage and concentration in the major financial markets.This measure is being pursued with earnest in both the public and private sector. The Basel Committeeon Banking Supervision, and IOSCO have issued respective guidelines on sound practices forinteractions with HLIs for banks and securities firms. The latest discussion has focused on the kind ofsupervisory incentives for the compliance of risk management standards. The Basel Committee onBanking Supervision has put forward two proposals for the revision of the Capital Accord, whichwould help address the concerns on HLIs. One is abolishing the maximum 50% risk weighting fornon-bank OTC derivatives exposures; and the other is encouraging counterparties to impose an initialmargin on repo transactions.From the private sector, the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group formed by twelve leadinginternational financial institutions produced a report in June 1999. Five major hedge funds alsoproduced an industry group report in February 2000 on improving counterparty risk management andinternal control.While we agree that enhanced risk management of HLIs and their counterparties is a useful first line ofdefence, two major concerns remain. First, the return of competitive pressure may lead to a relaxationor even a breakdown in risk management standards again in the future. There is anecdotal evidencethat some large HLIs are becoming less willing to supply information to their counterparties asmemories of the LTCM saga are fading. It is thus important that regulators continue to promote theintroduction of suitable supervisory incentives that would encourage continued compliance with soundrisk management practices by the financial institutions.Secondly, these proposals may not be sufficient to resolve the problem faced by smaller and openmarkets. Even with reduced overall leverage, HLIs could still build large foreign exchange positionsrelative to these markets. It might also be possible for HLIs to build up potentially destabilising
BIS Review 24/20004positions in smaller markets while remaining inside internal limits on leverage and/or liquidity risk.Enhanced risk management cannot therefore be relied upon, in isolation, to alleviate the problem.A second proposal to enhance market stability is to improve transparency and disclosure to makemarkets work better. There have been two major international initiatives in this respect, one at the firmlevel and one at the market level. At the firm level, there is the Multidisciplinary Working Group onEnhanced Disclosure, chaired by Peter Fisher of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which hasdeveloped a disclosure template for individual firms to voluntarily disclose their risk exposures. Thisinitiative is breaking new ground, as it is the first time that the private sector would be providing moreinformation about their risk exposures. However, the usefulness of such disclosure depends very muchon the level of breakdown in the risk disclosure.Furthermore, the US President’s Working Group on Financial Markets recommends (a) a reportingframework for large hedge funds to disclose more meaningful and frequent market risk information tothe public, and (b) a requirement on public companies to disclose information about their materialfinancial exposures to HLIs. A challenge here is for other authorities to take similar steps to requiresuch standards of disclosure, as this would help to avoid the possibility of regulatory arbitrage.At the market level, a working group set up by the G10, and led by Jean-Pierre Patat of the Banque deFrance, studied the feasibility of collecting and disseminating aggregate positions data in the foreignexchange market. I believe the initiative, if implemented, could have helped smaller and open marketsin better understanding their currency markets and the accumulation of highly concentrated positions.However, in November 1999, the G10 Governors decided not to proceed further with work in thisarea. In making this determination, the G10 found that there were a number of practical limitations tothe proposal, including the difficulty in obtaining compliance, the unfeasibility of producing the datain a timely manner, and the substantial costs involved. The demise of this initiative left a vacuum inthe area of transparency on market concentration. This is unfortunate and the international communityshould explore other alternatives to bridge the information gap.I have mentioned two approaches, that of enhanced counterparty risk management and improvedtransparency and disclosure, which will hopefully help to address the concerns on excessive leverageand on opaqueness of HLIs. There remains the issue of aggressive trading practices, such as takingextreme measures to manipulate prices and to precipitate herding or panic selling by other marketparticipants. Such practices undermine market stability. I therefore call upon the private sector marketparticipants to review matters and devise a code of conduct to improve the standard of marketbehaviour and practices. For such a code to be effective, I believe it needs to be market specific andapplicable to all market participants in that market.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, it has often been said that history, especially financial crisis, tends to repeatitself. In the last ten years alone, we have had the ERM crisis in 1992, the Mexican peso crisis in1994/95 and the latest Asian crisis in 1997/98. Notwithstanding the disturbingly frequent occurrenceof seemingly similar financial crises, I am inclined to believe that even though no two crises areexactly the same, if people do not learn from past mistakes, the market will continue to repeat itspunishment. The only difference between the major financial crises in recent years is that thepunishment is getting more and more severe, if not violent.I have cited three major challenges to learn from the mistakes in the last financial crises. First,domestic structural reforms. Secondly, monitoring and surveillance of capital flows. Thirdly, copingwith the destabilising impact of HLIs. They are by no means exhaustive. However, if we, individualeconomies and the international financial community, can muster the determination to tackle thesechallenges, we will go a long way in helping to reduce systemic risks, and improve the functioning ofthe international financial system and the stability of the financial markets. While much domestic andinternational efforts have been devoted to these issues, there is still much catching up to do. This isprecisely the reason why we gather here today - to take stock of progress, exchange views on the
5BIS Review 24/2000unfinished reforms, and work for a more robust and safe domestic as well as international financialsystem for all of us.
1BIS Review 14/2000Mr Gjedrem discusses various aspects of monetary policy,financial markets and the welfare state in NorwayAnnual address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank, the Norwegian central bank, at themeeting of the Supervisory Council of Norges Bank, held in Oslo on 17 February 2000.*      *      *We have just marked the turn of the millennium. Norway can look back at a century of upheaval - thedissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905, social conflict in the interwar period and the emergenceof the welfare state. At the beginning of a new century it is natural to examine some of the threadsrunning through our economic history. This may also shed light on the choices Norway is now facing.We have experienced periods of inflation and periods of deflationary recession. Vast changes in theworld economy have led to shifts in monetary policy and financial markets. Technology has brokendown regulations. Patterns of funding and ownership are changing. This creates unrest anduncertainty, but also offers new opportunities for growth and welfare. The welfare state is facing majorchallenges as a result of the ageing of the population and tax competition among countries. In thisyear’s annual address I will discuss various aspects of monetary policy, financial markets and thewelfare state.Historical perspectiveOne of the first endeavours of the Storting (Norwegian parliament) after its establishment in 1814 wasmonetary reform. In 1816 Norges Bank was founded. The specie daler was Norway’s first monetaryunit.From the mid-1800s an increasing number of countries chose to link the value of money to gold. Thecentral banks were under the obligation to convert their currency at a fixed rate into gold on demand.At the same time, there were no import or export restrictions on gold. This gradually resulted in theestablishment of an international fixed exchange rate system based on a gold standard.Chart 1
BIS Review 14/20002Norway switched from the silver standard to the gold standard in 1874. The krone was introduced as acurrency unit and we formed a monetary union with Sweden and Denmark. The gold standard and themonetary union were successful. The world economy and the Norwegian economy were expanding.Price levels were stable. In the 1900s periods of nominal stability, i.e. price and exchange ratestability, have also coincided with periods of steady and solid economic growth.Chart 2The experience of the last century shows that consumer price inflation is ultimately associated withhigh growth in the money supply. However, the causal relationship between money supply andinflation may be unclear.Norway has experienced four episodes of high inflation in the last century: during and after the twoworld wars and the Korean War, and a 15-year period from the first half of the 1970s to the secondhalf of the 1980s.During the First World War inflation accelerated sharply. The British war effort was partly financedby printing money. Price inflation accelerated in most countries, also in Norway. The gold standardwas suspended.The krone’s value against gold and pound sterling fell sharply in the boom during and after the FirstWorld War. Price inflation soared, accompanied by a speculative bubble with rising asset prices.When the bubble burst the boom came to an end, followed by deflationary recession and a bankingcrisis. The recession was probably exacerbated by the so-called parity policy pursued at that time,which aimed at returning the krone exchange rate to its pre-war value against gold.Inflation also accelerated during the Second World War. But unlike the interwar period, the years after1945 were not marked by recession. With the exception of a few years of high price inflation duringthe Korean War, the postwar period featured low and stable inflation and buoyant economic growth.
3BIS Review 14/2000Chart 3Chart 4
BIS Review 14/20004Chart 5The fourth period of high inflation was different from the three previous ones. In the 1970s and 1980sinflation gradually increased. Although inflation rates were not as high as during the two world wars,inflation remained high for a longer period.The postwar fixed exchange rate system - the Bretton Woods System - collapsed in 1971. A few yearslater, the Yom Kippur War broke out and OPEC countries suspended oil deliveries, triggering the firstoil crisis. The sharp rise in oil prices led to a recession in the western economies. Moreover, inflationtook root in most countries. In Europe, only Germany and Switzerland were able to keep inflationmore or less at bay.In Norway, the welfare state and support schemes were rapidly expanded partly based on expectationsof large future oil revenues. Economic policy was oriented towards building a bridge over what wasexpected to be a temporary downturn in the world economy. This led to a tug of war for real resourcesbetween the business sector and the public sector - between the exposed and sheltered sector.Chart 6
5BIS Review 14/2000The cost level in manufacturing industry was driven upwards. At the same time, the slowdown ingrowth proved to be permanent. The sheltered sector continued to expand, while industries exposed tointernational competition experienced deteriorating profitability and a relative decline. The recessionat the end of the 1980s was followed by a period of low wage growth and gains in competitiveness.This may help to explain why the decline in manufacturing employment came to a halt in the 1990s.However, wage costs increased again in the late 1990s. The relative wage level in manufacturingindustry compared with trading partners is now back at the level in the 1970s.Two forces were behind economic developments from the beginning of the 1970s. First, thedeterioration in competitiveness was caused by the expansion of the Norwegian welfare state and atransfer of real resources from the exposed sector to the sheltered sector. Second, inflationexpectations took root as a result of low administered interest rates and competitive devaluations.Nominal interest rates were kept low although price inflation and the value of tax-deductible interestexpenses rose. Frequent devaluations in the period from 1976 were ultimately ineffective with regardto preventing a relative decline in manufacturing industry. On the contrary, the devaluations proved tobe self-reinforcing.Chart 7Over a period of 15 years from 1973 to 1988 consumer prices in Norway rose twice as much as inGermany. In the same period, the value of the krone was virtually halved against the Mark. While wepaid around 2 kroner for one Mark in 1973, 15 years later we had to pay close to 4 kroner. Since thenthe krone has remained relatively stable against the Deutsche Mark. Today the exchange rate is around4 kroner and 10 øre.The last devaluation came in 1986 after the fall in oil prices. Thereafter, the krone exchange rate wasfixed. The Norwegian economy had to go through a severe economic turnaround. Confidence in thekrone had to be restored in order to avoid persistent inflation. This required very high interest rates.The Norwegian economy entered the worst recession experienced since the interwar period.Unemployment rose from about 2% in 1987 to almost 6% in the winter of 1992/1993. Manycompanies went broke and households were faced with debt problems. The financial sector was hit bycrisis.The fixed exchange rate regime led to a gradual decline in price inflation, but not to deflation as wasthe case in the 1920s. An improved wage-setting process, in conjunction with an active fiscal policy,contributed to curbing the real economic costs. Hence, the experience of 1986 and the beginning of the
BIS Review 14/200061990s probably provides a realistic picture of the minimal costs associated with stamping out highinflation. At the same time, an active fiscal policy enhanced the credibility of monetary policy becauseit led to lower unemployment than would have been the case otherwise.In Norway, high inflation is a war phenomenon and phenomenon of the 1970s and 1980s. In theaftermath of high inflation, we experienced substantial real economic losses and financial instability.The cost of inflation has been high.History shows that lower unemployment cannot be achieved in exchange for higher inflation in thelong run. A monetary policy that fuels inflation does not generate economic growth. On the contrary,the result is booms and speculative bubbles, which are the precursors of recession and unemployment.In the absence of nominal stability, employment and production will not show stability either. Theeconomy must be endowed with a nominal anchor. This is the task of monetary policy.The Norwegian economy was lacking a nominal anchor during the period of low interest rates anddevaluations in the 1970s and 1980s. This led to rising inflation and instability. From 1986 the fixedexchange rate regime restored confidence in monetary policy and subsequently laid a foundation formore stable economic developments.Chart 8Through the 1990s, inflation has been on a par with or below inflation in Europe. While the averageannual rise in prices was a good 8% in Norway in the 1970s and 1980s, the annual rise in consumerprices has been confined to 2 1/4% in the 1990s. The subdued rate of increase in consumer prices hascoincided with a strong expansion. In 1999, the number of employed was 200,000 higher than in 1990,i.e. an increase of 10%.We had to abandon our fixed exchange rate policy in December 1992, primarily as a result of thesystem’s inherent weaknesses in a world of free flows of capital and deep international financialmarkets. When the fixed exchange rate policy was formally abandoned, there was a risk that theNorwegian economy would again lose its nominal anchor. However, the krone exchange rate showedlittle change and quickly found a new trading range.
7BIS Review 14/2000Chart 9In the first years the krone exchange rate was very stable, also on a daily basis. When we now lookback at developments in the Norwegian foreign exchange market in the 1990s, we see no significantchange in 1992. On the contrary, we witnessed a pronounced shift in January 1997. It was from thispoint in time that daily quotations and month-to-month variations in the exchange rate show that thekrone is floating.Wider fluctuations in the exchange rate have improved the functioning of the options market andforward contracts in Norwegian kroner. At a premium, businesses can hedge against short-termfluctuations in the krone exchange rate. The fluctuations are not greater than in other countries with afloating exchange rate.In 1996 and in the autumn of 1998, Norges Bank attempted to attenuate movements in the kroneexchange rate through exchange market interventions. On both occasions, interventions prompted agame situation between the central bank and market participants, as was also the case during thecurrency crisis in the autumn of 1992. When a central bank trades its own currency, market operatorsmake a play for profits on the premise that the exchange rate does not reflect market fundamentals. Ina world where capital flows freely, this game situation can quickly trigger large capital movements.The experience of the 1990s shows that Norges Bank does not have the instruments to fine-tune thekrone exchange rate.Today’s monetary policyThe objective of monetary policy is exchange rate stability against European currencies, defined as theeuro from 1 January. Norges Bank’s mandate - which is the Exchange Rate Regulation - takes intoaccount that the krone may remain outside its normal range. The Exchange Rate Regulation states that“in the event of significant changes in the exchange rate, monetary policy instruments will be orientedwith a view to returning the exchange rate over time to its initial range”. The concept “significantchanges” is not quantified and must be given an economic content. Norges Bank interprets a“significant” change in the exchange rate as a change that fuels expectations of price and cost inflationto the extent that the change in the exchange rate becomes self-reinforcing.
BIS Review 14/20008Monetary policy can counter such a self-reinforcing movement in the exchange rate by contributing tolow and stable inflation without recession. In its conduct of monetary policy, Norges Bank thereforeplaces emphasis on fulfilling the fundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability against theeuro: monetary policy instruments must be oriented towards bringing inflation down to the level aimedat by the Eurosystem. At the same time, Norges Bank must prevent monetary policy from contributingto a deflationary recession as this may weaken confidence in the krone.The experience of the 1970s and 1980s shows that monetary policy cannot in the long run steercompetitiveness or the size of the exposed sector. If we attempt to do so, monetary policy onlycontributes to instability. Such real economic fundamentals may on the other hand be influencedthrough fiscal policy and cooperation between the social partners. Norges Bank cannot with open eyescontribute to higher inflation or a deflationary recession. This would contribute to an unstable krone.Hence, there is no conflict between gearing monetary policy instruments towards low and stableinflation and the objective of a stable krone exchange rate over time.Although monetary policy cannot be used to steer competitiveness, changes in the krone exchange ratemay provide an early warning of a weakening - or strengthening - of the exposed sector in the tug ofwar for real resources. A successful fiscal policy and a well-functioning wage formation processprovide a sound basis for a stable krone exchange rate. The main difference between Norway andcountries that have adopted an inflation target for monetary policy lies in the interaction betweenmonetary policy and fiscal policy. The oil economy and capital exports through the GovernmentPetroleum Fund are also features that are specific to the Norwegian economy.The most important factor that influences the krone exchange rate is confidence in nominal stability. Ifsuch confidence exists, short-term fluctuations in the krone exchange rate may vary withoutconsequences for the exchange rate level over time. However, confidence depends on a number offactors, such as the authorities’ will to pursue nominal stability. Under the fixed exchange rate regime,we tied ourselves to the mast by stipulating an exchange rate band for the krone. With a floatingexchange rate regime and wider scope for discretion, transparency concerning analyses and policyresponse pattern can contribute to bolstering confidence in the nominal anchor. However, thispresupposed that the announced policy response pattern is actually followed.Fluctuations in domestic activity may induce changes in the exchange rate. For instance, strongdemand for labour could push up wages and weaken competitiveness. If there is confidence in nominalstability, the deterioration in competitiveness may result in an appreciation of the krone in the shortterm. A lack of confidence in nominal stability may result in a depreciation of the krone. Both casesmay entail fluctuations in the exchange rate.A shift in public expenditure growth - or one-sided tax cuts - will have an impact on domestic demand,thus prompting movements in the exchange rate. When fiscal policy is used to smooth fluctuations indomestic demand, it will contribute to a stable exchange rate.International business cycles and financial market unrest may have an impact on the krone exchangerate. Exchange rate variations among major currencies may influence the krone exchange ratemeasured against individual currencies. Over the last year the euro has depreciated against theUS dollar, the yen and pound sterling. The krone has appreciated against the euro. The effectiveexchange rate has been more stable.A situation may arise with a significant shift in economic fundamentals in Norway. A shock of thisnature may be due to a permanent change in growth prospects. This may also imply a permanentchange in the krone exchange rate. Our experience suggests that this seldom occurs. A sharp andsustained shift in oil prices, as witnessed in 1973 and 1986, may imply that the use of oil revenues willhave to change. This may in itself have an impact on the exchange rate.Fiscal policy and the Government Petroleum Fund have proved to be effective in terms of shelteringthe mainland economy from more normal variations in oil revenues. A permanent change in the kroneexchange rate will occur only if there is an increase in the use of oil revenues through a shift inexpenditure growth. In this context, instruments other than those available to Norges Bank must beused to return the krone to its initial range.
9BIS Review 14/2000Interest rates influence the exchange rate through two channels. The interest rate differential againstother currencies has some effect on the exchange rate. The exchange rate is further influenced via theimpact of interest rates on domestic price and cost trends. The isolated effect of the interest ratedifferential on the exchange rate may be of little consequence compared with other factors. Accordingto Norges Bank’s calculations, the current interest rate differential against the euro area impacts thekrone exhange rate in the order of 20 øre against the euro in the short term. On the other hand, theeffect of the interest rate on the exchange rate through the channel of domestic demand and price andwage inflation may in many situations be considerable.The Norwegian economy may be exposed to shocks or disturbances that both reduce domestic activityand weaken the Norwegian krone. In response, interest rates should not be increased. An increase ininterest rates will result in higher unemployment and mounting instability in the domestic economyand the exchange rate. Our economy may also be exposed to disturbances that both increase domesticactivity and strengthen the krone. Interest rates should then not be lowered.In response to the prospect of a downturn in the Norwegian economy, Norges Bank reduced interestrates in the winter of 1999 when the krone was weak against the euro. This contributed to stabilisingthe Norwegian economy and hence also the krone exchange rate. Along the same lines, a situationmay arise with growing pressures in the economy and signs of higher inflation where interest rates willbe increased when the krone is strong in relation to the euro.Chart 10Over the last 15 years, the business cycle in Norway has been desynchronised in relation to cyclicaldevelopments in most European countries. The output gap provides a rough indication of capacityutilisation in the economy. The chart shows a specifically Norwegian upturn in the mid-1980s and asubsequent downturn. While the downturn bottomed out in Norway in 1990, other Europeaneconomies were booming. Subsequently, cyclical developments have remained desynchronised. Thecyclical fluctuations in Norway can to some extent be traced back to the disturbances in theNorwegian economy in the 1980s and the economic shock in Europe in the wake of the fall of theBerlin Wall.The cyclical desynchronisation is the main reason behind the inflation differential between Norwayand euro area countries. The very low rate of inflation in Europe primarily reflects the downturn in the
BIS Review 14/2000101990s. A fundamental precondition for exchange rate stability against the euro is that the inflation ratein Norway is brought down to the level aimed at by the Eurosystem. In recent years, the rate ofincrease in prices has been higher in Norway than among euro area countries, which is reflected in theinterest rate differential between Norway and the euro area.If we were to lower interest rates to the level prevailing in the euro area in the current environment,inflation would rise rapidly in Norway accompanied by exchange rate volatility. Any movements inthe krone exchange rate will be thoroughly analysed by Norges Bank. A policy response patterninvolving automatic changes in interest rates in response to movements in the exchange rate, as a fixedexchange rate regime would imply, is inappropriate.A century of growthChart 11At the turn of the last century GDP per capita was around NOK 20,000 in present-day value. Todaythe average is around NOK 250,000, or about 10 times higher than 100 years ago. For purposes ofcomparison, the increase was barely twofold between 1820 and 1900.Economic growth in Norway was particularly strong in the first 30 years following the Second WorldWar, as a result of the introduction of new technology from the US and new products in Europe.Europe has gradually caught up with the US thanks to the import of technology from the US, effectiverestructuring and the expansion in global trade. This explains why welfare gains have beensubstantially higher in Norway and other European countries than in the US in the postwar period.
11BIS Review 14/2000Chart 12Growth in productivity in mainland Norway was high in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1980 productivitygrowth has been more in line with growth in the US. By then we had reached a high level of income. Itfollows that there was less to gain than earlier from the import of new technology.Chart 13In spite of the boost provided by Norway’s oil resources, there is a difference in income betweenNorway and the US. The income differential is probably to a large extent ascribable to differences in
BIS Review 14/200012working hours and employment. Labour participation is slightly higher in Norway than in the US,while the average working time in Norway is almost 30% below the US average. Many people inNorway work part time. But even a full person-year amounts to a good 10% fewer hours than the USaverage. The income differential primarily reflects that Norwegians have preferred leisure to longworking hours.However, the income level in Norway is high compared with other European countries, which isattributable to Norway’s petroleum revenues and high level of employment. The relatively high levelof income indicates that we have to a large extent closed the technological gap between Norway andthe US. This means that we cannot expect growth rates on a par with that of the 1950s and 1960s,i.e. annual growth rates of up to 5%.A new economyNew technology may be a driving force behind structural changes in the economy and lead to highgrowth rates.Chart 14The trend in the postwar period, with stronger growth in productivity in Norway than in the US, mayhave been reversed. Productivity growth has tended to move on a weaker trend in Norway, whilerising in the US. Both Norway and the US have enjoyed a long period of sustained expansion in the1990s. At this stage, productivity growth tends to be low. Signs of higher growth in the US may thussuggest a new trend.It is probably too early to draw any definite conclusions. We also know that there may be considerablestatistical sources of error. However, the new growth trend is supported by evidence of a moreanecdotal nature. Major changes are taking place in the US business sector through processes such asmergers and acquisitions. There is an exceptionally rich supply of capital in the stock market. The newtechnology companies dominate stock exchange developments. In Europe, Sweden and Finland areleaders in developing new technology environments. Norwegian companies may also be at theforefront of developments in some areas.
13BIS Review 14/2000Securities markets have been a vital force behind these changes. In the course of the last 20 years, arevolution has taken place in global financial markets. Capital restrictions have been removed.Companies around the world are experiencing a wave of mergers, acquisitions and demergers. Thesetransactions reflect a higher required rate of return among all companies and all areas of a business. Atthe same time, there is an increased willingness to take risk, with a soaring number of start-upcompanies. This trend has been particularly evident in the US, but European countries are also part ofthis process.Increased possibilities for using information improves financial markets’ ability to act as a catalyst forprofitable restructuring and growth. Companies financed through equities, bonds and commercialpaper are continuously monitored through a transparent process. Owners and potential investorsfollow company performance closely. There are ever-stricter requirements concerning information. Apoorly performing enterprise can be acquired by others who feel they can either run it more profitablyor use its resources more effectively elsewhere.One may be sceptical with regard to these developments, which seem to have created a situation wherea few keyboard operations can lead to wealth and losses. Financial markets are driven by forces andpsychological mechanisms that may result in extreme volatility. Financial bubbles fuelled byunrealistic optimism may lead to the darkest pessimism and fears. The so-called new economy may bea bubble. The concept “new economy” was first introduced prior to the stock market crash in 1929.The authorities carry a particular responsibility for monitoring financial stability and ensuring that therules of the game are followed.The alternative to open securities funding is bank credit. This type of financing is traditionally basedon a close relationship between banks and borrowers. Banks gain access to extensive informationconcerning the borrower and often exert influence over business decisions.This type of arrangement has long been preferred in many European countries as it was very difficultto obtain adequate information about individual companies and time-consuming to analyse theinformation that was available.This situation has changed with the advent of new information technology. Financial markets are nowmore effective in terms of channelling capital to investments that yield the highest returns.Germany is the country in Europe where banks and borrowers have been the most dependent on eachother. In addition to providing loans, banks have large shareholdings in companies and big companieshave a large stake in private banks. The tax system has locked in this cross-ownership. Owners havehad to pay about 50% in taxes on capital gains on share transactions. The German government hasannounced that this tax will be eliminated from 2001. This is expected to prompt a restructuring, firstin the ownership of German banks and enterprises and subsequently in production.The business sector is dependent on both a smoothly functioning securities market and banks with aclose relationship to borrowers. Small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly dependent on theexpertise and guidance offered by banks. Funding in securities markets is too expensive for thesmallest enterprises.The securities market plays less of a role in Norway compared with other European countries and theUS. The market for equity capital is particularly small in Norway. Norwegian companies often rely onforeign funding for new projects. The thin market for securities capital in Norway may be an obstacleto the development of the business sector.This means that it is essential that the banking system function smoothly.When they function, the strength of financial markets lies in their transparency and adaptability.Capital which is tied up in unprofitable activity can be freed up for other activities. Competition forcapital contributes to creative destruction.
BIS Review 14/200014Chart 15Structural changes also take place within individual companies. One example is NOKIA. Thirty yearsago, the forerunners of the world’s leading producer of cellular telephones were primarily producingtelephone cables, rubber boots and tyres. At that time, the electronics division accounted for 3% ofNOKIA’s turnover and employed 460 persons. However, research and product development led to awider range of products. In 1988 NOKIA was the third largest producer of television sets in Europeand the largest producer of cellular telephone equipment in the Nordic area.NOKIA experienced a deep crisis in the beginning of the 1990s, as did many Finnish companies.NOKIA decided to concentrate on telecommunications. The split-up of the group was initiated fromwithin the company. Non-core activities were spun off and sold. This allowed NOKIA to free upcapital for the most profitable activities of the company. Today the company has more than50,000 employees. At the end of last year, the market value of NOKIA was about NOK 1,700 billion,which is four times the market value of all the companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.The economy needs creative destruction to develop. The tendency may have been for the Norwegianauthorities to provide various types of support to businesses and industries that have existed for sometime. When the government intervenes, the authorities tread a fine line between business developmentand conservation. It is thus important to tread carefully, so that capital and labour are not tied up inless profitable activity.The required rate of return and the need for restructuring in the business sector often conflict with theneed for stability and security for the individual employee. Local communities may suffer. The answeris not to oppose restructuring. The best solution is to develop and take advantage of skills andexpertise. This also requires extensive adaptability and labour mobility.The welfare stateThe restructuring that we are facing in the Norwegian public sector is hardly of less significance thanthe changes in the business sector. During the last decades the Norwegian welfare state has expanded
15BIS Review 14/2000rapidly. Household income and consumption have also shown steady and strong growth. We have alsowitnessed a sharp expansion in the production of services in both the public and private sector.Chart 16Employment growth in the service industries increased while declining in primary industries andmanufacturing, with a redistribution of real resources between sectors. The transfer is the result of asteeper increase in demand for services than for goods when income rises.Taxes were increased to finance the expansion of the welfare state. Excluding the petroleum sector, thetax level has increased from 41% of mainland GDP in 1970 to around 48% today.Chart 17The tax burden in mainland Norway is among the highest in the OECD countries. Only Sweden andDenmark have a higher tax burden. There are many reasons why further tax increases would put the
BIS Review 14/200016Norwegian welfare state in jeopardy. Tax competition among countries is intensifying. Severalcountries have attracted new business by reducing taxes. Enterprises, capital and labour choose theirlocation based on tax considerations.In principle, it is conceivable that higher taxes only affect the household sector, so that the businesssector is not exposed to a heavy tax burden. However, it is difficult to find direct or indirect taxes thatdo not also affect the business sector. Higher direct and indirect taxes may lead to demands for higherincome, which will be easier to achieve the tighter the labour market is. However, companies exposedto strong international competition have limited scope for passing on higher costs to households.A high tax level is particularly dependent on an efficient tax system. High tax rates promote taxplanning and hamper the growth capacity of an economy. Low, broad-based tax rates are preferable tohigh tax rates with a narrow base. Norway made headway with the tax reform of 1992. There is stillroom for considerable improvement in the Norwegian system.Many public services are of considerable economic importance. Infrastructure, education, soundlegislation and a solid judicial system are necessary for the economy to function and grow. Publicservices may be important in order to secure equality and security. At the same time, the public sectoris so large that it affects the economy at large. This means that requirements concerning efficiency andadaptability must also apply to the public sector.Chart 18Over a twenty year period, the number of employed in the health, care and education sectors increasedby 240,000, which account for about 60% of the increase in overall employment in Norway. Thenumber of employed in the health and care sector has more than doubled in 20 years. More people arenow working in this sector than in the whole of manufacturing.Nevertheless, every day we receive reports of personnel shortages at hospitals, in elderly care or atschools. The authorities constantly signal increases in appropriations in order to remedy theseproblems. Norway imports labour from other countries to cover its resource shortages. What are thereasons behind this situation?
17BIS Review 14/2000Chart 19Demand for health and care services rises sharply when incomes increase. The chart shows income onthe horizontal axis, and health expenditure on the vertical axis. Norwegian health service expenditureis on a par with or higher than in that of other western countries, with the exception of the US,Germany and Switzerland. However, as a percentage of income, health expenditure in Norway is stillnot particularly high.A further reason for the situation outlined above might be the composition of the population. We knowthat in a few years health expenditure will rise sharply because of an ageing population. However,current demographic trends do not indicate particularly strong pressures.The challenges will increase considerably in the years ahead. Continued growth in incomes and anageing population will boost demand for health and care services. Moreover, it will be possible tooffer services and forms of treatment that are not available today.All this has to be provided for within tight personnel and budget constraints. The increase in socialsecurity expenditure on pensions will lay claim to a steadily increasing share of overall centralgovernment expenditure. Even with sizeable government financial assets, these resources willprimarily be used to finance the increase in pension expenditure associated with the ageing of thepopulation. Taxes cannot be increased unaccompanied by a weakening of the position of the businesssector. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to base policy decisions on the assumption that growth inpublic expenditure items other than pensions can exceed GDP growth.Allow me to illustrate this. The chart shows Norges Bank’s estimate for public purchase of health andcare services. The estimate is based on the assumption that the public sector will finance the sameshare of public services as today. The source for the estimate for public consumption is theGovernment’s Long-Term Programme, and the estimate is, among other things, based on unchangedtax rates.The fundamental problem is that demand for health and care services is growing faster than taxrevenues. There will be a limit on the extent to which the state can reduce appropriations for otherimportant social objectives such as education, research and the judicial system. Something has to give.
BIS Review 14/200018Chart 20Even after all the structural changes of recent years, there is probably still room for efficiency gains inthe health and care sector. However, this is hardly sufficient to fully address the challenges. Users maytherefore have to finance a substantially greater share of these services, whether the services areprovided by public or private operators. There are limits to the extent to which the public sector shouldand can impose user fees without creating unacceptable distributional effects. A private insurancesystem is not a fail-proof solution.It seems obvious that there is a need for a clearer definition of the public sector’s core activities in thehealth and care sector, and in other areas. There is a need for delimiting what the public sector shouldfinance based on tax revenues.The main challengeAt this time last year, oil prices stood at USD 10 a barrel. The Norwegian economy had experienced aturnaround, with a risk of a deflationary recession. Indeed, this particular risk now would seem lessprominent. Oil prices have risen to almost USD 30 a barrel. The period of sluggish growth nowappears to be transient. European economies are expanding while the US economy is still booming.Even after a year of slower growth, economic activity in Norway is still high.Over the last decade, inflation has been subdued in Norway. The economy has expanded at a rapidpace and the business sector and public enterprises have created new jobs. Technology and thecompetition for capital are engendering structural changes, unrest and uncertainty, but also provideopportunities for renewed growth. At the same time, the stock market shows some features that mayprove to be a source of future instability.Economic policy must draw on the lessons of the boom and bust cycles of the past. The mostimportant task of monetary policy is to secure a nominal anchor for the economy. Fiscal policy andmonetary policy must be complementary. Fiscal policy determines the distribution of labour and otherreal resources between the business sector and public sector activity - between exposed and shelteredindustries.
19BIS Review 14/2000Norway’s state finances are solid and will be further strengthened in the years ahead. However,government savings will hardly exceed the requisite level implied by pension expenditure over thenext decades. Considerations relating to the business sector and the supply of labour set limits on howfast the public sector can expand. Given the current structure and pricing of public services - and themany tasks assumed by the public sector - it will become increasingly difficult as each year goes by tomake ends meet in both central and local government budgets in an environment of growing demandsand expectations. This probably represents the greatest challenge to economic policy in the yearsahead.
1BIS Review 13/2000Mr Bäckström reports on the Swedish economy and monetary policySpeech given by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Boardof Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, to the FöreningsSparbanken, inMalmö on 16 February 2000.*      *      *The repo rate increasesIn order to understand why the Riksbank has raised the repo rate in two steps from 2.90% lastNovember to 3.75% less than a fortnight ago, it is necessary to consider the situation in 1998. Themood at that time, in the global economy as well as in Sweden, was coloured by the Asian crisis, thesuspension of Russian payments, the problems with the hedge fund Long Term Capital Managementand falling stock-market prices.It was considered that in addition to direct problems, the financial crisis in the autumn of 1998 wouldhave negative effects on real economic activity. Forecasters altered their assessments and the prospectsfor global output and inflation were revised downwards. Central banks around the world did likewiseand the Riksbank was no exception. Instrumental rates were reduced in many countries. Between theearly summer of 1998 and the spring of 1999 the Riksbank cut the repo rate by a total of 150 basispoints, bringing it down from 4.40 to 2.90%.The actions of central banks probably mitigated effects of the various shocks. They helped to checkthe signs of panicky behaviour in the market and then to restore a more optimistic assessment of thefuture. At the same time, the process displayed some ability to heal itself. All this has contributed to arapid recovery in the global economy as well as in Sweden.The current picture of many economies is thus very different from the uneasy situation that prevailedduring 1998 and the early part of 1999. Global growth prospects are appreciably better and the risksconnected with inflation have changed. That is also why instrumental rates were adjusted upwards bymany central banks last autumn and early this year.In principle it can be said that inflationary pressure follows a cyclical pattern. When economic activityis strong, demand growth tends to exceed the expansion of capacity and this normally leads in time toan accelerating rate of price and wage increases. Conversely, weak demand may lead to the prospectof inflation being below the target one to two years ahead. As a rule, the repo rate should be raised inthe former case and lowered in the latter. In this way, the repo rate varies with the business cycle sothat the rate of inflation remains more or less continuously in line with the target.So, as rising economic activity successively reduces the degree of unutilised resources in the economy,the repo rate has to be increased. That is the process the Riksbank has initiated with the increases sincelast autumn.From what I have said it follows that there should be a repo rate that is commensurate with stableinflation and a demand growth that matches the expansion of capacity while the economy is alsobalanced in other respects. It is around this level of interest rates that the actual repo rate ought to bevaried as activity moves up and down. So what is the Swedish economy’s sustainable growth rate andwhat is the commensurate repo rate?The Swedish economy’s sustainable growth rateA simple way of estimating the potential growth rate is to add the figure for the trend rate of increasein labour supply to the growth rate for labour productivity.
BIS Review 13/20002The latest figures, based among other things on demographic changes and labour force participation,point to an annual increase in labour supply up to 2008 of 0.5%.1 As regards labour productivity, mostof the evidence suggests that the trend in the 1990s was higher than in the 1970s and 1980s. In theperiod 1974-93, for example, the annual increase in labour productivity averaged approximately 1.4%,while the average since 1994 is about 1.9%. It is admittedly true that as the economy has been in anupward phase since the summer of 1993, it is hardly surprising that productivity growth is above thetrend; but a comparison with the corresponding upward phase in the 1980s leads to the sameconclusion: the rate of increase in labour productivity appears to be approximately half of a percentagepoint higher than before. This accordingly means that the Swedish economy’s potential annual growthrate is between 2 and 2.5%. It may be asked, however, whether one can simply project productivity’shistorical path.This is where the discussion of what is known as the New Economy comes in. Productivity growth inthe United States has risen appreciably in recent years. The investment boom in the 1990s has beenone factor here; corporate investment has almost doubled since 1990 and a very large share has goneinto new information technology. This has led to what the economic jargon refers to as capitaldeepening, which amounts to a higher capital input per employee. A notable feature of the picture isthus that the new information technology seems to be having knock-on effects in the form of enhancedproductivity in other segments of the US economy. Many observers therefore consider that theAmerican economy is now capable of expanding at a rate of 3-3.5% without encountering shortagesand an acceleration of inflation.A similar change could well occur in other countries that reap the new information technology’spotential benefits. But it cannot yet be said that productivity growth in the Swedish economy hasimproved to the same extent. Neither have we registered a similar growth of investment, which couldthen be a leading indicator that the new technology is being introduced on a wide front. In the 1990sthe stock of corporate capital, for example, grew twice as fast in the United States as it did in Sweden.It is certainly conceivable that the high level of the Stockholm stock exchange represents expectationsthat productivity growth will also move up in Sweden. The sum of the values of individual companiescan serve as a yardstick of what is expected of the stock market as a whole and this presumablyreflects expectations of how the total economy will develop. And if current share prices are regardedas reasonable, there will clearly have to be an appreciable increase in future profits. This can then beinterpreted as expectations of an overall improvement in productivity growth and thus of a higherpotential output. An alternative interpretation could be that the stock market is at least partiallyover-valued. A third possibility is, of course, that the development of share prices is explained by acombination of these two factors.It still seems too hazardous, however, to assume that potential growth in Sweden has moved uptowards the level in the United States. It is possible - perhaps even probable - that similar supplyfactors will emerge in the future and the Riksbank must be alert to this. But it seems safest at presentto count on a potential annual GDP growth rate of between 2 and 2.5%.Growth can be temporarily higherWhen the labour force is not being fully utilised, the increase in employment can exceed the trend rateof about 0.5%. In a transitional period the economy can then grow faster than its potential rate in thelonger run.Unemployment in Sweden is still historically high. That might suggest that the labour market hasplenty of unutilised resources at its disposal. Some bottleneck problems are already showing up,1See LU 1999/2000 Bilaga 1 (Medium Term Survey 1999/2000, Annex 1, Population, labour force and employment),Ministry of Finance.
3BIS Review 13/2000however, and are an indication that there is only a limited number of persons with the appropriatetraining and occupational experience for the jobs that are available.Moreover, statistics from the National Labour Market Board show that the number of unfilledvacancies at employment offices has risen to the highest level since 1990 and business tendency datafrom the National Institute of Economic Research reveal that certain sectors are now finding it difficultto recruit labour with the required training and occupational experience. The problems are accentuatedby the fact that a large part of the increased production and hence the expansion of employment isconcentrated to the metropolitan regions and other university cities. This means that bottleneckproblems are starting to impede the growth of production and employment. The infrastructure in awide sense in the metropolitan areas, perhaps in the Stockholm area in particular, may affect thepossibilities of continuing to benefit from the existing demand. The rapid price rise for houses andtenant-owned flats in the Stockholm area is a clear illustration of certain supply-side problems.Another sign is the shortage of rented dwellings, or rather the lack of mobility in this market.Thus it is not only labour demand that will determine the future development of unemployment. Agrowing part will be played by supply-side factors in the form of occupational and geographicalmobility.So while it can be concluded that in the near future the Swedish economy’s growth rate may becapable of topping the potential level of - as I just indicated - between 2 and 2.5%, this applies only foras long as there is a supply of labour with the appropriate training and occupational experience and thepossibility of being geographically available.According to the most recent national accounts, published just before Christmas, GDP growth in thefirst three quarters of 1999 was over 3.5%. The fourth quarter outcome is still difficult to estimateprecisely but demand growth seems, if anything, to have accelerated. An unusually good Christmasseason appears to have resulted in a strong trend for private consumption, for example. A continuationof the strong development is suggested, moreover, by such leading indicators as household confidence,a high increase in the money supply and rapidly rising asset prices.This implies that sooner or later, if nothing were done, the rapid growth at present would lead tooverheating and an acceleration of inflation. One factor behind the current trend has been monetarypolicy’s stimulatory direction ever since the repo rate cuts that were initiated in 1998. This illustratesthat over a complete business cycle, the repo rate of 2.90% that applied up to last November is toolow. GDP growth at the current rate of 3.5-4% implies an expansion of demand that clearly exceedsthe rate of 2-2.5% that the economy can cope with in the longer run. It is only feasible in a limited,transitional period, that is, for as long as there is a supply of labour for the available jobs.The repo rate hike may not suffice; inflation prospects set the paceAs monetary policy works rather like the helm of an oil tanker - it takes rather a long time to shift theeconomy onto a new course - it was necessary to make the adjustment to a more neutral monetarystance. Thus, GDP growth will continue at a higher rate for some time to come and then, after perhapsone to two years, successively slacken towards the economy’s long-term potential.The task the Riksbank is endeavouring to perform is to achieve an economic transition from a fairlynormal upward phase to a growth trend that is more sustainable. This task, which is not simple,follows implicitly from our statutory function of “maintaining price stability”. As I mentioned earlier,a low and stable rate of inflation normally means that the economy is continuing to expand inaccordance with its long-term potential.One cannot be certain, however, that the repo rate hike since November will suffice to bring aboutsuch an adjustment of the path for economic growth. The impact on demand from monetary policy isprobably still stimulatory. But the repo rate that represents a more neutral monetary policy impactcannot be specified exactly. We simply do not know enough about this. Besides which, the levelprobably varies over time.
BIS Review 13/20004Empirical guidance can be derived from countries that are ahead of Sweden in the business cycle. Theaction of the US Federal Reserve, for example, illustrates the economic advantage of aforward-looking approach that raises the interest rate for a gradual reduction of monetary stimulation.The Fed began a series of increases in the instrumental rate in February 1994, from a level of 3%, andthen adjusted the rate within a more normal range of 4.5-6%. This served to prevent an acceleration ofinflation without plunging the economy into a recession. On the contrary, the US economy is nowexperiencing the post-war era’s longest upward phase. While other factors besides monetary policyhave, of course, contributed to this, the American example does show that a judicious upwardadjustment of the interest rate definitely can contribute to good economic effects provided thesustainability of growth is also taken into account.I do not cite the case of the United States to imply that the Riksbank has already decided to makefurther rapid interest rate increases in the near future. That is not how we work. Those who followwhat we do know that the foundation for monetary policy measures is our inflation forecast.At the time of the latest repo rate increase the Riksbank’s Executive Board judged that inflation isrising only moderately and will be approximately in line with the target in one to two years’ time. Itmust be borne in mind, of course, that new information may alter our assessment and that our timehorizon in the upward phase is moving ahead. In the short perspective, however, things look a littledifferent. The rate of inflation may actually tend to slacken this spring, partly due to effects of thederegulation of telecommunications. But as I said, the perspective for monetary policy lies furtherahead.Forecasting is difficultThe difficulty for the Riksbank lies in constructing forecasts for the period - usually one to two yearsahead - that is generally regarded as the time lag before an interest rate adjustment has its full effect.Anyone with some experience of forecasting knows how difficult this can be and is aware thatforecasts not infrequently miss the mark. We could in fact attach more importance to the current asopposed to the forecast future rate of inflation but that would probably call for rather large repo rateadjustments in order to keep inflation stable around the target. Such an approach would result in sharpfluctuations in real economic activity, which would naturally not be desirable.Are there any developments which suggest that the time lag for effects of interest rate adjustmentsmay be becoming shorter? More and more home owners are switching from fixed to variable mortgagerates, which may indeed tend to speed up the impact of monetary measures. But there are other factorswhich may be working in the opposite direction, towards a longer time lag. One example is the costsinvolved in altering prices. One of the benefits of low and stable inflation is precisely that it facilitatescontracts with a longer duration. Insofar as the establishment of a low-inflation regime has led to pricemovements being more restrained for this reason, it follows that it will take longer for monetary policymeasures to impinge on prices. For monetary policy’s time horizon, there are therefore arguments inboth directions.The problem of faulty forecasts is limited, however, in that monetary policy is implementedcontinuously. Moreover, current information about economic tendencies can be accorded more weightthan events that lie further ahead and the forecasts can be revised as time passes. And when the reporate is comparatively far from a more neutral monetary stance, monetary policy can be adjusted inlarger steps than when the rate is closer.Thus, there are various ways of making up for the fact that economic forecasts beyond the short termnot infrequently miss the mark and still allow for the circumstance that it takes a comparatively longtime for the full effect of monetary measures to materialise.ConclusionI should like to conclude by saying that while we all know that the Riksbank’s main concern is thefuture path of inflation in the Swedish economy, our deliberations about how to hold inflation at a
5BIS Review 13/2000stable level around the 2% target can just as well be seen as the Riksbank’s endeavour, by means ofthe repo rate, to contribute to a continuation of the Swedish economy’s favourable trend. In manysituations our statutory duty - the maintenance of price stability - is fully commensurate with therequirement that the Riksbank helps to make the development of production and employment in theSwedish economy as stable as possible.
1BIS Review 23/2000Mr Macfarlane: Opening address to theEuromoney Australasian Capital Markets ForumOpening address by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the EuromoneyAustralasian Capital Markets Forum, held in Sydney on 14 March 2000.*      *      *I would like to start by thanking Mr Brady for his introductory remarks, and to say that, in our view,Euromoney made a very sensible choice in scheduling a Capital Markets Forum in Sydney. Itrecognises the significance and growth potential of our capital markets, and the generally improvedprospects for this region. I see a very impressive list of speakers and participants before me and I amsure there will be a lot of fruitful discussion over the next two days.The timing of the Conference is interesting in that it comes at a time when we can safely say that theAsian crisis is behind us and that, with a couple of exceptions, the outlook for this region is good.Perhaps it was Australia’s success in withstanding the contractionary effects of this crisis thatencouraged Euromoney to hold its Conference here at this time. Whether that is the case or not, Iwould like to take the Asian crisis and its spillover to other emerging markets as the starting point formy comments this morning.I do not wish to go over the macro-economic issues because I have already done this before. I wouldinstead like to ask what did we learn from this crisis that was of immediate relevance to capitalmarkets? What are the implications for developed economies such as Australia?My answer to the first question is that we learnt that, for a country to play in the international financialmarket place, it needs a very sound financial infrastructure. I do not wish to suggest that it was thelack of this which caused the Asian crisis (the cause lay elsewhere), but it was this deficiency whichmade the crisis so deep when it occurred.By financial infrastructure, I mean:• the body of commercial law which covers everything from the concept of limited liability tobankruptcy provisions;• the conditions under which entities can issue debt and equity;• the body of competition law, trade practices law and securities regulation which ensuresarm’s length dealing and limits related party transactions;• the supervision of the banking system, including regulation of near banks such as financecompanies and merchant banks;• the provision of a safe payments system;• the application of sound accounting standards;• the existence of a court system which is capable of timely resolution of disputes and whichhas the confidence of local and foreign participants.This is quite a demanding list for several reasons. First, it is quite broad and involves the legal system,the Government, regulatory bodies, financial market participants and the professions. Secondly, andmore importantly in my view, the achievement of a high standard in each of the items on this list takesa very long time. In our case, some of these things took a century to achieve. In many cases, we lookback to periods as recent as the 1980s and wonder why we ever thought that we had done enough.That is one of the reasons I have been sympathetic to our Asian neighbours. It is inevitable that at anearly stage of development of a country, its financial infrastructure will be only partly formed.
BIS Review 23/20002Furthermore, even with the best will in the world, it is going to take time to bring these things up toscratch.When people say that the recent financial and economic instability was the inevitable result of acombination of the free flow of international capital plus inadequate financial infrastructure, there ismuch truth in the statement. But if that is the case, we cannot expect a sudden return to stabilitybecause the second essential component - the adequate financial infrastructure - will take years, orpossibly decades - to achieve.The second thing we learnt from the Asian crisis, and its spread to other countries, was the necessity ofhaving deep and liquid financial markets. We also learnt it was an advantage to have a floatingexchange rate, and to have a capital market that was diversified and not one that was too dependent onthe commercial banking sector.This brings me to the Australian financial system, to the capital markets and to financial markets moregenerally. The Australian financial system has developed rapidly over the past 20 years or so, withderegulation being a major driver of change. Deregulation started in the late 1970s with the gradualremoval of controls over bank interest rates. It picked up speed in the early 1980s with the removal ofother controls on banks, freeing up interest rates on government securities (by adopting tenderarrangements for new issues), floating the exchange rate and opening up the banking system, in themid 1980s, to foreign competition. Shortly thereafter, bank supervision was formalised, and the Baselframework for capital adequacy of banks was adopted in 1988.The development of the financial markets in Australia is not, of course, the result purely of regulatorychange. Financial institutions themselves have taken the opportunity to develop new markets andintroduce new products. For example, in 1979 the Sydney Futures Exchange was the first derivativesmarket outside of the United States to introduce a contract based on a financial instrument when itintroduced the futures contract on 90-day bills.Australian financial markets have become larger and more diverse over time and are now regarded asboth sophisticated and deep. Turnover in the major Australian markets - the foreign exchange, money,equity and derivatives markets - has grown at average rates of more than 20% a year sincederegulation. The exception to this rule is the market for government securities, which has grownmore slowly than other markets in recent years because of the Government’s run of budget surpluses.The relatively even pattern of development in Australia reflects both a lack of regulatory distortions orincentives, and the fact that, unlike the entrepot markets in Singapore and Hong Kong, Australianfinancial markets have a reasonably large domestic economy to serve.As in most countries, the foreign exchange market has the largest turnover, with about $75 billion aday, a little over half of which involves the Australian dollar. The Australian foreign exchange marketis the ninth largest in the world and the Australian dollar is the seventh most actively traded,marginally behind the Canadian dollar. To put this in perspective, Australia ranks as the 14th largesteconomy in the world, so the Australian dollar trades more actively than might be expected given thesize of the economy. Its relatively high position globally reflects the place the Australian dollar holdsin portfolios of international funds managers because of the opportunities for diversification it affords.The standing of the Australian dollar as a world currency is recognised by its inclusion in the firstwave of seven currencies in the CLS System or Continuous Linked Settlement System for foreignexchange settlement which is scheduled to come into operation in 2001. The other currencies are theUS dollar, euro, yen, Swiss franc, pound and Canadian dollar. Australia’s position in world financialmarkets was reinforced recently when it was one of four “significant financial centres” invited to jointhe G7 countries in the Financial Stability Forum, an inter-governmental group which monitors risksin the international financial system. As a “systemically significant economy”, Australia is also amember of the G20, which has been charged with broadening the dialogue on key economic andfinancial policy issues globally.A major gap in the development of Australian markets until recently was the domesticnon-government bond market. This market, however, has recently grown strongly, representing furtherwelcome diversification for borrowers and lenders. With non-government bonds on issue now
3BIS Review 23/2000totalling about $66 billion, this market is now about as large as the market for CommonwealthGovernment securities. This development is beginning to produce a “credit curve” in Australia. Nowthat bond yields in Australia have moved lower on the back of low inflation in recent years, theincremental pick-up for taking credit risk probably looks more attractive to investors than it mighthave a decade ago when bond yields were perennially double-digit numbers.The financial infrastructure in Australia has evolved to accommodate this growth of financial activity.Practitioners and the authorities have worked together to ensure that the “plumbing” kept pace withthe system it was serving. In the case of payments and settlements systems, Austraclear and theReserve Bank’s RITS system, which introduced delivery-versus-payment, and then the ASX’s CHESSsystem for equities were important steps forward. Our systems meet the highest internationalstandards, as specified by the Group of 30. They have been inter-linked through the RTGS system toprovide a very efficient payments and settlements infrastructure. Australia’s RTGS system is amongthe most advanced in the world because of the way it closely links to securities settlements, giving it avery high coverage of high-value transactions.We have already witnessed a major reorganisation of our financial regulatory agencies with theformation of APRA and changing responsibilities for the RBA and ASIC. The reform process is, ofcourse, ongoing. The main item on the agenda at present is the so-called CLERP initiative - CorporateLaw Economic Reform Program - which aims to achieve best practice in fields such as accountingstandards, disclosure, corporate governance, and takeover law. It also aims to facilitate the applicationof technology to the conduct of business and promote competition in financial markets, including ininvestment products.The expansion of financial activity in Australia has not been confined to market trading. Holdings offinancial assets in general have expanded rapidly. In the early 1980s, holdings of financial assets wereabout the same size as GDP; these days, they are about 2 1/2 times the size of the economy.The development of financial markets and the financial system has not benefited only the “big end oftown” - if anything, the system has become more “democratic”. One measure of this is the spread ofownership of equity, with share ownership by individuals increasing sharply in Australia in the 1990s.The Australian Stock Exchange estimates that 54% of adult Australians now hold shares directly(including through personally managed superannuation funds); in 1991, this figure was 22%. Thistrend reflects the programs of privatisation and demutualisation in Australia in the 1990s. Anothermeasure of the “democratising” of the financial system is that practically all permanent employeesnow receive privately funded superannuation benefits, compared with less than half a decade ago. It isthe investment of these funds which has provided such an important stimulus to the growth of thefunds management industry over the past decade and a half.It is growth in the size and diversity of financial markets that makes life rewarding and profitable formarket participants like yourselves. But from my perspective, the size, and particularly the diversity,of financial markets are also important. Representing an institution that is responsible not only formonetary policy, but also for financial stability more generally, I am conscious of the value of a strongand diverse set of financial markets and institutions.To illustrate this point, I want to conclude with a few words from Alan Greenspan. In a speech lastSeptember on Lessons from the Global Crisis, he went over the experience of a number of countriesand attempted to draw some conclusions, which are of relevance to what I have been discussing. In hisview (and I will quote):“The mere existence of a diversified financial system may well insulate all aspects of a financialsystem from breakdown. Australia serves as an interesting test case in the most recent Asian financialturmoil. Despite its close trade and financial ties to Asia, the Australian economy exhibited few signsof contagion from contiguous economies, arguably because Australia already had well-developedcapital markets as well as a sturdy banking system. But going further, it is plausible that dividends offinancial diversity extend to more normal times as well.”On that note, I will conclude and wish you all well for a fruitful and stimulating Conference.
1BIS Review 23/2000Mr Yam on Europe and the euro: the view from AsiaSpeech by Mr Joseph C K Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at theXII International Frankfurt Banking Evening, on 14 March 2000.*      *      *IntroductionMayor Roth, President Welteke, President Duisenberg, Governors, Excellencies, Ladies andGentlemen,There can be few things more irritating than foreigners coming to your country and lecturing you onhow much better things might be for you if only they were in charge. In my particular experience as acentral banker there is no shortage of gratuitous advice on how one’s monetary and exchange ratepolicies might better be conducted. Of course, I have encountered a number of visiting bankers,businessmen and academics coming to Hong Kong who are particularly well informed, who havethought carefully through the issues, and whose advice is consequently much to be valued. But I fearthat they may be in the minority. So, I certainly feel a bit awkward standing here. I don’t considermyself to be an expert in matters relating to the European economy or the euro, so I beg yourforgiveness right from the start. My only defence is that you did actually invite me, so what I have tosay is not entirely unsolicited.This speech is going to be largely about perceptions, or rather misperceptions, and how they maycontrast with reality. Why? As I said, I am not an expert on the euro. But I can certainly tell you a lotabout how it is perceived from my part of the world. And when it comes to the behaviour of financialmarkets we all know that perception is as important as reality.Perception and reality - Hong KongAllow me to illustrate this point by starting first with Hong Kong, for I cannot resist the temptation totake advantage of this opportunity to do a bit of advertising. I would like to describe some of thenegative perceptions which financial markets and analysts have had about Hong Kong over the lastfew years, and how these have compared with actual developments.First was the belief that Hong Kong’s fixed exchange rate with the US dollar would not survive theAsian economic crisis. The reality is that it has survived, and the Hong Kong economy has nowrebounded strongly, with the year-on-year growth rate of GDP for the fourth quarter of last yearrecording 8.7% and the forecast for the year 2000 now put at 5%. What the doomsters refused torecognise, despite the compelling evidence of the preceding one-and-a-half decades of the same fixedexchange rate system, was that Hong Kong has a highly flexible internal cost-price structure, whichcan quite quickly deliver the same external relative price adjustment as a currency devaluation.Although the time profile of the adjustment process is different, as is the degree of short-term paininvolved, internal adjustment arguably leaves the economy leaner and fitter than it would if everyonecould simply depend on depreciation to see them right.The second flawed perception was that the intervention by the authorities in the stock market inAugust 1998 represented a fundamental reversal of traditional non-interventionist policy. The mistakehere was to fall into the trap of characterising Hong Kong as a place where the authorities neverintervened. We have always made clear our preparedness to intervene for such purposes as promotingefficiency in the market economy, providing infrastructure, or providing necessary support for themost needy in society. But our emphasis has always been to keep intervention to the minimum. Thismay sound uncontroversial today; indeed, it is probably an attitude shared by most governments,including those here in Europe. But you should remember that when Hong Kong was first vigorouslyespousing this doctrine, perhaps 30 or 40 years ago, the vogue in most western countries was for the
BIS Review 23/20002state to assume an expanding role in the economy. In keeping with Hong Kong’s principles, the stockmarket intervention in 1998 was specifically directed towards improving the operation of the marketeconomy rather than perverting it: it was designed to frustrate market manipulation that wouldotherwise have led to serious market dislocation.A third example of perceptions being at variance with reality was the prediction that the MainlandChinese currency, the renminbi, would be devalued during 1999 and that the Hong Kong dollar wouldinevitably be swept down with it. It is true that the economic performance of the Mainland was for atime moving in a manner such that devaluation could have been judged a not unreasonable option. Butthose who predicted such an event tended to give insufficient attention to the fact that the renminbi isnot a convertible currency, that the prevailing external position was strong, and that the authorities hadmade it clear that they were not contemplating devaluation.The read-across to the Hong Kong dollar required an even greater leap of the imagination. Ourexchange rate had never been dislodged from its peg by previous depreciations of the Mainland’scurrency, which have amounted cumulatively to some 75% over the period since the establishment ofour peg in 1983. Moreover, any reasons for expecting a devaluation of the renminbi to have aknock-on effect on the Hong Kong dollar because of competitiveness considerations are weaker nowthan before, because Hong Kong has evolved much more as a complementary economy to theMainland of China than as a competitor.As a final example I might mention the various misperceptions which people have had more generallyabout the relationship between Hong Kong and the Mainland of China, which have perhaps causedsome volatility in financial market sentiment towards Hong Kong. I say “have” advisedly, rather than“do”, because, now that we are in our third year of “One Country, Two Systems”, I am pleased to findthat the number of foreigners that I encounter who still seriously misunderstand our system hasdwindled away. I would not anyway criticise those who did, or still do, have mistaken understandingsof Hong Kong’s constitutional position. After all, Hong Kong is a small territory, a third of the wayround the globe from here, and it would be conceited to assume that everybody should know theintimate details of our situation.Anyway, for the avoidance of doubt, let me tell you that Hong Kong enjoys complete constitutionalautonomy in its monetary and financial policies. And I can assure you that this autonomy has beenfully respected by the Mainland authorities. They are, indeed, as anxious as I am to preserve a stableand prosperous financial environment in Hong Kong.I hope you will forgive me for spending all this time talking about Hong Kong and its currency ratherthan about the euro. I have done so with a purpose, namely to illustrate the extent to which observersmay often be mistaken about the direction of policy or the status of a currency. This is the source ofmuch frustration to those of us trying to preserve financial and monetary stability. But we do have theconsolation of knowing that there is a good chance that those who have perpetrated or adopted thosemisperceptions may have lost a lot of money as a result - if they were brave enough to put their moneywhere their mouth was.Perceptions of the euroI shall turn now to the euro.I would be deceiving you if I said that the euro, as seen from Hong Kong, enjoyed a particularlypositive image at present. Arguably one could expect no better for a currency which has lost around18% of its external value in little over a year, regardless of whether this was judged to be the result ofthe strength of the US dollar rather than any intrinsic weakness of the euro itself. It is worth noting,however, that the euro was launched at a time when the Euroland currencies were particularly firmagainst the dollar - having climbed, in the case of the Deutsche mark, by almost 50% since its lowpoint in 1985. Against this background, and the widening of interest differentials in favour of thedollar in recent months, the direction of the euro’s movement is, with hindsight, hardly surprising.
3BIS Review 23/2000The depreciation of the euro is of course a fact, and it is perhaps the only concrete basis for thescepticism that one hears being expressed about the euro. But, from what I gather as an observer fromafar, there are a number of other factors, less tangible, which also contribute to that scepticism. I shallgo through some of them with you, noting once again that perception from many miles away mayindeed be quite different from reality.The first factor concerns structural rigidities, which appear to observers from my side of the world tobe more serious in Euroland than in many other economies, big and small. The severity of thesestructural rigidities is seen to be undermining the ability and the efficiency with which Euroland canrespond to change. Of course, we recognise that some loss of adaptability may be the price that has tobe paid for a relatively stable society and a comfortable social safety net, and that the trade-off haseffectively been arrived at through a democratic process. But it is hard to believe, as an outsider, thatthe trade-off is an optimal one. I cannot imagine, for example, what goal of social stability couldjustify labour market and social security arrangements that deliver an unemployment rate of doubledigits; or contribute to delaying, if not preventing, the arrival of the “new economy” in Euroland. Iunderstand that some still do not believe that there can be a new economy, in which the technologicalrevolution enables productivity gains that are capable of sustaining a much higher rate ofnon-inflationary growth. Of course, we should always question and critically examine any unusualphenomena, rather than embrace them blindly. But, meanwhile, investors are putting their moneywhere this unusual phenomenon is allowed, by structural flexibility, to be manifested in full force,notably in the United States. This is seen to be a factor contributing to the strengthening of the dollarand the weakening of the euro, and reinforcing the scepticism about the euro.One thing that we have learned from the Asian financial turmoil is that global financial markets, madehighly efficient by financial liberalisation and the advance of information technology, have becomerather intolerant about policy mistakes. Strengths as well as weaknesses are magnified in financialmarket behaviour to a disproportionate degree as a result of the explosion of international finance.What until recently were considered to be small aberrations in policy can now be brutally punished bythe market. Even those who have been particularly prudent can be tossed around rudely, as marketsentiment sways and, occasionally, succumbs to manipulative forces. So far, the emerging marketshave been the ones affected, overwhelmed by international finance, perhaps to an unjustifiable degreerelative to their economic fundamentals. Although they found the situation difficult to cope with at thetime, most of them pulled through and are now recovering strongly. The one common quality that theypossess, which is responsible for this rapid turn-around, is structural flexibility. The explosion ofinternational finance is poised to continue, after the current lull, and will be made even more potent byfurther advances in information technology. Euroland is, of course, much bigger and moresophisticated than the emerging markets in Asia, and so the risk of Euroland being similarlyoverwhelmed by international finance is distinctly lower. But, seen from Asia, even for the large andsophisticated markets, the risk is not so low that it can be safely ignored. And if problems materialise,structural rigidities that inhibit adjustment may exacerbate and prolong the pain and disruption.I sense also that there are still doubts about whether Euroland will cope well with the discipline ofadjustment imposed upon it by currency union and therefore be able to realise fully the potential ofsuch a union. Let me draw your attention to an interesting and highly significant parallel between yoursystem of a unified currency across eleven countries and Hong Kong’s currency board system fixed tothe US dollar. We both depend to a very much greater degree than would otherwise be the case oninternal market flexibility as a mechanism of economic adjustment. As you are aware, Hong Kong hasalways enjoyed a reputation as a flexible economy. It is precisely that flexibility in the labour, propertyand other markets that has ensured the sustainability of Hong Kong’s high rate of economic growthand currency stability over the nearly seventeen-year history of our currency board system. It is thatflexibility, involving sizable and quite swift price adjustments, accompanied by a considerable degreeof labour mobility within and between sectors, that has enabled Hong Kong to cope with economicshocks. But, rightly or wrongly, the impression from afar is that Euroland is some way frompossessing these necessary elements of structural flexibility. Consequently, there is concern whetherintra-Euroland adjustment between disparate regions, when the exchange rate is no longer an
BIS Review 23/20004instrument and fiscal policy is supposedly constrained by Treaty criteria, will prove to be too painfulfor some.There are other structural features of Euroland, which also cause some concern to observers from myside of the world. These include high taxation, stringent regulation and cosy corporate governancecharacterised by the equity of major businesses being closely held by friendly groups of long-terminvestors, including one’s bankers and associate companies - or Euroland’s version of the cronycapitalism for which parts of Asia have been so severely rebuked. From bitter experience, I know aswell as you do that the media tend to exaggerate the negative and overlook the positive. The vision ofEuroland which may consequently predominate in the sub-conscious of Asian readers might includesuch things as French truckdrivers blockading autoroutes; German resistance to foreign takeovers;relatively high taxes and a heavy burden of social security contributions; and statutory ceilings on thenumber of hours employees may work.But let me refrain from venturing too far and turn to the financial system of Euroland. The perceptionis that it is dominated by the banking sector, which is in turn dominated by a handful of hugetraditional commercial banks. I understand that, as at December 1999, commercial bank assets inEuroland represented over half of total assets in the bank, debt and equity markets. The correspondingfigure in the United States is only 15.8%. It is true that the relatively greater dependence on banks infinancial intermediation in the main Euroland countries has served those countries remarkably well formany years. It provided continuity of funding and support for long-term strategies, and thereforeinsulated them from the scourge of “short-termism”. But the pendulum appears to have swung in theopposite direction over the past 10-15 years. Competitive equity and debt markets have been moreefficient at delivering the corporate restructuring and the funding for “new economy” activities in aspeedy manner in a world of particularly rapid technological change and a world where internationalfinance is highly mobile. Such efficiency, with globalised markets, coupled with a buoyant economy,is seen to be attracting substantial capital to the US markets, and I understand that one major sourcefrom where such capital comes is Euroland. Seen from Asia, this has been another important factorcontributing to the weakness of the euro.These sort of images may explain why people talk of a reluctance of foreigners to invest in Euroland,despite the very clear signs that the overall prospects for non-inflationary economic growth are nowquite encouraging. You may argue that these images are mistaken and flawed. You may well be right;I am not in a position either to refute or to verify them. Euroland officials should perhaps considerhow much a problem there is of substance and how much of perception, and address each asappropriate.Another factor that may contribute to scepticism over the euro concerns monetary policy. But there isnot a lot that I would wish to say on the subject. You will appreciate that central bankers are notanyway the sort of people to make public assessments of one another! On the whole, I sense a feelingof some sympathy for the European Central Bank. In the technical sense it appears to have done mostthings right, in terms of keeping inflation under wraps and so preserving the internal purchasing powerof the euro, but it has nevertheless had to preside over a substantial decline in the euro’s externalvalue. Given that Euroland as a whole is a relatively closed economy, the decline of the euro may havecaused more concern to outsiders than to insiders. It has certainly influenced international investorperceptions.My own observation, perhaps slightly cynical, of businessmen and investors is that they are lessconcerned about the technical content of monetary policy - provided that it is seen to be reasonablydisciplined - than they are about the conviction with which it is delivered. Thus, the so-called “strongdollar” stance of the United States is clearly stated. It is not contradicted from anywhere within theadministration. It inspires confidence, even though it may lack precision - in fact what I think it meansis that the authorities will not stand in the way of a strengthening of the dollar, rather than that theywould necessarily resist a weakening. By contrast, different Japanese officials have over the past yearsmade rather different pronouncements about where the yen should be and what they might or mightnot do to secure that. International sentiment towards the yen and investment in Japan appear to havebeen damaged by such apparent vacillation.
5BIS Review 23/2000If these arguments are transposed to Euroland, they imply that the ECB must continue to develop itsown identity and assert its own policies. Emerging uncertainties over whether an exchange rate policyis lurking somewhere in the background should be firmly resolved. Furthermore, national central bankgovernors and finance ministers should exercise extreme self-discipline in commenting publicly onmonetary policy if their views in any way diverge from the official ECB line, notwithstanding thewithdrawal symptoms from which they may suffer. The problem was nicely summed up by the captionbeneath a photograph of G7 finance ministers in a recent edition of your German magazine, “Capital”.It noted that there was just one minister each to speak for the dollar, yen and pound, but three whodebated with one another about the euro. This may be a scandalous misrepresentation of the true stateof affairs, but there are many readers who would, I am sure, have sensed a grain of truth there.Another cause of possible scepticism over the euro relates to what I would like to call popularacceptability. Let me explain what it is. No one has yet seen the euro in the form of cash. From HongKong we cannot witness as closely as you can here in Euroland the extent to which the euro hasalready become part of economic life. The separate national currencies are still quoted in Hong Kongand any traveller knows that he can only take those and not the euro in banknote form on his journey.There is a feeling that, whatever the law says, the euro will not really have arrived until it is there inyour pocket. The sceptics will go on to suggest that poor performance of the euro to date, coupled withnationalistic resentment of the imminent loss of one’s own banknotes - to many an emotive symbol ofnational identity and sovereignty - might yet cause a wave of popular opposition to the euro at theeleventh hour.I should stress that this may not be a widely held viewpoint, and most international businessmen andbankers have long since discarded the national currencies from their minds and books in favour of theeuro. But it is possible for just a few vocal doubters to have a disproportionate effect on the overallmood. Plainly, the sooner the euro is in physical circulation the better, and I personally feel that theplan of a three-year wait was a trifle generous.I should add an associated observation concerning pride in one’s currency. A currency is unlikely towin the widespread confidence of international financiers if nationals of the currency zone themselveslack pride or confidence in it. It is fully understandable, though nevertheless unhelpful, that peoplewhom I meet here in Germany, for example, seem to have moved from pride in the Deutsche mark tonostalgia for the Deutsche mark, rather than from pride in the Deutsche mark to pride in the euro.So much for possible sources of negative perceptions. At the same time there are positive aspectsabout the emergence of the euro, although not all of them are necessarily clearly visible from Asia.A notable achievement has been the establishment of the euro as a major force in the internationalforeign exchange and bond markets. High degrees of liquidity are being enjoyed, and in the bondmarket issuance in euro quickly overtook the combined issuance levels of the former componentcurrencies. In this sense the euro has already proved that it is greater than the sum of its parts, and hassucceeded in reaping those economies of scale which were advertised as one of the several benefits ofthe single currency.A related achievement has been the spread of usage of the euro for invoicing and financing trade, notonly within Euroland but also by firms in other countries trading or competing with Euroland orinvolved in supply chains leading there. This is a phenomenon that is perhaps less evident in Asia thanin countries nearer to you here.Even less evident to us in Asia is the impact which the euro may be having on competition andinternal pricing within Euroland, now that the single currency has stripped away exchange costs andother impediments to price comparison. I must emphasise that I have not had the opportunity to testthis thesis for myself, so I can only rely on what others tell me. Some claim that this will prove to beone of the most emphatic benefits of the move to a single currency. I could well believe that, but I amunsure what progress may yet have been recorded.Thus, you will appreciate how in Asia we may not be aware of the various benefits that the euro isdelivering, whereas we are relatively well served by the sceptics. There may be a marketing job to bedone here. And it is one which, to carry conviction, must be performed as much by businessmen or
BIS Review 23/20006bankers who actually use the euro and experience the benefits, as by central bank, government orEuropean Commission officials, or by politicians and their aides.The HKMA viewBut let me say here that, insofar as the perception of the euro within the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority (HKMA) is concerned, it is clearly a supportive one.As I implied earlier, we have a keen interest in the euro and a quiet wish for its success. This shoulddemonstrate to the world that a fixed exchange rate (in your case more than a fixed rate - a unifiedcurrency) vis-a-vis some or all of one’s trading partners is a viable option. There have been few other“fixers” since the Bretton Woods system broke down in the early 1970s. But Hong Kong since 1983and other more recent currency board countries, such as Argentina, Bulgaria and Estonia, have shownthat fixing is a viable strategy. It may indeed even be superior, given the discipline it imposes and thesalutary attention it focuses at the national level on structural efficiency and flexibility. Of course itmay not suit all, and the IMF, for instance, continues mostly to espouse free floating in itsprescriptions for individual countries. But the IMF does acknowledge that options at the other extremeof the spectrum from free floating may be appropriate in some circumstances, and in itspronouncements the IMF has given unflinching support to Hong Kong’s peg - as indeed it has to theeuro.The success of the euro has further implications for the Asian region. One lesson learned from theexperience of the Asian financial turmoil is that if we wish to reduce the vulnerability of the small andopen emerging markets in Asia to international finance we need, among other things, to build biggermarkets. One way of achieving this, if not the only way, is to follow the example of Euroland and gofor some form of currency union. Although the Euroland type of pre-conditions for currency union arefar from being satisfied in Asia at present, with so much diversity and fragmentation in the geography,culture, stages of development and policies, this is an option that Asia can ill afford to ignore in thelong run. The experience of Euroland operating with the euro is therefore something that should bewatched in Asia, and is being watched in the HKMA, with keen, supportive interest.Meanwhile, one way of reducing the short-term vulnerability of small and open markets in Asia to thedestabilising influence of international finance, while continuing to benefit from it, is perhaps topromote the greater and prudent use of foreign currencies in financial market activities. This is not anadvertisement for “dollarisation” - quite the opposite in fact. It is a suggestion for consolidating theposition of national currencies by sparing them from certain extraneous influences. This is particularlyrelevant to Hong Kong as an international financial centre where non-domestic financial business andmovements in portfolio capital unrelated to economic developments intrinsic to Hong Kong areabundant. In line with this thinking, we have come to the conclusion that we need to develop ourfinancial infrastructure to facilitate the use of foreign currencies in international financial transactionsin the Asian time zone. We have just started work on building a US dollar payment system and wouldhave a keen interest in doing the same, in due course, for the euro, if demand for such facilities in theAsian time zone was evident. Hong Kong looks forward to and is ready to facilitate the greater use ofthe euro in Asia.For Hong Kong the emergence of the euro as a major currency alongside the US dollar is alsowelcomed from a reserve management standpoint, since the options for investment are broadened.There is now a clearer alternative to the US dollar than before monetary union. And it is a time whenconservative, long-term investors are looking for such an alternative. As you are aware, there is in theUS increasing concern about inflation being rekindled, notwithstanding rapid, IT induced productivitygrowth. Of course, prospects of tighter monetary policy tend to lend support to the dollar. But there isthe possibility that at some point the extent of interest rate hike needed to preempt inflation and theassociated fears for its consequences for the real economy are such as to scare investors away from USfinancial markets. Another reason would be the possibility that productivity gains arising from ITinvestments may experience diminishing returns.
7BIS Review 23/2000In the HKMA, we certainly are putting our money where our mouth is. I have personally attractedsome attention in the foreign exchange markets for remarks I have made about the management ofHong Kong’s Exchange Fund, which holds, among other assets, our foreign exchange reserves. Ourtarget exposure to European currencies (which may not necessarily mean the euro alone) is set at 15%of the Fund and we have, over the past few months, moved from an underweight position to theneutral position of 15%. This target exposure may strike you as low. But we do hold some Hong Kongdollar assets in the form of the Hong Kong dollar equities that we have acquired in 1998 and we areobliged to hold US dollars one-for-one as backing for the monetary base under our currency board. Ifwe exclude these, then among the remaining foreign currency assets our targeted exposure toEuropean currencies at present is effectively a little over 20%. Superficially, this may still seem on thelow side. But with our peg to the dollar we feel more comfortable having a substantial dollar reservewhich covers much more than just the monetary base, even though we do not formally commitourselves to convertibility at the fixed rate for anything more than the monetary base.In managing our foreign reserves we also tend to be averse to volatility. Thus, given our dollar focus,we have naturally been worried by the volatility of the euro’s exchange rate. Very recently weinformally polled ten leading financial institutions in London. Their forecasts for the dollar/euroexchange rate by the end of this year ranged from $1.22 down to 90c. This is a considerably widerspread than the trading range already experienced and suggests a huge measure of uncertainty, to ahorizon of only ten months.Of course, one might argue that this represents uncertainty over the dollar as much as the euro. Yesindeed, and I apologise for analysing things very much from a dollar base. Over time, all currencieshave experienced considerable volatility - the dollar, the yen, the euro and its ancestors, sterling and soon. Yet in all of these, investors have been able to enjoy significant positive real rates of return overthe long term. That may not be good enough for everyone: some seek short-term gains; others may beworried by mark-to-market volatility in the short term even if they are there for the long haul. Butlong-term investors will give considerable weight to the overall economic and monetary managementof the economy. As I mentioned earlier, there are a number of aspects of the management of theEuroland economy about which perceptions from Asia may be somewhat sceptical. As for monetarypolicy, I would suggest that it is perhaps natural for outsiders to be rather hesitant in their assessments,in view of the new infrastructure for monetary policy, but as the ECB beds down one would expectconfidence to grow.ConclusionMy theme today has been that perceptions may be at variance with reality, but it is often perceptionsthat drive financial markets. Economic fundamentals can probably explain some of the euro’sweakness over the past 14 months, but not all of it. I have tried to be frank in my assessment of theway in which the euro is viewed from Asia. I hope I have not been so frank as to be discourteous.Sentiment does appear currently to be somewhat frail and the outlook uncertain. I derive nosatisfaction at all from that - we are all in more or less the same boat when it comes to the vagaries ofthe markets. And as the manager of Hong Kong’s substantial foreign reserves, I am also heldaccountable for the investment decisions taken. But I am confident that sentiment will improve andour investment in the euro will come good.
1BIS Review 12/2000Mr Macfarlane takes the opportunity to expand on the roleof monetary policy in managing an economic expansionTalk by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Economic Society ofAustralia, Victorian Branch, Melbourne on 11 February 2000.*      *      *It is a great pleasure to be here speaking to the Victorian Branch of the Economic Society. I first spokebefore the Society in 1986 and have been back a few times since. On each occasion I have appreciatedthe interest and attention you have afforded me. I hope that what I have to say today will again be ofinterest to you.I want to take the opportunity today to expand a little more on the role of monetary policy in managingan economic expansion. This is a subject that I have spoken on in the past, but clearly there is more tobe said. On this occasion, I would not only like to restate the Reserve Bank’s position, but also dealwith some of the views that have been put forward following our recent raising of interest rates.The current expansion, as you will all probably be aware, has now lasted longer than its predecessorsin the 1970s and 1980s, and has also reached a higher level relative to its starting point. This is shownby the accompanying graph, which puts the three expansions on a comparable basis. Anotherinteresting aspect of our current expansion is how similar it is to the much better known expansion inthe US economy. While the US expansion has been going for 36 quarters compared to 35 for our own(measured up to the present quarter), our average GDP growth rate of 4.1% is higher than the 3.6%recorded in the US.1Diagram 195100105110115120125130135140951001051101151201251301351401Expansions in GDPCyclical trough = 100IndexIndex1980s1990s1970sYears since trough23456789While it is satisfying to look back and see how far we have come, it is more useful to look ahead andsee what we have to do if we are to continue on this path. For some time now, the task of monetarypolicy has been just that - to manage the expansion in such a way as to maximise its length. We do notwant to repeat the experience of earlier expansions which ended so unhappily, and therefore we mustask ourselves what it is that we have to do this time to avoid that fate. This is the main subject of my1These growth rates are calculated up to the September quarter 1999 - the latest data available for Australia: i.e. forAustralia average growth rate from 91 Q2 to 99 Q3, for US 91 Q1 to 99 Q3.
BIS Review 12/20002talk today, but before I get into it, I would like to ask your indulgence to detour through the age-oldsubject of the business cycle.The business cycleEconomists have been analysing the business cycle for a century or more. From time to time after along expansion, a few feel emboldened enough to suggest that perhaps we have seen the end of thebusiness cycle. This happened in the very early-1970s, and a few people are canvassing the idea nowas part of the concept known as the “new economy” or “new paradigm”. While there is undoubtedlysubstance in these ideas, some of you may be disappointed to know that I am not a member of theschool that thinks the business cycle has been banished, although I am happy to recognise thatincreased productivity growth in the 1990s has made the task of macro-economic managementsomewhat easier than formerly. The most obvious benefit of this from the monetary policy perspectiveis that the overall rise in interest rates needed to prevent a potential inflationary situation developingnow seems to be a good deal smaller than previously.There are two main mechanisms that lie behind the business cycle:1. A business cycle of some sort may be the inevitable result of interactions involved in acomplex dynamic system such as an economy. We know that cycles are the norm for suchnatural phenomena as the weather and animal populations, and some tendency in thisdirection is also probably intrinsic to economic behaviour. The first Nobel Prize inEconomics was awarded to Ragnar Frisch for work on how business cycles can bepropagated in simple models of the economy, and others such as Samuelson and Hicksexpanded on this.2 More recently, the Real Business Cycle3 school of economists have takenthis in a new direction by regarding all cycles as being a natural result of changes in thesupply side of the economy. I do not want to take any of this too literally, but I would agreewith one conclusion that comes out of all this work, namely that it is probably unrealistic toexpect a dynamic system like a modern economy to expand in a smooth line; its naturalprogression is probably characterised by some element of cyclicality.2. A business cycle may be viewed as resulting from policy mistakes. In this view, policy iskept expansionary for too long during the upswing, resulting in the build-up of seriousdistortions or imbalances - principally inflation. Eventually something has to be done, but inorder to eliminate the by then well entrenched imbalances, the degree of tightening requiredis quite large. As a result, the economy is pushed into recession and unemployment risessharply. This explanation essentially sees cycles as the result of a delayed monetary policyreaction function.In the popular discussion of economic developments over recent decades, it is the second type of cause- the tendency for monetary policy to contribute to booms and busts - that has been the focus ofattention. Fortunately, it is also the type that we have most chance of avoiding if we play our cardsright. This would not mean that all cyclical behaviour would be removed, but a significant part of itcould be.2Frisch, R (1933), “Propagation Problems and Impulse Problems in Dynamic Economics”, in Economic Essays in Honorof Gustav Cassel (London: George Allen and Unwin).

3BIS Review 12/2000The avoidance of imbalancesThe centrepiece of this approach is to act before the imbalances have had time to become entrenched.If you are seriously aiming to maximise the length of the expansion, the tightening of monetary policycomes earlier than if you are mainly interested in a high growth rate for the year ahead and lessconcerned with the length of the expansion. Of course, this can sometimes make the explanation ofmonetary policy moves more difficult, because those opposed to the move may be able to claim thatthere was not sufficient hard evidence of imbalances to justify it.It is instructive to look back over the past few decades to see how imbalances have built up towardsthe latter part of economic expansions. No two expansions or their demise have been the same, nor isit the case that a single imbalance was the cause of the problems. In all cases, there were severalimbalances whose interaction led to the build-up of an unsustainable situation.Having said that, however, it must be recognised that the pre-eminent imbalance has been inflation. Itis now almost universally acknowledged that the maintenance of low inflation is the sine qua non of asustainable expansion. It was the rise of inflation, in one form or another, which spelled the death knellof our previous expansions.• In the long expansion which began in the 1960s and ended in 1974, inflation had alreadyrisen to 10% by the September quarter of 1973, which was before the effects of OPEC I hadbeen felt. Following the rapid wage escalation of 1974, inflation then peaked at 17½% earlythe following year.• We had a rather weak expansion in the 1970s, which received a boost from the rises incommodity prices associated with OPEC II in 1979. But by 1981 another wage escalationpushed inflation from a low point of 8% in 1978 to a peak of 12½% in 1982.• In the strong, but shorter-lived, expansion of the 1980s the story was rather different.Although the increases in prices and wages were a good deal higher than we have becomeaccustomed to in the 1990s, there was no sudden acceleration in the latter stages of theexpansion as there had been in earlier episodes. It was a boom in credit-financed asset pricesand the associated speculative activity that did the damage. At some stage the boom wasbound to be followed by a bust, whether of its own accord, or as a result of monetarytightening. While asset price inflation is conceptually different to CPI inflation, and is furtherremoved from the ordinary operation of monetary policy, it is nevertheless a classic case ofthe type of imbalance that can occur in the latter stage of an expansion and lead to its abruptand painful ending.There are several other types of imbalances that often accompany the latter stages of an expansion andthat can be a warning of danger. One is monetary excess, which is usually manifested as excessiveprovision of credit, and which often ends up financing speculative activity. I have already mentionedthis in relation to the 1980s, when the credit expansion was primarily to business and resulted in theover-leveraging of that sector. It is also possible for the imbalance to show up as over-lending tohouseholds, as happened in the UK in the late-1980s.Another imbalance that can occur is in physical investment. We are accustomed to thinking ofinvestment as a good thing and only ever worrying about it if it is too low. But over-investment canalso be a problem at times in that it can lead to the build-up of over-capacity. This in turn can lead to asubsequent dearth of investment, especially if demand has not been as strong as had been expected bythose who put the investment in place. Part of the severity of the recent Asian recession, andparticularly the Japanese one, is due to the earlier period of over-investment. Some of that effect alsooccurred in Australia in the late-1970s/early-1980s during the so-called “resources boom”.Looking back over the post-war years, particularly during the fixed exchange rate period, theimbalance that often played the decisive role was the current account of the balance of payments. If itwidened markedly, private capital inflow risked being insufficient to cover it, and interest rates wouldhave to be raised to attract more capital and to reduce the demand for imports. This would be a majorcause of the subsequent contraction, such as the “credit squeeze” of 1961. With a floating exchange
BIS Review 12/20004rate, the current account is a less immediate constraint: it only becomes binding if the market begins toworry about an escalating external debt to GDP ratio, or about the country’s capacity to service thedebt.The current expansionThis brings me to the current expansion. We have now had two policy tightenings involving a netincrease in the overnight cash rate of ¾ of a percentage point. The tightenings were pre-emptive in thesense that they occurred before imbalances developed - in other words, before there was clearevidence of the economy generally overheating. As the foregoing discussion makes clear, we regardthese tightenings as an essential component of a strategy which is designed to allow this economicexpansion to continue for as long as possible, and not be overwhelmed by the usual imbalances thatbring an expansion to an end. This approach to monetary policy is not unique to the Reserve Bank ofAustralia; one can clearly see the same thinking behind the actions of other central banks. They toohave been bruised by the failures of the 1970s and 1980s and are determined to do better this time.While I think this approach is generally well understood, there are obviously some who do not supportit. There is nothing like a rise in interest rates to bring out critics of monetary policy who hitherto hadbeen silent. Of course, everyone has a right to express their views, and I have no trouble with therecent debate. I can also see why the public expect explanations from bodies that make importantdecisions, and we are conscious of the need to meet that requirement. As well as the explanationcontained in the press release that accompanied the monetary policy decision, we will be publishing adetailed quarterly report on the economy next week, and I appeared in public before a ParliamentaryCommittee two days ago. I will also take the opportunity in the remainder of this speech to addressthese issues.We have for some time been in a period characterised by good economic growth, low inflation andlow interest rates. It has been one of the better periods for the Australian economy, especially in lightof the turmoil among many of our trading partners. I think there has been a tendency for someobservers to think this happy state of affairs could continue indefinitely provided we left it alone. Acommon theme has been “don’t meddle - just leave it alone”, or a related one, “are you afraid ofgrowth?”.These views seem to us to be very short-sighted - in essence, they boil down to the view that the bestway to manage an expansion is to keep interest rates at their low point for as long as possible, and onlyraise them when things have gone off-track. We think that if we did this, we would look back in a fewyears’ time and regret it, even though we might have been more popular in the short run.We also think that this approach fails to recognise just how expansionary the stance of monetarypolicy was in 1999. In either nominal or real terms, interest rates faced by borrowers were very low, aswas shown by their eagerness to borrow.This expansionary stance of monetary policy was designed to combat a specific set of circumstances- weak world economy, expected domestic slowdown, and undershooting of the inflation target. Whenthese circumstances changed, it was only reasonable that monetary policy would also change. We havetried to encapsulate the two changes taken together as a return to “neutrality” from a position that wasclearly expansionary. Of course, there will always be considerable measurement uncertainties aboutthe term neutrality - perhaps we should have referred to a return to the “neutral zone”. Be that as itmay, if you do not have some idea of the concept of neutrality, you run the dual risk of:• being late by not changing monetary policy until overheating has actually occurred (or, in theopposite direction, until a recession is staring you in the face);• then being forced into a large and abrupt adjustment to recover the situation.Both of these outcomes effectively describe a “boom and bust” monetary policy, which is theapproach we set out to avoid.
5BIS Review 12/2000Another variation of the argument that monetary policy should not have been tightened, or not by asmuch, is the appeal to US experience. Proponents of this view claim that Chairman Greenspan hasbeen doing the right thing by letting the US expansion run on, and not being deflected by moreconventional voices calling for monetary restraint to avoid future inflation. I certainly have no qualmsabout joining the chorus of praise for Chairman Greenspan’s and the Federal Reserve Board’sperformance during this expansion, but I would like to make two points. First, we should rememberthat the Australian economy has actually grown faster than the US economy during this expansion.Secondly, the Fed has been prepared to put interest rates up as well as down in its management of theexpansion. Interest rates were raised in 1994, again, although by only a small amount, in 1997, andagain in a third phase in 1999 and 2000. The US experience argues against a policy of leaving interestrates at their low point for long periods in order to achieve a long expansion.Diagram 2 lllllllll0246802468%%US Federal Funds Rate During Current Expansion19921994199619982000There is another argument I want to address before concluding. For various reasons, a number ofpeople have been keen to put forward the view that monetary policy was tightened because of theimpending GST. Some have done this for partisan political reasons, and others because they are stilladhering to the view that monetary policy should only be tightened if general overheating is present.Since it is not present, they assume there must be some ulterior motive that has been hidden andtherefore seize on the GST.I have said on a number of occasions and will say so again today - monetary policy was not tightenedbecause of the GST. The tightening would have happened without the impending GST, just as it has inthe United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the Euro Area, Canada, Sweden, etc. We at theReserve Bank are still operating on the assumption that the GST will affect prices only on a one-for-one basis, and that wages will not be raised to compensate for the GST. The second assumptionreflects the fact that reductions in income taxes will more than offset the rise in prices due to the GST.To raise wages as well to cover the GST would be to expect “double compensation”. There is noeconomic logic for this and, if it were to occur, it would be an example of the type of imbalance thatcould threaten the end of the expansion, and therefore threaten the downward trend in unemployment.Wage surges ended two of the past three expansions - it is important that it does not happen again thistime. I think good sense will prevail, and that anyone who is encouraging “double compensation” willthink again.ConclusionI think we have still got a long way to go in this expansion. It is already longer than its predecessors,and if we as a community are sensible and do not allow short-term thinking to overcome our long-terminterests, it could rival in length the expansions of the 1950s and 1960s. As for monetary policy, wethink it can play a very important part in achieving that end. Inevitably, there will be those who agree
BIS Review 12/20006and those who disagree with what we are doing. We think, however, that monetary policy should bejudged, not by any particular movement in interest rates, which will always be surrounded by someelement of controversy, but by its performance over the whole of the expansion.
1BIS Review 22/2000Bank of Japan’s March report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 10 March 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy has recently started to improve. The economic environment surrounding privatedemand continues to improve, as seen in the increase in corporate profits. However, clear signs of aself-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observed yet.With regard to final demand, housing investment and public investment are decreasing moderately.Recovery in private consumption continues to be weak through lack of notable improvements inemployment and income conditions. Meanwhile, business fixed investment, which had been on adownward trend, seems to have almost leveled off. Net exports (real exports minus real imports)continue to follow an upward trend due to an upturn in overseas economies.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production continues to rise, and an increasein corporate profits is becoming distinct. In this situation, corporate sentiment continues to improve.Regarding the employment condition, the decrease in the number of employees is slowing. However,the improvements in corporate profits and sentiment have not stimulated business activities of manyfirms, because these firms still strongly feel that they have excess capacity and employees and thatthey should reduce their debts to restore financial soundness. In addition, efforts by firms to reducepersonnel expenses have prolonged the severity of households’ income conditions.As for the outlook, public investment is likely to pick up reflecting the progress in the implementationof the supplementary budget for fiscal 1999. This, along with the favorable financial environmentcreated partly by the Bank’s monetary easing, is expected to continue underpinning the economy.Moreover, the positive impact on domestic production of the recovery of overseas economies is likelyto continue for some time, having favorable effects on corporate profits and spending, and then onhousehold income and consumption. By contrast, it is highly probable that housing investment willcontinue to decline moderately. In the corporate sector, restructuring is gradually improvingprofitability to some extent, and some firms in high-growth sectors are inclining toward increasingcapital spending. Many firms, however, are expected to maintain a cautious stance toward fixedinvestment based on their modest prospects for sales. It seems that the appreciation of the yen sincethe summer of 1999 will have an adverse effect on corporate profits in the near term. In thesecircumstances, future economic developments still require careful monitoring in spite of the continuedimprovements in the environment for private demand. Furthermore, it is important to promotestructural reform in order to facilitate a recovery in private demand.With regard to prices, import prices are rising due to the increase in international commodity pricessuch as crude oil prices, along with the recent depreciation of the yen. Domestic wholesale prices,notwithstanding the fall in prices of electric machinery, are flat mainly due to the rise in prices ofpetroleum and chemical products reflecting an increase in crude oil prices. Meanwhile, consumerprices are somewhat weak due to a decline in prices of imported products reflecting the past1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 8 March 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 8 March as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 22/20002appreciation of the yen. Corporate service prices are still falling slowly. As for the outlook, upwardpressure on prices is likely to arise from the gradual improvement in domestic supply-demand balance,as shown in the decline in inventories, and from the rise in crude oil prices. On the other hand,downward pressure is expected from the long-term declining trend of machinery prices due totechnological innovations and from the fall in prices of imported products reflecting the pastappreciation of the yen. On balance, overall prices are likely to remain unchanged for the time being.However, attention should still be paid to the downward pressure on prices stemming from weakdemand, as clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not yet been observed andwages continue to fall.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has generally stayed near zero, except for a temporaryrise reflecting concerns about the possible computer problems related to the leap year, and financialinstitutions have been confident about the availability of overnight funds. The amount outstanding offunds in the call money market increased slightly in late February, and decreased thereafter.Interest rates on term instruments have generally been stable at an extremely low level. The Japanpremium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds were generally above 1.8% in February, but declinedsomewhat from the beginning of March, and are recently ranging between 1.7% and 1.8%. The yieldspread between private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds continuesnarrowing, primarily that between private bonds with relatively low credit ratings and governmentbonds.Stock prices have been firm on the whole, and are currently moving around 20,000 yen.In the foreign exchange market, the yen weakened against the US dollar for most part of February.However, the trend was reversed late in the month, and the yen is recently being traded in the range of106-108 yen.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks are becoming more active inextending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak. Inaddition, firms continue to reduce debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As aresult, credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant, and thus privatebanks’ lending has remained sluggish. Issuance of corporate bonds and CP has been steady.The growth in money stock (M2+CDs) continues to slow reflecting the above-mentioned situation.In this financial environment, corporate financing conditions are easing, and the lending attitude offinancial institutions is perceived by firms as becoming less severe. It continues to warrant carefulmonitoring how these favorable developments in the corporate financing environment will affecteconomic activities.
1BIS Review 22/2000Mr Yam looks at the benefits a US dollar clearing systemwill bring to Hong KongSpeech by Mr Joseph Yam, Chief Executive, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the SigningCeremony for the US Dollar Clearing System, Hong Kong, on 9 March 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to welcome you all to this afternoon’s signing ceremony. The purpose of the ceremonyis for the HKMA formally to appoint HSBC as the Settlement Institution for the new US dollarclearing system that will be developed in Hong Kong over the coming months. When it is fullyrunning - prospectively by the end of the year - this system will enable a wide range of financialtransactions in US dollars to be settled here in Hong Kong, many of them on a real time basis. Theproject marks an important milestone in the development of Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure andit should help to consolidate Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre.Developing Hong Kong’s financial infrastructure is, along with maintaining currency and bankingstability, one of the three main policy objectives of the HKMA. Financial infrastructure, when it worksefficiently, is something that is so much taken for granted that it is barely noticed. It is a far lessprominent public issue than currency or banking stability. Yet, without a properly working financialinfrastructure, there is little chance of currency and banking stability. Effective financial infrastructureis as important to Hong Kong as is the extensive and far more visible physical infrastructure that wesee around us. And Hong Kong is fortunate to be equipped with a financial infrastructure that is asadvanced, reliable and efficient as the road, rail and airport facilities that keep our city moving.Since 1994 the HKMA has implemented a number of major reforms to Hong Kong’s payment andsettlement systems. The largest of these reforms was the launch, in December 1996, of Hong Kong’sReal Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system for interbank payments in Hong Kong dollars. Thisstate-of-the-art system is widely acknowledged to be one of the most advanced and robust of its kind.It has served Hong Kong remarkably well, and made an important contribution to maintainingfinancial stability during the Asian financial crisis, which erupted not long after its introduction. Ourexperience with the RTGS system, and in particular the technology produced for it, plays an essentialrole in the development of the next great milestone, the US dollar clearing system.The US dollar is the currency in which most world trade in merchandise and financial products isdenominated. Because of Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre, and the fact that ourown currency is linked to the US dollar, there is extensive holding of US dollars and a considerabletrade in US dollar-denominated assets. The existing market demand within Hong Kong for a US dollarclearing system is a persuasive enough argument for its introduction: the potential demand for such asystem, and the strategic impetus that it would give to our development as a leading financial centre, isconsiderable. In the near term, Hong Kong’s US Dollar Clearing System will provide the necessaryinfrastructure to support the Stock Exchange’s launch of the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), whichwill allow listed shares to be denominated and settled in US dollars. In the longer term, the system willprovide a range of opportunities for further developing our stock and debt markets into major worldmarkets.A local US dollar clearing system will bring with it the advantages of speed, convenience andefficiency: it will, for example, allow US dollar cheques to be settled within two days, instead of thecurrent two weeks. In addition to these obvious advantages, it will also carry the benefit of safety, inthe form of reduced settlement risk. By enabling, within Hong Kong, delivery versus payment (DvP)for US dollar-denominated securities, and payment versus payment (PvP) for foreign exchange
BIS Review 22/20002transactions between US dollars and Hong Kong dollars, the system will eliminate the settlement riskthat arises when a transaction is spread across different time zones.Greater safety at the level of individual transactions will be complemented by the contribution thesystem will make to monetary stability. By reducing the need for using the Hong Kong dollar as avehicle currency for conducting non-domestic financial business, the US Dollar Clearing System willreduce the impact on local monetary conditions of movements in portfolio capital unrelated toeconomic developments intrinsic to Hong Kong. This is an excellent illustration of how a piece ofrobust and efficient financial infrastructure can be conducive to other important policy objectives, inthis case monetary stability.Let me turn now to the mechanics of the system. The arrangement adopted here is a private sectorsolution, in which the Settlement Institution is a commercial bank. This is not only consistent with thetradition in Hong Kong, but is also in line with international practice and with the recommendations ofthe Bank for International Settlements. At the end of a rigorous selection process, a Selection Panelmade up of disinterested members of the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) and seniorexecutives from the HKMA recommended to EFAC that HSBC be appointed the SettlementInstitution for a franchise period of five years. Under the arrangements agreed between the HKMAand HSBC, the Settlement Institution will in turn appoint Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Ltd, thecurrent operator of the Hong Kong dollar payment system, to develop and operate the US dollarclearing system. The role of the HKMA will be to oversee the design and implementation of thesystem and to ensure that it meets the highest international standards.The conceptual design of the system is firmly in place. The intention is that it should encompass notonly the best, internationally agreed, principles of payment system design but also state-of-the-arttechnology. Leveraging on the technology used for the existing Hong Kong dollar RTGS system, thisUS Dollar Clearing System will offer a range of advanced and sophisticated clearing functions. Thesewill include linkage with the Hong Kong dollar payment system to provide real time PvP settlementfor US dollar-Hong Kong dollar transactions, as well as linkages with the stock and debt securitiesclearing houses to provide DvP settlement. For the general public, the System will enable banks tooffer US dollar cheque deposit accounts, which means that US dollar payments can be dischargedthrough the writing of a cheque in US dollars drawn upon a bank in Hong Kong. The various featuresof the system will be introduced in phases. All being well, we hope to see real-time interbankpayments and PvP for US dollar-Hong Kong dollar foreign exchange transactions introduced by thethird quarter of this year and US dollar paper cheque clearing and a linkage with the HKMA’s CentralMoneymarkets Unit completed by the end of the year.People have asked whether we propose to introduce clearing in other foreign currencies once the USdollar system is established. In principle this would be possible. In practice there needs to be abusiness case. The HKMA is certainly ready to respond if there appears to be market demand forsimilar clearing systems for other major currencies.Hong Kong will shortly have a state-of-the-art facility for conducting US dollar transactions in Asiantime. The benefits of this for both local business and international customers, in both trade andfinance, should be considerable. I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate those who haveworked hard to bring the project to its present advanced stage in so short a time, and I wish everysuccess to all who will be involved in translating the design into reality.
1BIS Review 21/2000Mr Meyer remarks on structuralchange and monetary policy in the United StatesRemarks by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the StanfordInstitute for Economic Policy Research, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, on3 March 2000.*      *      *Structural change is a central theme in virtually any explanation of the exceptional performance of theUS economy over the past several years. Structural changes of uncertain magnitude and timing haveincreased the difficulty in forecasting, undermined confidence in our understanding of the structure ofthe economy, and increased the risk of measurement error with respect to key variables.In my remarks, I will offer a bridge from today’s discussion of structural changes to the implicationsfor monetary policy, the subject of tomorrow’s agenda. In my view, the most important challenges tomonetary policy related to structural change in this episode arise from possible changes in aggregatesupply - specifically in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and in trendgrowth. The key challenge for monetary policymakers during this period, in my view, has been toallow the economy to realize the full benefits of the new possibilities while avoiding an overheatedeconomy. More fundamentally, the challenge has been to adapt the strategy of monetary policy in lightof the uncertainties associated with structural change. My focus is therefore not on structural changeper se but rather on the uncertainty about key parameters likely to be heightened during a period ofstructural change.However, the key structural change during this episode - an increase in the underlying productivitygrowth trend - has also set in motion a complex of effects on inflation, interest rates, equity prices, andaggregate demand. Even if we knew the precise value of the higher productivity trend, we wouldlikely remain uncertain about the size and persistence of many of its effects. As a result, adaptingmonetary policy to a higher trend rate of productivity growth would be a challenge, especially in aninterest-rate setting regime, even if there were no uncertainty about the new underlying growth trend.Perspectives on monetary policy strategyThere are, in my view, two fundamental requirements of a prudent monetary policy. First, monetarypolicy should impose a nominal anchor, pinning down the long-run inflation rate. Second, monetarypolicy should lean against the cyclical winds. The second requirement contributes to the first and alsoto smoothing fluctuations in output around full employment. This view of the mission of monetarypolicy is consistent with both the dual mandate for the Federal Reserve in the Federal Reserve Act andwith flexible inflation targeting regimes in many countries.The key to the practice of monetary policy is to develop a strategy for the discretionary conduct ofpolicy that meets these requirements. A constructive way to describe such a strategy is to formalize itin terms of an explicit rule. John Taylor has offered an attractive and simple form of such a rule. Butperhaps equally important, John’s approach has encouraged a wider acceptance of the study of rulesby emphasizing that the objective is to inform discretionary monetary policy decisions rather than toreplace discretion by a rule.I find the Taylor rule attractive because it is closely aligned both with the objectives of monetarypolicy and with the model that governs inflation dynamics. That is, the rule responds directly todeviations from the Federal Reserve’s objectives - price stability and an equilibrium utilization rate.And it incorporates a preemptive response to inflation that is consistent with models that assign animportant role to unemployment or output gaps in inflation dynamics. However, implementing this
BIS Review 21/20002strategy requires knowledge of the output gap and the equilibrium real interest rate - variables thatappear to have been affected by structural change. As a result, there has been increased focus on howTaylor-type rules should be adjusted in light of the uncertainties associated with structural change.Uncertainty and monetary policy strategyGiven uncertainty about the output gap, for example, should we attenuate the response to the outputgap or even entirely abandon the output gap as a guide to adjustment in monetary policy? Given therelated difficulty in forecasting during a period of structural change, should we be lessforward-looking and hence less preemptive? If we are less preemptive, should we compensate bybeing more aggressively reactive to recent inflation? Or should we more fundamentally change thespecification of the policy rule when confronted with these uncertainties? For example, would weminimize the damage from mis-estimates of the NAIRU and trend growth using a nominal incomerule instead of a Taylor rule? Or should we allow for a nonlinear instead of a linear policy response tomovements in output and inflation?There is, of course, a well-developed literature on the effect of uncertainty on policy. Until recently, Iviewed the literature as delineating two simple types of uncertainty, typically referred to as additiveuncertainty and multiplicative or parameter uncertainty. Recently, the literature has focused onuncertainty associated with imperfect or noisy observation of the economy in ways that do not neatlyfall into the two simple bins.Certainty equivalence holds in the case of simple specifications of additive uncertainty. Whencertainty equivalence holds, it is optimal for policymakers to respond to the expected values of theirtargets as if they held these values with complete certainty. In a sense, uncertainty has no effect onpolicy in this case, though it results in some decline of its effectiveness. Additive uncertainty andcertainty equivalence are perhaps best seen as devices to allow the incorporation of some stochasticelements into a model without the complications that arise in more meaningful encounters withuncertainty.In the case of multiplicative uncertainty, the most well known result is William Brainard’s conclusionthat policy should be somewhat more cautious in this case. Assuming policymakers don’t likeuncertainty, they become less aggressive with their policy instruments, because bolder use of policyadds to uncertainty about outcomes. However, some recent evidence (Arturo Estrella, Rick Mishkin,and Glenn Rudebusch) suggests that this type of uncertainty may have a relatively modest quantitativeeffect on the policy outcome. Also, newer theoretical results, such as Tom Sargent’s, question theconclusion that parameter uncertainty would make policy more cautious.The newer entry into the uncertainty literature relates to imperfect or noisy observation of theeconomy, although concern about this problem certainly predates the recent studies. For example, byexamining the historical record at the Federal Reserve, Athanasios Orphanides uncovered substantialand persistent measurement error associated with estimates of the output gap - one of the measures wesometimes identify with “excess demand”. This uncertainty starts by looking a lot like additiveuncertainty, but its policy implications often end up similar to the Brainard result of more cautiouspolicy, with policy response attenuated at least with respect to movements in variables about whichthere are noisy observations.The literature supporting this attenuation result has at least two strands. One consists of theoreticalmodels based on signal extraction, as in the work that Eric Swanson and Lars Svensson and MichaelWoodford are presenting at this conference tomorrow. Suppose, as in Swanson’s work, that inflationdepends on an unobservable variable we call “excess demand” and policy responds to theunemployment rate, which is only an imperfect indicator of “excess demand”. Since theunemployment rate is a noisy indicator of what the policymaker is interested in - the unobservable“excess demand” - the weight the policymaker will give this variable will vary with its reliability as anindicator for excess demand. Specifically, the less reliable the indicator becomes, the smaller itsweight will be in the optimal policy rule and the more weight will be placed on the other indicatorsabout which uncertainty has not changed. In the current context, that means that the weight on the
3BIS Review 21/2000unemployment rate is decreased, while the weight on inflation is increased. In effect, as policybecomes less preemptive in stabilizing inflation, it becomes more aggressive in reacting to recentinflation.The second strand of the literature that supports the attenuation result is based on simulation results, asreflected in the work of Orphanides, Rudebusch, Frank Smets, and others. This work employs simpleempirical models and a simple rather than an optimal rule and examines how policymakers shouldadjust the parameters of the simple rule in light of the uncertainty about the measurement of the outputgap. It finds that policymakers should attenuate their response to changes in the output gap and,indeed, should move very cautiously when the confidence with which sure measures can beconstructed is low. In contrast with the conclusions based on signal extraction models, the simulationsresults using simple rules generally finds that increased uncertainty about the output gap may call forattenuation in the response to both the gap variable and inflation.In some cases, certainty equivalence continues to hold, even with noisy observations. In Swanson’swork, for example, optimal policy still displays certainty equivalence when policy is related to theunobservable excess demand. In the paper that Svensson and Woodford will present tomorrow, wherethe model relates inflation directly to the observed unemployment gap, certainty equivalence holdsprovided that the estimate of the gap is updated on the basis of all available data and the true model.This structure and result are also present in the work by Orphanides.So the question is: How general or special is the attenuation result? This question appears particularlyrelevant to the uncertainties that monetary policymakers are wrestling with today, and I am sure wewill have a lot of discussion about this conclusion tomorrow. I suspect the result is a general one forthe following reasons. First, I believe part of the challenge today is finding a proxy for theunobservable excess demand, especially given the divergent movements in the unemployment andcapacity utilization rates. Therefore, in my view, Swanson’s conclusion that certainty equivalenceholds when policy is expressed in terms of the unobservable “excess demand” is dominated by hisconclusion that attenuation holds when policy is made in terms of observables. Put simply, policyauthorities are mortals and hence are unable to observe unobservables. Second, given that we don’tknow the true model, policymakers might look at simple rules rather than try to derive optimal rulesfor guidance. This leads me to question the practical significance of certainty equivalence, whichrequires that policymakers know the true model, use an optimal rule, and update their optimal estimateof the NAIRU based on the true model.I draw the following conclusions from this research. First, policymakers should continuously updatetheir estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly therealizations of unemployment, output, and inflation. Such updating will not entirely erase the problemsassociated with noisy observations, but it will mitigate them. In my view, policymakers today updatetheir estimates of the output gap and the NAIRU more systematically and more frequently than theyonce did. This view suggests some caution in deriving the degree of attenuation from historicalevidence of revisions to the NAIRU and potential output.Second, policymakers should adjust the aggressiveness of their response to the gaps between actualand target variables in light of the uncertainty about their measurement. Specifically, policymakersshould attenuate their response to movements in the unemployment or output gap. There is animportant complication in applying this principle. Simulation results suggest that the optimal responseto the output gap in the absence of uncertainty might be considerably more aggressive than theparameter in the Taylor rule. The attenuation might therefore result in a response parameter closer toor lower than the Taylor rule value.Third, the literature is less clear about whether policymakers should offset any attenuation in theresponse to the output gap with a more aggressive response to movements in realized inflation. Myinstinct tells me that, as policy becomes less preemptive, it should become more aggressively reactive.Taking the second and third conclusions together, the relative weights on the gap variable and inflationshould vary, depending on the degree of uncertainty about the output gap. The higher coefficient onthe inflation rate might be justified by the fact that inflation has become a better indicator of the excess
BIS Review 21/20004demand compared with the output gap when there is heightened uncertainty about the measurement ofthe output gap.The focus of the literature has been on uncertainty about the unemployment or output gap, but a shiftin trend productivity growth also results in uncertainty about the equilibrium real interest rate. In thiscase, a Taylor-type rule should also incorporate some mechanism for updating the estimate of this rate.A nonlinear Taylor rule under uncertainty about key parametersThe literature on noisy observations has focused on adjustments in the parameters of linearTaylor-type rules. But I believe that a nonlinear rule may dominate a linear specification in this case. Ihave suggested a nonlinear rule that would attenuate the response to the unemployment rate in a regionaround the best estimate of the NAIRU but would cause a gradual return to the more aggressivemarginal response appropriate under certainty equivalence once the unemployment rate had movedsufficiently below the best estimate of the NAIRU.Such a nonlinear rule could be justified either by nonlinearities in the economy or by a non-normaldistribution of policymakers’ prior beliefs about the NAIRU. It is certainly easy to believe that thereare nonlinearities in the economy in general and with respect to the Phillips curve in particular. Forexample, to the extent that the effect on inflation becomes disproportionately larger as theunemployment or output gap increases, the policy response should become more aggressive with eachincremental increase in the gap. However, I’m not persuaded that there is a strong case for a nonlinearPhillips curve. So I am inclined to emphasize the possibility of a non-normal distribution of priorbeliefs about the NAIRU as the basis for a nonlinear policy rule.An example of a non-normal probability distribution for the NAIRU that would justify the nonlinearpolicy response I have suggested is one with a uniform probability distribution around the bestestimate for the NAIRU. For example, policymakers might have a prior of 5% for the NAIRU, but auniform probability distribution over the range between 4½% and 5½% for the unemployment rate.Because policymakers are so uncertain about the NAIRU within this interval, they might be verywilling to revise their estimate of the NAIRU about in line with the observations of the unemploymentrate within it. As a result, movements of the unemployment rate within this range would have littleeffect on the estimate of the unemployment gap and, therefore, on the target interest rate. However, ifthe unemployment rate moved outside this range, policymakers might assign an increasingly smallerfraction of each increment of the unemployment rate to the NAIRU as the unemployment rate movedstill further from policymakers’ best estimate of the NAIRU. In this case, the policy response isattenuated around the best estimate of the NAIRU, but it gradually becomes larger, ultimatelyconverging to the marginal response under certainty equivalence.Monetary policy’s adjustment to uncertainty about key parametersIs the recent monetary policy response consistent with the lessons I have drawn from the literature onuncertainty associated with noisy observations? The following discussion draws on the evolution ofmy own thinking, as well as on the policy actions, including the announced tilts in policy and the textof the announcements that accompanied policy actions.I pick up this episode in the middle of 1996, when I joined the Board. It seems to me that initiallymonetary policy was consistent with a backward-looking Taylor rule (although that is sometimesdifficult to distinguish from a forward-looking Taylor rule). We were faced with two surprises:faster-than-expected growth (resulting in a higher-than-expected estimated output gap) andlower-than-expected inflation. These had offsetting effects on the nominal funds rate, yielding a nearlyunchanged policy until the fall of 1998 and a policy that closely tracked the Taylor rule prescription, atleast allowing for updates of the estimated unemployment or output gaps along the way. Alternatively,this policy could be viewed as allowing a passive rise in the real rate that turned out to be wellcalibrated to the rise in the output gap.
5BIS Review 21/2000As the episode progressed, more questions were raised - both inside and outside the Federal Reserve -about the values of the NAIRU and trend growth. The staff continually adjusted its estimates of theseparameters in response to incoming data.In the fall of 1998, monetary policy responded both to the financial market distress and to the abruptchange in the forecast for growth (and hence utilization rates) in the United States. I put more weighton the forecast and less on recent observations in the context of a Taylor rule, a stance I thought wasjustified by the abrupt change in the forecast and by the unusually sharp contrast between the forecastand the still-strong incoming data.Once it became apparent that the US economy was maintaining its momentum despite weaker foreigngrowth and that financial markets had returned toward normal, the growing uncertainty about theoutput gap - reflecting the continuing contradiction of declining inflation and rising output gaps -made monetary policymakers cautious about aggressively reversing their policy actions. But throughearly 1999 we remained somewhat concerned about the degree of recovery in both financial marketsand foreign economies. The net result was that the nominal funds rate remained constant during thisphase, instead of tightening in line with the Taylor rule prescription. In effect, policymakers could beinterpreted as attenuating their response to the unemployment and output gap in line with thetheoretical models and empirical results I have talked about.Beginning in mid-1999, with the estimated output gap increasing further and growth shifting to astill-higher gear, policymakers became more concerned about the possibility of overheating and,hence, the risks of higher inflation. The tightenings in 1999 could be interpreted as unwinding theearlier easings, once the factors that motivated the easings had themselves reversed. Of course, everypolicy action needs to be defended in terms of its contribution in the future to achieving the objectivesof monetary policy. In this spirit, I interpreted the tightening moves as preemptive attempts to limitinflation risks.Why did policymakers tolerate for a while further increases in the output gap, and why did theysubsequently become more concerned about the inflation risks from further increases in the outputgap? I think the change can be rationalized in terms of my discussion of the case for a nonlinear policyresponse under uncertainty. As the unemployment rate fell farther below the best estimates of theNAIRU and the risk of overheating increased, policymakers became less tolerant of continuedabove-trend growth.Monetary policy strategy in light of the uncertainties associated with structural changeLooking backward, I think we can find at least a hint of attenuation of the response to changes in theunemployment rate and, more recently, a hint of a nonlinear policy response. What does this suggestabout monetary policy strategy going forward? The current strategy can, I believe, be viewed as atwo-step process. The first step is, preemptively, to slow growth to trend. If successful, this step wouldlimit, though not necessarily remove, the threat of overheating, if output has already advanced beyondpotential. The second step is to respond reactively to higher inflation, should the prevailing output gapprove to be inconsistent with stable inflation.The first step is a continuation of the strategy underlying the recent policy tightenings. In myjudgment, the unemployment rate has already declined to a sufficiently low level relative to myestimate of the NAIRU that we should no longer be attenuating the marginal policy response to furtherdeclines. But the current policy is, in my view, also an aggressive version of such a strategy because itis not a nonlinear response to further declines in the unemployment rate, but a forward-looking attemptto prevent further tightening of the labor market. I think that one of the subtleties of policy issometimes being content to respond incrementally to the incoming data and sometimes becomingmore aggressive and responding to forecasts. It is best that the policymakers are transparent about suchshifts in the relative weight on the forecast in their policy decisions.Once growth has slowed to trend and the output gap stabilizes, monetary policy may become morereactive, given the continued uncertainty about the levels of the NAIRU and the output gap. That is,policymakers might be prepared to slow the economy to trend growth to avoid the risk of higher
BIS Review 21/20006inflation associated with still-lower unemployment rates and higher output gaps, but might be reluctantto reduce the perceived output gap without evidence from realized inflation that the prevailing gap isunsustainable.Under such a policy, the response to inflation should, in my view, be more aggressive than it wouldotherwise be, for example, in the Taylor rule under certainty. This is an example of offsetting theattenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to inflation realizations.In effect, the policy setting at trend growth and at the prevailing level of the output gap is presumed tobe consistent with stable inflation. An increase in inflation (specifically in core inflation) would beevidence that the output gap is not in fact sustainable. As a result, the increase in interest rates shouldbe the combined response to a slight increase in the estimate of the NAIRU and to an increase in theinflation rate at an unchanged estimate of the NAIRU.A final component of the strategy, in my view, should be that policy should tighten further - above andbeyond what is presumed to be necessary to slow the economy to trend - to the extent that efforts tostabilize the output gap fall short. For example, let us assume that growth ultimately moves to trendbut, in the interim, the continued above-trend growth increases the output gap still further. In response,policy should tighten incrementally, encouraging below trend-growth and hence unwinding the furtherincrease in the output gap.The strategy I have described would reduce the prospects of policy responding to noise is estimates ofkey real-side variables in the economy and would increase the prospects of allowing the economy torealize the full benefits of the recent improvements in aggregate supply. However, it does riskallowing excess demand to build until it shows up in inflation and may ultimately require a moreaggressive response of interest rates, if the range of attenuation does not in fact correspond to a declinein the NAIRU.ConclusionStructural change complicates the task of monetary policy. Of course, it is not difficult to put up withthis additional burden when the structural change takes the form of a decline in the NAIRU and anincrease in trend productivity growth. It would not be easy for monetary policy to turn such goodfortune into poor macroeconomic performance. But the uncertainties about the nature and degree ofstructural change confront policymakers with the task of striving to realize the benefits of a decline inthe NAIRU and an increase in trend growth while trying to avoid the inflationary consequences ofovertaxing the new limits. Recent work on signal extraction models and on the implications of noisyobservations provides some important guidance about how to adjust the strategy of monetary policy inthe face of the new uncertainties. This conference provides a timely opportunity to assess what wehave learned and how it might be applied to monetary policy today, as well as to point to areas thatmay deserve further exploration.ReferencesBrainard, W: “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy”, American Economic Review, vol. 57(1967), pp. 411-25.Estrella, A, and F Mishkin: “Rethinking the Role of NAIRU in Monetary Policy: Implications ofModel Formulation and Uncertainty”, in J B Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules.

1BIS Review 21/2000Mr Greenspan focuses on the revolution ininformation technology and its implications for key government policiesSpeech by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Boston College Conference on the New Economy, Boston, on 6 March 2000.*      *      *In the last few years it has become increasingly clear that this business cycle differs in a very profoundway from the many other cycles that have characterized post-World War II America. Not only has theexpansion achieved record length, but it has done so with economic growth far stronger than expected.Most remarkably, inflation has remained largely subdued in the face of labor markets tighter than anywe have experienced in a generation.A key factor behind this extremely favorable performance has been the resurgence in productivitygrowth. Since 1995, output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate sector has increased at an averageannual rate of 3½%, nearly double the average pace over the preceding quarter-century. Indeed, therate of growth appears to have been rising throughout the period.My remarks today will focus both on what is evidently the source of this spectacular performance - therevolution in information technology - and on its implications for key government policies.When historians look back at the latter half of the 1990s a decade or two hence, I suspect that they willconclude we are now living through a pivotal period in American economic history. New technologiesthat evolved from the cumulative innovations of the past half-century have now begun to bring aboutdramatic changes in the way goods and services are produced and in the way they are distributed tofinal users. Those innovations, exemplified most recently by the multiplying uses of the Internet, havebrought on a flood of startup firms, many of which claim to offer the chance to revolutionize anddominate large shares of the nation’s production and distribution system. And participants in capitalmarkets, not comfortable dealing with discontinuous shifts in economic structure, are groping for theappropriate valuations of these companies. The exceptional stock price volatility of these newer firmsand, in the view of some, their outsized valuations indicate the difficulty of divining the particulartechnologies and business models that will prevail in the decades ahead.How did we arrive at such a fascinating and, to some, unsettling point in history? While the process ofinnovation, of course, is never-ending, the development of the transistor after World War II appears inretrospect to have initiated a special wave of innovative synergies. It brought us the microprocessor,the computer, satellites, and the joining of laser and fiber-optic technologies. By the 1990s, these and anumber of lesser but critical innovations had, in turn, fostered an enormous new capacity to capture,analyze, and disseminate information. It is the growing use of information technology throughout theeconomy that makes the current period unique.However, until the mid-1990s, the billions of dollars that businesses had poured into informationtechnology seemed to leave little imprint on the overall economy. The investment in new technologyarguably had not yet cumulated to be a sizable part of the US capital stock, and computers were stillbeing used largely on a stand-alone basis. The full value of computing power could be realized onlyafter ways had been devised to link computers into large-scale networks. As we all know, that day hasarrived.At a fundamental level, the essential contribution of information technology is the expansion ofknowledge and its obverse, the reduction in uncertainty. Before this quantum jump in informationavailability, most business decisions were hampered by a fog of uncertainty. Businesses had limitedand lagging knowledge of customers’ needs and of the location of inventories and materials flowingthrough complex production systems. In that environment, doubling up on materials and people wasessential as a backup to the inevitable misjudgments of the real-time state of play in a company.Decisions were made from information that was hours, days, or even weeks old.
BIS Review 21/20002Of course, large voids of information still persist, and forecasts of future events on which all businessdecisions ultimately depend will always be prone to error. But information has become vastly moreavailable in real time - resulting, for example, from developments such as electronic data interfacebetween the retail checkout counter and the factory floor or the satellite location of trucks. This surgein the availability of more timely information has enabled business management to remove largeswaths of inventory safety stocks and worker redundancies. Stated differently, fewer goods andworker hours are now involved in activities that, although perceived as necessary insurance to sustainvalued output, in the end produced nothing of value.Those intermediate production and distribution activities, so essential when information and qualitycontrol were poor, are being reduced in scale and, in some cases, eliminated. These trends may wellgather speed and force as the Internet alters relationships of businesses to their suppliers and theircustomers, a topic to which I shall return in a moment.The process of information innovation has gone far beyond the factory floor and distribution channels.Computer modeling, for example, has dramatically reduced the time and cost required to design itemsranging from motor vehicles to commercial airliners to skyscrapers. In a very different part of theeconomy, medical diagnoses have become more thorough, more accurate, and far faster. With accessto heretofore unavailable information, treatment has been hastened, and hours of procedures have beeneliminated. Moreover, the potential for discovering more-effective treatments has been greatlyenhanced by the parallel revolution in biotechnology, including the ongoing effort to map the entirehuman genome. That work would have been unthinkable without the ability to store and process hugeamounts of data.The advances in information technology also have been an impetus to the ongoing wave of strategicalliance and merger activity. Hardly a week passes without the announcement of another blockbusterdeal. Many of these combinations arise directly from the opportunities created by new technology - forexample, those at the intersection of the Internet, telecommunications, and the media. It is not possibleto know which of the many new technologies will ultimately find a firm foothold in our rapidlychanging economy. Accordingly, many high-tech companies that wish to remain independent arehedging their bets by entering into strategic alliances with firms developing competing technologies.In addition, the new technology has fostered full mergers that allow firms to take greater advantage ofeconomies of scale and thus reduce costs. Without highly sophisticated information technology, itwould be nearly impossible to manage firms on the scale of some that have been proposed or actuallycreated of late. Although it will be a while before the ultimate success of these endeavors can bejudged, information technology has almost certainly pushed out the point at which scale diseconomiesbegin to take hold for some industries.The impact of information technology has been keenly felt in the financial sector of the economy.Perhaps the most significant innovation has been the development of financial instruments that enablerisk to be reallocated to the parties most willing and able to bear that risk. Many of the new financialproducts that have been created, with financial derivatives being the most notable, contributeeconomic value by unbundling risks and shifting them in a highly calibrated manner. Although theseinstruments cannot reduce the risk inherent in real assets, they can redistribute it in a way that inducesmore investment in real assets and, hence, engenders higher productivity and standards of living.Information technology has made possible the creation, valuation, and exchange of these complexfinancial products on a global basis.At the end of the day, the benefits of new technologies can be realized only if they are embodied incapital investment, defined to include any outlay that increases the value of the firm. For theseinvestments to be made, the prospective rate of return must exceed the cost of capital. Technologicalsynergies have enlarged the set of productive capital investments, while lofty equity values anddeclining prices of high-tech equipment have reduced the cost of capital. The result has been averitable explosion of spending on high-tech equipment and software, which has raised the growth ofthe capital stock dramatically over the past five years. The fact that the capital spending boom is stillgoing strong indicates that businesses continue to find a wide array of potential high-rate-of-return,
3BIS Review 21/2000productivity-enhancing investments. And I see nothing to suggest that these opportunities will peterout any time soon.Indeed, many argue that the pace of innovation will continue to quicken in the next few years, ascompanies exploit the still largely untapped potential for e-commerce, especially in the business-to-business arena, where most observers expect the fastest growth. An electronic market that wouldautomatically solicit bids from suppliers has the potential for substantially reducing search andtransaction costs for individual firms and for the economy as a whole. This reduction would mean lessunproductive search and fewer workhours more generally embodied in each unit of output, enhancingoutput per hour. Already, major efforts have been announced in the auto industry to move purchasingoperations to the Internet. Similar developments are planned or in operation in many other industriesas well. It appears to be only a matter of time before the Internet becomes the prime venue for thetrillions of dollars of business-to-business commerce conducted every year.There can be little doubt that, on balance, the evolving surge in innovation is an unmitigated good forthe large majority of the American people. Yet, implicit in the very forces of change that are bringingus a panoply of goods and services considered unimaginable only a generation ago are potentialfinancial imbalances and worker insecurities that need to be addressed if the full potential of ourtechnological largesse is to be achieved.As I testified before the Congress last month, accelerating productivity entails a matching accelerationin the potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in real incomes available topurchase the new output. The pickup in productivity however tends to create even greater increases inaggregate demand than in potential aggregate supply. This occurs principally because a rise instructural productivity growth, not surprisingly, fosters higher expectations for long-term corporateearnings. These higher expectations, in turn, not only spur business investment but also increase stockprices and the market value of assets held by households, creating additional purchasing power forwhich no additional goods or services have yet been produced.Historical evidence suggests that perhaps three to four cents out of every additional dollar of stockmarket wealth eventually is reflected in increased consumer purchases. The sharp rise in the amount ofconsumer outlays relative to disposable incomes in recent years, and the corresponding fall in thesaving rate, is a reflection of this so-called wealth effect on household purchases. Moreover, higherstock prices, by lowering the cost of equity capital, have helped to support the boom in capitalspending.Outlays prompted by capital gains in equities and homes in excess of increases in income, as best wecan judge, have added about 1 percentage point to annual growth of gross domestic purchases, onaverage, over the past half-decade. The additional growth in spending of recent years that hasaccompanied these wealth gains, as well as other supporting influences on the economy, appears tohave been met in equal measure by increased net imports and by goods and services produced by thenet increase in newly hired workers over and above the normal growth of the workforce, including asubstantial net inflow of workers from abroad.But these safety valves that have been supplying goods and services to meet the recent increments topurchasing power largely generated by capital gains cannot be expected to absorb indefinitely anexcess of demand over supply. Growing net imports and a widening current account deficit requireever-larger portfolio and direct foreign investments in the United States, an outcome that cannotcontinue without limit.Imbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for potentialinflation pressures. While the pool of officially unemployed and those otherwise willing to work maycontinue to shrink, as it has persistently over the past seven years, there is an effective limit to newhiring, unless immigration is uncapped. At some point in the continuous reduction in the number ofavailable workers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wageincreases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity. This would intensify inflationarypressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity toan end. In short, unless we are able to indefinitely increase the rate of capital flows into the United
BIS Review 21/20004States to finance rising net imports or continuously augment immigration quotas, overall demand forgoods and services cannot chronically exceed the underlying growth rate of supply.Our immediate goal at the Federal Reserve should be to encourage the economic and financialconditions that will best foster the technological innovation and investment that spur structuralproductivity growth. It is structural productivity growth - not the temporary rise and fall of output perhour associated with various stages of the business cycle - that determines how rapidly livingstandards rise over time. Achievement of this goal requires a stable macroeconomic environment ofsustained growth and continued low inflation. That, in turn, means that the expansion of demand mustmoderate into alignment with the more rapid growth rate of potential supply.The current gap between the growth of supply and demand for goods and services, of necessity, hasbeen reflected in an excess in the demand for funds over new savings from Americans, including thosesavings generated by rising budget surpluses. As a consequence, real long-term corporate borrowingcosts have risen significantly over the past two years. Presumably as a result, many analysts are nowprojecting that the rate of increase in stock market wealth may soon begin to slow. If so, the wealtheffect adding to spending growth would eventually be damped, and both the rate of increase in netimports as a share of GDP, and the rate of decline in the pool of unemployed workers willing to workshould also slow. However, so long as these two imbalances continue, reflecting the excess of demandover supply, the level of potential workers will continue to fall and the net debt to foreigners willcontinue to rise by increasing amounts.Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve, effect the necessary alignment of thegrowth of aggregate demand with the growth of potential aggregate supply, the full benefits ofinnovative productivity acceleration are at risk of being undermined by financial and economicinstability.The second consequence of rapid economic and technological change that needs to be addressed isgrowing worker insecurity, the result, I suspect, of fear of potential job skill obsolescence. Despite thetightest labor markets in a generation, more workers currently report they are fearful of losing theirjobs than similar surveys found in 1991 at the bottom of the last recession. The marked move ofcapital from failing technologies to those at the cutting edge has quickened the pace at which job skillsbecome obsolete. The completion of high school used to equip the average worker with sufficientskills to last a lifetime. That is no longer true, as evidenced by community colleges being inundatedwith workers returning to school to acquire new skills and on-the-job training being expanded andupgraded by a large proportion of American business.Not unexpectedly, greater worker insecurities are creating political pressures to reduce the fierceglobal competition that has emerged in the wake of our 1990s technology boom. Protectionistmeasures, I have no doubt, could temporarily reduce some worker anxieties by inhibiting thesecompetitive forces. However, over the longer run such actions would slow innovation and impede therise in living standards. They could not alter the eventual shifts in production that owe to enormouschanges in relative prices across the economy. Protectionism might enable a worker in a decliningindustry to hold onto his job longer. But would it not be better for that worker to seek a new career in amore viable industry at age 35 than hang on until age 50, when job opportunities would be far scarcerand when the lifetime benefits of additional education and training would be necessarily smaller? Tobe sure, assisting those who are already close to retirement in failing industries is an imperative. Butthat can be readily accomplished without distorting necessary capital flows to newer technologiesthrough protectionist measures.

1BIS Review 25/2000Mr Brash: Will the Reserve Bank choke the recovery?Address by Dr Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the AucklandRegional Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Auckland, on 21 March 2000.*      *      *IntroductionLadies and Gentlemen,I was invited to give this address after a number of pretty aggressive attacks on the Reserve Bank, onmonetary policy, and on me personally in the Auckland media in late January and early February, afterthe Bank increased the Official Cash Rate from 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent in the middle of January.Who does Don Brash, an unelected bureaucrat whose name appeared on no ballot paper in the lastelection, think he is, to be making such important decisions?Why does Don Brash refuse to engage publicly with any of the media on the issue?Why is New Zealand the only OECD country that “persists in intervention to fuel another self-inducedrecession” (this from the Auckland Chamber of Commerce itself, using the same words after ourincrease in the Official Cash Rate in January, and again after the further increase last week)?Wouldn’t life be much better if we simply did away with such intervention, and allowed pure marketforces to determine interest rates?Hasn’t the Reserve Bank, and the way in which it has run monetary policy under the Reserve BankAct of 1989, caused New Zealand’s huge balance of payments deficit, and won’t pushing up theOfficial Cash Rate simply make matters worse?Why did the Bank increase the Official Cash Rate as the economy was just beginning to emerge fromthe recession?Surely it was inappropriate to tighten policy when the Government Statistician has shown thatinflation in the latest year was below the mid-point of the 0 to 3 per cent inflation target?Why does the Reserve Bank claim the right to be the sole judge of how fast the New Zealand economycan grow?Isn’t it possible that New Zealand, like the United States and other developed countries, can now growfaster than before without inflation?These and other questions poured forth – and this despite the fact that January’s modest increase of25 basis points had already been fully priced into financial markets (as indeed last week’s adjustmentto the OCR had been also)!Some questions based on misunderstandingI welcome the opportunity to respond to these questions this morning. Some of them raise importantissues, though I think it is fair to say also that others simply reflect misunderstandings.For example, and contrary to the view once expressed by former Prime Minister David Lange, there isno sense in which Don Brash has huge or unfettered power. Parliament has made it clear that theReserve Bank must use its ability to influence monetary conditions to maintain price stability.Parliament has made it clear that what price stability means has to be the subject of a formalagreement between the Government and the Bank’s Governor. And of course, that agreement currentlyrequires me to keep the CPI inflation rate between 0 and 3 per cent (with some qualifications). TheGovernment has made it clear that that is what I have to deliver, and under the Reserve Bank Act the
BIS Review 25/20002Government has the right to change that target, unilaterally if they wish to do so, provided that anychange is made public.So any decisions which Don Brash makes are tightly constrained, are based on the best informationwhich my colleagues can gather, and are made to achieve an objective which Parliament has laiddown. In no sense am I an unconstrained bureaucrat.The suggestion that I am reluctant to engage in debate with the media arose, I suspect, because inJanuary we issued a press statement announcing and explaining the increase in the Official Cash Ratebut then declined to answer further media questions. It is always a difficult judgement about howfrequently the Bank should comment on monetary conditions “on the record”. On that occasion, I feltthat had I given an interview to one journalist I would have had to give interviews to quite a number,and I was reluctant to run the risk of sending a multiplicity of messages which might have confusedmore than it enlightened. In general, however, we are more accessible to the media than any othercentral bank that I know of, and no central bank is more transparent about the rationale for itsdecisions.And have we been the only central bank in an OECD country to adjust monetary policy in a tighteningdirection in recent times? Hardly. In the last six months, the central banks of Australia, Canada,Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Monetary Union haveall tightened monetary policy on several occasions. That in itself does not make it sensible for us totighten policy, of course, but at very least it makes it clear that what we have been doing is typical ofwhat is happening in many parts of the world.But why not let “pure market forces” determine interest rates? As somebody who has a great deal ofconfidence in market forces, it feels a bit strange to have to disagree with those who advocate lettingmarket forces be the sole determinant of interest rates. Of course, market forces do determine interestrates to a very large degree. Central banks really have a strong influence only on short-term interestrates. But why do we need central banks at all? This is not the place to give a comprehensive answerto this question.1 But it might be worth noting that, to the best of my knowledge, no country in theworld currently operates without the services of a central bank. In other words, all countries that I amaware of have their own central bank, or effectively use the services of another country’s central bank(through using that other country’s currency, or tying their own currency to that of some othercountry). And all of those central banks intervene, as we do, by influencing short-term interest rates.What about the balance of payments? Surely, the Reserve Bank and its obsession with price stabilityhave been a major contributor to the large current account deficit which New Zealand has experiencedover the last decade? Well, actually no. New Zealand has had a current account deficit in every yearsince 1974, through a range of monetary policy regimes. Indeed, the largest deficit experienced overthat 25 year period, relative to GDP, was in the mid-seventies, with another very large deficit in themid-eighties.I am myself absolutely persuaded that, even if the Reserve Bank Act were amended to make the Bankresponsible for reducing the balance of payments deficit, monetary policy has no ability to produceany sustainable reduction in that deficit. Indeed, I do not even know whether reducing a currentaccount deficit would involve tightening monetary policy (which would push up the exchange rate butslow down domestic spending) or easing monetary policy (which would tend to push down theexchange rate but accelerate domestic spending).But surely it was daft for the Reserve Bank to tighten policy just as the New Zealand economy wasemerging from a recession? Well, it might have been daft to do that if that is what we had done, but ofcourse we did not. New Zealand experienced a brief, mild, recession in the first half of 1998, insignificant part because of the impact of the Asian crisis and of a severe drought. But the economy1But see “Monetary policy and the free-market economy”, an address to the Auckland Manufacturers’ Association,22 February 1996.
3BIS Review 25/2000started growing again in the third quarter of 1998, and despite a few wobbles has been growing withincreasing vigour since that time.Most commentators believe that over calendar 1999 the economy grew by over 4 per cent, and that isin line with our own estimate. (We know that the economy grew by 3.1 per cent in the first threequarters of the year, and our Monetary Policy Statement published last week suggested that Decemberquarter GDP grew by a further 1 per cent. Many commentators are already suggesting that that 1 percent estimate will prove to be too low.) It also seems very clear that as a result of that growth the smallamount of excess productive capacity which existed in the economy through much of 1998 and 1999has now been largely, or perhaps completely, used up. A tightening of monetary policy over the lastfour months has been entirely appropriate.So those are the questions and comments with which it is pretty easy to deal.More fundamental questionsBut there are some fundamental questions which must be taken more seriously, questions about therelationship between inflation and growth which go to the heart of monetary policy decision-making.How fast can the New Zealand economy grow without generating inflation? What does 1999 tell usabout the answer to that question? Let me try to answer those questions, while acknowledging that insome areas we ourselves do not have answers. Before doing that, it may be helpful to explainsomething about the way we look at this issue.This is best illustrated in a graph.
BIS Review 25/20004The straight line A/B represents the gradual growth in the economy’s capacity to deliver goods andservices without inflation. If demand exceeds the line A/B, then prices will have a tendency to rise. Ifdemand falls short of that line, then prices will have a tendency to fall. (I say “have a tendency to rise”and “have a tendency to fall” because of course there are many other things which have an influenceon prices, including changes in international prices, changes in government charging policy, changesin tariff policies, and similar factors.)The slope of the line, in other words the trend rate of growth in the economy’s capacity to supply, islargely driven by factors like the growth in the labour force, the quality of the education system, thequality of management decision-making, the openness of the economy, the quality of the judicialsystem, the quality of the industrial relations framework, and so on. Monetary policy can help bydelivering price stability, because that helps people interpret relative price changes more easily thanthey can do in the presence of high and variable inflation, and avoids the distortions which theinteraction of inflation with the tax system often creates. But the main factors affecting trend growthare the other ones I have mentioned. Monetary policy helps at the margin by keeping prices stable.In practice, of course, A/B is not a straight line – it varies in response to a whole raft of factors,including things like changes in net migration.Like the capacity to supply, demand also tends to fluctuate – in response to changes in internationalconditions, in response to changes in public confidence, in response to changes in government policy,in response to the introduction of new inventions, in response to changes in wealth, in response to awhole host of things – and yes, in response to changes in monetary policy.The key point to note is that when demand falls short of the economy’s capacity, as at points C and E,it is possible for the economy to grow rapidly while at the same time inflation is low or falling.Conversely, when demand exceeds the economy’s capacity, as at D, it is perfectly possible for theeconomy to grow very slowly, or indeed even to shrink somewhat, while at the same time inflation isrising. It seems to me that, conceptually at least, point C represents the state of the New Zealandeconomy in the early nineties (with very rapid growth but low inflation despite a big fall in theexchange rate); D represents the state of the economy in 1996 and 1997 (with growth slowing butinflation pushing up to and beyond the top of the then 0 to 2 per cent target range); and E representswhere we have been over the last couple of years (with the economy first contracting briefly, thengrowing quite strongly, but with inflation low or falling).Seen in this light, we should perhaps not have been surprised that there was very little inflation in thesecond half of 1999, despite the fact that growth in that half of the year probably ran at an annualisedrate of over 6 per cent; or that inflation in the year as a whole was just 1.3 per cent, despite growth inthe whole year of at least 4 per cent. As already mentioned, other factors influence the inflation rate inthe short-term of course – things like international oil prices, changes in government pricing policies,and so on – but the trend inflation which is the proper focus of monetary policy is basically a functionof the relationship between demand and the economy’s capacity to supply.But of course this tells us nothing about how fast the New Zealand economy can grow withoutgenerating inflation. What is that “sustainable growth rate”? What, in other words, is the slope of theline A/B? Nobody, and certainly not the Reserve Bank, knows the answer to that question withcertainty. But because the answer to the question is so fundamental to our decisions about monetarypolicy, we can not avoid making an estimate of that sustainable growth rate. We are forced to reach ajudgement on the matter.At the present time, we estimate that the sustainable growth rate of the New Zealand economy isaround 3 per cent per annum. Of course, the economy can grow faster than that for a time if it startsfrom a situation of excess capacity, as was the case in the early nineties and was the case in mid-1998.But when that excess capacity is used up, the economy needs to slow to about the sustainable growthrate or risk inflation beginning to pick up.Some people worry that the Reserve Bank can do considerable damage to the economy by assumingtoo low a sustainable growth rate, by assuming, say, a 3 per cent growth rate where in reality theeconomy could grow at 4 or 5 per cent if only the Bank would allow demand to expand more rapidly.
5BIS Review 25/2000But if the economy is really capable of growing at 5 per cent and the Bank runs monetary policy onthe assumption that it is only capable of growing at 3 per cent, then quite quickly demand will fallbelow capacity to supply, there will be a strong tendency for prices to fall, and the inflation rate getspushed down towards the bottom of the 0 to 3 per cent target range. And since we take not goingthrough the bottom of the target as seriously as we take not going through the top, we are forced toease monetary policy to let demand expand. In other words, we can’t avoid making a judgement aboutsustainable growth, and we can’t get it wrong for too long before we are forced to adjust our estimate.Indeed, we had a rather higher estimate of the sustainable growth rate of the economy in themid-nineties but revised it down as we found inflation consistently pushing up towards, and brieflybeyond, the top of the target range. Whenever any new piece of data comes out about inflation orGDP, we look again at whether our current estimate of sustainable growth is still reasonable.What about the “new paradigm”? As discussed in our Monetary Policy Statement last week, there arethose who believe that recent US experience, with rapid growth and low inflation, points towardssome new ability for modern economies operating with the latest technology and in competition withproducers from all over the world to grow more rapidly than previously believed without inflation.Local optimists argue that New Zealand too could see more rapid growth with low inflation if only theReserve Bank were not so cautious.Others suggest that, even in the US, the conjunction of low inflation with rapid growth has reflected inlarge part the disinflationary impact of some one-off factors, such as the recent weakness in worldcommodity prices, and the recent strength of the US dollar. They note that there is not yet any strongevidence in New Zealand to suggest that there has been a significant increase in the trend rate ofproductivity growth of the sort which might be required to justify a belief in the “new paradigm” inNew Zealand.As our Statement last week noted, we are not yet persuaded that there is evidence of any fundamentalchange in the relationship between growth and inflation in New Zealand. But we are open-minded onthe issue, and will continue to examine the data for evidence of such a change. Indeed, a whole sectionof the Statement was devoted to acknowledging that, while we have no doubt about the need to reducethe stimulus which monetary policy has been providing to the economy in recent times, there is muchless certainty about how far monetary policy will need to tighten beyond the next few months.ConclusionAnd this is my main message to you today. All the evidence suggests that, after a very brief recessiontwo years ago and growth of 3 to 4 per cent per annum since the middle of 1998, the excess productivecapacity in the economy is largely gone. (In other words, referring back to my graph, we have passedpoint E and the demand line is very close indeed to the supply line.) It was appropriate that monetaryconditions were stimulatory while demand fell well short of capacity. If we are right that demand andsupply are now close to balance, however – and there is now a large body of official statistics andunofficial anecdotes supporting this view – it is high time that this stimulus was removed. And ofcourse that is what we have been seeking to do with the increases in the Official Cash Rate inNovember, January, and now in March. We project that we will need to continue this reduction instimulus, this easing back on the accelerator, over the next few months.But will we need to step on the brakes, and if so, how hard? The answer, as so often in economicmatters, is “it depends”. Our Statement projects some need for monetary policy to become restrictive,to apply the brakes, over the next year or two. But at this stage this seems likely to involve a rathermilder tightening in monetary conditions than has been the case historically.One of the reasons for this belief is that New Zealanders now carry a lot more debt, relative to theirincomes, than they did a decade ago. We are assuming a relatively moderate rate of growth inhousehold sector expenditure in the next few years as a result. In particular, we are assuming that therate at which new debt is taken on will slow down as compared with the nineties, and that increases ininterest rates will have a bigger impact on consumption expenditure and even on new house-buildingthan in the nineties.
BIS Review 25/20006Of course, we could be wrong on this assumption, in either direction. There is not much evidence yetthat increased debt levels have encouraged a slow-down in the rate at which consumption is growing,so it is possible that demand arising from the household sector will be stronger than we now project,requiring firmer monetary conditions than we now project.Conversely, debt levels may be such that even small increases in interest rates induce a slow-down inconsumption spending and in house-building, requiring monetary conditions to be rather easier thannow projected.Another important area of uncertainty is the exchange rate. At the present time, the New Zealanddollar is close to its lowest level ever, on a trade-weighted basis. There are many reasons for this. NewZealand short-term interest rates have been lower than those in several other English-speakingcountries, providing little inducement to foreigners to invest in New Zealand dollar assets. Thecommodity prices of greatest relevance to New Zealand seem to be recovering rather more slowly thando some other commodity prices. There has been some nervousness about the political environment,among investors both here and abroad. New Zealand has a large current account deficit, which lookslikely to improve only slowly.To the extent that the exchange rate is weak because of low commodity prices, we know that offsettingthe stimulus of the low exchange rate is the disinflationary effect of weak export prices. This wouldsuggest no need for monetary policy to react.On the other hand, to the extent that exchange rate weakness simply reflects other factors, such as thecurrent account deficit or nervousness about the political environment, the Bank may well need toadjust monetary policy to avoid the total demand pressures on the New Zealand economy exceedingthe country’s capacity to supply. In this event, of course, interest rates may need to rise by more thanprojected in our Statement last week, as I noted at that time.But of one thing you can be absolutely certain. The Reserve Bank has absolutely not the slightestinterest in choking off the recovery. All the evidence suggests that the economy has been growingwith increasing vigour over the last couple of years, and most commentators expect it to continuegrowing at between 3 and 4 per cent per annum for at least the next couple of years. All the evidencesuggests that, in these circumstances, it is high time to ease off the accelerator and ponder whether totouch the brakes.As Ian Macfarlane, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said recently, an alternative way ofdescribing the objective of a central bank committed to safe-guarding price stability is to say that thecentral bank wants to let the economy “grow as fast as possible without breaking the inflationobjective, but no faster”.2 That is exactly how I see the mission of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.Price stability is not an end in itself. Rather, it has always been the best contribution which monetarypolicy can make to allowing the economy to grow at its maximum sustainable pace.2Speech by Mr Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the CEDA annual general meeting dinner,Melbourne, 28 November 1996.
1BIS Review 28/2000Mr Noyer: Monetary policymaking in the euro areaSpeech delivered by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at ParetoFonds’ 2000 Economic Forum, Oslo, on 23 March 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,It is a pleasure and an honour for me to speak here at the Pareto Fonds’ 2000 Economic Forum inOslo. The economic conferences organised by the Pareto Fonds have an outstanding reputation forpresenting a unique opportunity for investors, economists and policymakers to conduct an in-depthexchange of views on current issues of monetary policy.In January 1999 the euro was successfully launched as the single currency for the 11 countriescomprising the euro area. For more than a year, the Eurosystem, which includes the European CentralBank (ECB) and the 11 national central banks (NCBs) of the countries which have introduced theeuro, has been in charge of the single monetary policy for the euro area. Of course, it is much too earlyto make a detailed assessment of the achievements of the single monetary policy. Nevertheless, thefirst 15 months of the euro have been encouraging and there are good reasons to look to the futurewith optimism. Owing to very careful technical and conceptual preparations, both the monetarypolicymaking process and the implementation of monetary policy decisions have functionedefficiently from the very outset. At the same time, there can be no doubt that there is room for furtherimprovement and that important challenges still lie ahead.In my remarks today, I shall describe the main features of monetary policymaking in the euro area,focusing in particular on the monetary policy objectives of the Eurosystem, the stability-orientedmonetary policy strategy and on some of the communication issues raised by the strategy. Moreover, Ishall briefly highlight the current economic outlook for the euro area.Price stability as the primary objective of the single monetary policy of the EurosystemThe Treaty establishing the European Community clearly states that the primary objective of the singlemonetary policy shall be to maintain price stability. Furthermore, the Treaty requires that, withoutprejudice to the objective of price stability, the Eurosystem shall support the general economic policiesin the European Community with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Community. The latterinclude, inter alia, sustainable and non-inflationary growth and a high level of employment.The Treaty therefore establishes a clear sequence of objectives for the monetary policy of theEurosystem, with price stability unambiguously being the sine qua non. Such an assignment of tasks toa central bank is nothing extraordinary. On the contrary, it reflects the consensus which has emergedover the last two decades to the effect that maintaining price stability is the best contribution monetarypolicy can make to sustainable and non-inflationary output growth and employment perspectives.The belief that monetary policy should be geared towards price stability is firmly rooted in economictheory which clearly demonstrates the costs of inflation, both in terms of allocative inefficiencies andarbitrary redistribution effects. At the same time, these arguments suggest that maintaining pricestability in itself contributes to higher growth and employment. Several empirical studies haveconcluded that, across a large number of countries, it is on average those with lower inflation whichappear to grow more rapidly.While there is a widespread agreement on the benefits of price stability, it is less clear exactly whatprice stability means. In the context of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB defined price stability as “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%”. According to this definition, price stability“is to be maintained over the medium term”.
BIS Review 28/20002The phrase “below 2%” clearly delineates the upper bound for the rate of measured inflation in theHICP, which is consistent with price stability. At the same time, the use of the word “increase” in thedefinition clearly signals that deflation, i.e. prolonged declines in the level of the HICP, would not bedeemed consistent with price stability.The main reason for not aiming at a measured inflation rate of zero is what is known as the“measurement bias”, which can exist in consumer price indices. These biases arise mainly fromchanging spending patterns and quality improvements in those goods and services which are includedin the basket used to define a specific price index. Such biases cannot always be fully corrected in theconstruction of price indices. The measurement bias typically causes consumer price indices (CPIs) tooverstate slightly the “true” rate of inflation. While the measurement bias of the HICP is likely to belower than that observed in the national CPIs of the countries comprising the euro area, we cannotcompletely neglect it. Nevertheless, there are as yet no conclusive studies on the size of themeasurement bias of the HICP for the euro area. This is the main reason why the Governing Councilof the ECB did not announce an explicit lower bound for its definition of price stability.In the literature there are also some economic arguments in favour of a slightly positive rate ofinflation. First, it has been argued that the existence of downward nominal rigidity in wages impliesthat inflation is required to ensure downward flexibility of real wages, thereby allowing resources tobe allocated efficiently across different economic sectors in response to changes in technology andconsumer preferences. Second, it has been put forward that a modestly positive rate of inflation isrequired to ensure that monetary policy can always engineer negative real interest rates, should this berequired. There are good and well-known reasons not to overstate these arguments. At the same time,the definition of price stability chosen by the Governing Council allows for moderately positiveinflation below 2%.The Governing Council underlined the fact that price stability is to be maintained over the mediumterm. In the short term, the inflation rate can be influenced by one-off factors outside the control of thecentral bank, such as changes in indirect taxes or movements in commodity prices. Moreover,monetary policy impulses exert their influence on the overall price level only with considerabletime-lags. Hence, monetary policy cannot avoid short-term deviations from inflation rates consistentwith price stability.The two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the EurosystemThe intrinsic challenge for central banking is the need to look ahead. Were monetary policy only toreact when inflationary pressures are already visible, it would always be too late, as interest ratechanges show their full impact on prices only after around six to eight quarters. Moreover, it wouldhave to react much more strongly than in the event of a timely action. The past experience withstop-go policies, widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, clearly illustrates the negative side effects interms of a high volatility of inflation and output.A forward-looking monetary policy requires a structured approach in order to interpret and synthesiseall the information relevant for an assessment of the outlook for price developments; in other words, itrequires a well-founded monetary policy strategy. The strategy of the Eurosystem is based on twopillars, the first being a prominent role for money and the second a broadly based assessment of theoutlook for price developments.To give money a prominent role in its monetary policy analysis is quite a natural thing for a centralbank geared towards price stability to do, because inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon. Theimportant role assigned to money is reflected in the announcement of a reference value of 4½% for theannual growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. Current M3 growth is analysed and interpreted inrelation to this reference value. Under normal conditions, substantial or prolonged deviations ofmonetary growth from the reference value would signal risks to price stability over the medium term.For the euro area, this relationship is empirically well-founded. The available econometric evidencesuggests the existence of a stable relationship between M3, the euro area price level and a small
3BIS Review 28/2000number of other area-wide macroeconomic variables. Moreover, there is good evidence with regard toleading indicator properties of M3 for future price developments.While there can be no doubt about the relevance of monetary growth for inflation in the medium term,short-term changes in the stock of money may be influenced by factors unrelated to future spendingand future inflation. Thus, the Eurosystem does not react mechanically to short-term deviations ofmonetary growth from the reference value. Instead, monetary developments are analysed verycarefully in order to extract their information content for future inflation. If this analysis clearly wereto suggest that monetary developments indicate a threat to future price stability, monetary policywould respond in a manner appropriate to counter the risk.Although the monetary data contain information vital to informed monetary policymaking, on theirown they will not normally constitute a complete summary of all the economic information required toset an appropriate monetary policy for the maintenance of price stability. Thus, in parallel with theanalysis of monetary growth in relation to the reference value, a broadly based assessment of theoutlook for price developments and the risks to price stability in the euro area play a major role in theEurosystem’s strategy. This assessment is made on the basis of a wide range of variables which haveleading indicator properties for future price developments, including, inter alia, wages, unit labourcosts, bond prices, the yield curve, fiscal policy indicators, various measures of real activity, price andcost indices.Let me take this opportunity to stress that the Governing Council of the ECB considers the euroexchange rate an important indicator within the second pillar of the Eurosystem’s strategy. It is closelymonitored and influences monetary policy decisions, as it can have implications for the outlook forprice stability in the euro area. Changes in the exchange rate can influence the outlook for pricedevelopments both directly, through their impact on import prices, and indirectly, through their effectson trade. Against this background, the prolonged depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro sincethe beginning of 1999 is indeed a cause for concern and is being carefully taken into account in ourdiscussion on the appropriate monetary policy stance.Another element of the second pillar is macroeconomic forecasts. Given the forward-looking nature ofthe stability-oriented strategy, the Eurosystem follows closely the forecasts prepared by internationalorganisations, market participants and others. In addition, it also produces its own forecasts. Forecastsare an indispensable tool for efficient information processing. They help to summarise and synthesisea large quantity of information which may otherwise become too unwieldy to form a sensible basis forpolicy discussion. At the same time, however, it should be recognised that the role of forecasts in theEurosystem’s monetary strategy is clearly limited. It certainly cannot be compared with that played inthe context of inflation targeting. An inflation forecast can never be a sufficient statistical summary ofall the information which policymakers require in order to take appropriate monetary policy decisions.To give only one example, it is extremely hard to integrate the information relating to monetarydevelopments in a meaningful way in macroeconomic forecasts. Furthermore, it is often crucial tounderstand the nature of the factors which affect future price developments in order to assess the risksto price stability in the medium term. Thus, one can certainly not expect the Eurosystem to react toinflation forecasts in a mechanical way.One criticism which is frequently raised by external observers refers to the complexity of the strategyjust described. I agree that our strategy is complex but this honestly reflects the complexity of themonetary policy environment of the Eurosystem. While a forward-looking monetary policy is bydefinition complicated, its complexity is reinforced by the fact that the Governing Council of the ECBhas to assess the monetary policy situation for a large and diverse single currency area consisting of11 different countries. Moreover, owing to the impact of the introduction of the euro on the behaviourof economic agents and on the evolution of the institutional environment, we are faced with arelatively high degree of uncertainty with regard to the economic relationships which are relevant formonetary policy. Finally, the database for area-wide statistics is still relatively narrow by comparisonwith what central banks are accustomed to, at least in the industrialised world. Against thisbackground, the two-pillar strategy of the Eurosystem has the advantage of being relatively resilient tothese different forms of uncertainty.
BIS Review 28/20004Issues of communication policyIt is widely acknowledged today that communication policies belong to the core tasks of any centralbank. For some years now, transparency has been one of the catchwords of central banking. This isclosely related to the fact that, with more and more central banks becoming independent, the issue ofaccountability has gained equal importance. Accountability is in turn facilitated by a high degree oftransparency. Not only those institutions to which a central bank is formally accountable, but alsomarket participants and the public at large can make an assessment of the situation more easily if acentral bank pursues its primary objective in an appropriate way. Hence, a high degree of transparencyalso facilitates the creation of credibility and, via its impact on the expectation-forming process,increases the efficiency of monetary policy.Against this background, the Governing Council of the ECB has committed itself to being open,transparent and accountable for its decisions and its performance vis-à-vis the European public and theEuropean Parliament, the public’s elected representative. We are well aware of the fact that, becauseof both the complexity of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy and the plurality of the audiences - whichare accustomed to different communication forms - to which it is addressed, extraordinary efforts arerequired to explain the monetary policy considerations of the Governing Council on a regular basis inthe most transparent way possible. While trying hard, we have certainly not yet overcome all theteething problems in this regard. All of us, however, are determined to continue to strive forimprovement and I am convinced that we will make further progress in speaking with only one voice.Often, however, the critics of the Eurosystem’s communication policy do not refer to concretesituations, but claim that the Eurosystem’s general approach to communication is inherently lacking intransparency. In this context I have the impression that the whole discussion regarding thetransparency of monetary policy has become rather narrowly focused, associating transparency onlywith very specific communication tools, namely the publication of minutes and of inflation forecasts.It is sometimes forgotten that central banks have various instruments at their disposal for informingthe public in an honest, clear and understandable way of the considerations and motivationsunderlying their monetary policy decisions.One major tool of the communication policy of the Eurosystem is the press conference which thePresident of the ECB and I hold regularly following the first Governing Council meeting of eachmonth. On these occasions, the President makes an introductory statement, in which he explains thedecisions of the Governing Council on the basis of its assessment of the latest information onmonetary, financial market and other economic developments. In my view, the introductory statementis very similar to what other central banks call summary minutes. This statement is followed by aquestions and answer session, giving the journalists the opportunity to question the President or myselfon any issue. This press conference provides a forum for presenting policy decisions as promptly aspossible. The fact that some academics also recommend this procedure to other central banks cancertainly be regarded as a positive assessment of our approach.Another key instrument of our communication policy is the ECB Monthly Bulletin. The MonthlyBulletin is intended to provide the public with a thorough assessment of the economic situation as wellas with articles covering topical issues important for the single monetary policy. Moreover, speechessuch as this one today and other public appearances of members of the Executive Board, for exampleat hearings of the European Parliament, are an important channel of communication with the public.The ECB also participates actively in academic debate. Finally, a lot of information is accessible onthe ECB’s website.All in all, the information supplied by the ECB goes beyond the requirements of the Treatyestablishing the European Community. Against this background, it is not clear to me which additionalrelevant information academics and financial market participants hope to obtain from the publicationsof minutes and voting records. On the contrary, there is a non-negligible risk that focusing too muchon individual words and deeds, i.e. the voting behaviour, is likely to obscure the clarity and coherenceof the Council’s policy signals. Moreover, the publication of voting records could lead to pressurebeing brought to bear on the governors of the NCBs by national politicians and interest groups. This,
5BIS Review 28/2000in turn, could endanger the euro area focus which all members of the Governing Council committedthemselves to right from the outset, as well as the open and productive character of our discussions.With regard to the calls for a publication of inflation forecasts, I should like to stress that, in order tobe a helpful communication tool, the publication of forecasts requires extremely careful preparation.Not only must it be guaranteed that the forecasts are of sufficient quality, the public also has to beeducated on how to read a forecast. A misunderstanding of the fundamental assumptions underlying aforecast or a misinterpretation of the role of the forecast in the context of the overall strategy caneasily lead to a situation where the interpretation of the Governing Council’s monetary policydecisions is not facilitated, but complicated. This is why the Eurosystem decided not to beginpublishing forecasts from the very beginning of Stage Three.Monetary and economic developments in the euro areaLet me now turn to the monetary and economic developments in the euro area. Exactly one week ago,on 16 March 2000, the Governing Council decided to raise the ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.This decision addressed the upside risks to price stability as signalled by both pillars of the monetarypolicy strategy. Last week’s increase in ECB interest rates followed the interest rate decisions taken on4 November 1999 and 3 February 2000 and continued the policy of countering these emerging upsiderisks to price stability in a timely manner. Thereby, it contributed to maintaining the favourableoutlook for the euro area economy.The following factors contributed to the latest interest rate decision. With regard to the first pillar, thethree-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 exceeded the reference value of4½% throughout 1999 and in January 2000. The prolonged deviation of M3 growth from the referencevalue signalled the existence of ample liquidity in the euro area. This is especially true when seen inconjunction with the continued strong growth of credit granted to the private sector, at an annual rateof around 10%.With regard to the second pillar, most indicators and forecasts pointed to increasing upward pressureson consumer price inflation over the medium term. The strong rise in oil prices and the downwardmovement of the exchange rate of the euro in the past put upward pressure on import costs andproducer prices. In the context of a strong cyclical upswing, these developments could, viasecond-round effects, have lasting effects on consumer price inflation.As expected, consumer price inflation saw a further increase in the first two months of this year, withannual HICP inflation reaching 2.0% in February, after 1.9% in January and 1.7% in December 1999.The rise this year is largely accounted for by a further increase in oil prices and its effect on energyprices in the HICP. It is reinforced by base effects from declining oil prices at the turn of the year1998/99. Oil prices increased further in early March, and in so doing will continue to place upwardpressure on consumer prices in the short term.The past movements of the exchange rate of the euro have increasingly become a cause for concern forprice stability through their effect on import prices and producer prices. In the first half of March, thenominal effective exchange rate was 12.2% below the level recorded for the first quarter of 1999.Overall, the upward pressures on consumer price inflation were regarded to have become greater andmore protracted than previously foreseen. Against this background, the interest rate steps taken can beunderstood as pre-emptive measures aimed at maintaining price stability in the medium term.Currently, the prospects for strong economic growth are very favourable. The strengthening ofeconomic activity in the euro area in the second half of 1999 was confirmed by a first estimate of euroarea real GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 1999. Real GDP is estimated to have increased by0.9% quarter-on-quarter, following an increase of 1.0% in the previous quarter. In addition, the latestsurvey data indicate a continued improvement in economic activity. Area-wide industrial confidenceincreased further in the first two months of this year; it has now recovered from the effect of theslowdown in 1998-99 and stands again at the previous peak of April 1998. Moreover, the PurchasingManagers’ Index signals improved business conditions in the manufacturing sector. The cyclical
BIS Review 28/20006upswing should extend well into 2000 and continue thereafter. This is also confirmed by the availableforecasts, which indicate a real GDP growth of slightly over 3% in 2000, reflecting both thefavourable external environment and buoyant domestic demand. As for 2001, the economic expansionin the euro area is generally expected to continue at a similar pace.In this environment, employment is expected to increase further and the still very high level ofunemployment should continue to fall. Thus far, recent wage growth has been moderate and the sameapplies for actual wage settlements to date. It remains important not to jeopardise the expectedimprovements in economic conditions and labour market prospects through inappropriate wagesettlements. In fact, wage moderation would help both to contain inflation in the euro area and lead tofurther progress in employment creation.With regard to fiscal policies, the current upswing provides a good opportunity to comply morequickly with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, and thereby to add substantively to thefavourable economic conditions.Let me conclude by stressing that economic conditions and prospects for the euro area appear to bebetter at present than at any time in the past decade. Growth is strong, employment is expected toincrease further and the still high level of unemployment should continue to fall. Maintaining pricestability and pursuing structural reform is the foundation for a sustained period of strong economicexpansion and a lasting process of job creation.
1BIS Review 27/2000Mr O’Connell gives a review on the euro andthe European Central Bank and makes a fewbrief remarks on the world economyStatement by Mr Maurice O’Connell, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the IrishParliament’s Joint Committee on European Affairs, Dublin, on 23 February 2000.*      *      *Before I speak about the euro and the European Central Bank, may I make a few brief remarks on theworld economy. The outlook is quite positive. The US economy has surprised even the mostoptimistic of observers. Growth was of the order of 4% last year and inflation remains low. Europeappears to have turned the corner and to be on a path of stable, if unspectacular, growth. The Europeaneconomy should expand by 3% this year and this should be sustained in 2001. The Far East generallyis recovering, though the recovery in Japan appears to be very tentative.As always, there are risks. In the US, factors such as the persistent balance of payments deficit or adeclining stock market could undermine success. Europe must address vigorously the structuraldeficiencies that are a dead hand on the economy. Japan has yet to demonstrate convincingly thatreforms, including consolidation of the financial sector, are beginning to work.At the international level generally, the succession of economic crises in recent years has prompted theauthorities to review comprehensively the whole international financial architecture. Central to thisresponse have been efforts to improve the quality and availability of economic and financial data andstrengthen financial regulation. This is underpinned by institutional developments, such as the creationof two new bodies - the Financial Stability Forum and the G20. This is not today’s subject. I mentionit, however, because there will be changes ahead which will enforce new standards of regulation andtransparency worldwide.The euroIt is against this background that we should assess the progress of the euro. The new currency is nowin its second year. It is an accepted element of the international financial system, being the secondlargest currency - second only to the US dollar and ahead of the yen. The euro area has an internalmarket of about 290 million people, some 20 million more than the US. Exports from the area accountfor almost 20% of world exports. In 1999 the euro became the most popular currency for new bonds ininternational markets, accounting for some 45%, compared with 42% in US dollars.While the launch of the euro has been a remarkable success, the first year has not been withoutdifficulty. During 1999, it weakened by 14% against the dollar, while, in overall terms, the effectiveexchange rate was down by about 13%. Currency developments largely reflected an unexpecteddivergence in economic performance between the US and the euro area. Growth in the US economyaccelerated beyond expectations in 1999, while the expected recovery in the euro area economy wasslow. Stock markets in the US lent further support to the dollar while outward investment from theeuro area weighed on the euro. It was also weighed down by the impression that structuralimpediments were retarding economic activity in Europe. Besides, it did not help matters that, in theearly days, there was a variety of spokespersons with different prescriptions for the new currency.Most commentators accept that the currency is now significantly undervalued and that the tide willturn.The question is sometimes asked whether the absence of political integration is a drawback to thecurrency. Perhaps there is some disadvantage; all other major international currencies are underwrittenby political union. I would not wish to exaggerate the significance of this.
BIS Review 27/20002The integration of financial markets within the euro area is going ahead at different speeds in differentmarkets. While the money market has been unified quickly, the bond market is still not fullyintegrated. Market structures differ and most of the smaller countries do not have sufficient issue sizesto achieve benchmark status. Investors have a preference for the larger markets, where there is greaterliquidity. This is not to our advantage.Equity markets are least advanced in terms of integration. For many stocks, national considerations arestill important. In time, however, trading may become concentrated in a small number of larger centresand the existence of small equity markets may be put in doubt. In this context, the ability of nationalmarkets to be competitive, especially in terms of transaction costs, will be a very important factor.EMU has brought these issues of competition to the fore and increased the urgency of resolving themsuccessfully. These developments are a source of concern to us because of the tendency towardscentralisation.The European Central Bank is realising its primary objective, which is to maintain price stabilitywithin the euro area. Although the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) rose by 1.7% in theyear to December 1999, this was boosted by a rise of over 10% in energy prices. While the Bank doesnot target an exchange rate for the US dollar or any other currency, it would be entirely wrong toimply that it pursues an attitude of benign neglect or is indifferent to the exchange rate. A strong eurois in Europe’s interest and in Ireland’s interest. The more stable it is at home, the better its prospectson the international stage.Credibility is never easy. In the normal course, it is built on a good track record. One obvious measureof credibility for a currency is long-term interest rates. In this respect the euro is faring well. It isevident that the financial markets believe that stability will be maintained within the euro area.Ireland and the euroThe Irish economy is just one percent of the total euro area economy. It follows that Irish experiencewill not greatly influence nor dictate policy. Our experience up to now has been decidedly differentfrom that of the euro area generally, because of the scale of economic growth here in recent years. Asa consequence, we have had to adjust to a monetary policy which, in the short term, is not well suitedto Irish conditions. There is nothing that we can do about this in terms of tightening monetary policy.We cannot raise interest rates unilaterally to suit our circumstances. While euro interest rates haverisen in recent months, they remain substantially below what the Central Bank would consider asappropriate here in the present buoyant conditions. There is no longer an Irish exchange rate. Wecannot impose formal ceilings or restrictions on the growth in credit, which is running at a veryuncomfortable rate. We do require the lending institutions, however, to observe good prudentialstandards.As monetary policy is no longer determined to suit Irish conditions, our economy is more vulnerablethan before to overheating and the consequences of this - inflation and a loss of competitiveness. TheCentral Bank’s ability to take corrective action is severely restricted. A greater onus is now placed onother factors, such as fiscal and incomes policies. In particular, there is a greater need to use fiscalpolicy to contain strong demand. Continuing economic success must not blind us to the reality that weare in a new regime which, sooner or later, may demand from us disciplines to which we areunaccustomed.Because of the uncertainties linked to sterling, it would be to our advantage if the UK were to join theeuro area sooner rather than later. The indications are, however, that the UK is unlikely to become amember at an early stage. Besides, if it should decide to join, it will presumably have to satisfy entryrequirements in relation to the exchange rate and central bank independence. Sterling has been verystrong against the euro, contrary to earlier expectations. This is to our advantage in the short term tothe extent that it facilitates exports. It also raises the prospect of importing inflation. Taking alonger-term perspective, we need to be prepared for the possibility that in due course a decliningsterling may intensify competition.
3BIS Review 27/2000European Central BankDecisions on monetary policy issues in the euro area rest with the Governing Council of the EuropeanCentral Bank. Within the requirement of price stability, the Bank also has a duty to facilitate growthand employment. Stability has been defined by the Bank as an inflation rate not exceeding 2% in themedium term. The Bank also has a reference value for monetary growth as part of its overall strategy.I said already that the Bank does not target an exchange rate for the euro. Obviously, if the rate wereseriously out of line with economic realities or if there were extreme volatility, there would be somecorrective action. This would not arise in normal circumstances.In the European Central Bank there is a genuine commitment to transparency. This is reflected in theextensive published information and in the regular and detailed press briefings. The President attendsbefore the European Parliament. He is also present, as required, at meetings of EcoFin and theEuro-11 Ministers. Some members of the Governing Council attend periodically before their nationalparliaments. It would serve no useful purpose, in my opinion, to publish minutes of Council meetingsand the voting records of individual members. This could inhibit discussion and possibly imposeundue pressures on members to reflect a national viewpoint. This would be contrary to the spirit andthe letter of economic and monetary union.ReservesOn the previous occasion that I came before this Committee, I referred to the perception that therewould be a large surplus of free reserves when we joined EMU. This is a rather complex subject. Theposition is as follows.We have already contributed 467 million euro to the capital and foreign reserves of the EuropeanCentral Bank. In practice, we retain and manage these funds here. They do not belong to us; theybelong to the ECB. In addition, we hold and manage our own foreign exchange reserves and euroassets which, at the end of 1999 totalled nearly 7½ billion euro. On top of this, we also have assetsarising largely from the conduct of the money market. In short, the total assets of the Bank amount to12.75 billion euro. For the greater part, these are matched by liabilities in the form of currency, bankdeposits and Government deposits. The excess of assets over liabilities is represented by capital andinternal reserves. These totalled 2½ billion euro at end-1999. This is the figure to which the term “freereserves” is applied. This is the capital which supports the Bank. It is also a buffer against changes inthe value of external reserves, arising from movements in the euro vis-à-vis other currencies. Relativeto the size of our balance sheet, this figure is at the lower end of the scale vis-à-vis other euro areanational central banks.The national central banks in the Eurosystem no longer conduct foreign exchange intervention. It isfair to ask, therefore, whether they now have surplus external assets. There is a recognition that thisquestion should be addressed in due course. These reserves are subject to call by the European CentralBank. In all likelihood it will make a further call for additional capital and foreign reserves. It wouldseem preferable therefore that the issue of superfluous reserves be settled at the general European levelrather than taking unilateral action.Our external reserves are denominated, for the greater part in US dollars and to a much lesser extent insterling and yen. There is also a small quantity of gold. The reserves are invested in deposits andsecurities and are managed by reference to an independent benchmark. The Central Bank has a verygood record in managing large-scale funds. In respect of 1998 we earned a surplus of 225 million euro(IR£177 million), mainly from investment of reserves and interest. Of this, 193 million euro wastransferred to the Exchequer.Banknotes and coinTo most people the euro probably remains largely academic until it is available in their pockets. It isstill considered a currency in transition. In less than two years from now the new banknotes and coinwill have begun to replace national currencies. The impact will be huge at local level; immediately the
BIS Review 27/20004euro will become the concern of everybody. May I remind you that the largest banknote will be500 euro (roughly £400) and the smallest coin will be one cent (which is 4/5 of a penny). There will beseven banknotes and eight coins.Our production arrangements are already well in hand. In recent years we have invested more than£30  million in new plant and machinery. Coin production is under way since last autumn; we plan tobegin the production of euro banknotes in April. We must provide, for our own initial needs, almost200 million euro notes and over 900 million coins. We also must maintain an adequate supply of Irishnotes and coin up to the end of next year. Despite the competition from electronic money, the demandfor notes and coin continues to well exceed the growth in the economy. There have been some reportsin recent months about a shortage of coin. There are 2,400 million coins in circulation. Last year weissued 236 million, which represents 60 additional coins for every person in the country.Overall, the entry into EMU has had a profound impact on organisation and work practices in theCentral Bank of Ireland. The euro is now the currency of the State. The Irish pound is now adenomination of the euro and it is no longer traded on the foreign exchange market. There is constantdaily interaction with the European Central Bank. Our personnel serve on a wide range of EuropeanCentral Bank committees. The Eurosystem is quite unique; while policy is determined collectively inFrankfurt, it is implemented on a decentralised basis by the national central banks. It is important thatthis emphasis on decentralisation is not eroded over time.The Irish economyI have said earlier that within the euro area Ireland continues to be the grand exception because of ourrate of economic growth. Studies undertaken by the Central Bank suggest that, for the medium term,we have the capacity to sustain a growth rate of the order of 4-5%. This is about twice the estimatedpotential growth rate for most European economies. The exceptional growth over and above this forthe past few years was made possible by a high degree of slack in the economy and in particular, by arather low employment rate. This good performance contributed to a welcome increase in livingstandards and employment. Now, however, there is mounting evidence of overheating in the domesticeconomy. This is reflected in exceptionally rapid increases in property prices, unprecedented demandfor credit, labour shortages, higher inflation in the services sector and chronic congestion in thephysical infrastructure.During the past year, there has been a marked disimprovement in our inflation performance, both inabsolute terms and by reference to our main trading partners. In January, the rate of inflation here, asmeasured by the HICP, the benchmark index for euro area comparisons, was 4.4%. This was two anda half times the rate prevailing in the euro area as a whole. This puts us at the top of the league table.Some of the rise in headline inflation can be ascribed to once-off or temporary factors - such as the risein excise duty on cigarettes, higher oil prices and weakness in the euro. There is, however, a strongrise in underlying inflation which for the most part reflects the existence of strong demand.Nobody claims that inflation here must be at precisely the same level as in the euro area generally. It isreasonable to expect some differential at this time in view of our economic conditions but there areobvious limits. The point I want to emphasise is that, if present trends persist, we may have a sharploss of competitiveness on our hands.One of the inevitable consequences of an integrated European economy and a single currency is thestrong tendency to centralise financial activities in the larger centres and an increase in cross-bordercompetition. This is a threat to the Irish financial services industry, which has been expandingvigorously in recent years. It is compounded by the pressures within the industry for mergers andacquisitions, which are driven by new technology and the perceived benefits of economics of scale. Iwould like to believe that in ten years from now we will continue to have a vibrant indigenousfinancial services industry. I would be optimistic that the International Financial Services Centre willcontinue to grow and evolve as an integral part of our financial system.
5BIS Review 27/2000ConclusionAfter years of preparation, EMU is now a reality. In time, we will undoubtedly benefit from being partof an economy whose currency has a leading international status. We will benefit also from internalprice stability and the security that this brings. We must not lose sight of the reality, however, thatmembership of the euro area also imposes new disciplines, which will be put to the test at some stage.There is no provision in the Eurosystem for a bail-out in the event that any member encounters seriouseconomic difficulties. We can no longer fall back on the exchange rate or interest rates. We can nolonger control credit. These options are gone. Having said this, the advantages of being part of theeuro area should well outweigh the disadvantages in the long term. I am confident that we will cometo realise this more and more as time goes on.
1BIS Review 17/2000Mr Meyer looks at the prospects forstrengthening risk management for derivativesSpeech by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Derivatives Risk Management Symposium, Institute on Law and FinancialServices, Fordham University School of Law, New York, on 25 February 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be with you today. These conferences sponsored by the Institute on Law andFinancial Services bring together a diverse group of individuals with interests in banking and financialmarkets, facilitating discussion of issues that cut across disciplines. This year’s program, whichexplores topics associated with risk management for derivatives, is no exception.The events in markets during the last few years have given market participants and policymakersample incentive to reevaluate risk management procedures related to derivatives. The collapse ofLong-Term Capital Management prompted studies by the President’s Working Group on FinancialMarkets, the banking and securities supervisors, and private market participants. With its study ofLTCM behind it, the President’s Working Group released a long-awaited report that evaluates theregulatory framework for over-the-counter derivatives.A major focus of these efforts has been the challenge of managing counterparty credit risk - that is, therisk that a counterparty will not settle an obligation for full value, either when the obligation is due orat any time thereafter. The policies and procedures within individual firms and the techniques bywhich individual firms measure and manage counterparty risk, are prominent themes in both the reportby the President’s Working Group on hedge funds and the guidance from bank supervisors thatfollowed LTCM. However, less focus has been placed on the ways in which collective efforts tostrengthen market infrastructure could reduce risk. This is a central theme of the President’s WorkingGroup report on OTC derivatives. Its recommendations would enable market participants, workingtogether, to develop new trading and clearing structures. The private-sector group known as theCounterparty Risk Management Policy Group (CRMPG) also calls for important cooperative effortsrelated to collateral programs, as does the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).My focus this afternoon will be on the importance of collective efforts to strengthen marketinfrastructure as part of the overall approach to the risk management of derivative transactions.At first, these two strands of inquiry may appear to have little in common. On reflection, however, wesee that both attempt to broaden the range of tools that market participants use to manage the risksarising from OTC derivative activity. One set of studies and recommendations takes the perspective ofindividual firms and offers steps that firms can implement themselves to enhance risk management.The Working Group’s OTC study highlights ways in which collective efforts could enhance riskmanagement.1.Collective action to strengthen market infrastructureToday’s OTC infrastructure remains decentralized; trades are executed and settled bilaterally. Areview of that infrastructure reveals weaknesses or limitations in existing practices. Some of theseweaknesses can be, and are being, addressed by individual firms. Other weaknesses requirecooperation and collective action by firms. For example, firms could reduce risk and increaseefficiency as they improve their individual back office procedures. Risk could also be reduced throughcentralized mechanisms to execute and settle trades. Regulatory, legal, and operational barrierscurrently prevent some of these mechanisms from being used. Many of the recommendations in theWorking Group’s report on OTC derivatives would remove unnecessary legal and regulatory barriersto such innovations.
BIS Review 17/20002A challenge that policymakers always face in such times is to let markets evolve naturally and torefrain from attempting to dictate changes. The recommendations in the Working Group’s reportreflect this evolutionary philosophy. My goal today is to review areas in which improvements arepossible and to highlight the role that public policymakers can play.2.TradingStatus quo. The status quo for the trading of OTC derivatives is a system of telephones and voicebrokers. It is a bit incongruous that the financial instruments employing the most sophisticatedasset-pricing technology are traded, by and large, by means of the lowest technology. Most OTCderivative transactions are executed by telephone between the traders acting for the two counterparties.Conversations are almost invariably recorded, and these recordings are used as evidence of theexistence and terms of a trade if disputes arise. Traders are responsible for ensuring that prospectivedeals fall within credit lines for the counterparty and within overall trading limits. Firms have widelyvarying means for ensuring compliance with credit limits. Some firms have on-line systems throughwhich traders can check the availability of credit lines. In other firms, the process is manual, andtraders apply to a relationship officer before executing a trade.Voice brokers are used in some transactions, most frequently for common and relatively standardizedtransactions. Brokers frequently are used for single-currency interest rate swaps and forward rateagreements. As in the spot foreign exchange markets, brokers are used to locate counterparties forthese trades. They do not act as principal. Once counterparties who are willing to transact at the quotedprice have been identified, brokers reveal their names so that they can determine if each other’s creditquality is acceptable and if the exposure can be accommodated within credit limits. As you see,automation of trading is limited in the OTC derivatives market.Trading systems for foreign exchange. Among financial products, foreign exchange probably hasrecorded the most dramatic shifts in trading mechanisms in the last few years. The volume of foreignexchange traded through electronic brokering systems has grown rapidly and now accounts for somethree-quarters of the trading in major markets. Besides these systems in the interdealer market, foreignexchange dealers also have developed electronic trading facilities for customers. Most bank dealers inforeign exchange have websites that allow their customers to trade electronically. Electronic tradingbetween customers does not seem to be happening, although systems reportedly are underdevelopment.Despite the enthusiasm with which electronic enhancements to trading have been embraced in the spotforeign exchange market, vendors have not successfully extended their services to derivative productsinvolving foreign exchange. A service for the trading of forward foreign exchange has attractedmeager volumes, as has a service for the trading of forward rate agreements. The latter service hasbeen hampered by its inability to offer its products in the United States. If the recommendations of thePresident’s Working Group were enacted, this trading system would be excluded from the CommodityExchange Act (CEA), and the legal status of products offered through the service would be clear,likely enhancing its attractiveness.Trading systems for swaps. Development of electronic trading systems for swaps also is likely beinghampered by the potential application of the CEA. The CFTC has raised questions about theapplicability of the CEA to a system that electronically matches swap trades between dealers. Thissystem automates the functions that voice brokers currently provide in the interdealer market.Participants in the system electronically indicate their desire to enter into specific transactions. Otherdealers can accept a transaction, or they can send an electronic message suggesting possible changes interms. Participants can execute trades only with other dealers for whom they have acceptable creditlimits. The credit limits of all dealers vis-à-vis each other are loaded into the system before trading.The managers of this system believe that regulatory uncertainty about the application of the CEA hasslowed the growth of their business, too.Potential risk-management benefits. What are the implications of these developments (or potentialdevelopments) for risk management? The most immediately apparent benefits spring from the changes
3BIS Review 17/2000that electronics bring to information flows. Currently, deals are struck over telephones, perhaps withthe assistance of voice brokers. The data from those trades must be entered into the firms’ informationsystems. For some firms, data may even be keyed more than once. Electronic systems allow the quick,accurate capture of data. The data can then be used to update risk management information systemsrapidly. Other benefits may be realized in firms’ ability to manage their credit limits. A feature ofmany electronic systems is credit limits that are programmed into the system. This feature narrows theability of rogue traders to expose firms without the knowledge of risk managers.Just as electronic systems can generate data useful in internal risk management, they can also generatedata about the market for financial instruments. The rapid growth and widespread acceptance ofelectronic brokering reportedly has made the pricing process more transparent in the foreign exchangemarket. Dealers no longer have to do a transaction to discover where the market is trading. Similarimprovements in price transparency could be expected in other products. End-users in these productsmay also reap benefits if competition among dealers increases and bid-offer spreads narrow.3.SettlementStatus quo. Currently, settling derivatives transactions requires lots of paper and manual labor.Counterparties must confirm the details of deals with each other. The confirmation lists the economicfeatures of the transaction as well as many legal terms. ISDA has developed templates forconfirmations that market participants use for many products, but tailor-made confirmations may benecessary for certain products or certain counterparties. In some instances, confirmations are generatedelectronically, but for a range of products, the process is manual. Even electronically generatedconfirmations often must be manually verified by counterparties. Many confirmations are faxedbetween counterparties. S.W.I.F.T., an interbank messaging system, is used to confirm foreigncurrency options, forward rate agreements, and cross-currency swaps, but its usefulness is limitedbecause both counterparties must employ the system. Electronics thus are not the rule in confirmationprocessing. Not surprisingly, the result has been significant backlogs. Active dealers report hundredsof unconfirmed trades. A small but significant share may be outstanding ninety days or more.Another feature of settlements in OTC derivatives in recent years has been the development ofcollateral programs. US dealers, in particular, have rapidly expanded their use of collateral to mitigatecounterparty credit risks. In these programs, counterparties typically agree that, if exposures changeover time and one party comes to represent a credit risk to the other, the party posing the credit riskwill post collateral to cover some (or all) of the exposure. These programs offer market participants apowerful tool for helping control credit risk, but they also embody substantial documentation andoperational challenges.Alternative procedures could lead to risk reduction in many areas of the settlement of OTCderivatives. Collateral programs themselves could be strengthened to provide even greater benefits.Need to address backlogs. Most dealers acknowledge that the failure to confirm trades heightens therisk that the transaction will be unenforceable. Because unconfirmed trades create the potential thaterrors in trade records and management information systems will go undetected, they also create thepossibility that both market and credit risk will be measured incorrectly. Quantitative measures ofmarket risk and credit risk are only as good as the transaction data on which they are based.Most firms active in the markets recognize the need to address the backlogs in confirmations. TheCRMPG report, for example, directed several recommendations toward firms’ need to improve marketpractices in this area, and it set a target of confirming trades within five days of the trade date. Theproblem of backlogs can be attacked from two directions. First, individual firms can strengthen theirpolicies with regard to confirmations. They could monitor backlogs more carefully and devoteresources to reducing those backlogs. They could enhance internal systems for capturing trade dataand generating confirmations. Management can place a priority on reducing the backlog and assignclear responsibility for such reduction. Second, backlogs can be reduced by standardizing andelectronically matching confirmations or by developing electronic trading systems that create a matchat the time of the trade. These latter methods for reducing backlogs clearly must be pursued
BIS Review 17/20004collectively. A system for electronically matching confirmations will be helpful only if substantialportions of a firm’s counterparties use the same system. Similarly, electronic trading systems require acritical mass of participants.Need to strengthen collateral management practices. The volatile market conditions that surroundedthe LTCM episode provided a test of many firms’ risk management systems and particularly theircollateral programs. During the episode, collateral successfully mitigated credit risk, as designed.However, events also highlighted weaknesses in current policies and programs. These weaknesseshave been examined in some depth in studies both by banking supervisors and by ISDA. It isimportant to address them because improperly managed collateral programs may give firms a falsesense of security. Reductions in credit risk may not be as great as perceived. The studies point to waysin which individual firms can make collateral programs more effective.First and foremost, the studies emphasize that collateral is a complement to credit analysis; it is not asubstitute for credit analysis. Supervisors observed that some firms accepted counterparties that wereunwilling to provide information about their risk profile as long as they were willing to post collateral.The fallacy of that approach was vividly demonstrated. Positions may rapidly change in value,creating uncollateralized credit exposures to counterparties of unknown creditworthiness. A mainpoint of these studies was the need for counterparties both to recognize the potential for unsecuredexposures to arise in the future and to measure such exposures more carefully.A second theme in the studies was the need for counterparties to recognize that, although collateralprograms mitigate credit risk, they also introduce operational, liquidity, and legal risks. To realize thebenefits of the collateral program, back office systems must be very robust. That is, counterpartiesmust be able to value portfolios, track collateral posted, call for any deficiencies, and verify the timelyreceipt of collateral. Various studies have noted that firms relying on collateral programs mustestablish rigorous controls and devote sufficient resources to them. Additional liquidity and legal risksalso arise with collateral programs. Counterparties entering into collateral agreements must ensure thatthey themselves can deliver collateral in a timely fashion, and the extensive legal documents related tothe program must be enforceable in relevant jurisdictions.Clearing. A device used to mitigate credit risk among groups of participants in many financial marketsis a clearinghouse. A clearinghouse typically substitutes itself as central counterparty to alltransactions that its members agree to submit for clearing. The creditworthiness of the clearinghouse isthus substituted for that of its members. The clearinghouse assumes the responsibility for managingcredit risk through financial safeguards such as membership standards, capital requirements, andcollateral systems.The clearing of OTC derivatives is quite limited. Some clearing of OTC products has been conductedin Sweden for several years. Last year, the London Clearing House (LCH) began offering suchservices more broadly, but volumes to date have been limited. In the United States, the clearing ofOTC derivatives has been hampered by legal uncertainty associated with the possible application ofthe Commodity Exchange Act. If the recommendations in the report of the President’s Working Groupare implemented, this uncertainty will be resolved. Clearinghouses for OTC derivatives could becreated under various regulatory regimes. The only restriction would be that the clearinghouse besupervised. That supervision could be provided by the CFTC, the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Federal Reserve.Clearing OTC derivatives offers several potential benefits. A clearinghouse can substantially mitigatecounterparty credit risk through multilateral netting of obligations and implementation of sound riskcontrols. Legal risks tend to be reduced with clearing because the default procedures of clearinghousesare supported by specific provisions of national law. Clearinghouses also usually impose stringentoperational standards on members, and they likely would provide added impetus to efforts to developautomated systems for confirming trades.But clearing has limitations, too. Clearinghouses tend to concentrate risks and risk management. Thekey issue is how effectively a clearinghouse manages the risks it assumes. The record on riskmanagement provided by clearinghouses in the United States is quite good. The same safeguardscould be applied in the OTC context, particularly for relatively simple OTC products. But certain
5BIS Review 17/2000hurdles that arise because of the nature of OTC markets would have to be overcome. Contracts in theclearing process would have to be valued by models rather than by prices generated on an exchangefloor. More important, in the event of a member default, OTC products likely would take longer toclose out than exchange-traded products. This hurdle could be overcome, however, by the impositionof higher margin requirements on members or by the clearinghouse’s maintaining larger supplementalfinancial resources.Clearing also may have the perverse effect of increasing risk on counterparties’ portfolios ofnoncleared contracts. Clearinghouses for OTC contracts typically propose to clear the relatively simpleOTC instruments. The remaining contracts will be settled bilaterally between the two counterparties,as they are today. The bilateral exposures on the noncleared contracts might increase to some degree ifthe contracts that were removed for clearing had been offsetting some of that exposure. The magnitudeof this effect will vary from counterparty to counterparty because it is portfolio specific. Individualcounterparties, therefore, must carefully assess the potential benefits of clearing.4.Conclusion: the role of public policyThe role of public policy is to encourage sound risk management. In this regard, policymakers areencouraging firms to enhance their risk-management systems, including appropriate managementoversight, adequate risk-management policies and procedures, effective risk-measurement andmonitoring systems, comprehensive internal controls and independent external audit. Policymakerssimply cannot dictate the details of risk management based upon assumed market developments.Markets currently are in tremendous flux, and policymakers cannot foresee the needs in future years.Thus, the soundest course is to create a clear legal and regulatory environment within which marketparticipants can develop risk management tools as needed. In some instances, rather than mandatingcertain steps, policymakers might provide proper incentives for risk-reducing steps through capitalrequirements or disclosure regulations.The recommendations in the Working Group’s report on OTC derivatives, in particular, aim to clarifythe legal status of electronic communication, trading, and clearing systems. These recommendations, ifimplemented, offer a variety of enhanced risk management tools to market participants. Informationflows could be improved, backlogs in the settlement process might be reduced, and the benefits ofmultilateral netting might be realized.However, it remains for market participants to develop the systems that will best serve markets withinthe given legal framework. I hope that market participants pursue these opportunities. The risks oftrading and settling OTC derivatives can and should be reduced. Obviously, things that firms canpursue individually are easier to tackle than those requiring collective action. But the potential benefitsof new communication, trading, and clearing systems should be evaluated carefully. Participants inOTC markets have worked together in the past developing standard master agreements, for example,or obtaining legal opinions on netting. Those experiences should be useful as these new opportunitiesfor reducing risks are addressed.The challenge for policymakers as these new opportunities are evaluated may well be doing nothing.Policymakers no doubt will be tempted to mandate cooperation on the part of market participants in aneffort to hasten developments that they believe may reduce risk. In adopting such a course, however,they risk pushing markets and market participants down inefficient and undesirable paths. Oftenmarket participants are not pursuing steps that, on the surface, appear desirable because the benefits donot seem sufficient. In that event, policymakers’ efforts would be better spent in helping demonstratethat the benefits have not been appropriately evaluated rather than in dictating market structures.
1BIS Review 17/2000Mr Noyer gives an address on the outlookfor the euro area economy and its financial marketsSpeech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the “Cérémonie deremise des Victoires des SICAV”, Paris, on 24 February 2000.*      *      *I am very pleased to address this distinguished audience of fund managers today and to witness thepresentation of awards for excellence in financial innovation. It is my belief that the process offinancial innovation in general, as celebrated in today’s ceremony, deserves particular attention. Thisis because improvements in the working of financial markets will eventually improve the allocation offinancial resources in the economy, which will in turn be beneficial for sound economic growth overthe medium term.1.Trends in 2000 for the euro area economyIn the first part of my address today, I would like to discuss the major trends in monetary, economicand financial developments in the euro area in 2000. I will examine these trends within the frameworkof the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy.The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability over the medium term. Pricestability is defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) forthe euro area of below 2%. The assessment of risks to price stability in the context of the monetarypolicy strategy is based on two pillars. First, a reference value of 4½% for the growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3; second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developmentsand risks to price stability in the euro area. To begin with, let me consider the first pillar of thestrategy. In 1999, the three-month average of annual percentage growth rates of M3 was consistentlyabove the reference value. Over recent months, both money growth and the growth of credit to theprivate sector signalled generous liquidity conditions in the euro area and were seen as posing upwardrisks to price stability.Let me now turn to the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the broadly based assessment ofthe outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in the euro area. Variousmacro-economic indicators available for the euro area consistently point towards a strong cyclicalupswing in the euro area in 2000. These expectations for developments in economic activity in theeuro area are supported both by external developments, as the outlook for global economic activity isimproving, and developments internal to the euro area. At the same time as the cyclical upswingstarted to materialise, however, increases in consumer prices over recent months were relatively largeand protracted. This reflected mainly the impact of increasing oil prices seen throughout 1999 as wellas, following the continued depreciation of the effective exchange rate of the euro, increases in importprices. These increases in oil prices and in import prices led to a situation where there were increasingrisks of second round effects on consumer prices.With respect to both the first pillar and the second pillar of the strategy, developments over the lastfew months led the Governing Council of the ECB to raise interest rates. The main refinancing ratewas raised to 3% on 4 November 1999 and then to 3.25% on 3 February 2000. By raising interest ratesin view of the developments that I just described, it was aimed to contribute to ensuring that thecyclical upswing currently under way in the euro area will be both strong and sustainable, because itwill occur in an environment of price stability over the medium term.Over the next months it is particularly important that social partners keep wage increases in line withprice stability as well as being supportive of further growth in employment. The rate of unemploymentin the euro area has fallen throughout 1999 but still remains high. A lasting reduction in
BIS Review 17/20002unemployment could be achieved only if further progress is made in structural reforms aimed atpromoting flexibility on the labour market, providing jobs to low skilled workers and facilitating thereturn to the job market of the long-term unemployed. In addition, the growth prospects of the euroarea over the medium term would clearly benefit from the completion and further deepening ofstructural reforms promoting competition on the markets for goods and services.2.Euro area financial marketsAlso for the financial markets of the euro area, structural reforms aimed at promoting competitionappear to be necessary. These reforms will over time contribute to improving the working of financialmarkets integrated at the area-wide level. Furthermore, the Eurosystem has an obvious interest in wellfunctioning and efficient financial markets because financial markets are the conduit through whichmonetary policy decisions are channelled into the economy. Let me consider first the money market. In1999, within the euro area cross-border operations constituted a large share of all operations on themoney market. The market has evidently benefited from the creation of a strong and secure backboneof payment systems, including the real-time gross-settlement system operated by the European Systemof Central Banks (ESCB). The money market of the euro has widely used daily reference indices forinterest rates, notably EONIA for overnight transactions and EURIBOR for transactions at longermaturities. A full set of standard instruments is built upon these reference indices, in particular moneymarket futures and options contracts as well as short-term interest rate swaps. This leads to a situationwhere market participants are able to manage their day-to-day funds in an efficient manner and atrelatively low costs. Important progress remains to be achieved, however, in particular for instancewith regard to the repo market. The further integration of the repo market at area-wide level willbenefit from the operation of common platforms for the clearing and delivery-settlement of securitiesused as collateral in repo transactions.If I now turn to the bond market of the euro area, observations made during 1999 also seem to indicatethat the market is already relatively well integrated at the level of the euro area. As shown by thenewly published ECB statistics in this field, there was a considerable increase in the participation ofprivate sector issuers in the bond market in 1999. To some extent, this development appears to havebeen linked to higher mergers and acquisitions activity. Furthermore, the volumes of transactions onboth the secondary market for bonds and on the markets for interest rate derivative products alsoappear to have increased in 1999. In this context, the more sophisticated market participants seem tobe able to easily take positions at any point on the term structure of interest rates, thus contributing tothe formation of representative and reliable prices for the entire range of instruments available on theeuro area bond market. These observations tend to indicate that the bond market of the euro area hasattained a good degree of depth and liquidity.Further progress towards the constitution of very efficient bond markets in the euro area can, however,certainly still be made.In the run-up to Stage Three of European Monetary Union, bond market participants in each countryof the euro area appeared to increasingly hold bonds issued in other countries of the euro area. Thisdevelopment reflected notably the decline in spreads linked to the expected removal of intra-areaexchange rate risks. Following the creation of the euro, bond market investors are naturally notconcerned with intra-area exchange rate risks any more. Instead, they seem to focus on an assessmentof the intrinsic credit quality of issuers. Thus, the assessment of credit quality and the development ofa “credit risk culture”, which constitute important features of an active and open bond market, arelikely to develop further partly as a result of the creation of the euro. The activities of ratings agenciesmake it possible to define common standards for the assessment and comparative ranking of the creditquality of borrowers and issuers. In this regard, it is interesting to note that, in 1999, the share ofrelatively low-grade borrowers in new bond issues, although it remained small, seemed to increasesomewhat. Over the medium term, in the context of the further development of a “credit risk culture”,it can therefore be expected that the bond market of the euro area will become increasingly diversified,in particular with regard to the range of participating issuers, and attract more private issuers.
3BIS Review 17/2000With regard to the stock market, similar observations may be made. In particular, the development of arange of area-wide stock market indices is indicative of the progress made in the integration of euroarea stock markets. In particular, stock market participants seem to increasingly take into account theeconomic factors common to the euro area as a whole. Furthermore, the integration of stock markets atthe euro area level means that issuers across the euro area have privileged access to a large number ofinvestors on a large and open market place. This perspective is certainly a supporting factor for thedevelopment of segments of the stock market dedicated to relatively small and/or new firms, theso-called “new markets”.I would like to conclude this brief discussion of trends in euro area financial markets with a referenceto the - admittedly still timid - emergence of new market places operating on the internet. It appearsthat internet market places have the potential to cover a broad range of activities, both on the so-calledprimary market at the time of issue of new securities and on the secondary market. One of theadvantages of these new market places is that they may be accessed by a very wide range of usersbecause they take advantage of an existing communication network infrastructure, the internet.Furthermore, the new internet market places also seem to be characterised by a high degree ofautomation of trading processes. These factors would seem to make it possible to achieve lowertransaction costs and, more generally, contribute to further improving the working of financialmarkets.
1BIS Review 16/2000Mr Noyer summarises the main features of the Eurosystem’s monetarypolicy strategy and discusses the short past and the long future of the euroSpeech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of aconference organised by “le Club des Affaires de Berlin e.V.”, Berlin, on 23 February 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,It is a pleasure and an honour for me to speak here at the Club des Affaires de Berlin today. Since thefoundation of the Federal Republic of Germany more than 50 years ago, Berlin has attractedprominent speakers from all over the world praising this city as a symbol for the achievements ofWestern-type market economies. With the fall of the Berlin wall and the introduction of the euro,integration in Europe has gained a new quality both from an economic and a political perspective.German unification has raised expectations of a wider unification in Europe in the sense of furtherintegration. As Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission recently declared before theEuropean Parliament: “The opened Brandenburg Gate stands as a powerful symbol of our continent’sfuture.”The birth of the euro as the single currency for eleven Member States of the EU was an important step.Although this was only one year ago, the euro can be seen as a symbol for European achievements.The single currency offers a great opportunity to achieve and maintain price stability in Europe and tocreate the conditions needed for sustained economic growth. For the euro to become a “success story”as the single currency for around 300 million people, the confidence of the population in the stabilityof the new currency and in the single monetary policy of the Eurosystem plays a crucial role. Theestablishment of a “stability culture” throughout the euro area will contribute to the stability of theeuro. The foundations of this stability culture are to be found in a broad consensus among Europeansthat the maintenance of price stability is of utmost importance. A stability culture also facilitates theachievement of other objectives, such as high employment.The introduction of the euro marked the culmination of a long period of successful preparatory work,the magnitude of which can hardly be overestimated. As a result of these efforts, the introduction ofthe euro took place in an environment of price stability that only a few observers would have predictedsome years ago. In its short history, the Eurosystem has started to build up credibility and to gain asound reputation in financial markets for its stability-oriented monetary policy. In the course of 1999,inflation for the euro area remained at a rate consistent with price stability of around 1%. TheEurosystem is determined to conduct the appropriate policy in order to ensure that price stabilityremains in place.Let me also mention that, as expected, the transition of the euro area financial markets to the year 2000went smoothly. This reflects the careful preparation of the banking and financial community and thecomprehensive and flexible operational framework of the Eurosystem.The establishment of Monetary Union marks an outstanding historical achievement. In my remarks Ishould like to summarise the main features of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy and theexperience gained with the euro in this first year. By subsequently addressing forthcoming challenges,I should then like to span the bridge towards the future.A clear and transparent monetary policy strategyLet me describe our first experience with the monetary policy strategy in the euro area. TheEurosystem has chosen a clear and transparent monetary policy strategy with a quantitative definitionof its primary objective of price stability. The chosen stability-oriented monetary policy strategy isforward-looking and medium-term oriented. The Eurosystem has a policy framework which truly
BIS Review 16/20002reflects the complexity of the economy. It is sufficiently flexible to allow for appropriate responses tospecific shocks. It also allows account to be taken of the possibility of regime shifts that could impacton the stability of important economic relationships in the course of time.Let me briefly recall the main elements of the Eurosystem’s strategy. A clear definition for the primaryobjective to maintain price stability in the euro area contributes to stabilising market expectations.Price stability is defined as an annual increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)for the euro area of below 2%. The Eurosystem aims to maintain price stability in line with thisdefinition over the medium term. In order to achieve its overriding objective, the Governing Councilhas adopted a two-pillar approach.The first pillar assigns a prominent role to money. By announcing a reference value for the growthrate of a broad monetary aggregate, the strategy takes into account that inflation is a monetaryphenomenon in the medium term. The reference value exploits the leading indicator properties of thebroad aggregate M3, which according to most empirical studies is the most useful guidepost for futureprice developments in the euro area. The first reference value was set in late 1998 at an annual growthrate for M3 of 4½%. Following a review of the reference value in December 1999, the GoverningCouncil decided to leave the reference value unchanged on the grounds that the underlyingassumptions are still valid. Under normal circumstances, significant and sustained deviations of actualmonetary developments from this value would signal future risks to price stability. However, thereference value is not an annual target. Rather, it is based on medium-term assumptions and serves asa guide for developments over the medium term. Moreover, the ECB is not committed to ensuring thatM3 grows in line with the reference value at a particular point in time.The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a broadly based assessment of the outlook forprice developments and risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole. This assessmentencompasses a wide range of financial market and other economic indicators, including forecastsproduced both within and outside the Eurosystem. Within the second pillar, cyclical developments andwages are important indicators for future price developments. In addition, the exchange rate is one ofthe important determinants of the outlook for price stability. If exchange rate developments pose athreat to price stability in the euro area, this threat will be taken into account together with theinformation on price developments revealed by all other indicators.Monetary policy does not react mechanically to developments in a single indicator or forecast. Instead,based on the signals provided by both pillars of the strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB setsthe monetary policy instruments of the Eurosystem at the level which best serves the achievement ofits primary objective.Watchers of the ECB have criticised our communication policy for a lack of transparency. Centralbanks are used to this kind of criticism. More recently this criticism has also been extended to othercentral banks which follow a strategy of (direct) inflation targeting. However, we should be clear thatrevealing every aspect of an ongoing discussion is not an objective in itself. Instead, communicationshould be an element that reinforces the efficiency of monetary policy by making it comprehensibleand facilitating its acceptance by economic agents. It is therefore important to judge carefully thecontribution which the various elements of communication can make to the fulfilment of the primaryobjective of monetary policy.Such considerations apply for example to the issue whether the ECB should publish forecasts for euroarea variables. Forecasts represent information which is important for monetary policydecision-making. However, publishing forecasts as a central bank is different from publishingforecasts as an outside institution. It is the objective of the ECB to maintain price stability. Since theobjective of the ECB is to achieve this over the medium term, any forecast, which is for examplebased on constant interest rates, does not take into account that monetary policy takes action in time toensure price stability. In other words, while forecasts may inform interest rate decisions, there should,in principle, never be any doubt that after the ECB’s decision the outlook for price developmentsshould be in line with price stability. In this context, it would then be problematic to send signals intothe public debate, which could influence inflation expectations. Furthermore, in the construction of
3BIS Review 16/2000forecasts, behavioural, institutional and structural uncertainties should not be overlooked. Largeuncertainties can make forecasting price and other developments in the euro area inevitably difficult.Forecasts have therefore to be interpreted with great caution and an assessment has to be supplementedby an evaluation of risks and uncertainties underlying the forecast. Therefore, publishing just a singlenumber for the inflation outlook would clearly be misleading. Instead, a careful interpretation of theresults is required in order to exploit the signals for monetary policy purposes. Before the ECBpublishes any forecasts, it is crucial that we explain carefully the uncertainties surrounding it, theassumptions being made and to what extent then forecasts actually play a role in our decision.Otherwise, publishing forecasts might finally increase uncertainty and even complicate themaintenance of price stability.Let me point out that the ECB has set high standards in terms of openness, transparency andaccountability. As part of its communication policy, the ECB provides the public and other policymakers regularly with timely and detailed information on the Governing Council’s assessment ofmonetary, financial and economic conditions in the euro area. This assessment revealsforward-looking information of the outlook for price developments as well as the risks to pricestability. A statement of the President is released immediately after the first Governing Councilmeeting each month. This has the advantage of presenting the Council’s assessment of the economicsituation almost instantaneously after the meeting. Each month the ECB publishes a bulletin providingadditional background information to explain its current assessment of monetary, financial and othereconomic developments in more detail. Once a year, the ECB releases an annual report on its activitiesto the European Community institutions.Gaining first experienceThe monetary policy strategy has passed its first tests successfully. In addition to the describedelements of the strategy, consistency and transparency of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy decisionswere a crucial aspect. This can be best illustrated by discussing the most important factors influencingthe interest rate changes decided so far by the Eurosystem.In the first few months of last year, signs emerged that the extent of the slowdown of economicactivity in the euro area might be stronger than had been anticipated. At that point in time pricepressures continued to be weak. In this environment it became increasingly clear that the negativeeffects stemming from the crises in Asia and Russia on growth and employment in the euro arearepresented a downward risk to future price stability in the euro area. This assessment was alsoreflected in the downward revisions to the inflation forecasts of international organisations at thattime.A monetary policy reaction to these downward risks to price stability was, however, complicated bythe fact that at that time some indicators appeared to point in the opposite direction. In particular, thethree-month average of annual growth rates of M3 was slightly above the reference value. Consumerconfidence remained comparatively strong despite the economic slowdown. Furthermore, oil priceshad been rising since mid-February and the euro had depreciated in effective terms. These two factorswere also able to exert upward pressures on prices in the short term.However, there were several indications that M3 was temporarily being distorted upwards in early1999 as a result of the changeover to Stage Three of EMU. Thus, in early 1999, it did not appear thatM3 growth revealed upside risks to price stability. Moreover, since most of what could be assessed bythen was a normalisation and correction of excessive developments in late 1998, the GoverningCouncil did not regard it as appropriate to overemphasise relatively volatile movements in oil pricesand exchange rates in the first few months of 1999.All in all, while in early April the first pillar of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem was not judgedas pointing to upward risks to price stability, the second pillar of the strategy was signalling significantdownward risks to price stability. This assessment made it necessary for the Governing Council to takeaction. With a view to maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term, the
BIS Review 16/20004Governing Council of the ECB thus decided at the beginning of April 1999 to reduce the interest rateson the main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 2.5%.At around the beginning of the summer, it appeared that the downward risks to price stability receded.Over the summer, the three-month average of the annual rate of M3 growth increased further andprogressively approached a rate of 6%. Overnight deposits and credit to the private sector continued toexpand rapidly. A protracted monetary expansion was thus evident. At the same time, the externalenvironment strengthened as the Asian economies stabilised and then started to recover, whileconcerns for financial crises in other emerging markets receded. In this environment, economicactivity in the euro area progressively recovered. In addition, the effective exchange rate of the euroweakened further and oil prices continued to rise. These two factors were gradually feeding through toconsumer prices. Therefore, information contained in both pillars provided evidence that the balanceof risks to future price stability had been progressively moving upward since the beginning of thesummer. The downside risks which were present at the time of the cut in ECB interest rates in April nolonger prevailed. On 4 November the Governing Council decided to raise the interest rates on the mainrefinancing operations by 50 basis points to 3%.The increase in interest rates at that point in time was aimed at helping to counter the upward pressureon future prices and at contributing to keeping inflation expectations safely below 2%. The interestrate decision was taken in a timely manner so as to avoid the need for stronger measures later. This isconsistent with the focus on maintaining price stability and would thus contribute to sustainingnon-inflationary economic growth in the euro area over the medium term.In late 1999 and by 2000 risks to price stability moved again to the upside. Both pillars wereindicating increased risks to price stability. Considering the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy,monetary and credit growth continued to signal generous liquidity conditions. Monetary expansionremained high as evidenced by the latest three-month average of annual M3 growth of 6.1% for theperiod covering October to December 1999. The expansion of credit to the private sector continued tobe strong with rates around 10%. These developments were indicative of a continuation of a generousliquidity situation.As for the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the oil price and exchange rate movementsobserved in late 1999 and January 2000 have added to upward pressure on prices in the euro area. Infact, price and cost increases were larger and more protracted than foreseen earlier and hence indicatedrenewed upward risks for price stability. The latest price developments for the euro area werereflecting this pattern, given a pick-up in the HICP inflation rate to 1.7% for December 1999. Addingto these risks was the fact that the international environment has been showing continuous signs ofimprovement and the prospects of a cyclical upswing in the euro area have improved. Indeed,significant improvements in the economic outlook were confirmed by estimates of real GDP growthfor the third quarter of 1999 from Eurostat and by available confidence indicators that pointed to acontinued solid output growth in the fourth quarter of 1999. Against this background the GoverningCouncil decided to raise ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in February 2000.The explanations of the decisions to change ECB interest rates in 1999 and in February 2000 showthat we do not react mechanistically to individual indicators. Instead, we always interpret themovements and signals in all of the indicators evident in both pillars in conjunction with each other.As outlined and given that we are living in a complex world, this is a more reasonable approach thanrelying on a simple indicator. Timely and appropriate monetary policy adjustments should ensure thatthe risks to price stability are kept under control.The Governing Council’s determination to counter threats of inflation should assure wage negotiatorsthat the prospects for price stability remain favourable. In fact, it will be important to ensure that wagesettlements themselves do not constitute a threat to price stability in the medium term.The international role of the euroLet me turn to the implications the introduction of the euro had for the international capital markets.The euro has become the currency of an economic area which roughly equals the United States in
5BIS Review 16/2000terms of economic size and external trade, and which has the world’s second largest capital market.Owing to the fact that a number of the currencies replaced by the euro had played an importantinternational role in the past, the euro inherited this role. After the US dollar, the euro is the secondmost widely used currency in the world. In parallel with growing investors’ confidence and as moreEU Member States join the euro area, in particular following an EU enlargement, the international roleof the euro will receive further stimulus.Let me emphasise that the Eurosystem does not actively promote the international role of the euro.Instead a neutral stance has been adopted leaving the determination of the international role to marketforces. Maintaining price stability in the euro area helps to gain credibility and the confidence ofEuropean citizens in the stability of the euro. This will also contribute to the increased use of the eurooutside the euro area.The international interest in the euro is indeed evident, for example, from international new bondissues. According to information from the Bank for International Settlements, in the first three quartersof 1999, euro-denominated gross international issues of money market instruments, bonds and notesaccounted for 38% of total issues, which is only slightly less than the share for the US dollar. Bycomparison, in the first nine months of 1998 the combined share of the former euro area nationalcurrencies and the ECU was only 24% of total gross issuance. Although this strong increase can bepartly explained by the postponement of issues from 1998 to 1999, the issues in euro have beengrowing continuously in the course of 1999 not least owing to positive expectations regarding thefuture development of the euro area financial markets.Towards a long future of the euroLet me now try to look ahead towards the challenges which the ECB and the Eurosystem will have toaddress in the coming years. The experience with the short past of the euro justifies expectations thatwe will gradually see further advances towards a broadening of economic and monetary integration inthe future. With the establishment of the Eurosystem, solid foundations for a stable currency were laid.Moreover, the principle of central bank independence is anchored in the Treaty.Let me emphasise that Monetary Union in Europe has a different quality from the German currencyunion in 1990. German unification led to the introduction of the Deutsche Mark in eastern Germanybased on a fixed conversion rate. Monetary Union in Germany was thus achieved at the same time asthe political union. However, in Europe the establishment of Monetary Union has preceded thecreation of a wider political area. This made it necessary to introduce additional features in theframework of EMU so as to enhance the coordination between monetary and economic policies. Forexample the establishment of the Stability and Growth Pact facilitates the coordination of fiscalpolicies among Member States on the basis of a fiscal rule. Sound fiscal policies also facilitate theECB’s task to maintain price stability in the euro area. In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact isa crucial element. Its aim is to encourage the pursuit of disciplined and sustainable fiscal policies byboth the participating EU Member States and prospective members.Safeguarding sound government finances is conducive to achieving sustainable growth andemployment creation. The consolidation of public finances, which has made considerable progress inthe past few years, has to be continued and, where necessary, strengthened.There are important conditions to be met in order to achieve sustainable non-inflationary economicgrowth in the euro area. In particular, decisive measures to address the structural problems in Europeare needed, for example in the area of labour markets. Even, if we see some progress in reducingunemployment in the euro area over recent months, this problem is still pressing. There is no doubtthat it needs to be tackled by policies enhancing the flexibility of the euro area labour and goodsmarkets.In the coming years, the success of EMU demands that the division of policy responsibilities betweenmonetary and government authorities, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty, is followed. This allows theEurosystem’s monetary policy to focus on its primary objective. At the same time economic policiescan be directed more efficiently towards structural problems prevailing in the Member States. Such a
BIS Review 16/20006sharing of tasks is both transparent and conducive to accountability. It enhances the credibility ofmonetary and economic policies in Europe.The focus on price stability does not allow the conditioning of monetary policy actions upon theprospective results of fiscal and structural measures. Similarly, monetary policy cannot be conditionalon future wage developments promised by the social partners. In both cases the outcome is quiteuncertain. The public could falsely interpret such a form of policy coordination as the attempt tonegotiate the ECB’s monetary policy stance with other policymakers. This might hinder theEurosystem’s prompt response to shocks that threaten the maintenance of price stability. TheEurosystem should always take into account all available information, not just the information onother intended policy actions.In the future, we will also see the accession of a number of new Member States to the European Unionand eventually to the euro area. It is clear that the envisaged extension of the EU to include newmembers and, ultimately, the enlargement of the euro area represent important challenges both forMember States and for the Eurosystem. Any enlargement of the euro area is subject to the strictapplication of the convergence criteria, and not automatic. I should like to recall that the MaastrichtTreaty provides for a clear and transparent procedure, which lays down the conditions for EU MemberStates wishing to join the euro area. This should ensure that Member States provide evidence ofsufficient economic convergence with the euro area before adopting the euro.In this context it is useful to explain the rationale behind the convergence criteria. Their main purposeis to ensure that only those Member States which have economic conditions that are conducive to themaintenance of price stability shall be participants. This is important for the credibility andsustainability of EMU. It makes the case for a strict application of the criteria. As the convergencecriteria constitute a coherent and integrated package, they must be all satisfied at the same time.Current data represent the basis for an assessment. An application shall be carried out in a consistent,transparent and simple manner. This implies that a convergence assessment shall also take intoaccount the experience gained in the run-up to Stage Three.Compliance with the convergence criteria on a sustained basis is essential. This can be best explainedfor the example of fiscal policies. Looking back, many accession countries have accumulated high orvery high levels of public sector debt. This was often the result of economic shocks, distributional orintergenerational problems as well as regional divergences. An unduly high stock of debt typicallysteers debt-service payments for both current and future budgets until debt levels are substantiallyreduced.Exchange rate stability is also a measure of overall convergence, given that exchange rate movementstypically reflect, in addition to market expectations, relative movements of economic variables. In thisregard, participation in ERM II fosters convergence for prospective euro area members.The introduction of the euro in other countries will require more than only compliance with theconvergence criteria. In particular, further preparatory work in various areas is required. For example,new members have to ensure that the harmonised framework in which the single monetary policyoperates is fully in place prior to their participation in the euro area. Statistics need further adaptationso as to comply with the Eurosystem’s reporting requirements. Some changes in national legislationare needed to formally lay the foundations for the introduction of the euro. Finally, all procedures thatinvolve the Eurosystem and the prospective member country will have to pass a number of real-timetests in order to demonstrate that the infrastructure is operational.ConclusionsIn summary, looking at the current evidence on the outlook for price stability, the first year ofoperation of the ECB has been successful. The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem has provedto be a valuable tool both in supporting monetary policy decisions and in explaining these decisions tothe general public in a transparent manner. The ECB does its utmost to maintain price stability in theeuro area in a forward-looking manner and with a medium-term orientation. The Governing Councilof the ECB vigilantly monitors the signals provided by the two pillars of the ECB’s strategy. Stable

Maintaining price stability in the euro area will contribute to the credibility of the singlemonetary policy and to the stability of the single currency. It will pave the way for the long future ofthe euro.
1BIS Review 26/2000Mr Hayami: Globalization and regional cooperation in AsiaSpeech given by Mr Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Asian Pacific BankersClub, in Tokyo, on 17 March 2000.*      *      *It is a great honor to be invited today and given an opportunity to address distinguished members ofthe Asian Pacific Bankers Club. In particular, I would like to commend the Club for providing avaluable forum for fostering mutual understanding among representatives of major banks in East Asiaand the Pacific region. More than two years have passed since the outset of the currency crisis in Asia,and we can now say that we have clearly witnessed a recovery. Thus, at this juncture, I believe ituseful to examine what kind of regional cooperation is desirable in Asia from a long-term perspective.Positive and negative sides of globalizationLet me first consider globalization. The essence of globalization is the integration of marketsworldwide and the deepening of various interdependent relations. As we all know, the speed ofglobalization has been accelerating, especially in financial markets. This is clearly evidenced by thesignificant increase in foreign exchange transactions and international bond issues over the span of thepast ten years. You will all agree that the rapid progress of information and communication technologyhas played a decisive role as the driving force behind globalization.But, we should not forget the dynamic mechanism whereby globalization creates pressures for theharmonization of such systems as accounting, taxation and corporate governance across borders,which, in turn, leads to further globalization. As is commonly said, “globalization begetsglobalization”. Thus, the move toward globalization is an inevitable reality, and not likely to bereversed.Bearing in mind such a reality, we need to examine the problems related to globalization and how weshould respond to them. Globalization has brought about a variety of changes. One obvious benefitfrom a long-term viewpoint is that active cross-border capital flows will realize the efficient allocationof world resources.At the same time, precisely because of enhanced efficiency, there is a greater risk that the rapidincrease in international capital flows will induce an unexpected adverse impact, as was the case whenfinancial crisis contagion following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 spread to Russiaand Latin America.Given the fact of life that globalization is not reversible, what we need to do is to minimize thenegative side of globalization. In fact, since the financial crisis in Asia, various measures have beeneffected to prevent international contagion stemming from financial crises and to improve theinternational financial system. These measures include the improvement of disclosure to achieveenhanced market discipline, the establishment of a domestic financial system which is robust andresilient to external shocks, closer international cooperation in terms of financial supervision, and thereview and strengthening of IMF functions.Progress of regional cooperationAmid globalization, it is worth noting that we have also witnessed a clear trend toward regionalism orregional cooperation in various parts of the world. These movements toward promoting regionalcooperation have taken due account of trade and financial relations. For example, in Europe, theintroduction of the euro and the expansion of the EU. In the Americas, the expansion of NAFTA and
BIS Review 26/20002dollarization which is being considered by some Latin American countries. In Asia, we have begun toobserve some moves toward closer cooperation as I will describe later.Can we reconcile these two contrasting trends, the progress of economic and financial globalization onthe one hand, and the strengthening of regional cooperation on the other? One possible interpretationof this difficult question is that the driving force behind globalization has also made the interaction ofeconomic and financial activities closer in regions which have a lot in common. For example, the rapidprogress of information and communication technology can be regarded as one of the major factorssupporting the integration of financial markets in the euro zone.Therefore, globalization and regional cooperation can proceed simultaneously. Furthermore, regionalcooperation, if managed properly, will promote globalization. For example, if there are problems forwhich it will take a long time to form a global consensus, it may be possible to reach a consensusrelatively quickly among specific regions. This is a case where regional cooperation lowers barriers toglobalization in countries within the regions concerned.Furthermore, if there is a common platform for discussion or a framework for solving problems in aregion which consists of countries with similar economic conditions and policy orientation, we may beable to reduce the cost of global negotiations in the event of international policy conflicts or shocks. Insuch a case, regional cooperation may supplement a global cooperative framework. It may sound alittle ironic, but regional cooperation has become all the more significant and important whenglobalization progresses rapidly. The global economy of the twenty-first century will most likely be amulti-layered global network of various forms of regional cooperation.Regional cooperation in AsiaNow, I would turn to regional cooperation in Asia. Needless to say, Asia is extremely diverse in termsof culture, politics, and religion. Such diversity entails difficulties in promoting regional cooperation.In fact, the speed of regional cooperation in Asia has been slow compared to other regions. However,it is also true that the extent of interdependence has become more widespread and deep as witnessedby the progress of the horizontal division of labor and increased capital flows in East Asia. In addition,since the bitter experience of the currency crisis in 1997 has made us recognize the risk of spilloverand contagion, I believe that momentum for actively promoting regional cooperation as a device tosupport globalization has steadily increased.In promoting regional cooperation, let me offer you three important points in the economic andfinancial area. First is the strengthening of mutual surveillance. It is a major premise for any regionalcooperation that the countries concerned share a common recognition with respect to the economicand financial conditions of individual countries in the region, their interdependence, and the risksinherent in the regional economy.Second, countries in the region should share a common view of the future direction of the regionaleconomy and also concrete policy response based on such recognition. Bearing in mind the lessons welearned from the currency crises, we should improve the functioning of financial markets and foreignexchange regimes, and also strengthen domestic financial systems and financial supervisoryframeworks. In order to make an appropriate policy response, not only coordination among countriesin the region but also competition among them are very much needed.Third is participation in global efforts toward the stability of the international financial system, whichis often termed the “New International Financial Architecture” problem. It seems to me increasinglyimportant to send a coherent message from Asia to such international fora as the Financial StabilityForum, the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, and the InternationalMonetary and Financial Committee.Having said all this, we should never forget the importance of maintaining the basic philosophy of“open regionalism” as a major underlying premise to contribute to the stability and development of theworld economy. Central banks also play a very important role in promoting regional cooperation. Assymbolized by the rapid expansion of derivative transactions, we now live in a world where
3BIS Review 26/2000international capital flows have become extremely complex and the speed at which a shock istransmitted across borders has accelerated.In such a world, it is not possible for the central bank of any one country to ensure integrity of theinternational financial system. This can be easily understood if we recall such problems as the liquidityrisk involved in foreign exchange and the Herstatt risk in cross-border settlements. To discharge theresponsibility of conducting appropriate monetary policy and maintaining financial system stability aswell as to prevent international systemic risk from emerging, mutual cooperation and coordinationhave become increasingly essential among central banks in the region.In this context, a forum called EMEAP, composed of central banks in the East Asia and Pacific region,was established in 1991. In this forum, member central banks have been exchanging views andinformation regarding economic, financial market, and foreign exchange market developments. Theyhave also been studying ways to make improvements in such areas as financial markets, settlementsystems, and bank supervisory methods.ConclusionIn closing, let me briefly touch upon Japan’s role in Asia. Given the size of its economic presence andclose relations with countries in the Asian region, Japan should make an appropriate contribution toregional development. To this end, first of all, Japan itself must aggressively implement structuralreform to realize robust economic fundamentals.At the same time, Japan should promote further opening and improvement of its domestic markets tocontribute to the efficient and fair allocation of world resources. Particularly in financial markets,various measures for improvement have been effected. For example, in the benchmark governmentbond market, the maturity of bonds has been diversified and the withholding tax on non-residentslifted.We should continue such efforts to make domestic markets more attractive for overseas investors.Through such efforts, I believe and sincerely hope that countries both within and outside the Asianregion will come to have greater confidence in Japan, which, in turn, will contribute to closer andstronger cooperation in Asia.
1BIS Review 25/2000Mr Duisenberg discusses the ongoing dialogue on monetary policy,the overall economic situation and other activities of the EurosystemIntroductory statement by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at theHearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Brussels, on 20 March 2000.*      *      *It is my pleasure to continue today our ongoing dialogue on monetary policy, the overall economicsituation and other activities of the Eurosystem. Since our previous hearing in November, theEuropean economic outlook has brightened further, while, at the same time, the balance of risks toprice stability has shifted upwards owing, in particular, to external factors. Against this background,the decisions of the Governing Council of the ECB to raise interest rates in early February and lastweek, as well as the reasoning behind these steps, are at the centre of my presentation today.Moreover, I should like to touch upon the overall European economic environment. Finally, I shallbriefly turn to some other activities of the Eurosystem which might be of particular interest to you.1.Current economic developments and prospectsAs you are aware, the Governing Council of the ECB decided on 3 February and 16 March 2000 toincrease the three main ECB interest rates. These two decisions followed the interest rate decisiontaken on 4 November 1999. Whereas the interest rates were increased by 50 basis points in November1999, on the past two occasions the main refinancing rate and the rates on the marginal lending facilityand on the deposit facility were each increased by 25 basis points, so that they now stand at 3.50%,4.50% and 2.50% respectively. All three decisions were taken in the context of the monetary policystrategy of the Eurosystem to address upside risks to future price stability in the euro area.Both pillars of the monetary policy strategy indicated that the balance of risks to price stability in themedium term had been shifting upward in late 1999 and early 2000. Starting with monetarydevelopments in the context of the first pillar, the three-month average of annual M3 growth exceededthe reference value throughout 1999 and in January 2000. Together with the continued strongexpansion, at annual rates of around 10%, of credit granted to the private sector, this signalled thatliquidity in the euro area is ample, contributing to upside risks to price stability in the medium term.In the context of the first pillar, let me briefly take up the issue of the reference value for monetarygrowth. As you know, the reference value is an expression of the prominent role of money in the firstpillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem. Following its meeting on 2 December 1999,the Governing Council confirmed the reference value for the growth of the broad monetary aggregateM3 at 4½% per annum. This decision was taken on the grounds that the main elements which enteredthe determination of the reference value, namely the definition of price stability, the estimate of thetrend growth of real GDP and the trend decline in the income velocity of M3, had basically remainedunchanged. The Governing Council will continue to monitor monetary developments against thereference value on the basis of three-month moving averages of the annual growth rate of M3 asmonthly developments might be too volatile. In addition, we also noted that the generous liquiditysituation in 1999 will have to be kept in mind when assessing the information content of monetarydevelopments in the future.Considering the second pillar of the monetary policy strategy, namely the broadly based assessment ofother indicators containing information about the outlook for price stability, most indicators andforecasts have been pointing to increasing upward pressure on consumer price inflation over themedium term. The strong increase in oil prices in 1999 and early 2000 and the depreciation of theexchange rate of the euro in recent months have contributed to upward pressures on import andproducer prices. In addition to the direct effects of these pressures on consumer price inflation, there is
BIS Review 25/20002the risk in the context of the strong cyclical upswing that these developments could, via second-roundeffects, have lasting effects on consumer price inflation.All three of the interest rate measures taken over the last few months indicate the Eurosystem’scontinued determination to counter the emerging upside risks to price stability in a timely andpre-emptive manner. It is our strong conviction that we can thereby maintain a non-inflationaryenvironment, which is a prerequisite for making the economic upswing in the euro area sustainable.Currently, the prospects for strong economic growth in the euro area are very favourable. We are verymuch satisfied by the fact that economic activity is now expected to grow more strongly thananticipated earlier. In fact, most forecasts suggest that euro area real GDP growth will be above 3% in2000 and 2001, reflecting both the favourable external environment and buoyant domestic demand.These expectations have just been underpinned by the first estimate by EUROSTAT of real GDPgrowth in the fourth quarter of 1999, which indicated that economic activity continued to expand at arobust pace at the end of last year. Surveys of consumer and industrial confidence conducted by theEuropean Commission in early 2000 indicate that the positive development of economic activityshould have continued in the first months of this year. Financial markets also expect a prolonged phaseof economic expansion, as can be inferred from the fact that the yield curve has remained relativelysteep.In this environment, employment is expected to increase further and the still very high level ofunemployment should continue to fall. To date, wage growth has been moderate and the same appliesfor actual wage settlements to date. It remains important that the expected improvements in economicconditions and labour market prospects are not jeopardised by inappropriate wage settlements. In fact,wage moderation would help both to contain inflation in the euro area and lead to further progress inemployment creation. Wage negotiators can be assured that the primary objective of the Eurosystem isthe maintenance of price stability in the medium term and that we are fully committed to thisobjective. The temporary increases in the 12-month rate of consumer price inflation which we arecurrently observing as a result of the oil price developments should not be reason for higher wagedemands.There is now a broad consensus, also at the level of governments, that the currently favourableprospects for output growth in the euro area would be enhanced by a deepening of the structuralreform process in the euro area. Governments of the euro area have already taken important initiatives,but the high level of unemployment in many countries shows that there is still much to be done.In this respect, fiscal policies can also make a substantial contribution to maintaining favourableeconomic conditions by using the current upswing as an excellent opportunity to proceed swiftlytowards fulfilling the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact. Governments should continue theprocess of fiscal consolidation which was observed in the run-up to Stage Three with ambition.Aiming at positions of budget surplus and reducing debt to GDP ratios should free resources, whichcould be used by the private sector to finance new initiatives to create employment.I am confident that the first decade of the new millennium could, if all parties concerned take theirresponsibilities very seriously, mark the beginning of a prolonged period of price stability, growth andemployment creation. Inflation rates are currently among the lowest levels observed after the war, andwe are determined to maintain this very substantial achievement. Fiscal policies have already madegood progress in correcting the serious mistakes of the 1980s and early 1990s and they are encouragedto continue on the path of fiscal consolidation. These favourable conditions for a period of growth areclearly better now than at any time over the last ten years and this should both foster and facilitatestructural reforms.2.Other activities of the EurosystemFrom among the other activities of the Eurosystem over the last few months, I should like only brieflyto report on a few specific issues, which might be of particular interest to you.
3BIS Review 25/2000At present, the ECB is preparing this year’s Convergence Report. As you will be aware, the Treatyrequires the ECB and the Commission to present such a report at least every two years. The purpose ofthese reports is to examine the progress made by non-euro area Member States in the fulfilment oftheir obligations with regard to the achievement of economic and monetary union. This year’sConvergence Report will cover Greece and Sweden. For Denmark and the United Kingdom, whichhave a special status, the convergence examination is only to be carried out at their explicit request.However, no such request has been made. According to our current planning, the Convergence Reportis to be published on 3 May.In this context, I should also like to take the opportunity to confirm that, as envisaged, the ECB willpresent its Annual Report for 1999 on 12 April, to be discussed in your Committee on 17 April 2000.EU enlargement is another area in which the ECB has assumed an increasingly active role. Eventhough the ECB is not an official party to the accession negotiations, it goes without saying that theEurosystem’s views in its areas of competence should be properly taken into account. This applies, inparticular, to the provisions needed to guarantee central bank independence, the liberalisation ofcapital movements, sound banking systems and overall financial stability.Against this background, the ECB is closely monitoring the EU enlargement process, which hasimplications - already at this stage - for economic and monetary developments in accession countries.Moreover, the ECB has, following the Helsinki seminar of last November, further intensified itsbilateral and multilateral contacts with central banks from accession countries. A network of seminarsand fora has been set up, in which practical advice and information are provided at expert level withregard to the adjustments required for EU membership in EMU-related areas of legislation, statisticsand payment systems. Moreover, the Eurosystem provides technical assistance in all relevant areas ofcentral banking. These activities are likely to be developed further and should make it easier for theaccession countries to carefully prepare for the adoption of the acquis communautaire, which isindispensable for the successful enlargement of the European Union.Finally, I should like briefly to touch upon the status of preparations for the Eurosystem’s informationcampaign on euro banknotes and coins. As I already mentioned during our previous dialogue, thiscampaign is designed to allow European citizens to familiarise themselves with the new banknotes andcoins at an early stage. The campaign is also directed towards people in other countries, albeit to alesser degree. Its main focus will be on the visual appearance of the euro banknotes and coins, theirsecurity features, their denominations and the changeover modalities. Special attention will be paid tothe needs of vulnerable citizens. In the meantime, the preparatory work on the information campaignhas progressed further and should, according to our current planning, be finalised in April. It goeswithout saying that the ECB would appreciate the opportunity to present the main features of thecampaign to your Committee in due course.
1BIS Review 15/2000Mr Ferguson reviews last year’s economic performance in theUnited States and raises some topics related to the underpinnings ofmacroeconomics and monetary policyRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, before the Downtown Economists Club, New York, on 17 February 2000.*      *      *Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to join this illustrious group of economists in thishistoric setting. The end of one year and start of another is a natural time to focus on accomplishmentsand also to list the things to do or to understand better. In this spirit, I would like to review last year’seconomic performance and then raise some topics related to the underpinnings of macroeconomics andmonetary policy.Of course, the views that I am about to express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those ofother members of the FOMC or the Board of Governors.Economic performance in 1999Last year presented various challenges for monetary policymakers. Domestic demand was particularlystrong, led by consumption expenditures, which grew 5½% last year. However, consumption was onlyone engine driving the spectacular performance of 1999. Business fixed investment, paced byspending on producers’ durable equipment, also rose strongly - by 7%. One investment sector, thehousing sector, which had been a source of considerable strength in 1998, grew less rapidly last year.Although single-family starts rose further in 1999, starts of multifamily units were off from their 1998pace.Long-term interest rates trended downward in early 1999 but more than retraced those declines by theend of the year. Equity prices rose over much of 1999, raising the value of household assets andimproving the general sense of financial well-being of our citizens as well as lowering the cost ofcapital faced by businesses.Recovery in Asia, with perhaps the apparent exception of Japan, and a pick-up in growth in Europeaccompanied this good news in the United States. During the first half of 1998, net exports subtractedalmost 1¾ percentage points from GDP growth. With conditions improving overseas, the externalsector subtracted less than ¾ percentage point from growth in the second half of 1999.Throughout 1999, the Federal Open Market Committee took action to maintain balance in theeconomy. The sense of the FOMC was that the tightening of labor markets that accompanied a growthof demand exceeding even the stepped-up pace of supply growth would likely create upward pressureson labor costs and eventually on the rate of price inflation. Accordingly, we moved preemptively,raising rates 75 basis points in three increments. This tightening reversed the easings that had been putin place during the second half of 1998 in response to the market turmoil, including in the US markets,triggered by the unexpected events in Russia. As you well know, rates were raised another 25 basispoints at our meeting earlier this month.At the February meeting, the FOMC also abandoned the approach of discussing “biases” regardinginterest rate movements, which seemed to engender overly strong reactions or a misreading of ourintentions from markets. Instead, the FOMC adopted the approach of discussing our views oneconomic developments and potential risks to good economic performance. Using this new approach,the FOMC earlier this month indicated a concern that risks were weighted mainly toward conditionsthat might lead to increased inflation.
BIS Review 15/20002Sources of performanceFour major forces provide the underpinning for the vigorous domestic growth we are currentlyexperiencing. The first is the creation of, and massive investment in, information and communicationstechnology. This capital spending, along with the apparent technological improvements, is thought tohave been important in the increase in productivity - the output of goods and services per hour ofwork - that is currently providing such momentum for the economy of the United States. The secondmajor force is business deregulation. The removal of unnecessary government regulation started morethan 20 years ago, during the administration of President Gerald Ford, and gathered momentum duringthe Carter years. It has altered the business landscape. Deregulation allowed, indeed forced, businessesto focus more clearly on a market place that has become more competitive, with fewer constraints andincreased flexibility. The third major force is a more prudent fiscal policy. The 1990s werecharacterized by a movement of federal government balances toward and then into surplus, which,many believe, has freed up resources for private-sector investment.The final major force is the reduction of both actual and expected inflation. Relatively stable priceshave allowed businesses and households to plan their economic affairs with an expectation that thevalue of investments will not be eroded through a pernicious and uncertain increase in the generalprice level. Indeed, relative price level stability has reinforced the impetus provided by deregulationfor businesses to manage their affairs with a priority on efficiency.Observations and open issues: resource utilizationAgainst this backdrop, I want to raise some issues where further progress is needed if we are tounderstand recent macroeconomic events better. Some of these issues have been of concern for sometime, and a few are new.The first issue I wish to raise involves the supply side of the economy and grows out of the recent,unusual conjuncture of rapid growth and high resource utilization with low and stable inflation. Whatis the proper measurement of resource tightness? The two most prominent measures of resourcetightness, capacity utilization in manufacturing and the rate of unemployment, have historically movedfairly closely together over the cycle. However, they have diverged in the past several years, in part asthe surge in investment has provided considerable capacity to the manufacturing sector while labormarkets have become tighter and tighter. We need a better understanding of the implications of thisdivergence and, in particular, a clearer sense of which measure, or combination of measures, ofresource utilization best foreshadows the emergence of price pressures.A second, and related, issue is whether the nature of “capacity” has changed. In the 1940s and 1950s,large-scale units of fixed machinery - such as blast furnaces and assembly lines - more normallycharacterized manufacturing capacity. Many observers have argued that, because this capacityrequired long lead times to manufacture, test and install, available capacity was easier to measure andslower to change. In such circumstances, high levels of capacity utilization were good predictors ofresource tightness, which was likely to translate into pricing pressure. Now, we hear, capacity inmanufacturing is more technology intensive and can be adjusted more easily to reflect supply anddemand conditions. If true, this relatively “elastic” supply of manufacturing capacity would imply thatcapacity utilization may not become “tight” by historical standards and our measure of capacityutilization would therefore be a less-certain early warning signal of potential pricing pressure. I haveseen no proof of the assertion that the nature of manufacturing capacity has changed, although theexperience of the last several years suggests that it has.A third related issue has to do with the average workweek and labor force participation. During thisepisode of strong growth, the average workweek has not increased significantly. In 1994, the averageworkweek was about 34½ hours, and today it is about 34½ hours. This steadiness is in part due to mixshifts, as the economy moves away from manufacturing sector jobs, in which the 40-hour workweek isthe norm, to service sector jobs, in which shorter workweeks are more common. Moreover, the laborforce participation rate, while fluctuating, has remained around 67% during this period. Given thevarious other elements of evidence regarding labor market tightness, including survey data on job
3BIS Review 15/2000market conditions and the measured unemployment rate, I find it puzzling that both the workweek andthe labor force participation rate have not increased more strongly. One theory, of course, is thathousehold wealth, to which I turn next, might limit the felt need by some potential workers,presumably young people dependent on parents and perhaps older citizens, to participate in the labormarket.Observations and open issues: equity marketsAlso of interest are valuations in equity markets, the role they should play in policymaking, andwhether old relationships have changed. Many observers have asked if I think that the Federal Reservecan or should have a fixed view on the proper level of equity markets. Every time I consider thisquestion, I come up with the same answer: the Fed cannot target specific levels in equity markets.Equity prices are set by the give-and-take of supply and demand, with participants buying and sellingbased on their own information that shapes their long-term expectations. Investors can and should beinfluenced by several factors, including expectations of corporate earnings, attractiveness ofalternative investments (both domestic and international), and differing appetites for “ownership” riskas opposed to “creditor” risk. I believe that the Federal Reserve’s tools - primarily short-term interestrates - are too blunt to attempt to achieve specific levels of stock market valuations. I also believe thatpolicymakers should not necessarily attempt to put their judgments of correct values above those ofthe market. Simply put, equity prices should properly be thought of as a relative price-the value of theexisting capital stock relative to that of goods. Central banks are not good at fine-tuning relativeprices. Rather, leave us the responsibility for determining the policy that anchors the general pricelevel in the long run.However, equity markets do have important spillover effects on the real economy. As you know,economists often speak of the “wealth effect”, and econometric modeling indicates that consumersultimately tend to spend about three to four cents for every dollar increment to wealth. In addition,consumer sentiment is tied to feelings of financial well-being. Through both of these channels, theso-called wealth effect and the more general influence on consumer sentiment, equity valuations canand do affect consumption and macroeconomic performance. Equity markets are also a significantsource of investment capital, and valuations in the stock market are one determinant of the cost ofcapital for businesses. Therefore, equity prices affect business fixed investment, a major driver of oureconomy. Given the economic importance of equity prices, it is reasonable for policymakers tomonitor developments in this market even if we do not “target” specific values. We have seen in othereconomies that the bursting of bubbles in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that affectreal economic activity. Therefore, the maintenance of sound equity market conditions is of concern topolicymakers, though how that can be accomplished is often far from clear.My questions about equity markets center on the issue of valuation and the wealth effect. Economistspropose numerous approaches to determining the “correct” level of equity prices. One such approachcompares equity market valuations (namely earnings-price ratios) to the return on fixed-incomesecurities, generally the 10-year US Treasury bond. But many observers have suggested that thismeasure of the “correct” stock market valuation may no longer be accurate. Some suggest that thenature of equity markets has changed with the introduction of new instruments that allow for the bettermanagement or sharing of risks. Therefore, these observers assert that lower premiums over risk-freereturns are appropriate and that old relationships between earnings-price ratios and the return onTreasury instruments no longer hold. Others argue that, in this world of knowledge-intensiveindustries, accounting treatments do not accurately measure true economic earnings, and thereforemeasures of “correct” stock valuations do not capture economic reality that market participants see.These assertions are interesting, but they need further investigation.In addition, with respect to proper valuations, we know that many businesses are using options as aform of compensation to employees and that the value of these options is not being recorded ascompensation at the time they are granted. We roughly estimate that accounting for the value ofoptions granted would have reduced reported income for S&P 1,500 firms nearly 10% in 1998. Thesame adjustment would have reduced the growth rate of reported income for S&P 1,500 firms almost
BIS Review 15/200042½ percentage points per year, on average, during the 1996-98 period. When looked at with theserefinements, the current earnings-price ratios appear even more out of alignment with historicalexperience.When one considers the performance of the stock market during the recent past, it is clear that thegains are not evenly distributed, even among stock market investors. Some of the greatest beneficiariesof the unprecedented generation of stock market wealth have been those with the skills and the workstyle to work in high-tech companies, who are rewarded with stock, and those with the courage toinvest in high-tech sectors. This observation leads to several questions. First, how skewed is thedistribution of gains from the stock market? If gains are indeed skewed, what then is the actualdynamic of the wealth effect? When does an unequal participation in equities become sufficientlybroad-based to influence the path of our economy? I think of these questions as providing themicroeconomic underpinnings to our macroeconomic performance.Finally, we have seen a run-up in margin debt, particularly during the last two months of 1999 and thefirst month of 2000. I believe that the Federal Reserve should not foster the impression that we aretargeting the equity market by adjusting our one tool in the margin area, namely initial marginrequirements. However, given our obvious interest in macro-stability, it is useful to understand morefully what has motivated this recent run-up in margin. Some argue that it reflects a desire on the partof investors to capture some capital gains, while others are quick to point out that, as a percentage ofmarket valuation, margin has not increased dramatically. According to another theory, marginborrowing is the realm of the small investor whereas large investors finance equity purchases throughother means. In any event, prudent margin procedures are an important part of sound business practice.I expect that those extending margin credit, especially the major clearing firms, as well as investors,and the public at large, would continue to recognize that conservative margin practices are in their owninterest.Observations and open issues: international marketsLet me turn now to the role of international developments in policy. Our mandate gives priority toprice stability and maximum sustainable employment, which I think are the right elements for us toconsider in policy deliberations. Therefore, I believe that international economic considerations, likestock market valuations, should receive only the focus merited because of their implications for theUS economy. Certainly, developments in the international sector, in particular a large and growingcurrent account deficit, might indicate that there are imbalances in the economy of the United States.Similarly, movements in the exchange value of the US dollar might transmit pressures on inflation, butthey also are an important transmission mechanism for monetary policy. However, managing theexternal balance and the exchange value of the US dollar is obviously not the goal of monetary policy.One important contribution to the ongoing deterioration of our current account balance is the tendencyfor US residents, for reasons not fully understood by economists, to have a higher propensity to importout of every dollar of income than do residents in the countries that are our major trading partners.This, of course, means that even sustaining trend growth both in the United States and in our tradingpartners will not necessarily close the trade gap. To do so would require a period of sustainedstronger-than-trend growth overseas.Many professional economists and market observers now question the sustainability of our currentaccount deficit. I suggest that the combination of a large current account deficit and a strong US dollaris, in part, a reflection of the relative attractiveness of the US economy as a destination for foreigncapital. We are attracting savings from abroad because we currently have a higher rate of return oninvestment than many other countries do. This state of affairs, of course, is a reflection of the factorsthat have given rise to this long period of domestic prosperity. How much longer prosperity cancontinue is obviously the key question. The answer depends on the ability of businesses and workersin the United States to continue to generate growing productivity increases. Because few of us forecastthe current period of investment-driven productivity increases, it is difficult to predict when it willend. We know only that, at some point, productivity will stop accelerating. But the potential forchange is not the exclusive domain of the United States. The ability of other countries to adjust their
5BIS Review 15/2000systems of production to take advantage of new technologies will be an important determinant ofwhen other markets will offer returns that are comparable to those available in the United States. Iimagine that, seeing the gains that we have experienced from our capital deepening, investors wouldlook for the earliest signs of a similar phenomenon in other countries. The one lesson we can offer isthat the configuration of competitive and flexible markets, management focused on shareholder value,and supportive macroeconomic conditions is not achieved without costs in terms of some societaldislocations and that configuration requires good fortune, sacrifice and discipline.ConclusionAs you can see, these are interesting times in which to be a central banker. This complex set of forcesrequires continued vigilance on our part. Additionally, the last 24 months have raised an important setof questions regarding measures of real economic performance, the behavior of inflation, financialmarket indicators, and the growing globalization of today’s economy. I highlighted some of thesequestions with you today. I have enjoyed immensely having to grapple with these issues but recognizethat we at the central bank may have all of the right questions but do not have all the answers.
1BIS Review 24/2000Mr Carse: The importance of corporate governance in banksSpeech by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at TheYear 2000 Millennium Dinner of The Association of International Accountants - Hong Kong Branch,Hong Kong Bankers Club, Hong Kong, on 17 March 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I am very pleased to be here this evening to speak to the Association on the subject of corporategovernance in banks. I have chosen this as my theme both because it is highly topical for reasons that Iwill explain later and because it should be of particular interest to this audience. The Association playsan important role in the training and promotion of the accounting profession; and accountants are avital component in corporate governance not simply in their specific role as auditors but also as asource of highly trained directors and managers.I will begin by giving you a brief situation report on the banking sector because this is relevant to thegovernance issue. Clearly, the situation is looking a lot better than it has done for the last two years.As the 1999 results released so far have shown, the performance of individual banks is by no meansuniform. Some have done a lot better than others, depending on such factors as the mix of theirbusiness and where they are in the provisioning cycle. But the figures collected by the HKMA for thelocal banks’ Hong Kong offices show that, in aggregate, their pre-tax operating profits rose by about15% in 1999. This compares with the decline of 33% that we saw in 1998. This improvement has beensupported by renewed growth in net interest income. Moreover, the aggregate bad debt charge of thelocal banks showed little change in 1999, having increased by 335% in the previous year. It is true thatsome banks were obliged to increase their provisions against Mainland related companies during thecourse of the year. But the general trend in the latter part of 1999 was that the growth in new problemloans began to slow down as the economy improved. This is supported by the figures for problemloans in the final quarter of 1999 which we published recently. These show that the ratio of loansclassified as “substandard”, “doubtful” or “loss” to total loans fell to 9.8% at the end of December,compared with the 1999 peak of 10.3% at the end of September. At the risk of tempting fate it doesseem that the worst of the bad debt problems for Hong Kong banks is over. Certainly all the localbanks are expecting a significant reduction in the bad debt charge in 2000, which will give a boost toprofitability.Can we say therefore that life for the local banks is getting back to where it was prior to the crisis? Theanswer unfortunately has to be “no”. We are certainly moving into calmer waters for the banks butthere are strong currents, and a few sharp rocks, underneath the surface. The fact is that thecompetitive environment for banks in Hong Kong is changing radically as it is for all banks around theworld. The current competition in mortgage lending is a case in point. Banks are increasingly preparedto lend at margins well below prime. We are getting to the point where it is becoming difficult to earnan economic return from this business once funding costs and other expenses are taken into account. Itcan be argued that this in part reflects the current excess liquidity in the market and that margins willstart to move up again as loan demand and the property market recover in line with the economy.There is some truth in this, but it is difficult to see margins on mortgage business recovering too far.Certainly they will not get back to where they were in the boom years before the crisis. There are toomany active players in the market, both domestic and foreign, to allow this to happen.What this means is that the banks are going to have to work harder to earn a profit than they have donein the past. They will have to do this at a time when the last stages of interest rate deregulation inHong Kong are taking place, starting in the middle of this year and finishing in the middle of 2001.The impact of deregulation cannot be predicted with certainty but the likely impact will be to increasefunding costs and thus squeeze the net interest margin. The banks will therefore have to find ways togenerate income through new products and through new charging policies. You can expect fees for the
BIS Review 24/20002various banking services to rise in the deregulated environment. The banks will also be under greaterpressure to reduce costs through exploiting new delivery systems, re-engineering their processes andbetter managing their risks.Technology is at the heart of these issues. It is one of the main forces which is driving increasedcompetition and one of the main weapons that the banks are using to respond to competition. How toharness the power of technology, and how to finance the necessary investment, constitute the mainstrategic challenge facing banks in the world today.This brings me to the main theme of the importance of corporate governance in banks. It will be theresponsibility of the board of directors and senior managers of banks to navigate the way through thestrategic challenges that I have described, and they must ensure that they have the capacity to do so.Corporate governance is of course not just important for banks. It is something that needs to beaddressed in relation to all companies. The Financial Secretary recognized this by announcing in hisBudget speech that he had asked the Secretary for Financial Services with the assistance of theStanding Committee on Company Law Reform to conduct a comprehensive study on corporategovernance in Hong Kong this year. The objective will be to plug any gaps in the corporategovernance regime and to become a benchmark in the region. Market bodies, professionalorganizations and regulators will be asked to help in this task. Your own Association may be able tocontribute.I do however believe that sound corporate governance is particularly important for banks. The rapidchanges brought about by globalization, deregulation and technological advances are increasing therisks in banking systems. Moreover, unlike other companies, most of the funds used by banks toconduct their business belong to their creditors, in particular to their depositors. Linked to this is thefact that the failure of a bank affects not only its own stakeholders, but may have a systemic impact onthe stability of other banks. All the more reason therefore to try to ensure that banks are properlymanaged.It is true to say that banks in Hong Kong are already well managed by international and certainly byregional standards. The fact that they survived the financial crisis in generally good shape is atestament to this. However, during the financial crisis, the HKMA came across a few individual caseswhere the board of directors did not perform as well as might be expected. And this, coupled with thechallenges that lie ahead, has led us to look at ways in which corporate governance among the banksmight be further enhanced.If I could sum up our objective, it would be to try to reassert the role of the board of directors in banks.While the day-to-day running of banks should certainly be left in the hands of the management, theboard must play a leadership role in approving the objectives, strategy and business plans of the bank,monitoring the performance of management and ensuring that the internal control and riskmanagement systems of the bank are effective. The board must also make sure that the bank conductsits affairs with integrity and in accordance with high ethical standards. The board is part of the systemof checks and balances that ensures that neither large shareholders nor management abuse their powerand that decisions are taken with the bank’s best interests in mind. If the board does not play its fullpart, a vacuum in leadership will be created. This vacuum may be filled by the shareholders becomingdirectly involved in running the bank’s affairs, or by the executive management acting more or less inisolation. In either case, the board of directors is bypassed and checks and balances are lost.The HKMA has recently issued for consultation a draft guideline for banks and other authorizedinstitutions which sets out what the HKMA expects of them in relation to corporate governance. Theguideline aims to establish minimum standards. It does not itself have the force of law, but failure toadhere to the standards may call into question whether the bank continues to satisfy the criteria forauthorization laid down in the Banking Ordinance.The draft guideline describes the general responsibilities of the board, the legal obligations of directorsand the use of auditors. It then goes on to specify detailed guidelines to which locally incorporatedauthorized institutions are expected to adhere. Let me summarise these for you. While I will refer to
3BIS Review 24/2000the guidelines in relation to banks, most of them are also applicable to restricted licence banks anddeposit taking companies.• First, the board should ensure that the bank establishes policies, procedures and controls tomanage the various types of risk with which it is faced.Altogether the HKMA has identified eight types of risk for the purposes of its supervision.These are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, reputation, legal and strategicrisk. The board should approve the relevant policies while management should put them intoeffect. It is important that the policies should not exist merely for form’s sake - in otherwords, just to keep the HKMA happy - but should dictate how the institution is actually runin practice.• Second, the board should ensure that the bank fully understands the provisions of section 83of the Banking Ordinance on connected lending and establishes a policy on such lending.While there are no indications that banks in Hong Kong are abusing the rules on connectedlending, there seems to be uncertainty among some banks as to how the rules work. We havetherefore recommended that the board should ensure that the bank fully understands its legalobligations under the Banking Ordinance and establishes a detailed policy on connectedlending.• Third, the board should ensure that it receives the management letter from the externalauditor without delay together with the comments of management.We have specified that the management letter should normally be received within fourmonths from the year-end. Of course, this is not something that is totally within the controlof the bank. I would therefore put in a plea to any bank auditors in the audience to submit themanagement letter without delay.• Fourth, the board should maintain an appropriate level of checks and balances against theinfluence of management and/or the shareholder controllers in order to ensure that decisionsare taken with the bank’s best interests in mind.The key issue here is the number of independent non-executive directors there should be onthe board of banks. We recommend a minimum of three to ensure that there is a sufficientpool of independent directors to sit on the various committees of the board and to coverabsences.• Fifth, the board should establish an audit committee with written terms of referencespecifying its authorities and duties.We recommend that the audit committee should be made up of non-executive directors, themajority of whom should be independent.• Sixth, board meetings should be held preferably on a monthly basis, but in any event no lessthan once every quarter.The board can only fulfil its leadership role if it meets frequently enough and receivessufficient information from management to be able to monitor the financial position andperformance of the bank.• Seventh, individual directors should attend at least half of the board meetings held in eachfinancial year.We fully recognize that the effectiveness of a director cannot be measured simply byattendance at board meetings. But equally it is difficult for even the most competentindividual to make a contribution if he or she does not turn up for meetings in the first place.• Finally, the HKMA will meet the full board of directors of each bank every year.It is not the intention that the HKMA should participate in board meetings. Rather, we willmeet with the board with the aim of strengthening communication between the HKMA and
BIS Review 24/20004the board at the highest level. Among other things, this will give us the opportunity to givethe board first hand information on the major findings about the bank that emerged from ouronsite examinations and offsite reviews. It will also give the board the opportunity to conveyits views directly to us, for example on whether we are imposing too much of a regulatoryburden.As a result of the consultation exercise, we have received a number of supportive comments. It isdifficult, after all, to argue against the principle that banks should be encouraged to raise theirgovernance standards. However, a number of concerns have also been voiced. I will not go into thesein detail, but some of the questions that have been raised are as follows: Is the HKMA interfering toomuch in the way in which banks choose to manage themselves? Is too much burden being placed uponthe board, and upon non-executive directors in particular, in terms of establishing policies andcontrols? Should there be a distinction between listed and non-listed banks? Is it right to place moreonerous requirements on banks compared with other companies, for example as regards the requirednumber of independent directors? And is it going to be possible to find sufficient independentdirectors of the right quality?I have answered some of these questions already in this speech. We do believe that banks are differentfrom other companies because they are looking after other people’s money. From this point of view, itdoes not matter whether the bank is listed or non-listed. We also believe that banks are exposed tospecial risks compared with other companies, and that the board needs to ensure that policies are inplace to manage these risks. This is not to say that the board should actually formulate these policiesitself. That can be left to management. But the policies should certainly be approved by the board. Asto whether we are placing too much burden on the non-executive directors, it should be recognizedthat being a director of a bank does involve heavy responsibilities. Moreover, the criminal sanctions inthe Banking Ordinance apply to all directors, whether they are executive or non-executive. Weacknowledge that it may not be an easy task to find non-executive directors with the right skills anddegree of independence. We have therefore reconsidered our original recommendations on the numberof independent directors to some extent, particularly in relation to restricted licence banks and deposit-taking companies, and we are prepared to give institutions which do not already comply more time todo so if necessary.Finally, on the complaint that we are perhaps being too intrusive, I would point to our statutoryresponsibilities under the Banking Ordinance to ensure that institutions operate with integrity,prudence and competence and that individual directors are fit and proper. Concern about corporategovernance falls squarely within these responsibilities. However, let me stress that this is not an areawhere we would want to take a narrow legalistic position. We are anxious to work closely with thebanking industry to arrive at a mutually acceptable approach to corporate governance which isappropriate to the particular circumstances of Hong Kong. We will be aiming to ensure that the finalversion of our guideline embodies this approach.
1BIS Review 24/2000Mr Mboweni: The role of the South African Reserve Bank in the economyAddress by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Pretoria Councilfor Businesswomen, Pretoria, held on 14 March 2000.*      *      *1.The establishment of the Reserve BankThe South African Reserve Bank was established in 1921 as the central bank of South Africa in termsof a special act of Parliament. The founding of the Reserve Bank was the direct result of disruptionscaused by the First World War and formed part of a more comprehensive set of measures meant todeal with unsatisfactory monetary and financial conditions. At that time, the existence of central bankswas still not common, and the South African Reserve Bank was only the fourth central bank foundedoutside Europe. The other three central banks were established in the United States of America, Japanand Java.The Reserve Bank was mainly set up because of the need to issue uniform banknotes and to preventthe over-issue of banknotes. Before the Bank was established an assortment of banknotes were incirculation in South Africa which were issued in terms of the laws of the various provinces. With theformation of the Reserve Bank, it obtained the sole right to issue banknotes in South Africa. TheBank’s first notes were issued to the public in April 1922. At the end of that year the banknotes incirculation amounted to R20 million. At the end of February 2000 the notes and coin in circulationtotalled R27,4 billion.The Reserve Bank’s size and operations were at first hampered by various statutory restrictions on itslending and investing. Some expansions to the Bank’s powers to grant credit were brought about byamendments to the Currency and Banking Act in 1923 and 1930. A more comprehensive revision ofthe Bank’s powers was affected in 1944. Subsequently, many changes were also made to strengthenthe bank’s hand in carrying out its functions. These changes reflected a recognition of the Bank’s needfor greater freedom of action in its day-to-day operations and an awareness of the need for sufficientpolicy instruments in conducting monetary policy.Today, the Reserve Bank virtually performs the full range of functions and duties that are customarilycarried out by central banks. In addition, the Reserve Bank is actively involved in the marketing ofSouth Africa’s gold production. The main functions of the Reserve Bank are:• the issuing of banknotes and coin;• acting as banker to the government;• acting as a bank to other banks;• providing facilities for the clearing and settlement of claims between banks;• acting as custodian of the country’s gold and other foreign reserves;• acting as “bank of rediscount” and “lender of last resort”;• engaging in public debt management and open-market operations;• collecting, processing and interpreting economic statistics and other information, and• formulating and implementing monetary policy.
BIS Review 24/200022.Legal framework of the BankThe existence, management, powers and functions of the Bank are currently governed by the ReserveBank Act No 90 of 1989, which came into operation on 1 August 1989. However, the Reserve Bankhas also been identified as the central bank of South Africa in the Constitution of the Republic ofSouth Africa. As the Bank is a statutory institution, it is only allowed to perform functions expresslyor by implication assigned to or conferred upon it by these two legislative enactments.Since its establishment, the Reserve Bank has always been privately owned. Today, the Bank has morethan 700 shareholders. The shares of the Bank are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and noindividual shareholder is allowed to hold more than one-half per cent of the capital of the Bank. TheBank may never pay a dividend of more than 10% per annum on the nominal value of its capital.The Bank is managed by a Board of 14 Directors, seven of whom are elected by the shareholder’s torepresent them on the Board. Without holding any shares in the Bank, the Government has the right toappoint the other seven Board members. The seven members appointed by the President includes theGovernor and three Deputy Governors, who are full-time executive members, plus three part-timeDirectors.The Governor and the Deputy Governors are appointed for five years, while all other directors servefor periods of three years. All directors are eligible for reappointment or re-election after the expirationof their terms of office.The Reserve Bank Act provides further that of the seven directors elected by the shareholders, fourshall be persons who are or have been actively and primarily engaged in commerce or finance, oneshall be a person who is or has been engaged in agriculture and two shall be persons who are or havebeen engaged in industrial pursuits. Members of Parliament, directors, officers or employees of banksor mutual banks and persons who are not South African citizens resident in the country aredisqualified from being appointed or elected as a director of the Bank.The Board of the Reserve Bank has been given an important degree of autonomy for the execution ofits duties. In terms of the Constitution: The South African Reserve Bank, in pursuit of its primaryobjective, must perform its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice, but theremust be regular consultation between the Bank and the Cabinet member responsible for nationalfinancial matters”.As a creation of government, the Reserve Bank is, of course, accountable to Parliament and theGovernment has an important say in the activities of the Bank. In terms of section 31 of the ReserveBank Act the Governor of the Bank must submit a report annually to the Minister of Finance relatingto the implementation of monetary policy. Moreover, in terms of section 32 of this Act the Bank muston a monthly basis submit a statement of its assets and liabilities and annually its annual financialstatements to the Department of Finance. These reports are then tabled in Parliament by the Ministerof Finance.The Governor of the Reserve Bank is also summoned to appear before the Portfolio Committee onFinance from time to time. In these meetings he usually explains the monetary policy stance tocommittee members and answers questions on the Bank’s views on financial and economicdevelopments.Section 37 of the Reserve Bank Act provides further that if at any time the Minister of Finance is ofthe opinion that the Bank has failed to comply with any provision of the Act or of a regulation madethereunder, he may by notice in writing require the Board of the Bank to make good or remedy thedefault within a specified time. If the Board fails to comply with such a notice, the Minister may applyto the Supreme Court for an order compelling the Board to make good or remedy the default, and theCourt may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.
3BIS Review 24/20003.Primary objective of the BankIn all these endeavours, the primary or strategic objective of the Reserve Bank is to achieve andmaintain stable financial conditions in the country. This objective is spelled out in both theConstitution of the Republic and in the South African Reserve Bank Act. In these acts it is recognisedthat only by protecting the currency can balanced and sustainable economic growth be achieved. It isbelieved in the Bank, and indeed in most countries of the world, that the potential growth rate of aneconomy and the optimum creation of employment opportunities can only be attained under stablefinancial conditions. By fulfilling this primary objective, the Reserve Bank will make its contributionto sustainable higher economic growth in South Africa.The question may be asked what is meant by the term financial stability? In a broad sense financialstability can be defined to include price stability as well as stable conditions in the financial sector as awhole. Price stability is achieved when changes in the general price level do not materially affect theeconomic decision-making process. Although relative price movements will still have an impact onproduction, consumption and investment, the rate of inflation or deflation is not an important factor inthe decisions taken by producers, consumers and the authorities under stable price conditions.The stability of key institutions and markets in the financial system is achieved when there is a highdegree of confidence that the financial infrastructure of the economy is able to meet the requirementsof market participants. However, it is important to realise that financial stability does not exclude thefailure of individual banks or financial institutions. A financial institution can go bankrupt in stablefinancial conditions. It is only where systemic risks arise, i.e. where the financial sector as a wholemay be influenced by an incident, that the situation can be described as financially unstable.The two elements of financial stability, i.e. price stability and stability of the financial sector, areclosely related. Failure to maintain one of these elements provides a very uncertain operatingenvironment for the other, with causality running in both directions. For example, high inflation canlead to tighter monetary policy, higher interest rates, an increase in the non-performing loans of banksand a fall in asset and collateral values, which can cause bank and other failures in the financial sector.Conversely, disruptions in the financial system will make the transmission mechanism of monetarypolicy less effective and can materially affect changes in the general price level.4.Monetary policy frameworkIn its objective to establish and maintain financial stability it is therefore important that the ReserveBank encourages and supports the development of sound and well-managed banking institutions. Thisis done, firstly, by monitoring the financial risks that banks undertake. The Bank SupervisionDepartment is charged with the responsibility to ensure prudential soundness in the banking system.Secondly, lender-of-last-resort assistance is provided to banks to safeguard the system from systemicrisks. This assistance is never provided automatically to any bank that encounters difficulties, but it isonly applied in cases where a bank is encountering liquidity shortages and where its failure wouldpose a serious threat to the financial system as a whole.Financial stability also requires well-developed and efficient functioning financial markets. In thisregard it is important to have sufficient banknotes and coin in circulation, so as not to hamper tradeand financial transactions. Without a system for the clearance and settlement of bank claims, thepayments for transactions would be encumbered. In addition, the Reserve Bank has a vested interest inthe development and functioning of the money, capital and foreign exchange markets if it wants tomaintain financial stability.In order to achieve price stability, the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget Speech on23 February 2000 that the government has decided to adopt an inflation-targeting monetary policyframework in South Africa. This means that the authorities are now targeting the rate of inflationdirectly, instead of setting guidelines for intermediative objectives such as money supply and bankcredit extension to bring inflation down to lower levels. The inflation target has been expressed as anaverage annual rate of increase of between 3 and 6% in the consumer price index excluding the effectof changes in mortgage rates for the year 2002.
BIS Review 24/20004With the announcement of this new framework the inflation target becomes the overriding objective ofmonetary policy. The objective of monetary policy is now to hit the target. Missing the targetconsistently with wide margins will lead to lost prestige and credibility for the central bank. Such aframework for monetary policy can only be successful if the public is certain that the central bank isserious about containing inflation.This new framework has been adopted in South Africa to remove any uncertainties about the monetarypolicy stance that is adopted by the authorities. Inflation targeting makes policy transparent in thesense that it makes the central bank’s intentions clear in a way that should improve the planning of theprivate sector. Inflation targeting should also provide an anchor for inflation expectations, lead togreater stability in interest rates if it brings about better coordination of policy measures and clearlydefines the accountability of the Reserve Bank.In this new monetary policy framework the operational procedures of the Reserve Bank will basicallyremain unchanged. The Bank will accordingly continue to influence the total monetary demand in theeconomy to achieve price stability. The Reserve Bank controls the supply of money through itsoperations in providing liquidity to the banking sector and by affecting the total demand for moneythat emanates from the private and public sector. Its operational variable in this process is the level ofshort-term interest rates. The level of interest rates is determined primarily by total saving in theeconomy, the inflow of capital, and by the demand for funds from government, businesses and privateindividuals. The central bank affects the cost of short-term funds through the impact of its actions onthe repo rate, i.e. the interest rate at which it provides in the liquidity needs of the banks. In such aframework there is no target for the exchange rate of the rand. The external value of the rand formspart of the results obtained in the economy.5.Decision-making processIn view of the growing complexity of functional relationships between the various economic andfinancial variables, a detailed and careful analysis has to be made of the underlying economicconditions. A large number of economic indicators are therefore monitored by the Bank to arrive at itsmonetary policy stance, such as developments in price indices, the level of interest rates, the shape ofthe yield curve, changes in nominal salaries and wages, nominal unit labour costs, the gap betweenpotential and actual domestic output, money market conditions, the overall balance of paymentsposition, the net open position in foreign exchange and the public sector borrowing requirement.To evaluate the results of such an analysis of the economy a Monetary Policy Committee was createdin the Reserve Bank. The Monetary Policy Committee consists of the Governor and Deputy Governorsas voting members and senior officials of the Bank as non-voting members. The first meeting of theMonetary Policy Committee was already held in October 1999. At the meetings of this Committee anevaluation is made over a two-day period of international and domestic economic conditions, theexpected behaviour of the inflation rate and the current stance of monetary policy.Although the governors of the Bank are the only members with voting rights on the Committee,consensus decisions are normally made. The final decision-making power on monetary policy mattersnevertheless is still vested in the Governor’s Committee, i.e. a subcommittee of the Board comprisingthe Governor and three Deputy Governors.After the completion of every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee a statement is issued to thepublic. This statement summarises the more important aspects that were discussed at the meeting andthe conclusions that were made. In this statement the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank isalso formulated. For example, in the last monetary policy statement of 2 March 2000 it was concludedthat after taking cognisance of the current economic circumstances and consistent with the inflationtarget set by the authorities, the Monetary Policy Committee is of the opinion that the current level ofthe repo rate is appropriate. In accordance with the decision taken at the previous meeting, the ReserveBank will therefore continue to manage the banks’ daily liquidity requirement in a way that will resultin a repo rate at or around 11.75%”.
5BIS Review 24/20006.ConclusionAs already indicated, this decision was taken after lengthy deliberations and a detailed analysis of theunderlying economic conditions in the country by senior staff of the Reserve Bank. More in particular,the latest decision of the Monetary Policy Committee took note of the following economicdevelopments:• Favourable global growth prospects with some signs of an acceleration of inflation inindustrial countries and a concomitant rise in their interest rates.• South Arican recovery in domestic economic activity that gathered momentum during thecourse of 1999. The growth from quarter to quarter in real gross domestic product increasedfrom 2% in the fourth quarter of 1998 to no less than 32% in the fourth quarter of 1999.• With the increase in economic activity, gross domestic expenditure began to pick up andincreased at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 42% in the fourth quarter of 1999.This high growth can be ascribed to a rise in consumption expenditure, an increase in thefixed investment of private organisations and a strong accumulation of inventories.• Conditions in the labour market remained depressed with further job losses of about 80 000being recorded in the first nine months of 1999.• The current account of the balance of payments showed a deficit of 2% of gross domesticproduct in the fourth quarter of 1999. This deficit did not present any problems to thedomestic economy and was wiped out by a net inflow of capital of no less than R14 billion.Moreover, the balance of payments is basically very healthy, which makes it difficult tounderstand why the external value of the rand recently came under some pressure.• Clear signs of increased inflationary pressures have become apparent in the South Africaneconomy. This has been reflected in a rise in the year-on-year rate of the production priceindex from 5.7% in September 1999 to 8.2% in January 2000. This acceleration in inflationwas mainly due to increases in the prices of petrol and diesel, transport equipment and morerecently food products. The recent floods experienced in the country, a further increase ininternational oil prices and the more rapid rise in money supply growth could also causerising inflation over the short term.• Over the medium to longer term, inflation in South Africa is expected to subside againbecause of the application of fiscal and monetary discipline, a projected low growth innominal unit labour costs, international competition and the excess production capacity inthe economy.All in all the economic conditions in South Africa are at present much more favourable than at thebeginning of the preceding year. With the further improvement in the production structure of thecountry envisaged in the President’s State of the Nation Address on 4 February 2000, the outlook forthe South African economy indeed looks very promising.
1BIS Review 13/2000Mr Greenspan presents the Federal Reserve’s semi-annual report on theeconomy and monetary policy to the US House of RepresentativesTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, US House of Representatives on17 February 2000.*      *      *I appreciate this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve’s semi-annual report on the economy andmonetary policy.There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew more than 4% in 1999 and surgedforward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably. At the same time,inflation has remained largely contained. An increase in the overall rate of inflation in 1999 wasmainly a result of higher energy prices. Importantly, unit labor costs actually declined in the secondhalf of the year. Indeed, still-preliminary data indicate that total unit cost increases last year remainedextraordinarily low, even as the business expansion approached a record nine years. Domesticoperating profit margins, after sagging for eighteen months, apparently turned up again in the fourthquarter, and profit expectations for major corporations for the first quarter have been undergoingupward revisions since the beginning of the year - scarcely an indication of imminent economicweakness.The economic forces at workUnderlying this performance, unprecedented in my half-century of observing the American economy,is a continuing acceleration in productivity. Non-farm business output per workhour increased 3¼%during the past year - likely more than 4% when measured by non-farm business income. Securityanalysts’ projections of long-term earnings, an indicator of expectations of company productivity,continued to be revised upward in January, extending a string of upward revisions that began in early1995. One result of this remarkable economic performance has been a pronounced increase in livingstandards for the majority of Americans. Another has been a labor market that has provided jobopportunities for large numbers of people previously struggling to get on the first rung of a ladderleading to training, skills, and permanent employment.Yet those profoundly beneficial forces driving the American economy to competitive excellence arealso engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained, threaten our continuing prosperity.Accelerating productivity entails a matching acceleration in the potential output of goods and servicesand a corresponding rise in real incomes available to purchase the new output. The problem is that thepickup in productivity tends to create even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potentialaggregate supply. This occurs principally because a rise in structural productivity growth has itscounterpart in higher expectations for long-term corporate earnings. This, in turn, not only spursbusiness investment but also increases stock prices and the market value of assets held by households,creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet beenproduced.Historical evidence suggests that perhaps three to four cents out of every additional dollar of stockmarket wealth eventually is reflected in increased consumer purchases. The sharp rise in the amount ofconsumer outlays relative to disposable incomes in recent years, and the corresponding fall in thesaving rate, has been consistent with this so-called wealth effect on household purchases. Moreover,higher stock prices, by lowering the cost of equity capital, have helped to support the boom in capitalspending.
BIS Review 13/20002Outlays prompted by capital gains in excess of increases in income, as best we can judge, have addedabout 1 percentage point to annual growth of gross domestic purchases, on average, over the past fiveyears. The additional growth in spending of recent years that has accompanied these wealth gains aswell as other supporting influences on the economy appears to have been met in about equal measurefrom increased net imports and from goods and services produced by the net increase in newly hiredworkers over and above the normal growth of the work force, including a substantial net inflow ofworkers from abroad.But these safety valves that have been supplying goods and services to meet the recent increments topurchasing power largely generated by capital gains cannot be expected to absorb an excess of demandover supply indefinitely. First, growing net imports and a widening current account deficit require everlarger portfolio and direct foreign investments in the United States, an outcome that cannot continuewithout limit.Imbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for inflationpressures. While the pool of officially unemployed and those otherwise willing to work may continueto shrink, as it has persistently over the past seven years, there is an effective limit to new hiring,unless immigration is uncapped. At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of availableworkers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wage increases mustrise above even impressive gains in productivity. This would intensify inflationary pressures orsqueeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end.As would be expected, imbalances between demand and potential supply in markets for goods andservices are being mirrored in the financial markets by an excess in the demand for funds. As aconsequence, market interest rates are already moving in the direction of containing the excess ofdemand in financial markets and therefore in product markets as well. For example, BBB corporatebond rates adjusted for inflation expectations have risen by more than 1 percentage point during thepast two years. However, to date, rising business earnings expectations and declining compensationfor risk have more than offset the effects of this increase, propelling equity prices and the wealth effecthigher. Should this process continue, however, with the assistance of a monetary policy vigilantagainst emerging macroeconomic imbalances, real long-term rates will at some point be high enoughto finally balance demand with supply at the economy’s potential in both the financial and productmarkets. Other things equal, this condition will involve equity discount factors high enough to bringthe rise in asset values into line with that of household incomes, thereby stemming the impetus toconsumption relative to income that has come from rising wealth. This does not necessarily imply adecline in asset values - although that, of course, can happen at any time for any number of reasons -but rather that these values will increase no faster than household incomes.Because there are limits to the amount of goods and services that can be supplied from increasing netimports and by drawing on a limited pool of persons willing to work, it necessarily follows thatconsumption cannot keep rising faster than income. Moreover, outsized increases in wealth cannotpersist indefinitely either. For so long as the levels of consumption and investment are sensitive toasset values, equity values increasing at a pace faster than income, other things equal, will induce arise in overall demand in excess of potential supply. But that situation cannot persist without limitbecause the supply safety valves are themselves limited.With foreign economies strengthening and labor markets already tight, how the current wealth effect isfinally contained will determine whether the extraordinary expansion that it has helped foster can slowto a sustainable pace, without destabilizing the economy in the process.Technological change continues apaceOn a broader front, there are few signs to date of slowing in the pace of innovation and the spread ofour newer technologies that, as I have indicated in previous testimonies, have been at the root of ourextraordinary productivity improvement. Indeed, some analysts conjecture that we still may be in theearlier stages of the rapid adoption of new technologies and not yet in sight of the stage when this
3BIS Review 13/2000wave of innovation will crest. With so few examples in our history, there is very little basis fordetermining the particular stage of development through which we are currently passing.Without doubt, the synergies of the microprocessor, laser, fiber-optic glass, and satellite technologieshave brought quantum advances in information availability. These advances, in turn, have dramaticallydecreased business operational uncertainties and risk premiums and, thereby, have engendered majorcost reductions and productivity advances. There seems little question that further major advances lieahead. What is uncertain is the future pace of the application of these innovations, because it is thispace that governs the rate of change in productivity and economic potential.Monetary policy, of course, did not produce the intellectual insights behind the technological advancesthat have been responsible for the recent phenomenal reshaping of our economic landscape. It has,however, been instrumental, we trust, in establishing a stable financial and economic environmentwith low inflation that is conducive to the investments that have exploited these innovativetechnologies.Federal budget policy has also played a pivotal role. The emergence of surpluses in the unified budgetand of the associated increase in government saving over the past few years has been exceptionallyimportant to the balance of the expansion, because the surpluses have been absorbing a portion of thepotential excess of demand over sustainable supply associated partly with the wealth effect. Moreover,because the surpluses are augmenting the pool of domestic saving, they have held interest rates belowthe levels that otherwise would have been needed to achieve financial and economic balance duringthis period of exceptional economic growth. They have, in effect, helped to finance and sustain theproductive private investment that has been key to capturing the benefits of the newer technologiesthat, in turn, have boosted the long-term growth potential of the US economy.The recent good news on the budget suggests that our longer-run prospects for continuing thisbeneficial process of recycling savings from the public to the private sectors have improved greatly inrecent years. Nonetheless, budget outlays are expected to come under mounting pressure as the babyboom generation moves into retirement, a process that gets under way a decade from now.Maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years will continue to be animportant way the federal government can encourage productivity-enhancing investment and risingstandards of living. Thus, we cannot afford to be lulled into letting down our guard on budgetarymatters, an issue to which I shall return later in this testimony.The economic outlookAlthough the outlook is clouded by a number of uncertainties, the central tendencies of the projectionsof the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents imply continued good economic performance inthe United States. Most of them expect economic growth to slow somewhat this year, easing into the3½-3¾% area. The unemployment rate would remain in the neighborhood of 4-4¼%. The rate ofinflation for total personal consumption expenditures is expected to be 1¾-2%, at or a bit below therate in 1999, which was elevated by rising energy prices.In preparing these forecasts, the Federal Open Market Committee members had to consider several ofthe crucial demand- and supply-side forces I referred to earlier. Continued favorable developments inlabor productivity are anticipated both to raise the economy’s capacity to produce and, through itssupporting effects on real incomes and asset values, to boost private domestic demand. Whenproductivity-driven wealth increases were spurring demand a few years ago, the effects on resourceutilization and inflation pressures were offset in part by the effects of weakening foreign economiesand a rising foreign exchange value of the dollar, which depressed exports and encouraged imports.Last year, with the welcome recovery of foreign economies and with the leveling out of the dollar,these factors holding down demand and prices in the United States started to unwind. Strong growth inforeign economic activity is expected to continue this year, and, other things equal, the effect of theprevious appreciation of the dollar should wane, augmenting demand on US resources and lesseningone source of downward pressure on our prices.
BIS Review 13/20004As a consequence, the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand with the growth ofpotential aggregate supply may well depend on restraint on domestic demand, which continues to bebuoyed by the lagged effects of increases in stock market valuations. Accordingly, the appreciableincreases in both nominal and real intermediate- and long-term interest rates over the last two yearsshould act as a needed restraining influence in the period ahead. However, to date, interest-sensitivespending has remained robust, and the FOMC will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rateshave not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, evenshould the acceleration of productivity continue.Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects ofimbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depth of our various buffers against inflationarypressures. Labor markets, for example, have tightened in recent years as demand has persistentlyoutstripped even accelerating potential supply. As I have previously noted, we cannot be sure in anenvironment with so little historical precedent what degree of labor market tautness could begin topush unit costs and prices up more rapidly. We know, however, that there is a limit, and we can besure that the smaller the pool of people without jobs willing to take them, the closer we are to thatlimit. As the FOMC indicated after its last meeting, the risks still seem to be weighted on the side ofbuilding inflation pressures.A central bank can best contribute to economic growth and rising standards of living by fostering afinancial environment that promotes overall balance in the economy and price stability. Maintainingan environment of effective price stability is essential, because the experience in the United States andabroad has underscored that low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for healthy, balanced, economicexpansion. Sustained expansion and price stability provide a backdrop against which workers andbusinesses can respond to signals from the marketplace in ways that make most efficient use of theevolving technologies.Federal budget policy issuesBefore closing, I should like to revisit some issues of federal budget policy that I have addressed inprevious congressional testimony. Some modest erosion in fiscal discipline resulted last year throughthe use of the “emergency” spending initiatives and some “creative accounting”. Although somewhatdisappointing, that erosion was small relative to the influence of the wise choice of the Administrationand the Congress to allow the bulk of the unified budget surpluses projected for the next several yearsto build and retire debt to the public. The idea that we should stop borrowing from the social securitytrust fund to finance other outlays has gained surprising - and welcome - traction, and it establishes, ineffect, a new budgetary framework that is centered on the on-budget surplus and how it should beused.This new framework is useful because it offers a clear objective that should strengthen budgetarydiscipline. It moves the budget process closer to accrual accounting, the private-sector norm, and - Iwould hope - the ultimate objective of federal budget accounting.The new budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration generallylook reasonable. But, as many analysts have stressed, these estimates represent a midrange of possibleoutcomes for the economy and the budget, and actual budgetary results could deviate quitesignificantly from current expectations. Some of the uncertainty centers on the likelihood that therecent spectacular growth of labor productivity will persist over the years ahead. Like many privateforecasters, the CBO and the Office of Management and Budget assume that productivity growth willdrop back somewhat from the recent stepped-up pace. But a distinct possibility, as I pointed outearlier, is that the development and diffusion of new technologies in the current wave of innovationmay still be at a relatively early stage and that the scope for further acceleration of productivity is thusgreater than is embodied in these budget projections. If so, the outlook for budget surpluses would beeven brighter than is now anticipated.But there are significant downside risks to the budget outlook as well. One is our limited knowledge ofthe forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years. Of course, a good part of that surge is due
5BIS Review 13/2000to the extraordinary rise in the market value of assets which, as I noted earlier, cannot be sustained atthe pace of recent years. But that is not the entire story. These relationships are complex, and until wehave detailed tabulations compiled from actual tax returns, we shall not really know why individualtax revenues, relative to income, have been even higher than would have been predicted from risingasset values and bracket creep. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that this so-called “taxsurprise”, which has figured so prominently in the improved budget picture of recent years, willdissipate or reverse. If this were to happen, the projected surpluses, even with current economicassumptions, would shrink appreciably and perhaps disappear. Such an outcome would be especiallylikely if adverse developments occurred in other parts of the budget as well - for example, if the recentslowdown in health care spending were to be followed by a sharper pickup than is assumed in currentbudget projections.Another consideration that argues for letting the unified surpluses build is that the budget is stillsignificantly short of balance when measured on an accrual basis. If social security, for example, weremeasured on such a basis, counting benefits when they are earned by workers rather than when theyare paid out, that program would have shown a substantial deficit last year. The deficit would havebeen large enough to push the total federal budget into the red, and an accrual-based budget measurecould conceivably record noticeable deficits over the next few years, rather than the surpluses nowindicated by the official projections for either the total unified budget or the on-budget accounts. Suchaccruals take account of still growing contingent liabilities that, under most reasonable sets of actuarialassumptions, currently amount to many trillions of dollars for social security benefits alone.Even if accrual accounting is set aside, it might still be prudent to eschew new longer-term, potentiallyirreversible commitments until we are assured that the on-budget surplus projections are lessconjectural than they are, of necessity, today.Allowing surpluses to reduce the debt to the public, rather than for all practical purposes irrevocablycommitting to their disposition in advance, can be viewed as a holding action pending the clarificationof the true underlying budget outcomes of the next few years. Debt repaid can very readily bereborrowed to fund delayed initiatives.More fundamentally, the growth potential of our economy under current circumstances is best served,in my judgment, by allowing the unified budget surpluses presently in train to materialize and therebyreduce Treasury debt held by the public.Yet I recognize that growing budget surpluses may be politically infeasible to defend. If this proves tobe the case, as I have also testified previously, the likelihood of maintaining a still satisfactory overallbudget position over the longer run is greater, I believe, if surpluses are used to lower tax rates ratherthan to embark on new spending programs. History illustrates the difficulties of keeping spending incheck, especially in programs that are open-ended commitments, which too often have led to largeroutlays than initially envisioned. Decisions to reduce taxes, however, are more likely to be containedby the need to maintain an adequate revenue base to finance necessary government services.Moreover, especially if designed to lower marginal rates, tax reductions can offer favorable incentivesfor economic performance.ConclusionAs the US economy enters a new century as well as a new year, the time is opportune to reflect on thebasic characteristics of our economic system that have brought about our success in recent years.Competitive and open markets, the rule of law, fiscal discipline, and a culture of enterprise andentrepreneurship should continue to undergird rapid innovation and enhanced productivity that in turnshould foster a sustained further rise in living standards. It would be imprudent, however, to presumethat the business cycle has been purged from market economies so long as human expectations aresubject to bouts of euphoria and disillusionment. We can only anticipate that we will readily take suchdiversions in stride and trust that beneficent fundamentals will provide the framework for continuedeconomic progress well into the new millennium.
1BIS Review 13/2000Mr George takes a look at the potentialvolatility of private credit and investment flowsSpeech given by The Rt Hon Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, to the Bankers ClubAnnual Banquet at the Guildhall, London on 14 February 2000.*      *      *In my remarks last year I ventured to suggest that the darkest storm clouds might have lifted just alittle following the global financial upheavals of 1997 and 1998. It was a bold prediction for a centralbanker.But over the intervening period the skies have continued to clear as the clouds of financial instabilitydispersed. But clouds can return and the outlook for the medium term is for sunny periods withoccasional showers. For the time being, though, we enter into the new millennium with the worldeconomy as a whole basking in the glow of at least relatively warm sunshine.The rate of world output growth which had fallen to only about 2% in 1998, about half its long-termtrend rate, and which was widely expected to fall further, is now expected to bounce back to aroundtrend over the next couple of years. And whereas, a year ago, many industrial countries were still inthe process of easing monetary policy, to offset the impact on world demand of the interruption of theflow of credit and investment to emerging market countries and transition economies, we haverecently seen a quite widespread increase in interest rates, designed to moderate the pace of domesticdemand growth. I don’t need to convince this audience that rising interest rates are a reflection of astrengthening economy. And more even than that, we have all come through our technical examinationon Y2K transition with flying colours - I congratulate you all on that achievement.But central bankers are not paid, Mr President, to look on the bright side of things. We are paid toworry, to worry about what might go wrong and to anticipate the clouds coming over the horizon. Wedon’t have to be particularly inventive to find plenty of work to do! I should like to share some ofthose worries with you this evening relating in particular to the potential volatility of private credit andinvestment flows.Few people now question the positive role of free private financial markets - nationally andinternationally - as a powerful driver of economic growth. Markets may not be perfect but they are ingeneral the best means we have of allocating financial resources to where they can be mostproductively used. The debate is rather about the conditions that are necessary for financial markets tofunction more efficiently. That would help to reduce the risks of, and limit the damage from, suddenswings in market sentiment with their potentially disruptive effect on economic and financial stability.It is certainly not a new debate. But it becomes increasingly pressing with the growing scale offinancial intermediation and globalisation. And it is of obvious importance not just for those of us inthe public sector concerned with the macro-economic effects, but equally for you who are engaged infinancial intermediation in the private sector concerned with managing the risks in your individualbusinesses.The most immediate challenges relate to the build-up of imbalances within and between the majorindustrial countries. Moving into the global economic recovery, the US - and the UK - are alreadyoperating close to overall capacity with ultimately unsustainable growth of domestic demand offset byalready sizeable external current account deficits. The Eurozone as a whole may have more sparecapacity - even allowing for structural, supply-side, constraints - and is now seeing a recovery indomestic demand growth. Meanwhile Japan is still aiming to promote a self-sustaining pick-up indomestic demand after a prolonged period of weakness, reflected in a large current account surplus.Looking ahead - and we have to look ahead because macro-economic policies take time to have theirfull effects - I suppose that, if we could ordain these things, we might choose - in a virtual world
BIS Review 13/20002economy - to seek to underpin a more obviously sustainable growth pattern - through a combination offiscal and monetary policies designed to affect the relative pace of domestic demand growth in thedifferent countries (somewhat slower in the US and UK and somewhat stronger in the Eurozone and,particularly, in Japan), and to support relative exchange rates that would contribute to better balancedexternal positions. No doubt we could program a computer to tell us precisely how to do it!It is not quite so easy in the real world! In the real world the position is complicated among otherthings by capital flows. Capital is clearly flowing out of the Eurozone. This helps to explain theotherwise puzzling weakness of the new single currency, which in turn is adding to net externaldemand, and modestly so far, to domestic inflation. Capital is flowing into the US - on a net basis -apparently attracted by productivity and prospective future earnings growth, and contributing to risingfinancial asset prices, and associated wealth effects on US domestic demand. Capital is also obviouslyflowing into this country - for reasons that I’m bound to admit are less apparent so far in themacro-economic data. Capital also flowed back into Japan in the latter part of last year, giving rise tosudden strong upward pressure on the Yen and putting at risk economic recovery.What is not clear is how far these capital flows are a reflection of underlying economic factors andhow far they are likely to be sustained. It is possible - and I mean it really is possible - that they willabate gradually, allowing a better balance between domestic and external demand to emerge. It is alsopossible that the financial markets will overshoot and that we will then see a more abrupt adjustment.There are limits to what policy can do directly to address these concerns. On the monetary side, wecan - and do - take account of the effects of changes in asset prices, and of exchange rate movements,on overall demand and price pressures as best we can, both in our forecasts and in our interest ratejudgements. We can hope in this way to maintain reasonable stability - reflected in consistently lowinflation - in our economies as a whole; but we cannot easily avoid sectoral imbalances arising fromexaggerated capital flows or the disruptive effects if they are subsequently reversed. We can draw theattention of financial market intermediaries to possible risks as we see them. And we can, through ourregulatory and supervisory processes try to ensure that individual institutions do not becomeover-exposed to particular market risks. But it would be a serious mistake if we were to try to gofurther and try to impose our views on the markets. We would almost certainly fail - given the weightof private capital flows and diversity of channels through which they can move. And your collectivejudgements are likely to be at least as good as ours, given that it is you who stand to lose directly ifyour judgements turn out to be wrong.Mr President, even relatively small adjustments among the industrial countries could have widerrepercussions in the rest of the world. And although the capital flow to emerging market countries andtransition economies is now recovering, it is clearly important that we keep up the momentum of theextensive efforts made over the past two years both to reduce the risk of, and to improve our capacityto manage, excessive volatility of capital flows in the wider international context.In fact, although it often seems that the international debate moves forward at a snail’s pace, we aremaking considerable progress towards reducing the risks.In particular a great deal of work has been done to produce codes of good practice(cid:1) on data dissemination,(cid:1) on transparency of monetary and fiscal policies,(cid:1) on the framework of financial and supervisory policies,all within the IMF;(cid:1) on international and domestic debt and liquidity management, in the Financial StabilityForum Working Group on Capital Flows,(cid:1) on core principles for effective banking supervision, in the Basel Committee,(cid:1) on core principles for systemically important payment systems, in the Basel Committee onPayments and Settlement Systems,
3BIS Review 13/2000(cid:1) on accountancy standards, in the International Accounting Standards Committee,(cid:1) on auditing and audit practice, in the International Federation of Accountants,(cid:1) on cross-border insolvency law, in the UN Commission on International Trade Law,(cid:1) and on corporate governance, in the OECD.The emphasis now has to be on implementation by national authorities, with the help where necessaryof the international community. And although that cannot happen overnight, the emphasis must be,also, on transparency and validation of progress towards implementation in individual countries.These questions are being addressed by the IMF, and in both the Financial Stability Forum and in theG20.Taken together all these initiatives should contribute to greater stability at the national level. But theyshould also help lenders and investors better to assess the risks of lending to or investing in onecountry as against another, dampening potential volatility and, at the same time, giving the countriesstronger incentives to move towards best practice.We are making good progress, too, in strengthening financial regulation in industrial countries.(cid:1) The Basel Committee has put forward proposals for revising the capital accord, and hasissued a series of papers relating to credit risk management.(cid:1) IOSCO has made recommendations on dealings with highly leveraged institutions (HLIs),(cid:1) and an FSF Working Group is looking more broadly at ways of reducing the destabilisingpotential of HLIs.(cid:1) Another FSF Working Group is looking at the implications for financial stability of offshorefinancial centres.The list could easily be extended - and no doubt will be. But all these initiatives represent significantprogress in terms of crisis prevention.Where there has been less progress so far - despite a great deal of debate - is on crisis management.We have not yet advanced much beyond the principles and tools set out in the G7 communiqué fromthe Cologne summit in June.Broadly, having emphasised the importance of not undermining contractual obligations, the principlesstress that all private creditors should accept responsibility for their lending and investment decisions- without expecting to be underwritten by the official sector, and they encourage cooperative solutionsbetween the debtor country and its creditors, building on effective dialogues established in advance.The tools link official support to efforts by the debtor country to obtain private financing - or maintainexisting exposures - on a voluntary basis, and provide for comparability of treatment within the ParisClub, of all categories of creditors other than international financial institutions. They includemechanisms that can be used to limit the use of official financing to fund external deficits or domesticcapital outflows or to repay private sector debt. And they provide ultimately for capital controls, aspart of payments standstills, in conjunction with IMF programmes.So we have the principles and we have the tools. The problem is that we don’t at this stage have a veryclear idea as to how they might be applied in any particular case. I agree that each case is different andyou can’t have hard and fast rules. But we do need to develop some kind of presumption of whatdebtor countries and their creditors might expect, before the next crisis hits us because that willinfluence their behaviour in the meantime.Of course it is very tempting to avoid what is a very difficult issue. In the case of a relatively mildexternal liquidity shock the presumption is that a country maintaining prudent policies and which hasthe correct defences in place could look to the IMF for support under the new contingent credit linefacility. This is designed to signal the Fund’s confidence in the country’s policies and see it through tothe point where it can regain access to financial markets.
BIS Review 13/20004But that’s the relatively easy bit. The issues are more difficult when the circumstances are less benign.What we all have to recognise is that the exceptional amounts of official funding committed during theAsian crisis are far less likely to be forthcoming in future. And to the extent that official funding isforthcoming, conditions may well be attached to ensure that it is not used simply to re-financerepayments of short-term debt to private sector creditors or to fund a resident capital outflow. Severalof the tools which the G7 communiqué identified are designed to have precisely this effect.The last thing that the official community wants is to get dragged into the micro-management ofrelations between debtor countries and their creditors. But if that is not to happen, it seems to me thatborrowing countries and their major creditors - above all the short-term lenders - would be welladvised to establish, during the good times but on an ongoing basis, arrangements for regular dialogue.But beyond that, we do need a broader dialogue on the pros and cons of an orderly suspension ofexternal debt payments in more extreme situations. In principle it seems to me that this could haveadvantages for committed private sector creditors, as well as for the official community to prevent freeriders running for the exit, or seeking to attach assets, and provide time for orderly negotiations on theprovision of new finance, or for equitable debt rescheduling. It should enhance the prospective valueof private creditors’ claims by, in effect, “bailing in” both official financing andinternationally-endorsed policy actions to correct the underlying problems. That must be better thansometimes hastily-considered unilateral action. The chances otherwise are that the more responsibleprivate creditors would find themselves in the position of official lenders, with their funds used simplyto finance a capital outflow.Mr President, the debate - particularly on crisis management - still has a long way to run. But if we onthe official side do not engage with you in the private sector in that debate - facing up together to howbest to handle the really hard cases - during the present period of relative calm in global financialmarkets, then my fear is that when next the storm breaks - as it undoubtedly will at some point - wewill again find that we are making things up as we go along. I would hope that we might do better thanthat.My purpose in worrying aloud tonight has not been to keep you awake at night. My purpose has beento draw your attention to some of the risks that we will undoubtedly have to contend with together inthe future, and to suggest that we have a mutual interest in working together now to minimise thoserisks.
1BIS Review 23/2000Mr Welteke’s following address onEurope and the euro: the view from AsiaCo-speaker’s address by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, following thelecture held by Joseph C K Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at theXII International Frankfurt Banking Evening, held on 14 March 2000.*      *      *IMr Yam,First of all I would like to thank you for coming here and for giving us a very interesting Asianviewpoint of Europe and the euro.As Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, you have successfully steered your waythrough some turbulent times in the financial markets since the Authority was set up in April 1993.We Europeans also need a perspective from outside so that we can objectively assess our ambitioushistoric project of monetary union. For that reason alone, I feel it would be arrogant of me to offer a“reply” to your evaluation because the very concept of a “reply” implicitly suggests disagreement -even if that is not intended. And so the organisers of this event and I have agreed that, in future, thereply from the Bundesbank President will be dropped from the agenda.In the field of economic and financial policy there is no “ideal path” which should be followed by allcountries in all circumstances. The economic and political settings in individual countries are simplytoo diverse. The cultural and social conditions also often differ widely.That is why it is so important to compare notes and to learn from one another.IIThe respective economic developments in Europe and in Asia have likewise been characterised byvery different conditions in the past few years.Whereas in Europe various national currencies, supported by convergent economic and monetarypolicies, were increasingly harmonised and finally moulded together in a monetary union, some of theexchange rate pegs in Asia were strained to breaking point.Hong Kong was and remains one of the exceptions. Even during the financial and economic crises inSouth-East Asia in 1997/98, it managed to maintain its exchange rate peg to the US dollar.Hong Kong was like a rock in a stormy sea. For many foreign investors at the time it was - andremains - a firm anchor in the Asian markets.But in fact, defending the currency board regime was by no means an easy task. In mid-1998 manyinvestors were wondering whether Hong Kong really would defend its exchange rate come hell orhigh water. For many this was the key question during the Asian currency crises.Mr Yam, the successful defence of your currency succeeded not least because of your partlyunconventional policy. This entailed breaking the golden rule that a monetary authority should notintervene in the equity market.You successfully intervened in the equity and futures markets with large official purchases amountingto about 15 billion US dollars, or 6% of market capitalisation at the time, in order to put an end to thespeculative “double market play” in the equity and foreign exchange markets.
BIS Review 23/20002In the process Hong Kong put its free-market reputation on the line. But the intervention achieved itsaim. It resulted in an easing of interest rates and a levelling-off of the drop in equity prices. The dollarpeg was maintained. And Hong Kong remains a liberal and open market economy.This monetary policy success also had, I believe, an important psychological impact: the “small” HongKong Monetary Authority showed the global financial markets that speculating against the monetaryauthorities can be unsuccessful.Central banks are not a helpless prisoner of global financial markets - even if they have tied theirhands through a commitment to an exchange rate target. The initiative - in the monetary field as inother areas - remains with the policymakers.Naturally, the respective situations in Hong Kong and in Euroland are not directly comparable. HongKong is a small open economy for which the existing exchange rate regime is the sole option “tocounteract large, unexpected shocks from the global capital movement”, as you, Mr Yam, constantlypoint out.By contrast, the euro area is one of the largest currency areas in the world. Together, the participatingcountries account for more than 15% of global GDP.This aggregate volume has given the European countries a new responsibility for the stability of theglobal economic and financial system. They can and should face up to this challenge with self-confidence - including when it comes to occupying top posts in international organisations such as theIMF.Obviously, the question of the appropriate exchange rate regime for the euro area is posed in acompletely different context.The idea of establishing a system of fixed exchange rates between the major currencies - the dollar, theeuro and the yen - is a non-starter under present circumstances. Economic and cyclical developmentsin the various currency areas are too diverse, but so, too, are the political priorities. None of the threeregions I just mentioned is willing to subjugate its domestic policy to a fixed exchange rate.Exchange rates need a certain room to manoeuvre so that they can equalise differences betweendifferent economies.The ESCB therefore does not pursue an exchange rate target. Its monetary policy is orientedexclusively to the risks to internal price stability. The exchange rate does play a certain role, however,because key import goods - such as raw materials and energy - are invoiced in dollars.The decisive factor, however, is always the overall monetary policy setting. This is something whichthe Governing Council of the ECB will analyse thoroughly at its next meeting on Thursday.IIIMr Yam, another factor which has doubtless contributed to your successful monetary policy trackrecord is the proximity to the market of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which is also responsiblefor supervising the financial markets and the banking sector.Monetary authorities must have their finger on the pulse of the financial markets. After all, monetarypolicy decisions have direct implications not only for the money market but also for the foreignexchange and capital markets - both nationally and globally.Today, given interlinked markets and internationally active credit institutions, instability can spreadmore easily. This tendency is being reinforced by the fact that some credit institutions are acquiringnew, truly global dimensions - as is illustrated by the announced merger of Deutsche Bank andDresdner Bank here in Germany.Hence there is a much greater onus on central banks than in the past to take on responsibility for thefinancial stability of the financial markets, too. They have to focus their efforts in this context on crisisprevention.
3BIS Review 23/2000Central banks need to monitor the markets constantly so that they can detect crisis signals at an earlystage. For this they require prudential supervisory information on system-relevant individualinstitutions at first hand. This is why they also have an oversight function for the payment system, forthat could pose substantial systemic risks to the banking sector if major market players were toexperience disruptions in their payment operations.In Germany it is the Bundesbank which, by virtue of its involvement in banking supervision or as thegovernment’s fiscal agent, is able to inject the necessary market competence and market proximityinto the monetary policy decision-making process.In all the discussion about the tasks and future structure of the Bundesbank, therefore, it must beassured that the German central bank remains anchored in the financial markets.The reform of the Bundesbank must lead to more streamlined structures and to a strengthening of theBundesbank within the ESCB. Germany, as one of the major industrial nations in the world and thelargest economy in Europe, has a vested interest in having a potent and efficient central bank which isable to represent German interests effectively, both within the ESCB and internationally.A reorganisation of the Bundesbank must not fritter away the high esteem and trust in which thisinstitution has been held by the general public for many decades. The Bundesbank must remain ananchor of stability and trust for the German public - particularly during the period of changeover to anew currency. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of its arguments and on having a strongorganisation that carries a great weight.I assume that these aspects will be given due consideration by the politicians. One thing is certain, atany rate: the Bundesbank’s work in the fields of banking supervision and debt management stands upwell to international comparison.I believe that proposals to outsource functions from the Bundesbank fail to take due account of theexpertise and considerable synergies that exist within the Bundesbank.In banking supervision, for example, we are closer to the market, we have a nationwide network ofbranches and we have the experts needed - not to mention an ideal location in the banking centre ofFrankfurt.The tasks of exercising microprudential oversight of banks and ensuring the stability of the bankingsystem are ideally combined if the central bank is also involved in supervisory activities. So there aremany good reasons for concentrating banking supervision operations within the Bundesbank.Regarding a cross-sector coordination between banking supervisors, securities trading supervisors andinsurance supervisors, I think that a national “Joint Forum” is a solution that would be both cost-effective and capable of being rapidly implemented.In the field of debt management, too, the Bundesbank has a rationally structured system of interlinkedfunctions.Like every fiscal agent, we currently advise the issuer, manage new issues, carry out marketsmoothing and price management operations on all German stock exchanges and oversee both the cashand securities legs of securities settlements. A debt agency, however, would have to be supplemented -over and above the new department at the Federal Ministry of Finance - by a body that performs thebanking functions.IVMr Yam, the introduction of the euro just over a year ago truly marked an historic turning point, bothfor the global financial markets and for Europe.The euro has rightly triggered a debate on the future responsibilities and structures of the nationalcentral banks in the Eurosystem.
BIS Review 23/20004But the policymakers responsible for those areas of policy which remain in national hands mustlikewise adapt to the new setting.Competitive pressures are being intensified by the growing transparency on the goods and labourmarkets in the euro area. This is turning an even brighter spotlight on differences in the government-defined operating framework and on national structural problems.Divergent economic and employment trends now have to be accommodated primarily by the nationaleconomic, financial, wage and social policies. That requires greater overall flexibility on the respectivegoods and labour markets.And in view of the fact that government debt remains high, all levels of government should continueto step up their efforts aimed at reducing their deficits. Not least, that will enable them to enlarge theirfreedom of action in fiscal matters. The Stability and Growth Pact is the yardstick for the euro-areacountries in this respect.These are not monetary policy tasks - they have to be tackled by the other policymakers in theirrespective fields.By pursuing its goal of ensuring internal price stability, European monetary policy is supporting theother policy fields and, in the process, is laying the basis for sustained economic growth andemployment.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is pursuing a quite different aim, namely safeguarding theexternal value of the currency, that is the stability of the exchange rate, in which you, Mr Yam, have asuccessful track record over a number of years.The Eurosystem has completed its first successful year. The inflation rate was well below 2%.And I hope that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will likewise continue its successful performancein the years to come.I would like to close by thanking you once again, Mr Yam, for attending the Twelfth InternationalFrankfurt Banking Evening and for delivering your interesting speech.
1BIS Review 12/2000Bank of Japan’s February report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 15 February 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy has recently started to improve. The economic environment surrounding privatedemand is gradually improving, as seen in the continuing increase in corporate profits. However, clearsigns of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observed yet.With regard to final demand, housing investment has peaked out and started to decline slowly, andpublic investment seems to be decreasing moderately. Recovery in private consumption continues tobe weak with the decrease in income, particularly in winter bonuses. Business fixed investment, whichhad been on a downward trend, is starting to level off. Meanwhile, net exports (real exports minus realimports) continue to follow an upward trend, despite monthly fluctuations, due to an upturn inoverseas economies.Reflecting such developments in final demand and progress in inventory adjustment, industrialproduction continues to rise and an increase in corporate profits is becoming distinct. In this situation,corporate sentiment continues to improve. Regarding the employment condition, the decrease in thenumber of employees is gradually slowing. However, the improvements in corporate profits andsentiment have not stimulated business activities of many firms, because these firms still strongly feelthat they have excess capacity and employees and that they should reduce their debts to restorefinancial soundness. In addition, efforts by firms to reduce personnel expenses have prolonged theseverity of households’ income conditions.As for the outlook, improvements in the overall financial environment partly due to the monetaryeasing by the Bank, along with a series of economic measures taken by the government, are expectedto continue underpinning the economy. Moreover, the positive impact on domestic production of therecovery of overseas economies is likely to continue for some time and have favorable effects oncorporate profits and then on household income. By contrast, it is highly probable that housinginvestment will continue to decline slowly, and public investment is expected to follow a moderatelydownward trend for some time. In the corporate sector, restructuring is gradually improvingprofitability to some extent and some firms in high-growth sectors are inclining toward increasingcapital spending. Many firms, however, are very likely to maintain a cautious stance toward fixedinvestment based on their modest prospects for sales. It seems that the appreciation of the yen sincethe summer of 1999 will have an adverse effect on corporate profits in the near term. In thesecircumstances, future economic developments still require careful monitoring in spite of the gradualrecovery in the environment for private demand. Furthermore, it is important to promote structuralreform in order to facilitate a recovery in private demand.With regard to prices, import prices are rising somewhat due to the increase in internationalcommodity prices such as crude oil prices, along with the recent depreciation of the yen. Domesticwholesale prices, notwithstanding the fall in prices of electric machinery, are flat mainly due to the1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 10 February 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 10 February as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 12/20002rise in prices of petroleum and chemical products reflecting an increase in crude oil prices. Consumerprices remain unchanged fundamentally. Corporate service prices are still falling slowly. As for theoutlook, overall prices are likely to be flat for the time being despite the continued fall expected inprices of some machinery. This is because the supply-demand balance is improving gradually, asshown in the decline in inventories, and because the rise in crude oil prices to date will continue to bepassed on to prices of other products for a while. However, attention should still be paid to thedownward pressure on prices, as clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have notyet been observed and wages continue to fall.Turning to the financial markets, the influence on the money market of concerns related to the Year2000 problem has almost disappeared.The overnight call rate has stayed at nearly zero, and financial institutions have been confident aboutthe availability of overnight funds. The amount outstanding of funds in the call money market hasbeen basically unchanged.Interest rates on term instruments have generally been stable at the level as low as that prior to theemergence of concerns related to the Year 2000 problem. The Japan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds declined and, in late January, reached around1.60-1.65 percent. But then they rebounded in reaction to the depreciation of the yen and thedevelopments in the stock market, and are presently around 1.85 percent. The yield spread betweenprivate bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds continues narrowing,primarily that between private bonds with relatively low credit ratings and government bonds.Stock prices have been on a rising trend since mid-January against the background of the depreciationof the yen, and are currently moving around 19,500-20,000 yen.In the foreign exchange market, the trend has been toward a weaker yen against the U.S. dollar, andthe yen is being traded in the range of 107-110 yen.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Under these circumstances, major banks are gradually becoming moreactive in extending loans, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.However, credit demand for economic activities such as business fixed investment remains weak. Inaddition, firms continue to reduce debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As aresult, credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant, and thus privatebanks’ lending has remained sluggish. Issuance of corporate bonds and CP has been sluggish.The growth in money stock (M2+CDs) continues to slow reflecting the stagnant private credit demand.In this financial environment, the financial position of firms is easing, and the lending attitude offinancial institutions as perceived by firms is becoming less severe. It continues to warrant carefulmonitoring how these favorable developments in corporate financing environment will affecteconomic activities.
1BIS Review 12/2000Mr Greenspan gives a testimony on over-the-counter derivativesTestimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, United States Senate, on10 February 2000.*      *      *I am pleased to be here today to underscore the importance of this committee’s efforts to modernizethe Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and to express my support for the recommendations foramending the act that were contained in the report by the President’s Working Group on FinancialMarkets entitled Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act.The need for legislationOver-the-counter (OTC) derivatives have come to play an exceptionally important role in our financialsystem and in our economy. These instruments allow users to unbundle risks and allocate them to theinvestors most willing and able to assume them. A growing number of financial and non-financialinstitutions have embraced derivatives as an integral part of their risk capital allocation and profitmaximization. In particular, the profitability of derivative products has been a major factor in thesignificant gain in the finance industry’s share of American corporate output during the past decade - areflection of their value to non-financial industry. Indeed, this value added from derivatives itselfderives from their ability to enhance the process of wealth creation throughout our economy.In light of the importance of OTC derivatives, it is essential that we address the legal uncertaintiescreated by the possibility that courts could construe OTC derivatives to be futures contracts subject tothe CEA. The legal uncertainties create risks to counterparties in OTC contracts and, indeed, to ourfinancial system that simply are unacceptable. They have also impeded initiatives to centralize thetrading and clearing of OTC contracts, developments that have the potential to increase efficiency andreduce risks in OTC transactions. As I shall discuss more fully later in my remarks, rapid changes incommunications technology portend that time is running out for us to modernize our regulation offinancial markets before we lose them and the associated profits and employment opportunities toforeign jurisdictions that impose no such impediments.To be sure, the Congress and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have taken stepsto address these concerns about the CEA. The Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 gave the CFTCauthority to exempt OTC derivatives from most provisions of the act. In early-1993 the CFTC usedthat authority to create an exemption for OTC derivatives that reduced legal uncertainty for a widerange of transactions and counterparties. Unfortunately, some subsequent actions by the Commissioncalled into question market participants’ understanding of the terms of the 1993 exemption. Now,under the leadership of Chairman Rainer, the Commission is considering reaffirming and expandingthe terms of the 1993 exemption. Nonetheless, even with such an important and constructive step bythe Commission, legislation amending the CEA would remain critically important. The greatest legaluncertainty affecting existing OTC transactions is in the area of securities-based contracts, where theCFTC’s exemptive authority is constrained. Furthermore, as events during the past few years haveclearly demonstrated, regulatory exemptions, unlike statutory exclusions, carry the risk of amendmentby future Commissions.Principles of regulationImposing government regulation on a market can impair its efficiency. Thus, when evaluating the needfor government regulation, one must clearly identify the public policy objectives of the regulation. As
BIS Review 12/20002the working group’s report discusses, the primary public policy purposes of the CEA are to determarket manipulation and to protect investors against fraud and other unfair practices.We must of course assess whether government regulation is necessary to achieve those objectives. Theregulatory framework of the CEA was designed for the trading of grain futures by the general public,including retail investors. Because quantities of grain following a harvest are generally known andlimited, it is possible, at least in principle, to manipulate the price of grain by cornering a market.Furthermore, grain futures prices are widely disseminated and widely used as the basis for pricinggrain transactions off the futures exchanges. The fact that grain futures serve such a price-discoveryfunction means that if attempts to corner a market result in price fluctuations, the effects would be feltwidely by producers and consumers of grain.OTC derivativesThe President’s working group has considered whether regulation of OTC derivatives is necessary toachieve these public policy objectives of the CEA. In the case of financial OTC derivativestransactions between professional counterparties, the working group has agreed that such regulation isunnecessary and that such transactions should be excluded from coverage of the act. Importantly, therecommended exclusion would extend to those securities-based derivatives that currently are subjectto the greatest legal risk from potential application of the CEA.The rationale for this position is straightforward. OTC transactions in financial derivatives are notsusceptible to - that is, easily influenced by - manipulation. The vast majority of contracts are settledin cash, based on a rate or price determined in a separate highly liquid market with a very large orvirtually unlimited deliverable supply. Furthermore, prices established in OTC transactions do notserve a price-discovery function. Thus, even if the price of an OTC contract were somehowmanipulated, the adverse effects on the economy would be quite limited. With respect to fraud andother unfair practices, the professional counterparties that use OTC derivatives simply do not requirethe protections that CEA provides for retail investors. If professional counterparties are victimized,they can obtain redress under the laws applicable to contracts generally.The working group also considered whether the introduction of centralized mechanisms for the tradingand settling of what heretofore have been purely bilaterally negotiated and settled transactions wouldgive rise to a need for additional regulation. In the case of electronic trading systems, the workinggroup concluded that regulation under the CEA was unnecessary and that such systems should beexcluded from the act, provided that the contracts are not based on non-financial commodities withfinite supplies and that the participants are limited to sophisticated counterparties trading solely fortheir own accounts. Electronic trading of such contracts by such counterparties, it was reasoned, wouldbe no more susceptible to problems of manipulation and fraud than purely bilateral transactions. It wassuggested that some limited regulation of such systems might become necessary in the future if suchtrading systems came to serve a price-discovery function. But it was agreed that creation of aregulatory system for such systems in anticipation of problems was inappropriate. As I have alreadynoted, the vast majority of OTC derivatives simply are not susceptible to manipulation. Thus, even ifthose contracts come to play a role in price discovery, regulation of the trading mechanism might stillbe unnecessary.In the case of clearing systems for OTC derivatives, the working group concluded that governmentoversight is appropriate. Clearing tends to concentrate risks and responsibilities for risk managementin a central party or clearinghouse. Consequently, the effectiveness of the clearinghouse’s riskmanagement is critical for the stability of the markets that it serves. Depending on the types oftransactions cleared, such oversight might appropriately be conducted by the CFTC under the CEA.Alternatively, it might be conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FederalReserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or a foreign financial regulator that one of theUS regulators has determined satisfies appropriate standards. Provided such government oversight isin place, OTC transactions that would otherwise be excluded from the CEA should not fall within theambit of the act because they are cleared. If market participants conclude that clearing would reduce
3BIS Review 12/2000counterparty risks in OTC transactions, concerns about legal risks associated with the potentialapplication of the CEA should not stand in their way.Traditional exchangesThe working group’s report does not make specific recommendations about the regulation oftraditional exchange-traded futures markets that use open outcry trading or that allow trading by retailinvestors. Nevertheless, it calls for a review of the existing regulatory structures, particularly thoseapplicable to financial futures, to ensure that they are appropriate in light of the objectives of the act.Consistent with the principles of regulation that I identified earlier, the report notes thatexchange-traded futures should not be subject to regulations that are unnecessary to achieve the CEA’sobjectives. The report also concludes that the current prohibition on single-stock futures can berepealed if issues about the integrity of the underlying securities market and regulatory arbitrage areresolved.I want to underscore how important it is for us to address these issues promptly. I cannot claim tospeak with certainty as to how our complex and rapidly moving markets will evolve. But I see a realrisk that, if we fail to rationalize our regulation of centralized trading mechanisms for financialinstruments, these markets and the related profits and employment opportunities will be lost to foreignjurisdictions that maintain the confidence of global investors without imposing so many regulatoryconstraints.My concerns on this score stem from the dramatic advances in information technology that we see allaround us. In markets with significant economies of scale and scope, like those for standardizedfinancial instruments, there is a tendency toward consolidation or even natural monopoly. Throughoutmuch of our history this tendency has been restrained by an inability to communicate informationsufficiently quickly, cheaply, and accurately. In recent years, however, this constraint is beingessentially eliminated by advances in telecommunications. We have not yet seen clear evidence of atrend toward natural monopoly. But the diffusion of technology often traces an S-shaped curve, firstdiffusing slowly, but then rapidly picking up speed. Once we reach the steep segment of that S-curve,it may be too late to rationalize our regulatory structure.Already the largest futures exchange in the world is no longer in the American heartland; instead, it isnow in the heart of Europe. To be sure, no US exchange has yet to lose a major contract to a foreigncompetitor. But it would be a serious mistake for us to wait for such unmistakable evidence of a lossof international competitiveness before acting. As our experience with the vast eurodollar marketsdemonstrates, once markets with scale and scope economies are lost, they are very difficult, if notimpossible, to recapture.
1BIS Review 22/2000Mr Noyer gives a review of the economic situation in the euro areaSpeech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the conference of theInternational Finance Futures snc (IFF), Paris, on 8 March 2000.*      *      *IntroductionLadies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to speak here at this conference. The topic of my speechis “la conjoncture dans la zone euro” and this may warrant some explanation, given that thisconference traditionally focuses on the cyclical outlook for the French economy. Some, but hopefullynot too many of you may simply see this as confirming their suspicion that central bankers like tosurprise financial market participants. Let me assure you that this is not our intention, and there aregood reasons indeed why, as a European central banker, my focus should naturally be ondevelopments in the euro area as a whole, rather than on those in individual Member States. And,while I will also briefly go into the cyclical outlook for France, this will be largely with the outlook forthe euro area as a whole in mind. Before I turn to this discussion and the policy challenges associatedwith it, please allow me to review the case for this area-wide perspective.The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability in the euro area. This impliesthat the single monetary policy can only be based on developments in the euro area as a whole. Giventhis view, decisions are made with due consideration of all information that is available and relevantwith a view to maintaining price stability in the medium term. This requirement is reflected in thetwo-pillar strategy of the Eurosystem, which comprises an assessment of monetary developmentsagainst a reference value for growth of M3 and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments.Economic analysis for the euro area as a whole critically hinges on the availability of appropriate data.In addition to requirements in terms of sufficiency, quality and timeliness, area-wide data also need tobe harmonised to the highest degree possible. The latter requirement is clearly met regarding the dataon, for instance, monetary aggregates and consumer prices, as measured by the HICP. Moreover, thechangeover to the new European System of Accounts (ESA 95), which began in the course of lastyear, meant a further improvement in this respect and should be seen as representative of the ongoingefforts to develop a wholly satisfactory basis for the single monetary policy. It is true that in someareas further progress is still needed and, overall, it still holds that there is relative dearth of area-widedata compared with the availability of data in individual Member States. In addition, when assessingdevelopments in the euro area as a whole, the possibility has to be considered that economicrelationships which are taken to prevail at the level of the individual countries may look different atthe area-wide level. But this cannot be taken as implying that a single monetary policy is not feasibleor that there is an alternative to its focus on developments in the area as a whole. Rather, theseintricacies should be seen as re-emphasising the case for the strategy which has been chosen by theEurosystem and which reflects these particular circumstances.Cyclical outlook for the euro area ...With this in mind, let me now turn to the economic outlook for the euro area. There is by nowsufficient evidence to say that the euro area is enjoying a strong upturn in growth, as had indeed alsobeen predicted by the vast majority of international organisations and private institutions in the autumnof last year. The headline figure for this upturn is clearly the rate of growth of real GDP in the thirdquarter of 1999, which was well up from what had been recorded for the first two quarters of the year.
BIS Review 22/20002No estimate for real GDP is yet available for the final quarter of last year, but on the basis of availableindicators growth should have continued to be strong.Taken together, the year 1999 has been characterised by a rather swift and strong rebound from theslowdown in growth in the course of 1998 and early 1999 following the crises in Asia and Russia.Indeed, when reviewing the magnitude of the disturbances in the external environment as theyappeared at the time, the likely outcome of 2% for euro area growth in 1999 as a whole is not bad atall. Judging from the currently available evidence, there seems to be a broad consensus in theforecasting community that the prospects for a strengthening of growth in the years 2000 and 2001 arefavourable. On average, the latest forecasts point to real GDP growth of about 3% in the euro area ineach of these years. It should be noted, however, that most of the currently available forecasts weremade in the autumn of last year and that some of their underlying assumptions and initial conditionsmay thus no longer fully reflect current perceptions. For example, the IMF has since revised itsprojections for world growth upwards and such a scenario could well provide for somewhat largerimpulses on euro area export growth than have been incorporated so far. Similarly, the quasi-technicalassumptions for variables such as exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices, whichforecasts tend to be built on, might need to be revised in order to bring them into line with the latestdevelopments. Rather than precisely forecasting numbers, my explanations should therefore be seen asrelating to the general picture of the outlook which is likely to be much more stable.The favourable outlook for euro area growth is essentially based on the prospect that the initialimpulses from external demand and the sustained domestic demand within the euro area reinforce eachother in a beneficial way in the current upturn. This is exemplified by the fact that, together with thebrightening picture on the external side of the economy, there has been a strong rebound in industrialconfidence. Following steady increases up to the first months of this year, most of the previous declinein industrial confidence has now largely been reversed. The cyclical pattern of consumer confidencewas fairly subdued and confidence remained at a level close to its all-time high throughout 1999.Continued employment growth and further reductions in unemployment should help to sustain it atthis high level. Taken together, the prospects for a strengthening of domestic demand growth appear tobe good. In this context, it is worth pointing to a key feature of the euro area economy, namely that itsdegree of openness, and thus its dependency on foreign demand, is much lower than that of individualMember States. Developments in the world economy will nevertheless remain important, in particularthrough their repercussions via financial markets, and need to be monitored carefully. But if conditionsfor growth are right from the domestic side, the euro area economy should, in principle, be fairlyresistant to potential shocks to foreign demand.Let me now turn to developments in prices. Looking back, the average rate of increase in consumerprices in 1999 was just over 1%, the same as it had been in 1998. And most of the forecasts currentlyavailable from private and international institutions, while projecting a somewhat faster rise in 2000and 2001, expect inflation to remain below 2% on average. So, is there any reason to worry? The bulkof these forecasts was made in the autumn of last year and is subject to the caveat of the potentiallyoutdated forecasting assumptions already mentioned earlier. In a number of cases, these forecasts alsoincorporate the assumption of rising short-term interest rates in 2000. Prices are now rising faster andfurther than was expected earlier. In the course of the second half of last year, inflation moved up byalmost one percentage point to reach 1.7% in December. And expectations of higher inflation rates inthe first months of this year have just been confirmed by a rise to 2.0% in January. This continuedupward movement essentially reflects the increase in oil prices, but - increasingly - also the impact thatthe lower exchange rate of the euro has on import prices in general. While these effects can beexpected to unwind sooner or later, they have been more protracted and more fervent than expectedearlier and, through their very duration and magnitude, they clearly heighten the risk for second roundeffects.At this point, let me say something about interest rates. About one month ago, the Governing Councilof the ECB decided to raise the interest rate on the main refinancing operations by 25 basis points. Iwould like to stress that this was not a direct consequence of the favourable prospects for euro areaactivity growth which I just described. As has been emphasised repeatedly, the ECB is not concernedabout higher growth as such, but that this higher growth be non-inflationary. In this respect, the
3BIS Review 22/2000interest rate decision of 3 February should have been a reassuring one. On the one hand, the rateincrease did not mean that the ECB had put the brakes on. Rather, when looking at the high rates ofmonetary and credit growth and the fact that the levels of both nominal and real interest rates remainedrelatively low in a longer-term perspective, the appropriate picture would have been that of throttlingback. The economic upturn in the euro area is now well under way and its momentum should not behurt by an adjustment of the monetary policy stance. On the other hand, the interest rate moveprovided a clear signal to market participants, social partners and policymakers that the ECB wasdetermined to counter inflationary dangers in a timely fashion and that the prospects for price stabilityin the euro area remained good.In the run-up to this interest rate decision, a number of risks to price stability in the medium term camemore clearly to the fore, indicated by both of the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy. First,monetary growth has remained consistently above the reference value and the uneven growth patternat the turn of the year 1999/2000, with lower growth in January, should be seen against thebackground of a base effect. It is worth re-emphasising that there are no mechanistic reactions todeviations of monetary growth from its reference value, but, together with the continuing strongexpansion of credit to the private sector, liquidity conditions in the euro area remained generous. Asregards the second pillar, the outlook for future price developments has become less favourable. Inparticular, the danger has increased that the temporary upward pressures on consumer prices from theexternal side of the economy, from higher oil prices and a lower exchange rate, may feed into morelasting price pressures from the domestic side. In this respect, the interest rate increase has not, forinstance, eliminated the need in the upcoming wage bargaining rounds to ensure that wage settlementsdo not give rise to second round effects. It should instead have given additional assurance to wagenegotiators to keep wage increases in line with price stability.... and the policy challenges lying aheadWhat we currently observe in the euro area is a noticeable upturn in growth accompanied by pricestability, and the challenge is to set the scene for this to turn into a prolonged period ofnon-inflationary growth. Monetary policy can best contribute to long-term growth of output andemployment by pursuing its primary objective of safeguarding price stability and by counteractingrisks in a forward-looking manner. This has been confirmed by several studies - within and outside theECB. However, it would mean an overburdening of monetary policy if the responsibility fornon-inflationary growth and for the single currency were left to that policy field alone.So what can other policy areas do in support of these joint responsibilities? Ongoing efforts arerequired from macroeconomic and general economic policies as well as from wage negotiators to raisethe productive potential of the euro area. In particular, further progress in structural reforms of labourand product markets is needed to eliminate or at least significantly reduce existing rigidities. There isnow a broad consensus that the larger part of the still very high unemployment is of a structural nature.It is true that estimates of structural unemployment are subject to considerable uncertainty, but thedimension of the problem is certainly large enough to warrant decisive action. And there is no time tolose. The change to a post-industrial economy with different work profiles and job requirements isalready under way. There is also the prospect of rising participation rates as demand for part-timeemployment increases. In order to ensure employability of the work force at all levels of productivity,structural reforms of labour markets are urgently needed. However, the full benefits of such reformscan only be reaped if supported by appropriate wage policies. The participants in the wage negotiationprocess thus have the dual responsibility of keeping wage increases consistent with both price stabilityand continued employment growth.Some deregulation and liberalisation of previously sheltered sectors has already taken place in recentyears, but there remains significant scope for further action along these lines. The favourable impact ofsuch measures in terms of lower price increases have, for instance, become clear in thetelecommunications and energy sectors and should be encouragement enough to step up efforts inother sectors as well.
BIS Review 22/20004As regards fiscal policies, the current cyclical upturn provides a good opportunity to intensify thenecessary consolidation of public finances. It has to be acknowledged that public deficits have comedown in recent years and that budgetary objectives for 1999 seem to have been met by all euro areacountries. However, it has also to be borne in mind that the recent reduction of deficits has beengreatly helped by the relatively low levels of interest rates achieved in the run-up to Monetary Union.And in a number of Member States the budgetary situation is still far from reaching the targetsspecified in the Stability and Growth Pact, which are for budgets close to balance or in surplus. Theadditional room for manoeuvre offered by such positions is urgently needed. First, sufficient safetymargins are necessary to cope with the adverse shocks which will not cease to occur in a MonetaryUnion. Second, they are necessary to increase the scope for reforms of tax and expenditure systemswhich are conducive to long-term growth, and to start on the necessary reforms of social securitysystems. It appears that a number of updated stability programs, which have recently been sent to theEuropean Commission for examination, do not yet sufficiently incorporate such objectives.With all the appropriate policies in place, the momentum of non-inflationary growth could eventuallybe stronger than is currently expected. Such a prospect would have made a nice ending to a discussionon the outlook for the euro area. However, the question which currently appears to occupy Europeanpolicymakers is whether Europe is about to convert into a so-called “New Economy” and whether itcould be expected to mirror the strong performance of the US economy in terms of high growth andsubdued inflation. At this juncture, the concept of the New Economy is still somewhat unclear,essentially combining a range of rather diverse factors which have in common that they potentiallyraise the speed at which the economy can grow before inflation starts to accelerate. In this respect,while certainly not “new” as a prescription, decisive action on the part of policymakers to pursuestructural reforms and sound economic policies would certainly be part of this concept. The extent towhich the potential gains of factors such as information technology can be reaped, is likely to dependon whether appropriate market structures and sound economic policies are in place.To date, there has been a difference between the US economy and the euro area. This is most apparentwith respect to the different growth performance, which is also reflected in recent developments of theeuro. To the extent that exchange rates are a reflection of cyclical divergence between countries oreconomic regions, it is worth pointing out that the current external value of the euro vis-à-vis the USdollar is not so much an expression of bad performance or unfavourable prospects of the euro area.Rather, it reflects the exceptionally good performance achieved by the US economy. However, thegrowth differential vis-à-vis the United States is likely to narrow rapidly as the upturn in the euro areacontinues [and some re-balancing of the exchange rate can hence be expected. At the same time, in thelonger-term, the exchange rate reflects more than just cyclical differences. Of greater importance forthe upward potential of the euro will therefore be that monetary policy is committed to securing pricestability. In addition, and this also ties up with the requirements for something like a New Economy toemerge, it is necessary that convincing further progress be made in the individual Member Statesregarding the structural reform of labour and product markets.]Differences in economic performance across Member States ...The single currency reflects a large number of factors, both at the area-wide and at the national level,and is therefore a joint responsibility of all Member States and of all policy areas. In this respect,differences in growth and inflation between Member States will continue to occur also with a singlemonetary policy, just as they have been normal between regions in the individual countries. MonetaryUnion is no universal shield against shocks and does not prevent these shocks from affecting countriesdifferently, depending on their economic structures and policy responses. At the same time, monetarypolicy can no longer be geared towards the divergent developments in individual countries and it isclear that, if this divergence is considered to reflect unwarranted cyclical or structural conditions, thisis primarily a question of the country in question and of national economic policies. But we should notforget that some divergence is quite normal. For instance, with countries still in a process ofcatching-up in terms of productivity and living standards, there will be some natural and evenwarranted divergence in growth and inflation in the course of this process.
5BIS Review 22/2000While the single monetary policy is determined by developments in the euro area as a whole, lookingalso at the performance in the individual Member States is necessary to gain a better understanding ofarea-wide developments.... and the outlook for the French economyWith this in mind, let me now say something about the outlook for the French economy - and to pointout that it is indeed favourable. The cyclical developments in France combine moderate inflation,below the euro area average, and strong economic growth, above the euro area average. Towards theend of the decade, France has thus contributed to a great extent to stabilising the prospects of the euroarea economy. In particular last year, and in contrast with other large economies of the area, theFrench economy has proved resilient in terms of activity and stable in terms of prices. Looking at theheadline figures for 1999, an estimated 3.2% real GDP growth for the fourth quarter and a 0.6%annual average increase in consumer prices, the conclusion can be drawn that economic agents inFrance have so far successfully adapted to the new euro-wide macroeconomic context associated withthe single monetary policy.With a view to the near future, available indicators and forecasts suggest similarly favourableprospects for France as for the euro area as a whole. According to recent results from industrial andconsumer surveys, both entrepreneurs and households remain confident about their short-termprospects. The optimism of the latter is best reflected in the historically high level of consumerconfidence and stems partly from the on-going improvement of the situation on the labour market.Household consumption, which has been resilient in 1999 despite the temporary economic slowdown,is therefore expected to continue to grow rapidly this year. As far as enterprises are concerned,business confidence is in line with the historically high levels reached in 1998 and entrepreneurs havekept on signalling well-filled order books. With capacity utilisation rates some 2 percentage pointsabove their long-term average, the overall positive environment can be expected to contribute todynamic investment expenditure. This would be reinforced by other major determinants forinvestment. Irrespective of the positive influence of monetary policy on financing conditions,companies’ financial positions can indeed be expected to remain healthy, while re-payment difficultieswould continue to ease.Not surprisingly in this context, there is a broad consensus among forecasters on a scenario of rapideconomic growth in France, with inflation remaining within the definition of price stability for the twoyears ahead. So far, the consensus forecast predicts that real GDP could increase by some 3.4% in2000 and by 3.0% in 2001, while consumer prices will grow by 1.2% in both years, although morerecent forecasts indicate that prices could rise more rapidly. It is also widely expected that growth willbe sustained by both domestic and external demand and will result in continued employment growthand further reductions in unemployment.This is a bright picture and we should wish that it all comes true, not only in 2000 and 2001, but alsobeyond. But, although this scenario for the coming years is a likely one, it is important to bear in mindthat it is subject to uncertainties. Some of them, like the event of an unexpected external shock, cannotbe eliminated. But others fall within national responsibility. Proper economic policies and/or anadequate consensus among economic agents can in some cases be key factors in ensuring that crucialpending issues are faced in a way compatible with sustained and non-inflationary growth.Among the pending issues for the future of the French economy, the implementation and financing ofthe 35-hour working week is certainly an important one. But other uncertainties also call for attention.I would like to stress the importance of maintaining the credibility of fiscal consolidation. In thisregard, avoiding any relaxation of the fiscal stance, as well as reducing the risk of any deficit slippagein the event of an unexpected growth slowdown are certainly key elements. Moreover, with a view toexternal competitiveness, an explicit commitment on the part of the social partners to maintain wagedevelopments in line with productivity increases is an important factor.More generally, France faces the same fundamental challenge as the other European economies. It canbe summarised in the following short question: “How can one develop an internal dynamic for
BIS Review 22/20006sustainable long-term growth?” This is a crucial challenge if one wants to significantly reduceunemployment. And, at the same time, in an increasingly integrated world economy, one wishes theeuro area economy not to be too vulnerable to every external slowdown. By committing themselves tofostering low inflation and sounder public finances, public authorities, both French and European,have been working for years to develop the necessary background environment for such a domesticdynamic. The relative resilience of the French economy, despite the recent temporary slowdown,could be a sign of a successful policy mix in this regard.Earlier in my speech I spoke about the “New Economy”, an appealing expression which is also beingused more and more when referring to the good performance of the French economy in the recent past.However, for its true emergence, two important elements are required. First is the commitment tomaintain an environment with moderate developments in production costs and to pursue sound publicfinances. Second is the need to continue and step-up the process of structural reforms. That is the onlyway to foster employability of the labour force and to encourage entrepreneurship, leading toappropriate choices in terms of product specialisation and ultimately, high economic growth coupledwith macroeconomic stability.
1BIS Review 22/2000Mr Thiessen converses on the conduct of monetary policyin Canada under a floating exchange rate systemSpeech by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canadian Society of NewYork, New York, on 9 March 2000.*      *      *The conduct of monetary policy when you live next door to a large neighbourBoth in Canada and elsewhere, much ink has been spilled over the past year on the pros and cons ofdifferent exchange rate regimes and the implications for monetary policy.Interest in the subject was piqued by the difficulties experienced in 1997-98 by a number ofemerging-market economies in Asia - difficulties that had a lot to do with unsustainable exchange ratearrangements. As well, the formation of a large single currency area in Europe, just over a year ago,focused attention on monetary unions. Canada’s floating exchange rate system has itself been thesubject of debate, particularly while our economy was adjusting to the effects of falling worldcommodity prices.There have been a number of changes in exchange rate regimes recently. Several Asian countries haveabandoned their fixed exchange rate arrangements for more flexible systems. Last year, Brazil alsomoved to a floating exchange rate. Conversely, Argentina was seriously debating giving up itscurrency board arrangement and adopting the US dollar. And of course this past January, Ecuadorembarked on the road to “dollarization” in an effort to restore political and economic stability there.In a world of increasingly open markets for goods and services, burgeoning international trade, andmassive global capital flows, what can we say about the appropriate exchange rate arrangements andthe scope for independent monetary policies in individual countries?I believe that Canada is well placed to offer some useful insights, living next to a much biggerneighbour, with whom we have forged very close economic and financial links over the years. And sotoday, I would like to talk about the conduct of monetary policy in Canada under a floating exchangerate system. I will end with a brief summary of the state of the Canadian economy.Economic and financial links between Canada and the United StatesNo two other countries share as much as the United States and Canada - and I do not just meanhockey, baseball, or the longest undefended border in the world! Let us look at some basic economicfacts.The value of goods and services that cross the Canada-US border every year amounts to aboutUS$370 billion - 40% of our gross domestic product. Canada accounts for nearly one-fifth of USinternational trade in goods and services, while the United States accounts for close to four-fifths ofours.With the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1989 and the addition of Mexico in 1994 to form the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), tariffs between Canada and the United States have beeneliminated on a large number of goods.Financial flows between our two countries have also generally been free of controls since shortly afterthe Second World War. Today, the United States accounts for two-thirds of our net internationalliability position and for approximately half of all Canadian gross international assets and liabilities.
BIS Review 22/20002With this much economic and financial integration between our two nations, it is not surprising thatthere are people who believe that Canada should be in some type of monetary union with the UnitedStates (and perhaps Mexico) or that it should peg its currency to the US dollar.Instead, the Canadian dollar has been floating against the US dollar for all but eight of the last 50 years- the longest time that any industrial country has been on a floating exchange rate system. Indeed, thiscoming September will be the 50th anniversary of our first move to a floating rate.Canada’s floating exchange rate regimeThe main reason for choosing to float is that economic shocks affect our two countries differently.Even when Canada and the United States are hit by the same shocks, the impact on our economies canvary. Movements in the world prices of primary commodities are a classic example. Although theshare of primary products in total Canadian exports has fallen by nearly half since the 1970s - to about30% - primary-producing industries are still important to us. In the United States too, the primarysector is significant. But, unlike Canada, the United States is not a net exporter of commodities.Indeed, it is a net importer.So, when world commodity prices tumbled in 1997-98 in the wake of the Asian crisis, this actuallyhelped a vigorously expanding US economy, by reducing input costs and dampening upward pressureon the general level of prices. In Canada, however, lower commodity prices caused a deterioration ofour terms of trade - the prices we receive for our exports relative to the prices we pay for imports.Between mid-1997 and the end of 1998, the US terms of trade rose by about 3%, while ours fell byclose to 5%. This had a negative effect on both our national income and the profitability of ourprimary sector.When something like this happens, our floating exchange rate helps us to absorb the consequences.This is not to say that it eliminates the effects of a decline in commodity prices. But it does cushionthem, and it facilitates the necessary adjustments in the economy.In this instance, the external value of the Canadian dollar fell by about 12% between mid-1997 andlate-1998, reflecting a drop of some 20% over the same period in the average world price (inUS dollars) of the key primary commodities we produce. Because of this movement in our currency,the price of these products in Canadian dollars fell by less than their world price in US dollars, thusreducing the negative impact on our exporters of commodities. Even more important was the incentivethat the lower exchange rate provided to Canadian producers and exporters of non-commodity goodsand services to expand their sales abroad.With the exchange rate moving in response to the commodity-price shock, the negative effects werespread out more evenly across the economy and were less pronounced overall than they mightotherwise have been. Yes, real GDP growth slowed from 4% in 1997 to 3% in 1998. But it picked upagain to 4¼% in 1999. Moreover, employment has been rising, and unemployment has continued tofall since 1997. And in response to the acceleration in economic activity and rising commodity prices,the Canadian dollar has strengthened over the past year.The other important characteristic of a floating exchange rate is that it allows us to have a monetarypolicy that is separate from that of the United States. Typically, economists express this independenceas the ability to choose one’s own national objective with respect to inflation. I do not find this to be aparticularly useful way of looking at autonomy. And I most certainly would not want to suggest thatthere are serious shortcomings with the present objectives and approach of US monetary policy thatwould justify pursuing a fundamentally different policy in Canada. In fact, the objectives of monetarypolicy in our two countries are very similar.Monetary policy affects the level of aggregate demand in the economy which, in turn, leads to anultimate effect on prices and the inflation rate. The real essence of pursuing a separate monetary policyis having the option and the ability to respond to fluctuations in demand that are unique to oureconomy. Let me give you an example from recent Canadian history. It goes back to the sharp fiscaltightening that we had to implement in 1995 in order to turn around our large public sector deficits and
3BIS Review 22/2000mounting indebtedness. Of course, fiscal deficits also had to be reduced in the United States during the1990s, but the relative tightening has been much less than in Canada.In any event, the dampening effect on aggregate demand of this dramatic change in Canadian fiscalpolicy called for easier monetary conditions. As progress was made in restoring fiscal credibility, theBank of Canada was able to lower its policy rate during 1996-97, to levels well below the comparableUS Federal Reserve rate. Both market interest rates and the exchange rate moved down in response,helping to stimulate foreign and domestic demand and so moderate the effects of fiscal restraint oneconomic activity.For all these reasons, a flexible exchange rate has an important role to play in an open economy likeCanada’s.Let me now turn to the framework for monetary policy that the Bank of Canada has adopted.Inflation-control targetsThe objective of Canadian monetary policy is to keep inflation low and stable. The Bank of Canadapursues this objective by means of an explicit target for inflation control. This target has been the mainfeature of our monetary order since the beginning of 1991. The current goal is to hold inflation insidea range of 1 to 3%.However, the Bank of Canada could not have targets for inflation control and be held accountable forachieving them without the flexibility provided by a floating exchange rate regime.But it is also true that a floating exchange rate system is more effective and reliable when there is afirm commitment to targets for inflation control. And our ability to have short-term interest rates formonetary policy purposes that are different from US rates is greater in those circumstances.The Bank of Canada’s success in meeting the targets over the past nine years has helped to increasepublic confidence that inflation will stay inside the target range. And this has been true even duringperiods of turbulence and relatively wide fluctuations in the external value of the Canadian dollar.Moreover, this increased confidence in the Bank’s commitment to low inflation has, in turn, helped theoperation of financial markets by providing a strong underpinning to the valuation of the Canadiandollar.This is a relatively new phenomenon for Canada. During the years of high inflation - the 1970s and1980s - a depreciation of the exchange rate would, all too often, raise fears of still higher inflation,which would then lead to further depreciation and higher interest rates.Needless to say, it is only when expectations of inflation and of the future value of the Canadian dollarare well anchored that an independent monetary policy is possible. For only then will movements inthe exchange rate permit adjustments in real (after-inflation) interest rates in Canada that are differentfrom those in the United States.Put another way, monetary policy actions cannot bring about Canadian real interest rates that remainbelow US rates for any significant length of time, unless markets have a fair amount of confidence inCanada’s commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies, and unless there is a reasonableexpectation of a real appreciation of our currency in the future.In this context, I strongly believe that, without our inflation-targeting framework, we could not havehad interest rates in Canada generally below those in the United States, as we have in the past fouryears. But I should add that neither would this have been possible without the remarkable progressmade by Canadian governments during the second half of the 1990s to reduce budget deficits and tobring down the amount of public sector debt relative to the size of our economy (debt-to-GDP ratio).Now, you may ask, how important can inflation-control targets really be if the United States hasconsistently turned in a strong economic performance and low inflation without their benefit?The key element here is monetary policy credibility. And credibility is not necessarily tied to inflationtargets. As US experience shows, a strong commitment to low inflation can do the job. But, where past
BIS Review 22/20004price performance has not been particularly favourable, inflation targets can help to strengthenconfidence in the central bank’s commitment to low inflation. From the early-1970s to theearly-1990s, on average, Canada had a somewhat higher inflation rate than the United States.Other factors that matter are the size and importance of the US economy as well as the fact that theUS dollar is the pre-eminent international reserve currency. All this incites considerable investmentinterest and greater market confidence in the US dollar compared with any other currency, especiallyduring turbulent times. The Canadian economy, by contrast, is much smaller and more open.Because of these considerations, we in Canada have had to affirm our commitment to a more concretemonetary policy objective in the form of explicit inflation targets.The importance of credible macroeconomic policiesIn summary, I would suggest that our experience with a floating exchange rate system and a“made-in-Canada” monetary policy, despite high economic and financial integration with our muchlarger US neighbour, provides an interesting example for those exploring the gamut of exchange rateand monetary policy options.As I look at Canada’s exchange rate experience over the past few decades, however, one thing is veryclear to me. And that is the importance of credible domestic macroeconomic policies. Without a soundfiscal policy and without a strong explicit commitment to inflation control, exchange markets will nothave full confidence in the underlying value of the currency. And the ability of a flexible exchangerate to respond to shocks and to facilitate the interest rate movements needed for an independentmonetary policy will be seriously compromised.This in the end says it all. No exchange rate system is going to bail you out of bad economic policies.And that is equally true of a floating exchange rate system, as it is of the alternatives - a fixedexchange rate or indeed a monetary union, even if that monetary union is with the world’s largest,strongest economy.In today’s rapidly changing, increasingly open world economy, there is an even greater need forflexibility than before. I believe that a flexible exchange rate regime continues to serve Canada well indealing with the challenges of this new economic reality.The current economic situation in CanadaLet me finally say a few words about the current economic situation in Canada.The Canadian economy had a good year in 1999.Our export industries benefited from the strong US economy. And with global economic conditionsgenerally improved, primary commodity prices rebounded. The resulting gains in incomes andemployment in Canada led to higher levels of domestic spending. Recently revised statistics now showstronger economic growth in Canada during 1999 than previously estimated.And we continue to see strong momentum in our economy so far this year. Indeed, by somecalculations, we could be operating at full capacity.However, as has been the case in the United States for some time, Canada has also recentlyexperienced an increased level of investment in machinery, equipment, and technology. This shouldlead to improvements in productivity and in our economy’s production capacity. But we cannot besure by how much.In light of this uncertainty, the Bank of Canada has been concerned about our economy picking up toomuch speed. There is a risk that we could hit the capacity ceiling too hard, causing supply bottlenecksand shortages that could lead to an ongoing increase in inflation.To reduce this risk, the Bank of Canada increased its Bank Rate twice, in November and February,following similar rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. The latest data indicate that the external
5BIS Review 22/2000demand for Canadian output, especially from the United States, is stronger than previously expected.Under these conditions, it is essential for the central bank to be vigilant.Moreover, in view of the uncertainty about the production potential of our economy at this time ofstructural change, the Bank is now monitoring a wide range of indicators for early-warning signs ofpressure on capacity and prices.Up to now, our inflation performance has been somewhat better than we had expected. While theincrease in the total CPI over the past 12 months to January was 2.3%, our core rate of inflation(excluding food, energy, and the effect of changes in indirect taxes), at 1.3%, remains in the bottomhalf of the 1 to 3% target range.This good inflation performance bodes well for the continued expansion of the Canadian economy.But what remains to be seen is whether this expansion will bring with it strong productivity gains forCanada similar to those witnessed in the United States.One thing is clear. The job of the Bank of Canada must be to keep inflation in Canada low and stable.Without that, we will be risking both the economic expansion and the potential productivity gains.
1BIS Review 21/2000Mr Ferguson comments on a number of aspectsregarding the convergence of regulatory standards: a work in processSpeech by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the Institute of International Bankers, Washington, D.C. on 6 March 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be here and to address the members of the Institute of International Bankers. Foreignbanks play a critical role in the US financial system, accounting for nearly one-quarter of total USbanking assets throughout the 1990s. The Federal Reserve has consistently supported open USmarkets for foreign banks and has long recognized the value that you add to our economy andfinancial markets. Conferences such as this provide important opportunities for the banking andsupervisory communities to meet with one another and to share our thoughts and concerns.In my comments today, I would like to discuss the apparent motivation for managers to create globalfinancial institutions, which provides the background for a convergence of regulatory standards aroundthe world. I would also like to mention briefly the approach that the Federal Reserve is taking withrespect to foreign banks. Finally, I would like to focus on the emerging global regulatory standards,mainly the efforts of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to revise risk-based capitalstandards.Global consolidation of financial institutionsThe need for sound and consistent policies and procedures throughout the world has become moreimportant as our financial markets and financial institutions have become larger, more complex, andmore tightly integrated. If anyone needs proof of that statement, the spread of the Asian crisis duringthe course of 1997 and 1998 stands as the most obvious example of the growing integration offinancial markets. Informed researchers would argue that the global consolidation of financialinstitutions appears to be driven by several factors. Originally, globalization probably reflected thedesire of banks to serve their domestic customers as those customers themselves expanded overseas.This was probably a defensive measure designed to retain customers and preclude others from makinginroads into longstanding customer relationships. For other financial institutions, the motivation foroverseas expansion may well have been to fully leverage perceived comparative advantages inimportant business lines, such as custody, that were characterized by high fixed cost and economies ofscale. A related motivation might have been to take advantage of cultural affinity, which itself isanother form of comparative advantage. The strong presence of Spanish financial institutions in LatinAmerica may be the prime example of this motivation. Finally, many institutions may have expandedto meet ambitious aspirations for growth that comparatively small local markets might notaccommodate. Certainly, one might argue that the global reach of major Dutch and Swiss institutionsreflects this motivation, at least in part.Importantly, one must ask if global institutions are more successful than their home-boundcompetitors. At least one private-sector study, from a major consulting firm, suggests that during theten-year period ending 31 December 1996, most of the global financial services companies did notachieve significantly superior returns to shareholders. Nor did they appear to achieve superior revenuegrowth. I am sure that there will be other studies that attempt to determine the effect of globalconsolidation on the financial results of the firms involved.In any event, regardless of the presence or absence of financial success, the trend toward a more globalfinancial industry will continue. Such market forces will provide a continuing impetus for continuedcooperation and coordination among bank supervisors worldwide. Indeed, the forces for cooperationwill only grow as these trends become more pronounced.
BIS Review 21/20002The Gramm-Leach-Bliley ActIssues related to the international supervision and regulation of banks come at a time when we in theUnited States face new challenges in implementing financial reform and the provisions of theGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. That act has the potential, and indeed the intention, to change substantiallythe structure, activities, and supervision of financial institutions in this country. Many of the foreignbanks represented here today operate as universal banks outside the United States and, like many USbanks, you have been frustrated by the outmoded restrictions on your banking activities in ourmarkets. After much debate, the US Congress enacted legislation that permits banks operating in theUnited States to expand their activities within a legal and supervisory framework intended to preservetheir safety and soundness.As you well know, the Federal Reserve Board recently issued for public comment an interimamendment to Regulation Y setting forth the procedures for banking organizations to elect to becomefinancial holding companies and avail themselves of the broader powers authorized under the act. Inaccording financial holding company status to foreign banks, the Congress instructed the Board toapply capital and managerial standards comparable to those pertaining to US banking organizations,giving due regard to the principles of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity. Therule applies the US bank risk-based capital standards of 6% Tier 1 capital and 10% total capital toforeign banks wishing to become financial holding companies. It also applies the US leverage ratio toforeign banks, but at the lower holding company level of 3%, instead of the 5% ratio required of USbanks.To consider differences in banking and accounting practices in many foreign countries, the Board alsowill assess the capital and management of foreign banks case by case. This assessment will take intoaccount, when appropriate, a number of factors such as the bank’s composition of capital, accountingstandards, long-term debt ratings, reliance on government support to meet capital requirements, andthe extent to which the bank is subject to comprehensive, consolidated supervision. The intent of thisapproach is to provide the flexibility necessary to take into account all relevant factors in a way thatwill be equitable to all banks, foreign and domestic. We understand that there is concern that thisprocedure will be subject to delays, resulting in disadvantages to foreign banks. Let me assure you thatwe fully intend to deal with submissions from foreign banks expeditiously and in the same time framesthat are provided for the review of submissions by US companies. If different procedures will allow usto meet the statutory requirements on comparability, we are very open to considering them.The Board recognizes that this interim rule is of great interest to foreign banks and that it raisescomplex issues - in particular, how to achieve comparability as required by the law while stillrespecting the home country supervisory framework. This balance is difficult to achieve, and theBoard intends to give careful consideration to the comments it receives in response to the interim rule.The Board is committed to implementing this new law in a manner that is equitable and fair to allinstitutions and that ensures a sound and stable framework for the evolution of financial services in theUnited States.Basel Committee on Banking SupervisionIn supervising financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve will need to consider not only theGramm-Leach-Bliley Act but also the policies and actions of other agencies in this country andabroad. Fortunately, we have been working together for several years to deal with issues arising fromactivities of financial conglomerates. I think that much of the experience we have gained through ourparticipation in groups such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Joint Forum, and theFinancial Stability Forum will help us meet the challenges ahead.Because time is brief, I will focus the balance of my remarks on the work of the Basel Committee. TheFederal Reserve has been actively involved in this committee since its inception in the mid-1970s, andthe Basel Committee continues to take the lead in coordinating banking supervisory policies andpractices globally. Although representatives from the G10 countries and Luxembourg do the work ofthe committee, it recognizes that supervisors in most of the non-G10 countries typically adopt the
3BIS Review 21/2000policies and principles that the committee adopts. As a result, the committee has sought to incorporatethe views of supervisors throughout the world. A non-G10 working group, for example, isparticipating in the current revisions to the Capital Accord.As I know you are all aware, the Basel Committee is devoting a tremendous amount of time andresources to the effort to develop a new capital adequacy framework that is more sensitive to the levelof underlying economic risk. Indeed, comments are due soon on a consultative paper issued last yearon this topic. Feedback from the industry is important to the Basel Committee, and I hope that many ofyou will be communicating your ideas and reactions to the Bank for International Settlements.Capital requirements are an essential supervisory tool for fostering the safety and soundness of banks.The 1988 Basel Capital Accord was a major achievement in establishing a uniform standard forinternationally active banks. In the years since, the committee has continued to develop and refine thestandard in an effort to keep pace with banking practices and to maintain adequate levels of bankcapital throughout the world.Many have asked why the Basel Committee is revising the accord at this time. There has beenrecognition from the start that the 1988 accord was rather crude and imperfect in many respects.Although that accord incorporates some differentiation in credit risk, it is limited. Moreover, theaccord does not explicitly address interest rate risk, operational risk, or other risks that can besubstantial at some banks. Consequently, some countries, including the United States, have put inplace supplementary requirements - such as target ratios above the minimum levels - to help mitigatethe accord’s shortcomings. For example, as a further prudential measure, the United States decided toapply a separate leverage constraint to provide some limit to leverage, regardless of what therisk-weighted Basel approach might allow.Beyond these initial and inherent imperfections of the accord, simply the dramatic innovations overthe past decade in financial markets and in the ways in which banks manage and mitigate credit riskhave driven the need for change. The committee has been concerned particularly about the incentivesthat the accord gives banks to take on higher-risk, higher-reward transactions, and to engage inregulatory capital arbitrage. Efforts to make the standard more sensitive to underlying risk shouldgreatly reduce these incentives.Basel Committee Consultative PaperLast year’s consultative paper set out a new paradigm for judging capital adequacy based on a set ofthree so-called pillars. Pillar I is sound minimum capital standards or, in essence, the existing Accordwith improvements. Pillar II is supervisory oversight of capital adequacy at individual banks, andpillar III is market discipline supported by adequate public disclosures by banks. These three pillarsrepresent an evolution in the Basel Committee’s approach to capital adequacy and should be mutuallyreinforcing. The addition of pillars II and III acknowledges the importance of ongoing review bysupervisors of the capital adequacy at individual banks and the critical role of market discipline incontrolling the risk-taking of banks.The committee’s revisions to pillar I are aimed at developing minimum capital standards that moreaccurately distinguish degrees of credit risk and that are appropriate for banks of varying levels ofsophistication. In its consultative document issued last June, the committee set out two possibleapproaches: a standardized approach that would tie capital requirements to external credit assessments,such as credit ratings, and another approach that would be based on a bank’s own internal ratings. Thelatter would derive a capital requirement from bank estimates of default probabilities and fromestimated losses-given-default on individual exposures. Using such estimates would help greatly inmaking capital requirements more sensitive to different levels of risk but would also introduce moresubjectivity and a lack of transparency into the process. Therefore, we may need to limit or constraincertain measures. How to validate the estimates will also be an issue, especially considering thatbanks, themselves, often have little historical data on which to base key assumptions and calculations.Comparability and competitive equity among banks and national banking systems will be importantfactors in the debate.
BIS Review 21/20004Nevertheless, the two-pronged approach of offering both a simplified and a more complex methodseems both necessary and reasonable in order to accommodate all types of banks. Even then, however,we must recognize that any standard will continue to evolve. Although I believe that an internalratings-based approach would provide an important step forward, its results would still likely differfrom those of a bank’s own economic capital allocation models. Questions about the correlation ofrisks among different asset groups and about how and whether to consider them in a regulatory capitalstandard are still unresolved and go to the heart of full credit risk models.Beyond credit risk is the highly complex matter of operating risk and other risks that are not explicitlydealt with in the accord. In the past, of course, the overt charge for credit risk has carried the full loadof these other risks, but that has begun to change. Both the Basel Supervisors Committee and theinternational banking community need to address these topics more directly and more satisfactorily.Regardless of what regulators and supervisors do, you as bank managers must fully recognize andcontrol your risks. As you make greater progress, so can regulators.In the past, relatively rough rules-of-thumb and traditional practices sufficed in supervising andmanaging banks. But just as derivatives have allowed you to unbundle risks and to price and structurefinancial products with more precision, similar technologies and innovations are requiring moreprecision in almost everything else you do. And also everything we do as bank supervisors.Opportunities for arbitrage within financial markets and capital regulations are easily found. What youdo within the industry and what we do as bank supervisors must be more closely connected in allrespects to the underlying economics. Meeting that challenge will keep all of us on our toes.Recognizing that supervisors need to relate capital requirements of individual banks more closely totheir unique risk profiles, the Basel Committee’s second pillar - the supervisory review of capital -emphasizes principles such as these:• that supervisors should expect, and have the authority to require, banks to operate above theminimum regulatory capital ratios• that they should require their banks to assess and maintain overall capital adequacy inrelation to underlying risks• that supervisors should review and evaluate the internal capital adequacy assessments andstrategies of banks, as well as their compliance with regulatory capital ratios• that supervisors should intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling belowprudent levels and should require remedial action quickly if capital becomes inadequate.I believe it is essential to have effective supervisory oversight and assessment of individual bankcapital as a complement to meeting regulatory capital requirements. This does not mean, however, thatsupervisors have ultimate responsibility for determining the adequate level of capital at each bank northat supervisory judgment should replace that of bank management. Rather an active dialogue shouldtake place between bank management and supervisors with regard to the optimum levels of capital.Pillar II thus moves the accord beyond a simple ratio-based standard to a more comprehensiveapproach for assessing the adequacy of capital levels.The supervisory review of capital called for in pillar II obviously will have resource implications forsupervisors around the world and may require significant changes in supervisory cultures andtechniques in many countries, both G10 and non-G10. The committee will need to develop guidancefor bank supervisors to use when evaluating the adequacy of internal capital assessment processes. Aresidual benefit of such evaluations will be that supervisors will more easily stay current with evolvingindustry practices related to risk management and will better understand the risks that individual banksface.The third element of the proposed new capital framework - pillar III - relates to market discipline,which I believe all supervisors recognize as a critical complement to their supervisory oversightprocess. When banks disclose timely and accurate information about their capital structure and riskexposures, market participants can better evaluate their own risks in dealing with such institutions.
5BIS Review 21/2000Greater market discipline, in turn, gives banks more incentive to manage their risks effectively and toremain adequately capitalized.Recognizing that current disclosure practices in some countries are relatively weak, the BaselCommittee under this pillar is working on guidelines that would make banking risks more transparent.The goal is to protect legitimate proprietary information, while promoting more consistent disclosureamong nations. Adequate disclosure becomes even more important as we base regulatory capitalrequirements on internal risk measures of banks. Clearly, more information, by itself, is not alwaysbetter. Working with the industry, we need to decide which specific elements are needed to do the job.Indeed, an ongoing partnership between banks and supervisors is crucial to the success of anyregulatory capital standard and to the success of the supervisory process overall. It is in everyone’sinterest that we succeed in this effort and that the international financial system remain sound.Other Basel Committee initiativesAlthough the Basel Committee may be best known for its work on capital standards, its efforts extendwell beyond that - as suggested by the two other pillars. Its development of the Core Principles forEffective Banking Supervision in 1997 is particularly noteworthy. These twenty-five principles covera broad range of supervisory issues involving licensing and supervising banks and enforcingsupervisory judgments. By setting reasonable thresholds for standards that banking supervisors in allcountries should achieve, the committee has substantially helped to promote financial stabilityworldwide. Of course, the challenge now is to help all countries meet these core principles, despite thelimited expertise and resources some may have. Fortunately, the International Monetary Fund andWorld Bank are working with the committee and can be of significant help.The securities and insurance supervisors have taken similar steps in developing supervisory principlesof their own that should contribute to stronger supervisory regimes worldwide and provide aframework for further harmonization with banking standards, when appropriate.ConclusionIn closing, I see no shortage of difficult challenges facing financial institution supervisors in the periodahead. Clearly, supervisors of the various sectors of the financial industry - banking, insurance, andsecurities - will continue to be confronted with rapid and dramatic changes in banking and financialmarkets. Supervisors will need to react to technological innovations, expansion of financial institutionsinto new and increasingly more complex activities, and ongoing consolidation within the industryworldwide. A rigorous, coordinated supervisory approach will be necessary to counterbalance thepressures of an increasingly dynamic and competitive marketplace. I am confident that by workingtogether and with the financial industry supervisors we can meet the challenge. I want to assure youthat, as central bankers, we at the Federal Reserve have strong interests in maintaining efficient,well-managed, and responsible financial institutions.I wish you all well in the years ahead. Thank you for your attention.
1BIS Review 20/2000Mr Garganas looks at the challenges for Greek monetary policyon the eve of euro-zone entryAddress by Mr Nicholas C Garganas, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the EuromoneyInternational Bond Congress, held in London on 15 February 2000.*      *      *It is a great pleasure on the occasion of the Euromoney International Bond Congress to be given thisopportunity to speak to you about recent developments in the Greek economy and I would like tothank Eurobank and Deutsche Bank for having invited me here tonight. I believe that this is aparticularly interesting time for Greece as she prepares for entry into the euro-zone on 1 January 2001.I want to begin by looking at the impressive progress made by the Greek economy over recent yearsbefore going on to discuss some of the challenges which monetary policy, in particular, faces over thecoming months.In recent years economic policy in Greece has been oriented towards achieving a high degree ofsustainable economic convergence and fully satisfying the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty forparticipation in the third stage of EMU by the time compliance is examined in 2000. Fiscal andmonetary policies were implemented vigorously and the targets of the last two convergenceprogrammes were met, thus placing Greece directly on the road to joining the euro-zone by 1 January2001.Three of the four convergence criteria of Article 109j(1) of the Treaty - the government budgetaryposition and public debt, the exchange rate and long-term interest rates - are already fully satisfied,and the fourth - the criterion on price stability - will be fulfilled by the end of this month.On 29 November 1999, the Ecofin Council abrogated its decision that an excessive deficit existed inGreece; indeed, the general government deficit reached 2.5% of GDP in 1998, well below the Treatyreference value. In 1999, the general government deficit was further reduced to 1.5% of GDP, belowthe projection of the 1999 budget. Cyclical adjustment of the government balance shows that thebudgetary position of Greece has already been in compliance with the requirements of the Stabilityand Growth Pact from 1999. As can be seen from Figure 1, left hand scale, in 1993 the deficit was13.8% of GDP.Figure 1Greece: General government finances (% of GDP)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:27)(cid:16)(cid:25)(cid:16)(cid:23)(cid:16)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:25)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:27)(cid:24)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:24)JRYHUQPHQW(cid:3)(cid:3)GHILFLW(cid:3)(cid:11)OKV(cid:12)FRQVROLGDWHG(cid:3)JURVV(cid:3)GHEW(cid:3)(cid:11)UKV(cid:12)
BIS Review 20/20002The debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 111.6% in 1993 (Figure 1, right hand scale), was broadly stablethereafter, and started to decline in 1997. It was reduced by 3.1 percentage points in 1998 and a further1.2 percentage points in 1999, despite some additions of below-the-line debits. At about 104% ofGDP, its level is still very high, but is now very firmly on a downward path.With regard to the criterion on exchange rate stability, the Maastricht Treaty stipulates that thecriterion will be satisfied if “a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins providedfor by the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severetensions for at least two years before the examination” of compliance with the convergence criteria.The drachma entered the ERM in March 1998 at a central rate of 357 per ECU, just over 12% belowthe market rate prevailing at the time. As from January 1999, it joined ERM II at a central rate of353.109 per euro, with the standard fluctuation band of plus or minus 15%.High interest rate differentials and favourable expectations concerning Greece’s convergenceprospects resulted in large capital inflows. As can be seen from Figure 2, the drachma appreciated(first against the ECU, and since January 1999 against the euro) and traded at around 7% above itscentral rate for the best part of 1999. The central rate of the drachma was revalued by 3.5% against theeuro on 15 January this year. The new central rate of the drachma is 1 euro=340.75 drachma, and thestandard fluctuation band of plus or minus 15% continues to be observed around the central rate.Figure 2Chart : Exchange rate( Per cent deviation of the drachma from its central rate January 1998 - January 1999)(Daily data)Note : The Greek drachma entered the ERM on 16.3.1998 at a central rate of 357 drs per ecu. The two straight verticallines in the Chart indicate the entry of the GRD in ERM II on 1.1.1999 at a central rate of 353.109 drs per euroand the revaluation of the drachma central rate by 3.5%  to 340.750 drs per euro on 15.1.2000 respectively.Source: Bank of Greece(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:19)0$5&+$35,/0$<-81(-8/<$8*8676(37(0%(52&72%(5129(0%(5’(&(0%(5’(&(0%(5-$18$5<)(%58$5<0$5&+$35,/0$<-81(-8/<$8*8676(37(0%(52&72%(5129(0%(5’(&(0%(5-$18$5<)(%58$5<(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:19)
3BIS Review 20/2000Figure 3Greece : Exchange rate of the drachma against the EURO* and USD(Daily data)*Based on GRD/DEM in 1998Source : Bank of GreeceThese developments in the exchange rate, presented in Figure 3, indicate that the Greek drachma hassuccessfully participated in the ERM for two years without experiencing any severe tensions duringthe period under review. Throughout, the drachma has been above its central rate, reflecting thefavourable conditions in the Greek economy. Therefore, in my view, Greece fulfils the exchange ratecriterion.Financial markets have reacted favourably to Greece’s good convergence prospects and the spreadbetween the 10-year yield on government bonds and German bunds in February was around 98 basispoints, compared with 196 basis points in March 1999 and 425 basis points in September 1998. The12-month moving average of the yield on 10-year government bonds, used to test for convergence, hasbeen below the reference value (derived from the average interest rates in France, Germany andAustria, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability) since November 1999(Chart 4), and therefore Greece fulfilled the criterion on the convergence of interest rates.(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:24)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:17)-DQ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:17)-DQ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:17))HE(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:22)(cid:17)0DU(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:26)(cid:17)$SU(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:23)(cid:17)0D\(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:17)0D\(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:17)-XQ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:17)-XO(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:17)$XJ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:17)$XJ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:17)6HS(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:27)(cid:17)2FW(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:17)1RY(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:17)1RY(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:17)’HF(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:17)-DQ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:17))HE(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:17))HE(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:17)0DU(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:17)$SU(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:17)0D\(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:17)-XQ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:17)-XQ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:17)-XO(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:28)(cid:17)$XJ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:22)(cid:20)(cid:17)$XJ(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:17)6HS(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:17)2FW(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:27)(cid:17)1RY(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:17)1RY(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:21)(cid:17)’HF(cid:17)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:17)-DQ(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:27)(cid:17))HE(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:19)*’5(cid:18)(852(cid:13)*’5(cid:18)86’Chart 4Greece: Comparison of 10-year interest rate1with the reference value212-month averageJan. ’98 - Jan. 20006.06.57.07.58.08.59.09.510.06.06.57.07.58.08.59.09.510.0GreeceReference value1Yield on 10-year government bonds.2 Average of long-term interest rates of the three best performing countries in terms of inflation plus 2 percentage points.
BIS Review 20/20004Progress towards price stability is also very substantial. The objective of the Bank of Greece is forconsumer price increases not exceeding 2%. This target was reached in August 1999. The annual rateof inflation was 2 percent in terms of the national CPI, which corresponds to 1.5% for the harmonisedindex of consumer prices. Recent price developments (Chart 5) suggest that while the downward trendin headline inflation has been reversed since October 1999, partly as a result of rising oil prices, theunderlying trend was still declining in December 1999. Headline inflation eased to 2.6% in January2000 on an annual basis, from 2.7% in December 1999, while the underlying index edged upmarginally from 1.8% in December 1999 to 1.9% in January 2000 (see Chart 5). The harmonisedindex of consumer prices has been converging rapidly since the beginning of 1999 (Figure 6),exceeding the reference value by only 0.2 percentage points in January 2000, down from 2.5percentage points in January 1998. Although the increase in oil prices has been slowing down theprocess of disinflation in recent months, current projections suggest that, in the 12 months ending inFebruary 2000, Greece should have an average rate of inflation, on a harmonised basis, below thereference value (Figure 6).The fall in inflation was achieved under conditions of accelerating economic growth and rising realincomes. As can be seen from Figure 7, GDP grew at 3.5% in 1999 - the third successive year above3% and the fourth year of growth faster than the EU average. Real convergence with our Europeanpartners is expected to continue, with growth of 3.8% projected for 2000 and over 4% for 2001.Figure 6Greece: Comparison of average inflation rate (harmonised basis) with the reference value (%)12345698JMMJSN99JMMJSN00J*F*Inflation (HICP) in GreeceReference value(a) Measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of the latest 12 monthly indices relative to thearithmetic average of the 12 monthly indices of the previous period.(b)   Arithmetic average of the three best performers in terms of inflation plus 1,5 percentage points.* Partly estimated.Source: Commission services and Bank of Greece.Chart 5Greece: Consumer price index and underlying inflation(Percentage change over 12 months)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:28)(cid:25)-$-2(cid:28)(cid:26)-$-2(cid:28)(cid:27)-$-2(cid:28)(cid:28)-$-2(cid:19)(cid:19)-(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:14)(cid:16)(cid:22)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:13)(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:20)(cid:24)

BIS Review 20/20006Although employment has been growing steadily, the labour force is also growing fast as a result oflarge immigration and increasing participation. Last year, the government adopted a National ActionPlan for Employment, which relies on a range of intensive employment - enhancing measures.However, it is somewhat too early to assess the effectiveness of these measures.Notes:1/ The index is defined as the weighted average of the percentage change in the real short term interestrate and the percentage change in the real effective exchange rate. Relative weights  of 3 to 1 are used.The peaks in the second quarter of 1994 and the fourth quarter of 1997 are due to high interest ratesbecause of speculative pressures against drachma in May 1994 and October 1997.Figure 9Greece: Wage and unit labour cost trends(annual percentage change)Figure 8Greece: Monetary Conditions Index, 1994-1999 /1 (1997 q1 = 100)951001051101151201251994 q11994 q21994 q31994 q41995 q11995 q21995 q31995 q41996 q11996 q21996 q31996 q41997 q11997 q21997q31997q41998 q11998 q21998 q31998 q41999 q11999 q21999 q31999 q4(cid:3):DJHV(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:23)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:25)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:23)$YHUDJH(cid:3)KRXUO\(cid:3)HDUQLQJV(cid:3)LQ(cid:3)PDQXIDFWXULQJ$YHUDJH(cid:3)HDUQLQJV(cid:3)LQ(cid:3)WRWDO(cid:3)HFRQRP\
7BIS Review 20/2000So much for recent developments and the results that Greece has already achieved in the convergenceprocess. Let us now look at the challenges ahead.In the coming months, the main challenge for economic policy in Greece will be to secure thesustainability of the ongoing disinflation process so as to ensure a smooth transition to the commoncurrency within a healthy growth environment.Progress towards price stability reflects a number of important policy choices, most notably the tightstance of monetary policy adopted to date, centered on high short-term interest rates and a strongdrachma (Figure 8). The reduction in inflation is also supported by the tight stance of fiscal policy andby the slowdown in the growth rate of unit labour costs (Figure 9). Unit labour costs registered asubstantial deceleration following the two-year wage agreement, signed in the private sector in May1998. Unit labour costs in the whole economy increased by 2.5% in 1999, down from 5.5% in 1998and 8.4% in 1997. In the manufacturing sector the deceleration was more pronounced as a result ofimproving productivity (Figure 9).As the changeover to the euro approaches, so domestic short-term interest rates will have to align withthose in the euro-zone and the exchange rate converge to its central ERM parity. Table 1 providessome indication of the gap between official interest rates in Greece and those in the euro-zone. Theconsequence of convergence is that monetary conditions will inevitably loosen. The question whichclearly arises therefore is the extent to which this development represents a possible threat to thesustainability of price stability.A useful point which can be made at the outset is that the impact of monetary policy loosening oninflation may well be diminished by the openness of the financial system in Greece, the dampeningeffect on household incomes of decreasing yields on financial assets and the fact that economic agentshave already anticipated the fall in domestic short-term interest rates. However, this is not to say thatthe Bank is not taking the issue seriously. On the contrary, we are carefully monitoring the situation.Table 1Bank of GreeceEuropean Central BankOvernight deposit facility (first tranche)9.50Deposit facility2.25Overnight deposit facility (secondtranche)8.5014-day deposit rate9.75Lombard rate11.00Main refinancing rate3.25Marginal lending rate4.25Sources: Bank of Greece, European Central BankIndeed, the Bank supported fully the recent 3.5% revaluation of the drachma central rate withinERM II. By reducing the amount of exchange rate convergence required, this step will considerablyreduce the foreseeable negative effect on domestic inflation. It is now expected that the depreciationthat will occur until the end of this year will have little impact on inflation. Last week the drachmatraded at around 2.25% above its new central ERM parity. The impact of a depreciation of thedrachma towards its central ERM parity is negligible: given that the share of imports in consumptionis about 22% in Greece, the depreciation of the drachma required for it to reach its central parity isestimated to imply an acceleration in consumer price inflation of not more than 0.4 of a percentagepoint.Developments after the March 1998 devaluation provide evidence of Greece’s ability to absorbexternal shocks and to implement non-accommodating policies when required. Aggregate demandslowed down as a result of restrictive fiscal and incomes policies, though a tight stance of monetarypolicy still had a central role in containing pressure on prices.
BIS Review 20/20008The revaluation has facilitated some convergence of interest rates by allowing a reduction withoutimplying a loosening of the overall stance of monetary policy.Developments in interest rates and the exchange rate since the revaluation of the central parity suggestthat markets largely discounted the effects of the revaluation (Chart 10). A downward trend in the3-month Athibor-Euribor differential was noticeable from the third week of November onwards.Developments in the foreign exchange market were broadly similar, with concerns about whether acentral rate adjustment would occur and, if so, its extent, along with seasonal factors, causing someweakening of the drachma in December. Following the revaluation, the market adjusted quickly withthe implied December 2000 forward rate moving to the new central rate of 340.75 drachmas per euro.Thus the revaluation, in combination with the fact that interest rate declines have already been largelydiscounted, suggest that the impact of the monetary policy “shock” will be considerably less thaninitially anticipated. Overall, it is not now expected that it will be very significant. That having beensaid, however, interest rate policy in the remainder of the year will proceed cautiously. The timing andmagnitude of changes in interest rates by the Bank of Greece will be dictated by developments ininflation and the evolution of the exchange rate. We intend to ensure a smooth transition to euro-zonemembership in both money and foreign exchange markets.In view of the forthcoming easing of monetary policy, other policies - notably, fiscal policy, but also,wage and structural policies - will become the pre-eminent instrument available to counter possibleinflationary pressures and ensure sustainability of low inflation.The new convergence programme which was recently presented to and accepted by the Ecofin Councilenvisages a further tightening of fiscal policy, targeting a general government deficit of 1.2% of GDPfor this year and a primary surplus of 6.7%. For 2001, the target deficit is 0.2%, followed by a smallsurplus in the following year. The general government primary surplus is projected to rise again to 7%of GDP for both years. Maintaining the level of the primary surplus may become the most reliablepolicy instrument available to hold back demand and ensure price stability.As regards wage developments, the updated Greek convergence programme implies moderate wageincreases in the public sector in 2000 and beyond. The conditions of the renewal of the two-year wageagreement for the private sector that has just lapsed are of particular importance. As I mentionedearlier wage moderation was a key factor that contributed to lowering inflation and inflationaryexpectations in the aftermath of the 1998 devaluation, suggestive of an incipient culture of stabilitythat will be essential in the forthcoming wage negotiations. A credible targeting of inflation and themaintenance of the announced target in all circumstances have also created a favourable climate thatChart 10Three-month Interest Rat Differential to Germany(1/11/99 - 9/2/2000)5.05.56.06.57.07.58.001.Nov11.Nov21.Nov01.Dec11.Dec21.Dec31.Dec10.Jan20.Jan30.Jan09.Feb
9BIS Review 20/2000may positively affect the outcome of the impending wage agreement. The behaviour of economicagents might also be influenced by awareness of the consequence of a regime change: the exchangerate instrument will no longer be available as a solution to competitiveness losses once Greece hasbecome a full member of the euro-zone.Finally, deregulation and structural reform aimed at enhancing competition and improving thefunctioning of individual markets (the goods, services, capital and labour markets) are also helpingprice stability. In this context, it is important to mention that key sectors of the economy, such aselectricity and fixed telephony, are programmed to be opened to competition as from 2001 inaccordance with an EU timetable. Additionally, conditions on the supply side of the economy havebeen improving in recent years. The acceleration of private capital formation, the improvement ininfrastructure and the structural reforms (including privatisations) implemented so far have most likelyincreased the productive potential of the economy.To conclude, the Greek economy has come a long way over the recent past. Tight monetary andexchange rate policies have been instrumental in fighting inflation. The inevitable reduction in interestrates implied by participation in the euro-zone and a return of the drachma to its central ERM ratewould represent an easing of monetary conditions with a foreseeable impact on inflation. I have triedto argue today that the inflationary impact of gradual interest rate and exchange rate convergenceshould not be very significant. The support of other policies, in particular, further fiscal consolidation,persisting wage moderation and continued progress towards structural reform should prevent anysignificant inflationary pressure resurgence when monetary policy eases and ensure a smoothtransition to the euro on 1 January 2001. The outlook for Greece once in the euro-zone is good,suggesting that in the long run she will be in a position to reap the full benefits of EMU membership.
1BIS Review 54/2000Christian Noyer: The development of financial markets in the euro areaSpeech delivered by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs, London, on 26 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I am very pleased to be here at Chatham House today to address such a distinguished audience.Over recent years, the economic and financial structure of the euro area has undergone sweepingchanges. Overall, these changes have led to the rapid development of financial markets in the euroarea. This trend seems to have been reinforced since the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999.Over a period of a few years, financial markets in the euro area have grown in size and have come toplay a more important role in the economy.The development of financial markets in the euro area is shaped by a set of broad economic trends, allof which are conducive to the development of deeper, more liquid and more efficient financialmarkets.One of these broad trends is the programme of Economic and Monetary Union, which has contributedto further economic integration and convergence of the economies of the European Union over most ofthe past decade. As the processes of economic activity became more intertwined in the EuropeanUnion, this naturally led to the development of more cross-border financial interconnections. In thecountries which adopted the euro, the evidence available so far suggests that the single currencyfacilitated this process. The euro acted as a catalyst for the development of area-wide financialmarkets, although this process is still far from complete.Another trend is the solid establishment of price stability in the euro area. This followed theconsiderable progress made in the run-up to EMU. During the second half of the 1990s, the rate ofincrease in consumer prices at the level of the euro area declined steadily to reach values in line withprice stability. Even more importantly, during this period the citizens, firms and other organisations ofthe euro area progressively came to consider it credible that price stability would henceforth continueto be firmly maintained. This confidence on the part of the public is of the utmost importance for thecontinued success of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem. As we all know, price stability isbeneficial in numerous ways, not only in creating a climate for higher economic activity over themedium term, but also in reducing the economic and social inequalities caused by the asymmetricdistribution of the costs of inflation on the various economic agents. In addition, when inflation is lowand expected to remain low and subject to limited variations over the medium term, the prices offinancial assets incorporate lower inflation risk premia, by contrast with a situation of high oruncertain inflation. As the inflation risk premium becomes relatively less important as a determinantof financial prices, other factors such as credit risk can take on a larger role in the price formationmechanism. Ultimately, this results in a more efficient allocation of financial resources.In the run-up to Stage Three of EMU, the governments of the European Union also, where necessary,made efforts to reduce their deficits and their debt so as to bring them into line with the requirementsspecified by the Maastricht Treaty. As was intended by the drafters of the Treaty, this developmentcontributed to achieving sounder fiscal policies, which would be more conducive to economic growthover the medium term and which would make it possible for automatic fiscal stabilisers to work moreeffectively when needed. A further effect of the reduction in public deficits and debt, all other thingsbeing equal, is the freeing of financial resources for use by the private sector. This reduces hindrancesto the development of financial markets for private borrowers such as the corporate bond market.A final item in this short list of the broad economic trends shaping the future of financial markets inthe euro area is the phenomenon of population ageing. Taken together with the liberalisation offinancial markets, over the coming years population ageing will lead to further demand for long-term
BIS Review 54/20002investment instruments on the part of rapidly developing pension funds, along the lines, for instance,of what we are already beginning to see in the United Kingdom. As borrowers strive to meet theincreased demand for investment instruments, this is likely to provide a further impetus to thedevelopment of a wide range of suited financial instruments available to pension funds, and moregenerally to savers at the end of the intermediation chain.Having identified broad economic trends, which all seem to point in the direction of a wider role forfinancial markets in the euro area over the coming years, I should like today to discuss what hasactually happened so far and consider what challenges lie ahead. I shall first consider the degree ofdevelopment of the various segments of financial markets in the euro area, so as to assess whether and,if so, why some segments are less developed than others, at area-wide level. I will then move on toconsider, more generally, the progress made in the efficiency of the functioning of the financialmarkets of the euro area.Are certain segments of euro area financial markets less developed than others and, if so, why?The discussion of this issue should be precursored with the observation that, in the euro area, financialmarkets rely more on bank credit than in the United States or the United Kingdom. By contrast, debtsecurities and shares represent a considerably smaller proportion of GDP in the euro area than they doin the United States or the United Kingdom. Hence, and notwithstanding the processes ofdisintermediation and securitisation currently under way, the financial structure of the euro area can becharacterised as being more bank-oriented than security or market-oriented. Starting from thissituation, many commentators have correctly observed that the euro area is currently engaged in aprocess of structural change towards more market-based finance. As Alan Greenspan put it, recent“changes appear to be moving continental Europe’s financial system closer to the structure evident inGreat Britain and the United States”.With regard to debt securities, outstanding amounts in euro-denominated instruments increased in allissuing sectors in 1999. However, the increase was more pronounced in the private than in the publicsector. At end-1999, with a share of 52% the public sector still accounted for a considerable proportionof total debt securities denominated in euro, but this had declined compared with the 55% witnessed atend-1998. At the same time, the share of the financial sector had increased from 38% to 40% and theshare of the non-financial private sector had increased from 5% to 6%. Obviously, significant changesin the relative share of the various sectors occur only gradually over time. However, the developmentsseen in 1999 received a large amount of attention on the part of market commentators, for severalreasons.First, there was a considerable increase in private issuance in the euro area between 1998 and 1999.This continued broadly unabated at the beginning of 2000. It should be recognised that temporary orexceptional factors may have played a role in 1999. For example, some borrowers may havefrontloaded issuance activity in 1999, so as to benefit from a possible enhanced attractiveness of newissues in the aftermath of the introduction of the euro. In addition, issuers may have wished to avoidplacing new issues around the century date change for fear of possible liquidity problems, whicheventually did not occur. However, these explanations are not sufficient to account in full for theincrease in private issuance activity seen in 1999, all the more so since the trend has continued at thebeginning of 2000.Second, the available data showed not only an increase in private issuance, but also a series of changesin the various characteristics of the newly issued debt securities. For example, the average size of newbond issues increased considerably in 1999, as the number of very large issues, of EUR 1 billion ormore, increased significantly. It should be recognised that this development partly reflected theincreased preference of investors for deep and liquid instruments following the episode of financialturmoil in the autumn of 1998. However, another reason for this change, which was particularlynotable in the euro area, was the fact that borrowers were able to take advantage of the newly createdeuro-denominated bond market. By virtue of its size and high degree of openness, theeuro-denominated bond market is more able to absorb very large issues than the individual bondmarkets of the predecessor currencies of the euro.
3BIS Review 54/2000Looking in more detail at the components of the increase in private euro-denominated bond issuance,it is noteworthy that issuance by non-residents, although small relative to the total, increasedparticularly rapidly in 1999. Standing at around EUR 630 billion at the end of 1999, the outstandingamount of euro-denominated debt securities issued by non-residents represented slightly less thanone-tenth of the total outstanding amount of euro-denominated debt securities. However, thisconstituted an increase of more than 40% compared with end-1998. In 1999, the amount of new issuesof euro-denominated debt securities by non-residents came very close to that of newdollar-denominated issues by non-residents. Hence, in the course of 1999 the euro-denominatedcomponent of international bond markets played a far larger role than the predecessor currencies of theeuro had hitherto. This development was in line with the predictions made by some commentatorsbefore the introduction of the euro. However, the speed of the increase in euro-denominatedinternational bond issuance during 1999 was remarkable.In 1999 the main investors active in the euro-denominated segment of the international bond marketwere, as in previous years, investors located in the euro area. Hence, as shown in a recent ECBworking paper, although the euro became an important placement currency for international bondsvirtually from the beginning, the use of the euro as an international investment currency is likely todevelop more gradually over time. From the point of view of monetary policy, let me recall that theinternationalisation of the euro is not a policy objective as such and that, therefore, it will be neitherfostered nor hindered by the Eurosystem.Turning to securities in the form of shares, close to 900 companies were newly listed on stockexchanges in the euro area in the course of 1999. This represented an increase of some 40% comparedwith 1998. In the United States, there were close to 800 new stock listings in 1999, a slight declinecompared with 1998, and in the United Kingdom new stock listings also declined from 1998 to 1999.These changes may obviously have reflected circumstantial factors, such as differing positions in thebusiness cycle, for example. These circumstantial factors notwithstanding, the increase in new listingsalso seems to have reflected the enhanced attractiveness of stock market listing in the euro area.Following the introduction of the euro, a number of firms found it more attractive to issue stocks in theeuro area, as these stocks could be marketed to a wider array of investors than had been possible in thestock markets of the predecessor currencies of the euro.Furthermore, in 1999 and in the first half of 2000, there was an exceptional array of initiatives takenby stock exchanges with a view to forming alliances or merging activities, both within the euro areaand beyond, involving exchanges located in the United Kingdom and the United States. Theseinitiatives clearly reflected not only factors specific to the euro area, but also other factors, such as theimpact of new information and telecommunications technology. These new technologies seem to haveled to a marked increase in the economies of scope and scale that can be achieved by stock exchangesthrough alliances or mergers. At the level of the euro area, the process of consolidation of stockexchanges is taking place in the context of the integration of stock markets at area-wide level.In summary, both corporate bond markets and equity markets in the euro area, while remainingsomewhat less developed than their US counterparts, developed rapidly in 1999. This developmentseems, in particular, to have brought benefits to the less well-rated borrowers, as the amount of bondsissued by this category of borrowers increased most rapidly in 1999.It cannot be denied that the process of Economic and Monetary Union has contributed positively tothis development.With the introduction of the euro, financial prices are no longer affected by intra-area foreignexchange risk premia. Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, financial prices generally incorporate muchlower inflation risk premia. As a result of lower foreign exchange and inflation risk premia, credit riskhas gained more importance, in relative terms, in the pricing of financial instruments. In order to dealwith this evolution, financial market participants active in the euro area have stepped up theirassessment of the credit quality of the security issuers. This development may be described as thedevelopment of a “credit risk culture”. In the course of 1999, the development of a “credit risk culture”amongst investors active in the euro area led borrowers to seek more ratings for their securities. Thisexplains why the number of new ratings provided by ratings agencies to borrowers located in the euro
BIS Review 54/20004area increased very substantially in the course of 1999, also for borrowers with ratings somewhatbelow the best levels.Second, with the creation of the euro, investors and borrowers active in the financial markets of theeuro area have de facto been granted access to the euro-denominated market. This market, even if it isnot yet fully integrated at the area-wide level, is larger and more open than any of the marketsdenominated in the predecessor currencies of the euro. As the remaining barriers to the efficientfunctioning of financial markets at the area-wide level are progressively removed, borrowers will haveeasier access to financial resources and investors will enjoy more varied opportunities for investment.Obviously, this development will not necessarily provide benefits only for large borrowers and largeinvestors. For example, as large borrowers are able to obtain more funds directly from the financialmarkets, some bank resources will be freed and thus become available for smaller borrowersparticularly suited to the kind of credit monitoring relationship that can be established with a bank. Inaddition, smaller investors will clearly be able to reap the full benefits of the establishment of largefinancial markets in the euro area, either through the use of retail brokerage services or, more often,through the purchase of mutual fund shares. In this respect, it is also noteworthy that the amountsinvested in mutual funds located in the euro area continued to increase, by 6% in 1999, following aconsiderable increase of 34% in 1998.Although considerable progress has been made so far, there appear nonetheless to be some areas ineuro area financial markets which are lagging behind in terms of development. Let us take, forexample, the case of the repo market. The unsecured money market became fully integrated at thelevel of the euro area soon after the introduction of the euro. However, it is striking that, althoughsome progress has also been made in the secured money market, the repo market has not yet becomeintegrated to anything like the same extent as its unsecured counterpart. In particular, turnover incross-border repo transactions, although it increased, did not do so very considerably. Furthermore,market liquidity, as measured, for example, by bid-ask spreads on repo transactions, still variessignificantly across countries. Several technical factors seem to have prevented the full developmentof an area-wide repo market so far. First, the market infrastructure currently available for repotransactions is not conducive to cross-border trades. Trading and clearing platforms are not sufficientlyintegrated. In addition, securities settlement systems do not always make it possible to transferefficiently the ownership of securities on a short-term basis, as is needed in repo transactions. Asecond set of factors hindering the development of the repo market at the area-wide level seems to berelated to country differences in the tax regimes applicable to repo transactions. Furthermore, there arealso legal differences across countries, in particular relating to the possibility of netting financialobligations. These problems have been posing considerable challenges to the preparation of thecontractual documentation underlying repo transactions.With regard to market infrastructure, the Eurosystem believes that it is up to market participants todeal with the problems and find the best market-oriented solutions. In its own repo operations, in orderto ensure a level playing-field, the Eurosystem has put in place a system whereby its counterpartiescan use any eligible asset, irrespective of its location, as collateral against credit received from theEurosystem. At the risk of treading on rather technical ground, let me recall that this system consistsof two parts. First, the national central banks act as correspondent banks for one another, and takeeligible assets in custody for one another’s account. Second, when there are links between thesecurities settlement systems, assets may be transferred using such links, provided that the links havebeen reviewed by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and judged to comply with ESCBstandards. In fact, thanks to these facilities, the counterparties of the Eurosystem make extensive useof collateral on a cross-border basis.Are the financial markets of the euro area becoming more efficient?I should now like to reflect upon the question of the efficiency of financial markets in the euro area. Iwill first briefly touch upon retail financial markets. I shall then address wholesale financial markets ingreater detail.
5BIS Review 54/2000One particular development can illustrate the progress recently made in retail banking markets. In theeuro area the dispersion of interest rates on loans for house purchase declined noticeably in the courseof 1999, continuing a trend which had been apparent since 1996. Between 1996 and 1998, theconvergence of interest rates on loans for house purchase had been in parallel with the convergence ofmarket interest rates across those countries which would later form the euro area. By 1999 differentialsbetween market interest rates had reached stable levels across the euro area. However, cross-countrydifferentials between interest rates on loans for house purchase continued to narrow sizeably. Morespecifically, in countries where they used to be particularly high, interest rates on loans for housepurchase came closer to the euro area average in 1999. Hence, despite the fact that banks do not yet, inmany cases, directly compete with each other on a cross-border basis in the granting of loans for housepurchase, customers have already been able to benefit from more competitive loan prices. Thisdevelopment was particularly interesting as interest rates rose during 1999 from the exceptionally lowlevels recorded at the beginning of that year.Although considerable progress has already been made, there clearly remain obstacles to thedevelopment of more competitive markets for banking products and services at the level of the euroarea. For example, there is a need to improve cross-border retail payment services in the euro area. Inorder to encourage the development of cross-border payment systems enabling the public to benefitmore fully from the single currency, the Eurosystem has drawn up a list of desirable objectives forcross-border retail payments in the euro area. It stands ready to play a coordinating and supportiverole. In particular, the Eurosystem considers it highly desirable that the prices and settlement lags ofcross-border transfers be similar to those of national transfers, whenever the applicable standards andprocedures permit.Turning to the wholesale financial markets, progress has clearly been more rapid than for retailfinancial markets. Already in the run-up to the introduction of the euro, but especially since 1 January1999, there has been a large decline in transaction costs in many areas. In foreign exchange, interestrate and equity markets, bid-ask spreads often declined in 1999 compared with 1998, sometimes verysignificantly. Furthermore, trading activity expanded, particularly in some segments such as theprivate bond markets. As a result of the increase in trading activity, market participants were able tocarry out large transactions within a short period of time more easily and with lower costs. Hence, in1999 not only bid-ask spreads but also other indicators pointed towards an increase in the depth andliquidity of financial markets in the euro area.The changes in transaction costs are particularly notable on the unsecured money market. In thecontext of the conduct of monetary policy, the creation of an area-wide operational framework for therefinancing operations of the Eurosystem has modified the micro-structure of the money marketconsiderably. Despite the continued use of different trading systems, the money market of the euro hasgained a clear cross-border orientation, largely thanks to the establishment of TARGET. Very soonafter the introduction of the euro, typical bid-ask spreads quoted on the unsecured money market ofthe euro became as narrow as in the most liquid money markets at the global level. Furthermore,swaps indexed on the overnight reference rate, as measured by the EONIA, which have become a verywidely used instrument, also offer particularly small bid-ask spreads. It is therefore clear that theunsecured money market of the euro has become fully integrated and is functioning well. However, asalready mentioned, there is still some scope for further development in the repo market.In other segments of the euro-denominated interest rate markets and in the equity market, the range offinancial instruments available to market participants expanded markedly in 1999. For example, themost widely traded short-term interest rate futures denominated in euro are contracts indexed on thethree-month EURIBOR. For these instruments, the range of available delivery dates currently goes upto five years. This is less than the ten years available for three-month Libor futures traded for theUnited States. However, this is wider than the range of maturities which used to be available in thepredecessor currencies of the euro. From the point of view of monetary policy, the market prices ofsuch products provide information of interest about market expectations.The development of the mortgage bond market constitutes another example. In several countries of theeuro area, legal texts were recently enacted which permitted the development of a market for mortgage
BIS Review 54/20006bonds similar to the German Pfandbriefe. New issues of non-German Pfandbriefe have been verysuccessful, as there was a strong demand on the part of investors for this type of instrument.In 1999 a number of financial market institutions created a wide array of stock price indices and bondindices covering the euro area as a whole. This development has contributed to extending the range oftrading and position-taking opportunities available for investors.Stock price indices are available mainly in two forms: broad and narrow. Broad indices provide aprecise measure of stock price developments in the euro area stock market. The narrower indices,which by nature cannot be considered representative for the euro area as a whole, are useful becausethey are easier for investors to track through the purchase and sale of a limited number of stocks. Forthis reason, narrow indices have been instrumental in the development of equity derivatives contracts.Overall, turnover on area-wide stock index derivatives has grown steadily over the past 18 months,increasingly taking up a larger share of total turnover on stock index derivatives in the euro area. Withthe progress of economic integration in the context of Economic and Monetary Union, over recentyears stock market investors have increased the share of their stock portfolios which is managed withreference to area-wide risk factors. This process accelerated in 1999, as the introduction of the euroseemed to act as a catalyst for the creation of area-wide stock price indices.In the course of this process, investors have also taken advantage of sectoral stock price indices. Inparticular, it is interesting to observe that exchanges have created futures and options contractsindexed on certain sectoral stock price indices, such as the technology sector, the telecommunicationssector or the bank sector, to take a few examples. Not only does the introduction of such financialproducts respond to the demand of investors, but it also makes it possible to process more informationand circulate it across the market through the price formation mechanism. This information onarea-wide sectoral developments is clearly beneficial for investors managing large area-wideportfolios. It is also useful for smaller investors, whom it can help to form judgements about the takingof positions in certain specific stocks. At the global level, it is noteworthy that, at the beginning of2000, the various financial market institutions publishing sectoral stock price indices took stepstowards a better harmonisation of sector classifications. These changes, which can be expected tobring benefits to the users of such data, were obviously also applied to the stock price indices availablefor the euro area.For bond indices, much the same observations can be made as for stock price indices. The availablebond price indices include area-wide indices which are split according to the various maturity bucketsalong the yield curve and further broken down according to whether the issuers are governments orfrom the private sector. In turn, private sector indices are often available in sectoral breakdowns, forexample financial sector versus non-financial sector, and in credit ratings breakdowns, for exampletriple A versus double A versus single A and so forth going further down the credit curve. It cannot bedenied that such benchmark indices for bonds can play a useful role in the course of the developmentof bond markets in the euro area.In sum, wholesale financial markets of the euro area are currently benefiting strongly from thecontinued reduction in transaction costs, the development and spreading of new financial productssuch as Pfandbriefe, and the introduction of a wide set of area-wide and sectoral indices for stockprices and bonds.Looking forward, there are a number of challenges to be met. In this regard, without aiming at beingexhaustive, I should like to address three topics: the question of benchmarking in euro area bondmarkets; the challenges posed by the electronification of trading systems; and the need to take intoaccount the risk of extreme events when modernising market infrastructure in the euro area.Over recent weeks, there have been episodes when, in those countries, such as the United States andthe United Kingdom, where the process of reducing public debt is more advanced, government bondyields have been subject to very strong and unexpected downward pressures. Some of the downwardpressures on yields reflected sudden increases in liquidity premia. Investors seemed to be concernedthat the future pace of reduction of government debt would become so high as to create an imbalancebetween high demand and low supply of government bonds. On the heels of these developments, thequestion of benchmarking instruments in bond markets was naturally considered to be quite acute.
7BIS Review 54/2000Prior to the introduction of the euro, in euro area countries with a non-negligible private bond market,government bonds were generally used as a benchmark for the pricing of corporate bonds.Furthermore, government bonds were also generally used as conduits for position-taking and hedgingon interest rate markets. In this respect, futures and options contracts using the national governmentbonds as underlying references were widely used, in conjunction with position-taking on bothgovernment and private bond markets. Since the introduction of the euro, a certain limited number ofgovernment bonds have played the role of benchmarks at the level of the euro area as a whole. Thismainly includes German government bonds and, at the shorter end of the maturity spectrum, Frenchgovernment bonds. Furthermore, total turnover on government bond futures and options has becomevery concentrated on the contracts indexed on German government bonds, although there has beenrenewed competition from other contracts over recent months. The risks associated with having anopen position on a single contract which is larger than the underlying bonds available for delivery mayhave played a role.In this context, the question has arisen of whether the amount outstanding of benchmark governmentbonds will remain sufficient to cover benchmarking needs, particularly as public deficits and debtsshould be reduced further in the euro area. Already quite some time ago, some commentators had putforward the idea that the interest rate swap market, which, by international standards, is very welldeveloped in the euro area, could at least partly play the role of benchmark. In fact, it is clear that theswap curve constitutes a widely used reference for the pricing of private sector debt instruments aswell as the measurement of market risk on these instruments. With regard to derivatives instruments, Iam confident that financial market institutions will come up with solutions to any possible shortage ofthe underlying government bonds. This development, in itself, would be welcome, as it would reflect adecline in government deficits and debt to levels in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. Forexample, other instruments or pools of instruments may be used to provide the underlying pricereferences for exchange-traded derivatives instruments. All in all, there are two main conditions to befulfilled by instruments to serve as a reference in interest rate derivatives contracts. First, referenceinstruments should be traded in a market which is sufficiently deep and liquid to constitute a reliableand efficient price source. Second, the requisite legal and institutional conditions should be in place toensure that positions on derivatives may easily be either reversed prior to expiry, rolled over at thetime of expiry or settled at the time of expiry by way of a cash payment.Moving on to the second item in my short list of issues, let me now consider the challenges posed bythe electronification of trading systems. This development has been most remarkable in the foreignexchange markets. Automatic trading systems have very rapidly, over the course of the past threeyears, become the most widely used way of matching buy and sell orders. In the course of thisdevelopment, a large part of the voice-based trading process has disappeared. In this context, certainobservers regarded it as symptomatic of possible problems that, on particular days in 1998 and 1999,foreign exchange rates fluctuated by unusually large amounts within very short periods of time. Theseobservers argued that the changing role of market makers in the price formation mechanism, as a resultof market electronification, was the cause underlying some of the unusual gapping behaviour seen inforeign exchange rates on these particular days. If this hypothesis proves correct, then it is likely thatany gapping phenomenon would disappear once the transition to the new framework is complete andthe new market infrastructure has become well established.Meanwhile, the electronification of markets has also made progress in interest rate and equity markets.Over recent months, certain institutions have made available, particularly on the internet, relativelycheap automatised trading systems. These systems carry out the matching of orders as well as thesettlement of transactions, sometimes on a net basis, with the stock exchanges. The shift of a portionof trading activity away from stock exchanges and onto electronic trading systems may result in morepronounced risks of gridlocks, if the electronic trading platforms do not adopt sufficiently safeprocedures. Furthermore, the quality of the price discovery process on electronic trading platformsmay not always be sufficient, at least during a transition period. This could, for example, be the casewhen there are several systems which cover identical instruments but function independently of eachother. The resulting risk of fragmentation of certain markets prompted Arthur Levitt, the head of theUS Securities and Exchange Commission, to call for the rapid generalisation of “open books”
BIS Review 54/20008showing, in real time, limit orders collected by the major market makers operating in the US securitiesmarkets. This proposal encountered some opposition, however, as it was considered likely to putexcessive strains on the free development of competition. For my part, I should like principally torecall the suggestion made by some that we should foster the use amongst market service providers ofsafe and secure procedures which are able to limit the risks of gridlocks in financial markets.This brings me to the final item in my short list of issues. Over recent months, there has been anacceleration of the pace of change in the infrastructure of financial markets in the euro area. As Imentioned earlier, these changes have brought about a number of benefits for market participants.However, in a newly built infrastructure there is a need to ensure that all requisite mechanisms arethere for the markets to be able to function, as it were, under bad weather conditions. In the same wayas market participants extensively tested the ability of their information technology systems towithstand the century date change, there is a need for market service providers to carry out some stresstesting of the new financial market infrastructure in the euro area as it has developed. The questions toraise in this area are quite well known. For example, one should ask whether trading systems are ableto withstand without friction the failure of a market participant to fulfil its obligations or whether thiscould lead to a major disruption in trading activity. By entertaining such questions early on, marketservice providers will be in a good position to contribute to the development of the financial marketsof the euro area in the best possible manner, for the benefit of the economy of the euro area in general.In order to conclude my remarks for today, let me come back to where I began.The financial system of the euro area is currently experiencing a series of profound changes. Thesechanges concern all financial markets, from the foreign exchange market to the bond market and theequity market. European Economic and Monetary Union has fostered changes in two ways. First,closer economic integration has created more financial interconnections across country borders in theeuro area. Second, the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 has acted as a catalyst for marketparticipants to switch to new systems and to foster the development of hitherto underdeveloped marketsegments such as the corporate bond market. In this regard, the contribution made by price stabilityand public confidence in the Eurosystem should be mentioned. This led to the development of a“credit risk culture” fostering more efficiency in the financial markets of the euro area. In this contextof change, there are great opportunities for financial markets in the euro area to become even moreefficient and more open, a development which will support economic growth over the medium andlong term. At the same time, there are certain market segments still lagging behind, for example therepo market or the market for cross-border retail payments. In addition, I have highlighted the fact thatthere are some risks which naturally arise in a period of accelerated change. If, however, thechallenges ahead are appropriately addressed, I am confident that we are looking towards a continuedperiod of exciting and eventually very beneficial changes in the financial systems of the euro area.Thank you very much for your kind attention.
1BIS Review 53/2000Lee Hsien Loong: Separation of financial andnon-financial activities in SingaporeSpeech by DPM Lee Hsien Loong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of The Monetary Authority ofSingapore and Deputy Prime Minister, at the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) dinner, held inSingapore on 21 June 2000.*      *      *IntroductionI last attended the ABS annual dinner two years ago. I spoke then on the need to free up our bankingsector, and to allow competition a greater role in shaping the industry. Last year, MAS announcedmeasures to improve corporate governance and institutionalise the management of the local banks, andthe first phase of a five-year programme to liberalise the banking sector. We sought to strengthenSingapore’s banking system, provide Singaporeans with quality banking services, and further enhanceSingapore’s position as an international financial centre.These reforms have brought about visible changes. The next step in strengthening the local banks isnow to separate financial and non-financial businesses within the banking groups, and to furtherimprove corporate governance through a clearer and more transparent ownership and control structure.Separation of financial and non-financial activitiesWhat ought to constitute the permissible activities for a banking group is an issue which all financialregulators have to consider carefully. If we took a purely laissez faire approach, we could leave banksto structure themselves as their owners and management saw fit. What businesses banks chose to beinvolved in, and what business entities chose to own a bank, would be matters for themselves todecide. Over time, banks with the right configuration and mix of activities would succeed, while thosewithout would fail or be eliminated by the competition.But regulators cannot leave it entirely to the market to sort out such matters, especially where thebanks involved are not peripheral players but perform key roles in deposit taking and the paymentssystem. Strong banks are important to the health of the financial system and to the entire process ofcredit intermediation. Regulators cannot guarantee that individual banks will never fail, but they havea duty to minimise the chances of a mishap and to maintain the integrity and overall stability of thefinancial system.A clear source of potential problems in this regard is the commingling of financial and non-financialactivities within the same corporate group. Many regulators regard it as good banking and soundsupervisory practice to require clear separation of the two.Firstly, separation will limit the risk of contagion from non-banking businesses to the bank. Bankswith significant interests in non-banking activities are exposed not just to credit and market risks -which are the primary risks of their business, and which the banks should assess and manage as part oftheir core competence. These banks will also be taking on the business risks of their non-financialactivities. If their non-financial activities run into trouble, the banks may feel compelled to supportthem beyond normal commercial considerations, to protect their own reputation. In so doing the banksmay undermine their own soundness; yet if they did not extend the rescue, the problems of theaffiliates may trigger a loss of confidence in the bank itself because of the close association.Secondly, with banking and non-banking activities inter-meshed within a conglomerate, there will be astrong tendency to stretch any safety net intended for the banking system also to cover non-bankoperations in the group. If failure of an associated non-bank threatens the bank and systemic stability,the regulator or government may be forced to rescue both. We have seen this happen in the recentAsian crisis. An implicit safety net for the banking system may be a necessary evil; but extending it to
BIS Review 53/20002non-banks compounds the problem of moral hazard. It also tilts the playing field against non-bankcompetitors who are not associated with banks.Thirdly, separation minimises the risk of non arms-length transactions between banks and their non-bank affiliates. When a bank lends to a related entity at more favourable terms than market, or investsin an affiliate in order to control it even though the investment does not perform, minorityshareholders of the bank are disadvantaged, and so are depositors.Some economists have argued that in less-developed financial markets, it is in fact a rational andpractical strategy for a group of companies sharing common ownership or cross-shareholdings to lendto and invest in one another. Information about companies is often less than complete, and companyaccounts and business plans are hard to interpret. Family networks or guanxi are then efficient ways toestablish a basis of trust for doing business, and to avoid the high costs of obtaining reliableknowledge about the other party’s activities and finances.But the non-transparency of this approach can lead to serious difficulties and abuses.Cross-shareholdings diminish the influence of minority shareholders, dilute market pressure on thecompanies in the group, and weaken the internal discipline to appraise rigorously the risk of eachinvestment.The ongoing reforms in many Asian countries are as much about tightening corporate governance inthis regard as they are about re-capitalising weak banks. The way forward for banks is therefore not torely on family networks or guanxi. It is to strengthen their ability to assess credit risks and investmentpropositions rigorously, on arms-length, commercial considerations, and to deploy their assets in adiversified, optimal manner.Finally, separating out non-financial activities will focus management attention on their core businessof banking and finance. The need to concentrate on core competencies is not unique to banking.Globalisation and technology are causing many world-class companies to focus on their corecompetencies, and to outsource parts of their value chain for which they have no particularcompetitive advantage. This is especially true for banks, which are operating in an intenselycompetitive and dynamic environment. They need to muster all their talents and energies on thefinancial business, instead of dissipating them over many different businesses.For these reasons, banks should not commingle financial and non-financial activities. However, thisdoes not mean that banks must refrain from engaging in venture capital or merchant banking business,which involves taking an equity interest in a diversified portfolio of non-financial companies for someperiod. It is not uncommon for the merchant banking business of well-run, international banks to takestakes in non-financial companies for three to five years. These activities are natural extensions of thelending business of banks. They are, however, quite different from taking long-term strategic stakes innon-financial companies which tie a bank’s reputation to these companies.In addition to the separation of banking and non-banking activities, regulators in several developedmarkets have also advocated dispersed ownership of banks. Often this has been achieved bylegislation or via the bank’s own memorandum and articles of association, which sets limits onshareholdings to prevent any single shareholder or group of shareholders from dominating the bank.The result has been a “clean” corporate structure for their banks, i.e. there are no cross-shareholdingsbetween banks and non-banks, and there is clear separation of ownership from management.Practice in other countriesThe US is an example of a financial system which has prohibited commingling between banking andcommerce, and required dispersion of bank ownership. For many years the Glass-Steagall Actrestricted commercial banks even from certain other financial activities, particularly investmentbanking and insurance, much less non-banking business. Now that Glass-Steagall has finally beenrepealed, allowing for more competitive banking institutions, the US Federal Reserve Board isproposing that US financial holding companies should only undertake a well-defined range ofapproved activities.
3BIS Review 53/2000In the UK, there is no legal prohibition on banks participating in non-financial activities. But inpractice few of the banks do so. This is partly the result of stringent treatment of capital adequacy bythe regulator - banks are required to deduct from their regulatory capital dollar for dollar of anyinvestment they make in non-financial activities. It is also because the banks are widely held, with nodominant shareholder who has other non-financial interests. The banks therefore have little incentiveto control non-financial companies through their investments.Germany has had a different approach. German banks have traditionally held major long-term equitystakes in industrial groups, such as Daimler-Benz or Thyssen. This arrangement gave the industrialgroups long-term strategic shareholders, who could look beyond the next quarter’s financial results.But it has also frozen the structure of the industrial groups, and prevented them from merging,restructuring and rationalising, as US companies have done. It has made it harder for the banks todeploy their assets flexibly, to maximise their own returns, and to become as spry and competitive asUS banks.The Germans have recognised these structural weaknesses and are taking steps to rectify them.However, one major obstacle to German banks divesting their industrial holdings has been theprohibitive capital gains tax. Now a Social Democrat government has proposed tax reforms that willremove this obstacle, and pave the way for banking and industrial conglomerates to untangle their webof cross shareholdings.In Asia, both South Korea and Japan relied on close association between banking and commerce in theearlier stages of their industrialisation. South Korean chaebols, and the banks that lent to them, arenow facing painful reforms. Poor lending practices by Korean banks disguised the deterioratingfinances of the chaebols, and eventually nearly brought the whole system down in the Asian crisis.In Japan, the pre-war zaibatsu system became the post-war keiretsu system. Each major keiretsu orindustrial group consists of companies linked together through a web of cross-shareholdings, includinga main bank. Keiretsu members support one another financially and in terms of direct business. Thebank in the keiretsu plays a pivotal role, facilitating the financial transactions of the group.While the keiretsu system helped Japan to rebuild and industrialise its economy after the war, many ofthe problems of corporate governance and unsound banks that now plague Japan are rooted in thisstructure. The prolonged crisis of the Japanese economy since 1990 has forced a fundamental rethink.The Japanese are now gradually starting to make basic structural changes. The banks are less willingto lend to associates without independently assessing their risks and charging the appropriate riskpremiums. And both banks and non-banks within the group are no longer willing to maintainshareholdings in each other which yield low returns. The changes will enhance transparency andcorporate accountability. They are essential to Japan’s economic recovery, but will have far-reachingsocial and cultural implications.Existing structures of Singapore banksIn Singapore, the local banks (other than DBS) started as family-owned banks and built up asuccessful financial business on that basis. Over time they have merged and consolidated. Today thefounding families remain the principal shareholders, and are in several instances also involved in themanagement of the bank.Besides banking, the principal shareholders have also built up diverse non-banking businesses,especially in property. The local banks participate in these non-financial activities of the group, bothby lending and through equity ownership. The banks and non-banks in the same group have developedsignificant cross-shareholdings. A mixed conglomerate structure has evolved.The commingling of financial and non-financial activities will potentially expose Singapore banks tothe same problems that banks elsewhere have experienced. We have not run into serious problems, sofar. This is because the principal shareholders have run the banks prudently and properly. The MAShas also been stringent in monitoring related party transactions. Strict laws govern such transactions;
BIS Review 53/20004for instance, bank directors are jointly and severally liable to indemnify the bank for losses arisingfrom unsecured loans to related companies.But problems will manifest themselves only in times of stress, as the Japanese and Korean experienceshave shown. For the future, we need to restructure the banks’ participation in non-financial activitiesbefore potential vulnerabilities become actual problems. We have the luxury of acting now while thebanks are sound; we must not delay or put off changes which are essential for their long-term well-being.The banking environment in Singapore will only become more open and competitive, and lessforgiving of weaknesses or under-performance. Banks must concentrate on their core competenciesand build strong and institutionalised management structures to compete in a globalised industry.Ultimately, their improved performance will benefit all depositors and shareholders, and strengthenthe financial system as a whole.New structureThe Government has therefore decided to require the local banking groups to segregate their financialand non-financial activities, and unwind the cross-shareholdings between the two. This will meanchanges to their present corporate structures. These measures will apply to all local banks - OCBC,UOB and OUB, as well as DBS and KTB.There will be four key elements in the separation between the financial and non-financial entities:ownership, cross-shareholding, management, and name-sharing.OwnershipMAS will require all the financial activities in each banking group to be grouped together, either underthe bank or under a non-operating financial holding company (FHC). The non-financial activities mustbe segregated from the banking group and divested. They can be sold to third parties, or alternativelyto the principal shareholders of the bank, so that the principal shareholders own them directly, and notthrough any of the entities in the financial arm of the group. MAS will regulate the bank or FHC, but itwill not regulate the non-financial activities.Currently, all the local banks are listed, and so are many of the non-banks in the groups. The banksand non-banks already have separate sets of shareholders. In fact, the minority shareholders, i.e. theshareholders other than the principal shareholder, typically account for about 70% of the ownership ofthe bank.MAS will require this separation of ownership to be retained. The bank or FHC in the existing bankinggroups must continue to be listed on its own. For example,, it cannot be subsumed as a 100%-ownedsubsidiary of a listed top-level holding company, which owns both the bank as well as the non-financial entities.Having distinct groups of shareholders for the financial and non-financial activities will strengthenmarket discipline on the bank, and facilitate clearer accountability of its performance to minorityshareholders. It will help to ensure that the separation of the financial and non-financial activities issubstantive and not just pro-forma.There are many ways for banking groups to reconfigure their corporate structure. In the end, whatcounts as a FHC is a matter of substance, and not of the form of the organisation chart. MAS reservesthe right to declare any company which owns a substantial share of a bank, directly or indirectly, as anFHC. Such an FHC will be subject to MAS regulation and will not be allowed to own non-financialactivities.
5BIS Review 53/2000Cross-shareholdingThe financial entities will not be allowed to own, directly or indirectly, the shares of non-financialfirms affiliated to the same principal shareholder.Within the financial arm, shareholdings should only be in one direction. We will not allow twocompanies in the financial arm to have mutual shareholdings in each other. For example, if a banktakes a stake in an insurance company or securities firm, then the insurance company or securities firmwould not be allowed to hold a stake in the bank. The Companies Act already prohibits subsidiaries ofbanks from owning shares in the bank. We will extend this principle to all entities below the bank orFHC, whether or not they are subsidiaries of the bank or FHC.Ideally, we should also disallow the non-financial entities from owning shares in the financial entities.However, we do not start from a clean slate. Requiring the banks to divest themselves of the non-financial activities will already be a major structural change. Therefore, in the present exercise MASwill allow the principal shareholders to continue owning indirect stakes in the banking groups throughthe non-financial entities that they control. MAS will review this arrangement later.ManagementTo avoid conflicts of interest, the management of the financial entities should be separate from themanagement of its non-financial affiliates. There should be no sharing of executive directors andmanagement staff, such as the chief financial officer and chief operating officer. On the board ofdirectors of a regulated financial entity, a majority of the directors should not be holding directorshipson the boards of the non-financial affiliates as well.Name-sharingMixed conglomerates usually leverage on common brand building. Many of the non-financialaffiliates of local banks share the name of their parent banks. Financial and non-financial entities alikehave built up goodwill in the brand name over the years.But reputational and contagion risks can result from sharing of names and corporate badges betweenthe bank and its non-bank affiliates. Where an unregulated entity sharing a name fails or falls intodisrepute, the public may attribute its problems to the bank, causing a bank run.MAS will therefore disallow the sharing of names and logos between the financial and non-financialentities. We are considering amending the Banking Act, to prevent the use of names or acronyms bycompanies that may confuse the public, or give the impression that a company is related to orassociated with any Singapore-incorporated bank.Scope of permitted activitiesMAS will determine the scope of activities which the bank or FHC will be permitted to undertake.Besides financial activities, they will include activities which have clear synergies with the bank’sfinancial business. We will not have a fixed list of permitted activities. Instead we will exerciseflexibility to allow banks to undertake business ventures that are related to their core competencies,such as e-commerce activities that are changing the banking industry worldwide. These includeproviding payment services in support of e-commerce, and leveraging on banks’ IT competencies toprovide IT services, especially in building infrastructure and applications for B2B e-commerce.Banks will also be allowed to undertake equity portfolio and venture capital investments. We willdefine an equity portfolio investment to be one where the bank and its financial affiliates do not havecontrol over the investee company, e.g. by being the largest shareholder. An equity portfolioinvestment should generally not exceed 10% of the investee company’s capital. Furthermore, eachequity portfolio investment will be subject to a single security limit of 2% of the bank’s capital funds.We will amend Section 31 of the Banking Act to remove the existing aggregate limit on portfolio
BIS Review 53/20006investments, and replace it with this new single security limit. We will also exclude debt instrumentsfrom Section 31 because they are generally less risky than equities.Venture capital investments will be treated separately. MAS is drafting separate rules to allow forventure capital investments by banks, and will consult them on these guidelines soon.The local banks have significant property holdings. This is partly because over the years the bankshave grown together with the property business of their principal shareholders, and also becauseproperty has been seen as a good and safe investment in Singapore. Some of these property holdingswere acquired many years ago, and have been kept on the banks’ books at book values which are wellbelow their present market values. This has provided a comfortable cushion of reserves for the banksagainst uncertainties. But it has also failed to reflect the true cost of holding these properties andtherefore reduced the pressure on the banks to optimise returns on assets.Property assets that earn competitive returns have their place as one component of the investmentportfolio of the local banks. MAS will therefore allow the banks to hold properties, solely forinvestment purposes, and subject to a limit aimed at preventing excessive risk concentration. Howmuch property a bank actually holds within these prudential limits is for its management andshareholders to decide.However, banks should not be engaged in developing or managing hotels or other properties, whetherdirectly or through companies they control. Banks are not property companies. MAS will thereforerequire banks to divest all properties held for development, and shareholdings in property developmentcompanies beyond the portfolio investment limits.The aggregate net book value of permitted property holdings will be subject to a revised Section 33limit of 20% of a bank’s capital funds (reduced from the existing 40%). The 20% limit translates intoless than 5% of each of the local bank’s total assets currently. It will apply on the basis of both bankand group capital. As with the present Section 33, properties held for the purpose of the bank’sbusiness premises will be excluded from this limit. But whilst the present Section 33 applies only toproperties directly held by banks and their subsidiaries, the new limit will also include properties heldby companies in which the banking group has shareholding of 10% or more.Investments made by insurance fundsMost of the local banks have insurance companies within their groups. These insurance companiespresent a slight complication. They invest two separate types of funds: the equity in the companybelonging to its shareholders, and the insurance funds managed by the company but belonging to thepolicyholders, For example, the life fund of life insurance companies.Portfolio investments made using the shareholders’ funds of the insurance companies will be subjectto the same single security limit of 2% of the group’s capital funds and the limit of 10% of the investeecompany’s capital. The portfolio limits for the banking group as a whole will therefore include theinvestments using these shareholders’ funds of their insurance companies.MAS recognises that the insurance funds are different in nature from the equity of the company or thegroup because they belong to the policyholders and not the shareholders. Therefore in principleinvestments using the insurance fund should be treated separately from the investments of thecompany and the group. Nevertheless the insurance fund should also be used only for portfolioinvestments, and not for the purpose of controlling other companies in the group, especially non-financial companies, whether by itself or together with other investments by the group.Currently, some banking groups have used these insurance funds as the vehicle for owning andcontrolling their investee companies. For example, the bank itself may own only 5% of an investeecompany, but the insurance fund of the insurance company may own another 15%, giving a total stakeof 20%. This is not satisfactory, because it presents the same problems of contagion, non-transparencyand dilution of management focus as the bank itself investing directly in these companies.
7BIS Review 53/2000MAS will study the appropriate investment limits of insurance funds for both bank-related andindependent insurers. The limits set should protect the interests of policyholders through adequatediversification, and ensure that the investments do not amount to controlling stakes. These measureswill be developed in consultation with the industry, and are expected to be finalised by the end of theyear.Whatever the precise portfolio investment limits for the insurance funds, MAS will take thegovernance and deployment of these insurance funds into consideration, when assessing whether thebanking group has de facto control of an investee company, and thus whether an investment meets theportfolio investment criteria for the banking group.Time frame and potential impactThe separation of the financial and non-financial activities will be a major change for the bankinggroups. There will be significant corporate restructuring and divestment of assets. We must do this inan orderly manner, over a reasonable period. There is no reason to force a fire sale, which wouldweaken the banks and diminish confidence, and would be against the interests of shareholders anddepositors.Local banks will be given three years to complete the restructuring and comply with the newrequirements. The three years will commence from the passage of the relevant legislation, whichshould take place by the end of the year. MAS will work with the banks on a phasing and schedule, sothat the restructuring and divestments can take place in an orderly manner and be completed within thethree-year deadline.Tax treatment for divestmentThe divestment of non-permitted assets will have significant tax implications. In order to avoiduncertainty as to how IRAS will treat these transactions, and to minimise the tax impact on the banksof changes which have been mandated by MAS, the Government has decided on a set of one-offadministrative concessions to facilitate this exercise.All gains arising from disposals of shares and real properties which have been held for more than 10years will be treated as non-taxable capital gains. For assets held for less than 10 years, IRAS wouldlook at the facts of individual cases to decide whether capital or income treatment is appropriate. TheGovernment will also waive stamp duty on sales of all shares and properties where the gains areconsidered capital in nature.These concessions will not apply to gains arising from the disposal of shares which have previouslybeen claimed as trading stock for tax purposes, or gains on disposals of real properties by banks’property development companies. However, where income tax is payable arising from a mandated saleof assets that does not qualify for capital gains tax exemption, the Government will give the banksthree years to settle the amount.This package will apply only to assets required to be disposed of under the restructuring exercise, andwill only cover disposals made within the three-year period allowed by MAS for the restructuring.ConclusionMAS has discussed our plans with the local banks. They agree with the policy direction proposed.They have suggested some modifications to the MAS proposals, which wherever possible MAS hasincorporated.Our approach is pragmatic, not purist. Our circumstances are different from other countries. We needto strike the right balance, to find the framework that suits our economy, and which recognises thehistorical developments that have brought about the present situation. The principal shareholders
BIS Review 53/20008remain a source of strength to the banks, and it is not our intention to conscribe their contributions tothe future banking business.The separation of financial and non-financial activities will be another major step forward instrengthening the local banks. As one analyst wrote in March:“The MAS is expected to announce soon rules requiring banks to dispose of non-core assets. Weconsider this to be very important - as part of re-engineering the banks into more profitable andcompetitive entities would be to require them to concentrate on their core business rather than act asconglomerates with low-yielding assets”.1I urge all the banks to continue to upgrade their capabilities and build up their management teams, inorder to prepare themselves for the new opportunities and challenges arising from the rapid changes oftechnology and the market. MAS will continue to work with the local banks to foster closercooperation and strengthen the culture of openness as we liberalise the banking industry.1“Singapore Banks: Impact of Sale of Non-Core Assets”, Theme Piece by Warburg Dillon Read Global Equity Research, 17 March 2000.
1BIS Review 52/2000Klaus Liebscher: Challenges for the Eurosystem’s monetary policyContribution by Dr Klaus Liebscher, Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, to the paneldiscussion on monetary policy, 28th Economics Conference of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank,held in Vienna, on 15 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen!Central bankers are used to acting under uncertainty - in fact, this is a major rationale for theirexistence. The Eurosystem - i.e. the ECB and the euro area national central banks - has undergone -and, I believe, successfully passed - a special test on “Monetary policy under uncertainty” in managingthe transition to EMU and in conducting monetary policy during the first one and a half years of theeuro area’s existence. Indeed, EMU represents a major regime shift, with a number of associateduncertainties, such as data uncertainties, uncertainties about the monetary transmission mechanismacross the euro area, uncertainties about the economic structure of the euro economy as it is adaptingto the new, more competitive environment, and, last but not least, uncertainties about the interactionbetween the various economic policymakers.Ladies and gentlemen, let me contribute six observations to the issue of our panel discussion whichwere obviously similar.The first observation relates to the role of monetary policy in a situation when the economy is possiblyentering a new era. Some proponents of the New Economy claim that monetary policy should berelaxed to “give growth a chance”. Now, while I certainly have sympathy with economic policiessupporting economic growth, employment and welfare, I think this categoric claim is beside the point.Monetary policy should always and unambiguously - with or without a “New Economy” - pursue itsprimary objective of maintaining price stability. A stable anchor for price expectations is particularlyimportant in a period of heightened uncertainty. It is common wisdom by now that, by crediblysticking to price stability, monetary policy serves growth best. Indeed, it has been argued - and I wouldsubscribe to this assessment - that the low inflation of the 1990s was among the contributing favorableframework conditions which laid the ground for the recent emergence of dynamic entrepreneurshipand innovation in the United States. In addition, the highly competitive and far less regulated marketstructure of the US economy has contributed substantially to new businesses and new technologies.This does, however, not mean that monetary policy should be blind and ignorant vis-à-vis the changesbrought about by a New Economy. Quite on the contrary!This brings me to my second observation, ladies and gentlemen. In a situation of uncertainty about aregime change, the central issue for monetary policy is: on which economic indicators best to focus inorder to assess inflation prospects. And it is with these indicators - not with the policy objectives -where shifts of weight might be appropriate.Any regime change may have the unwelcome effect of altering long standing economic relationships.The advent of a New Economy affects a number of variables which the central bank would normallymonitor to assess whether the economy is below, at or above its potential and whether thereforeinflationary pressures are likely to emerge. A New Economy would, by definition, increase theeconomy’s potential output, so potential output and any concept directly or indirectly derived from it -such as the output gap, NAIRU (i.e. Non-Accelerating-Inflation Rate of Unemployment) or the naturalrate of unemployment and growth - become less reliable indicators of future price developments.Thus, the central bank should attach less weight to these indicators in periods where fundamentalchanges to the trend growth of potential output are suspected. At the same time, the potential break inlong-standing economic relationships means that quantitative models, which are usually estimatedfrom long time series, become a less reliable guide for the interpretation of current and future
BIS Review 52/20002economic developments. Thus, by necessity, the central bank should attach more weight on a detailedanalysis of current economic developments.Ladies and gentlemen, this leads me to my third observation. The Eurosystem’s two-pillar monetarypolicy strategy was particularly chosen to cater for a period of transition and uncertainty, although - tobe frank - at the time of designing this strategy, we certainly did not have a New Economy in mind buthad quite different concerns. The two-pillar strategy allows us - and compels us - to follow closely andsystematically a wide range of monetary, economic and financial indicators which may giveindications on future inflation and economic developments at large. It easily accommodates theadvisable shift in the relative weight attached to various variables which I advocated previously.What is more, the two-pillar strategy does not pretend the existence of certainty and stable economicrelationships where there are in reality no such things. In this sense, it is a very honest strategy. To betransparent to the public, though, it requires special communication efforts by the central banks.By all means, the two-pillar strategy is in my conviction clearly superior - particularly at the presentjuncture of considerable model uncertainty - to any mechanical rule-based approaches. The latter areusually tailored to specific views of how the economy operates and are therefore less likely to performwell in periods where these views might have to be adapted. Monetary policy rules usually derive theirpolicy recommendations from a very narrow set of economic indicators only. In many cases they restheavily on the output gap and the equilibrium real interest rate, which, as I have pointed out, arepotentially very unreliable concepts at the present juncture.Ladies and gentlemen, let me now, as my fourth observation, address the issue of how a NewEconomy would influence monetary policy in the long run, in other words how it would affect thelong-term prospects for real interest rates. Again, there is unfortunately no simple answer.Even in the United States, where recent data clearly point to a substantial increase in the growth rate ofproductivity, it is still open whether a New Economy would permanently increase the trend rate ofproductivity growth or, alternatively, cause a one-off shift in the level of productivity only.What is more, even in the latter case of a one-time level shift in productivity, it could take theeconomy quite some time - up to a decade or more - to reach its new steady state. It will therefore alsoin the near and medium-term future remain unclear which of the two effects the ICT revolution entails.Ladies and gentlemen, let me now, as my fifth observation, turn to the more immediate period of thetransition to a possible New Economy. As has recently been pointed out by Alan Greenspan, thepotential problem for monetary policy from the New Economy is that the pick-up in productivity maycreate even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate output. So, in otherwords, monetary policy needs to closely watch the relative size - and the timing - of the potentialeffects on aggregate supply and demand. Let me elaborate a little bit on this. I am close to what wassaid by President Broaddus and Governor Bäckström.The prospect of higher productivity, higher economic growth and thus higher profits may boost stockprices particularly of firms operating in the new ICT sectors, as we have observed in the past fewyears. The associated stock price rally increases consumers’ financial wealth.At the same time, current high labor demand and the generally optimistic outlook on the economy mayincrease workers’ expectation of their future salaries, and thus also increase human wealth. Takentogether, this may boost consumer spending even ahead of, and in excess of, the growth effectsactually materializing. In this case, the temporary excess demand would spur inflation, and monetarypolicy should intervene in order to cool off demand to a pace consistent with the increase in theeconomy’s productive capacity.By contrast, if demand and supply effects from a New Economy developed broadly in parallel,monetary policy could pursue a neutral stance. This does not mean that the central bank should keepnominal short-term interest rates constant. Rather, it should see that overall monetary conditions,including the exchange rate and long-term interest rates, remain neutral.It also follows from what I said before, that monetary policy should not try to target a specific level ofstock prices or to put a lid on stock prices. Particularly in an era of a potential substantial regime
3BIS Review 52/2000change, it is impossible to judge with any confidence on the appropriate level of stock prices.Monetary policy should, however, take into account the current - and potential future - aggregatedemand effects arising from rising - and potentially falling - stock prices.Concluding, ladies and gentlemen, let me finally observe that the factors behind the New Economyapplicable to the US could also have a similar positive effect on Europe.As regards technology, as I already pointed out in my opening remarks, there is the chance for Europe- based on the US experience - to achieve good results. A second argument consists in the benefits ofthe European integration into the global economy and the advantages of the Common Market - likederegulation in areas such as telecommunications and in the public utilities sector. Finally, theestablishment of the Monetary Union forces a restructuring in the corporate sector and facilitates neweconomic policies.All in all, the latter requires a much stricter approach on the European level to abandon rigidities in thelabor, goods and services markets, to create a more favorable environment for entrepreneurship and toimprove the structures and techniques of the risk capital markets.Compared with the situation a few years ago, we are heading forward in these crucial areas. Therefore,I am very much convinced that Europe has also the potential for a New Economy if we are willing toadopt the process of further structural reform. But there are many and good reasons for optimism. Animportant one is the well-functioning Monetary Union, which opens up many opportunities.Thank you very much for your attention.ReferencesBrainard, William (1966), Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy, American Economic Review,Vol. LVII, No. 2, May.Estrella, Arturo, and Frederic S Mishkin, Rethinking the Role of NAIRU in Monetary Policy:Implications of Model Formulation and Uncertainty, NBER Working Paper 6518, April.Federal Reserve Board (2000a), Humphrey Hawkins Testimony of the Chairman Alan Greenspan,17 February.Federal Reserve Board (2000b), Technological innovation and the economy, Remarks by ChairmanAlan Greenspan before the White House Conference on the New Economy, Washington D.C.,5 April 2000.Ferguson, Roger W, Jr (2000), Conversation with Leaders of the “New Economy”, speech held at theHaas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, 9 May 2000.Gordon, Robert J (1999), Has the “New Economy” Rendered the Productivity Slowdown Obsolete?”,Working paper, Northwestern University, 14 June.Issing, Otmar (2000), European Integration at the beginning of the new millenium, Excerpts fromlecture given at the Forum Dialogue, organized by the Banque Central du Luxembourg, on8 February 2000 in Luxembourg.Jorgenson, Dale W, and Kevin J Stiroh (2000), Raising the Speed Limit: US Economic Growth in theInformation Age, Working Paper, 3 March.

1BIS Review 52/2000Jean-Claude Trichet: Euro prospects and international financial reformsSpeech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Banque de France, at the 21st Century Forum,sponsored by the National Committee Chinese People’s Consultative Conference, held in Beijing, on15 June 2000.*      *      *It is a great privilege to participate in such an extraordinary forum. I want to express all my gratitudeto the National Committee Chinese People’s Consultative Conference, and particularly its chairman,for having sponsored this 21st Century Forum, here in Beijing.Let me take this opportunity to present some views on international issues. I would like to focus ontwo major topics,– the international financial architecture and its necessary evolution;– the economic strengths and scope for further progress in the euro area.Both topics are in fact related: both have a bearing on the future of the International Monetary andFinancial System; both illustrate the worldwide efforts to build more stable economic and monetaryrelationships in an increasingly globalized world.1.Let’s consider first the international financial architectureSeveral complex issues, often inter-related, are currently at stake. On each of them, the Eurosystem(i.e. the European Central Bank - ECB - and the eleven National Central Banks - NCBs - of the euroarea) have elaborated a common view. It is this common view that I will present to you now as I havehad occasions of presenting it, as the position of Banque de France, in the last G VII meeting, lastApril.I see five major points that are of systemic interest: – the orderly liberalization of capital movements;– the question of reserve and debt management;– the key issue of transparency;– the question of the moral hazard associated with private sector involvement;– and finally the choice of the exchange rate regime.1.1Orderly liberalization of capital movementsThe liberalization of capital movements benefits both individual countries and the world economy: itenhances long-term growth potential and improves savings/investments allocation. However, the twofollowing principles need to be carefully taken into account in order to minimize risks:– the restructuring of domestic financial systems and the strengthening of domestic regulatoryand supervisory frameworks are preconditions of utmost importance: emerging economiesshould bring their domestic financial systems into line with regulatory and supervisoryminimum requirements prevailing in mature economies. In that respect, the internationalcommunity plays an important role through the Financial Stability Forum, theimplementation of standards such as the “Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision”or the Financial Sector Assessment Programs developed by the IMF in order to identifyfinancial systems’ strengths and vulnerabilities.
BIS Review 52/20002– The liberalization process should be carefully sequenced, starting from the more stablecapital flows (e.g. FDI), in line with the progress mode in the financial sector solidity andsoundness; recent crises illustrated disruptive capital outflows generated by external debtshighly concentrated on short-term maturities.1.2Improved reserve and debt managementTo mitigate the volatility of capital flows and especially short term flows and reap the benefits ofcapital account liberalization, one should adopt a risk management strategy that involves a system formonitoring and assessing the risks and liquidity of the economy as a whole, including at a sectorallevel.The international community may assist in developing best practices related to reserve and debtmanagement: let me quote for example the more stringent publishing obligations on net foreignexchange reserves adopted within the context of the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard(SDDS) or the IMF and the World Bank initiative to promote good practices in reserve and sovereignliability management.As recommended by the Financial Stability Forum Working Group on Capital Flows, an improvedrisk management by the banking sector is desirable, particularly as regards banks in emerging marketsreceiving flows and international banks extending cross-border credit, with the help of revisedGuidelines from the Basel Committee on managing liquidity risk.Let me also note that implementing a strategy assessing the liquidity risk and foreign exposure of theeconomy as a whole calls for an adequate balance sheet information from both the public and theprivate financial and corporate sectors.1.3Transparency and enhanced surveillanceThe efficiency of international capital markets depends on the availability of reliable and timelyinformation both on debtor countries and market participants.– As regards the public sector, many efforts have been achieved, such as the IMF codes ofgood practices on transparency in the field of fiscal policy or monetary and financial policiesor the promotion by the IMF of statistical standards (the so-called SDDS).– International Financial Institutions have also continued to proceed toward greatertransparency. Several initiatives have been launched, I will particularly point out theparticipation of 60 countries on a voluntary basis in the pilot experience for the release ofIMF article IV reports.– As far as the private sector is concerned, parallel efforts need to be pursued. Progress maytake the form of improved disclosure on a voluntary basis, more demanding statisticalreporting and extended requirements for non-transparent segments of the financial markets.Thanks to improved transparency important progress is being made to strengthen IFI’s surveillance inkey areas, including financial sector issues, external debt and capital account developments, exchangerate policies.As Prime Minister Fraser has mentioned, the definition of internationally agreed standards and codesis also strongly impacting the IMF surveillance; the implementation of these standards will reduceemerging market economies’ financial vulnerabilities and together with enhanced transparency,improve market discipline and market participants’ ability to better assess the risks of their investmentdecisions.Efforts have now to be pursued as regards the prioritization of these Standards and Codes (theFinancial Stability Forum Task Force on Implementation identified 12 of such Codes and Standardsout of 65) and the development of incentives to implement them. Is there a better demonstration thatwe are experiencing globalization than to observe that 65 global workshops including countries intransition and emerging economies have worked out 65 Codes and Standards to be implemented
3BIS Review 52/2000universally? The commitment of economies to implement Codes and Standards might be reinforced ifmarket participants reflect information on observance of Codes and Standards in differentiated creditratings.1.4Private sector involvementThe main objectives of private sector involvement is to avoid moral hazard and other distortions in thefunctioning of international financial markets and to facilitate more orderly adjustments in case ofcrisis.Market participants should be encouraged to assess adequately the risks involved in investmentdecisions on the basis of a country’s underlying fundamentals, including the soundness of its financialsystem, rather than on the expectation that official flows will possibly support repayments to them intimes of crisis.We have to promote approaches that permit appropriate coordination among creditors, and betweencreditors and borrowers. Appropriate instruments to reach that goal include collective action clauses,private contingent credit lines, call options on interbank credit lines and the removal of put optionsfrom bond contracts.I think that pragmatism should prevail as to the form of the private sector involvement in crisesresolution. But there is a need for general principles to highlight the roles and responsibilities of thepublic and private sectors, such as those that have been defined in the framework adopted by the G7 atthe Köln Summit in June 1999. Among these principles, I would particularly stress:– the focus on the medium term sustainability of a country’s financing position;– the objective to achieve comparability of treatment between and within a country’s bilateralofficial and private creditors.1.5Choice of the right exchange rate regimeThe sustainability of any exchange rate regime depends crucially on its consistency with a country’sdomestic macroeconomic and structural policy framework.This being said, the choice of an exchange rate regime should rest on the following principles:– So-called “corner solutions” are not necessarily the only available options. Free floating ratesmay help to accommodate volatile capital flows and asymmetric shocks; however, theymight not prevent misalignments leading to balance of payments desequilibrium, they mightprove disruptive for the real sector of small open economies, which often lack the size fordeveloping the necessary market infrastructure to cope with exchange rate instability.Currency boards can be warranted only under very specific circumstances.– Requirements for sustaining pegs have become very demanding in an environment of highcapital mobility; however, “intermediate solutions” may still remain a relevant option for anumber of countries; particularly for open economies with close links to a partner country ora partner single currency area that maintains price stability or for countries experiencing highinflation, where anchoring the currency provides a simple and credible rule for monetarypolicy. Needless to say that the intermediate solutions are considered particularly appropriatein the European framework where the belonging to an exchange rate mechanism plays amajor role in the preparation to join the single currency.– In cases where countries need to respond to very large capital inflows and related risks ofinflation and real appreciation, greater exchange rate flexibility might become desirable.Let me conclude these considerations with two observations:– First, we should concentrate all our efforts on implementation of existing codes andstandards. Implementation is the key word at present times. Applying standards and codes in
BIS Review 52/20004all economies of the world, including emerging economies and economies in transition is animmense, challenging and urgent endeavor.– Second, as regards the private sector involvement, I will recommend being as pragmatic andas consistent as possible. Pragmatic because a case by case assessment is always needed andthere is, in my opinion, no mechanistic “a priori” approach which would be advisable.Consistent, meaning that once the assessment is made by the international community on theconcept of the participation of the private sector in the crisis solution, we have to stick to it.2.Let me turn now to the second topic of my presentation which relates to the economicstrengths of the euro zone and its impact on the euro itselfMore specifically, I would like to stress the three reasons which make me confident in the euro zoneand therefore convinced that the euro will significantly appreciate in the future:– the euro zone may expect a long phase of steady economic growth;– structural reforms are underway so that a strong economic growth will be sustainable;– European firms are restructuring themselves and entering further into the global competition.2.1The euro zone may expect a long phase of steady economic growthIn the past months, the euro zone has benefited from a strong economic recovery. At the end of 1998and more notably in the first half of 1999, most European countries faced a temporary economicslowdown, partly resulting from the financial and economic turmoil of East Asia. But since then, theeuro zone has benefited from a strong economic recovery (4% in annual term during the second half of1999). One important feature of this evolution is the fact that countries whose economic growth hadbeen lagging so far are now catching up.This present economic recovery is taking place in a sound economic environment. Inflation levelremains under control even though the balance of risks to price stability has recently gone up: somepressures have resulted from recent oil price rises or may result from some capacity constraints thatcould be encountered in the course of next years. Needless to say that the Governing Council of theEurosystem has been and will remain vigilant in order to secure our primary objective of pricestability.Besides, the current account is slightly in surplus and fiscal deficits are, in the euro zone as a whole,on a downward trend.It is worth stressing that European economies have never been creating so many new jobs so fast. Thepast two years (1998 and 1999) have seen very rapid job growth (about +1.5% a year) and a very bigdecrease in unemployment. In France, the rise has been sharper since almost 900,000 new jobs werecreated by enterprises (excluding Government administration) from December 1996 to December1999 i.e. +6.6% over three years. With the economic growth speeding up, we can expect a further dropin the unemployment rate which is presently below 10%.Due to this economic recovery, the growth differential between the US and the euro zone isprogressively to disappear. This gap between the two economic zones in terms of economic growthhas resulted in the past years from the lag between their economic cycles. According to the presentanalysts’ consensus, growth differential between the two zones is to narrow this year and practicallydisappear next year. According to the IMF forecasts, growth should reach 3.2% in the US in 2001compared to 3.0% in the euro zone.2.2Structural reforms which are underway in Europe are likely to permit a sustainablenon-inflationary growthThe undertaking and speeding up of structural reforms is one of the conditions for a complete successof the euro. In this regard, the Lisbon European Council, held last 23 April, can be viewed as a further
5BIS Review 52/2000important step towards the necessary medium term strategy for structural reforms in the Union. Thelabor market has become more flexible in the past few years in Europe. I would like to give a fewexamples of this evolution. In all countries, the number of people on fixed-term contracts has quicklyincreased; they counted for a large part of jobs created between 1995 and 1998 and the trend hascontinued since then. In many countries, fiscal measures (for instance reduction of non-wage costs)have given incentives to hire younger and less-skilled people (France, Italy, Spain and Germany).Another key change is the rapid growth in part-time employment, especially among women.While Europe has long had a strong tradition of economic regulation, it must be acknowledged thatderegulation is well underway in most countries. The change is particularly noticeable in several keysectors such as telecommunication (mobile phones in particular), transportation (particularly airlines)and the power-supply industry (electricity and gas) to only mention a few of them.Major countries have embarked on an ambitious overhaul of their public sector. In countries with alarge public sector, such as Italy or France, ambitious privatization programs have steadily reduced thenumber of state enterprises (banking and insurance sectors, manufacturing sector…). It is noteworthythat these programs have been carried out by various governments with different political orientation.In addition to privatization, state enterprises are changing; companies that remain government ownedare becoming more profit-minded (particularly airlines, railways…).2.3European firms are restructuring and entering further into the global competitionEuropean firms are going through a deep restructuring. Mergers and acquisitions have hit new recordsas companies seek to create national, regional or global market-leaders (M&As close to $1,500bn in1999 against 500bn in 1997). Venture capital and start-ups are booming as investors and entrepreneursbecome more convinced that Europe can compete with America in knowledge-based industries. Heavyindustries and large conglomerates are restructuring as never before. Finally, new rules on corporategovernance are spreading over.The outflows of foreign direct investments merely mirror the dynamism of European firms. Europeanfirms were lagging behind US firms in terms of foreign direct investments and they are catching up.European firms have entered in a “globalization process” whereby they aim to reach a global sizethrough external purchases.As a conclusion, I would like to make three remarks: on the global financial markets, on the euro andon the People’s Republic of China.– On the global financial markets, I will draw our attention to one of the most importantchallenges we have to face up with: the “herd instinct” of market participants, which, incertain cases, can amplify considerably volatility, create or augment misalignments andinduce large-scale global contagion in case of local crisis. The herd instinct is probablyprofoundly enshrined in the functioning of the marketplace. In order to minimize its effects, Ihave three provisional conclusions:• Perhaps we should have a second look at the very rapid generalization of day to daymark to market accountings. Perhaps a better medium term functioning of the marketwould call for a clear distinction between various market participants depending ontheir own time horizons.• It seems to me that it would also be important to reflect upon the consequences of thevery rapid increase of mutual funds in some major markets. All the managers of thesefunds have to prove permanently on a very short-term basis that they are bettermanaged than the average. This creates a very powerful potential herd instinct.• Finally, I profoundly think that full transparency is the most efficient tool to counterthe setting up of a “herd” and to cope with potential “herd” behavior. When oneknows all about a particular “signature” or about a particular country, there is muchless reason to embark into blind crisis contagion. Here is the motto I would like to be
BIS Review 52/20006accepted globally by market participants: “Let us judge the quality andcreditworthiness of any particular signature upon its own peculiar fundamentals, uponits own, particular, assets and liabilities”.– On the euro, I want to stress that the euro zone has adopted a sound macro policy and hasembarked in a fairly comprehensive program of structural reforms. These reforms will taketime to be fully completed. But they have already boosted economic growth, job creation andthe restructuring of firms. I am impressed by what has been achieved during the past yearsand National Central Banks as well as the ECB are strongly encouraging governments andcorporate businesses to foster structural reforms and business restructuring in the future.The Eurosystem, which is the guardian of the euro for the sake of the people of Europe,knows that our fellow citizens want the single currency to be at least as solid as were theirprevious national currencies: in France, to give only one example, 96% of the people arecalling for the euro to be at least as solid as the Franc; needless to say that it is the same inGermany and in all other countries of the Monetary Union. That is the reason why I fullysubscribe to the declaration of our President, Wim Duisenberg, in the name of the GoverningCouncil: “European citizens can be assured that the future of the euro is that of a strongcurrency, based on price stability and the strength of the European economy.”A stable, a solid, a strong euro is in the interest of Europe.– On the People’s Republic of China, I would like to praise the highly responsible attitudewhich has been adopted by Beijing during the Asian crisis. China has played a decisive rolein helping stabilize the full body of the Region and has gained an immense credit not only inAsia but in the global community as a whole. I entirely share the sentiment of Premier Zhuon the role of the prudent monetary policy of the People’s Bank of China in that success.I have been impressed by the quality of the contributions delivered in the occasion of the 21st CenturyForum.If there is a lesson I draw from the exchange of views, here under the auspices of the NationalCommittee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, it would be the decisiveimportance of foreign direct investments in the development of the economy of China. FDI’s are thebest recipe for a successful and balanced globalization.
1BIS Review 51/2000William J McDonough: Update on the major initiativeto revise the 1988 Capital AccordSpeech by Mr William J McDonough, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, before the 4th Annual Supervision Conference of the British Bankers Association,held in London, on 19 June 2000.*      *      *I am pleased to be with you to provide an update on the major initiative to revise the 1988 CapitalAccord. Last June the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which I have the privilege ofchairing, released a Consultative Paper proposing a new capital adequacy framework. My commentstoday will focus on the industry’s response to the proposal and the areas that will require theCommittee’s attention going forward. Given the progress already achieved, it is my belief that theCommittee will be prepared to release a second Consultative Paper early next year.I will also briefly discuss three essential aspects of the safe and sound operation of any bankingorganization - good corporate governance, rigorous internal controls and effective risk management. Iwill conclude with some thoughts on the critical role of banks’ board of directors and seniormanagement.Current AccordThe primary tool of capital regulation currently is the set of minimum ratios that were devised in 1988by the Basel Committee. The 1988 Capital Accord has truly become a global standard for banksworldwide. Its adoption by over 100 countries has helped to strengthen the safety and soundness of theinternational banking system and has contributed to the achievement of competitive equality.However, the financial world has changed dramatically over the past dozen years, to the point that theAccord’s efficacy has eroded considerably. Its broad brush approach to differentiating credit riskencouraged banks to undertake regulatory arbitrage transactions. Furthermore, as banks havedeveloped innovative techniques for managing and mitigating risk, credit risk now exists in morecomplicated, less conventional forms than is recognized by the 1988 Accord, thus rendering capitalratios, as presently calculated, less useful to banking supervisors.Today’s marketplace also provides an imperative for revising the 1988 Accord. The rapid pace oftechnological change places information that was once largely the domain of analysts and institutionalinvestors into the hands of millions of individual investors and consumers. Market participants, armedwith timely and meaningful information, reward sound risk management practices and penalize thosebanks that are found deficient in this area. A bank’s regulatory capital position can be a strongindicator of how it supports its risk, and if markets are to impose an optimal level of discipline onbanks, we must ensure that regulatory capital measures reflect risk as precisely as possible. I believethat reform of the Basel Accord is thus clearly in the markets’ best interests. As the Committeecontinues to develop a more risk-sensitive capital adequacy framework, we cannot lose sight of theneed to keep the Accord up to date.Progress in revising the AccordLet me take a few moments to tell you how our work on the Basel Accord is progressing. TheCommittee began a fundamental review of the Accord in 1998. The release last June of theConsultative Paper reflected our vision for a new capital adequacy framework and we asked forcomments from the broad marketplace.
BIS Review 50/20002We knew that our first Consultative Paper would not be a perfect framework for all banks. That is whywe have been so keen to obtain feedback from a wide variety of sources including financialinstitutions, central banks and supervisors, representatives from non-G10 countries and other marketparticipants. The formal comment period on the Consultative Paper ended on 31 March. We are verypleased and encouraged by the response, and are now in the process of considering more than 200comments received.The commentators have sent us a strong message that they endorse our overall goal of developing acapital framework comprised of three pillars - minimum capital standards, supervisory review andmarket discipline - that is more risk reflective and appropriate to banks of varying levels ofsophistication.Internal ratings-based approachBased on our evaluation of the comments received, I can tell you that we are more committed thanever to an internal ratings-based approach. Many in the industry noted that a capital regime based onbanks’ internal ratings, which reflect a wide range of information about borrowers, can prove to bequite sensitive to the level of risk in a bank’s portfolio.Our analysis indicates that a wider range of institutions could be eligible to use the internal ratingsapproach, than the narrower set of large and sophisticated institutions, as implied in the ConsultativePaper issued in June. We now envision extending the applicability of the internal ratings methodapproach to banks of varying sizes, including small and medium-sized institutions provided suchratings systems are accompanied by strong internal controls, supervisory oversight and ampledisclosure.With this in mind, the Committee is working on how to link banks’ internal ratings to a regulatorycapital scheme. We are seeking to develop flexible approaches, since all banks wishing to use internalratings may not yet be able to generate the full amount of information necessary to tie their ratings tocapital requirements. Thus, for at least some banks, we are considering the possibility that someinformation would be supplied by the supervisor, although the core elements would be generated by abank’s internal ratings scheme. There would be a parallel track for the more sophisticated institutions,which would rely fully on internal information. In practice, the two approaches are part of a singleevolutionary framework, in which banks can rely increasingly on internal processes for regulatorycapital allocation as their risk measurement and management practices improve.As a first key step in developing these approaches, the Basel Committee gathered information aboutbanks’ internal ratings systems. Our findings indicate that there is presently no single standard for thedesign and operation of such a system. Thus, I see the importance of establishing appropriateguidelines for the use of internal ratings systems. These guidelines should ensure that internal ratingsappropriately reflect the credit risk in each category of exposure. Additionally, it is important that wedevelop robust disclosure guidelines for internal ratings information to ensure that capitalrequirements are comparable across banks and countries.Standardized approachA revised standardized approach is still very important to us at the Basel Committee, as some banksmay not have the internal resources to implement an internal ratings-based approach, and somesupervisors have indicated that implementation of this approach would create resource strains forthem. Further, we want to ensure that those banks that look to the Accord as the common standard -many of which are located in emerging market countries - can subscribe to the revised framework.In order to improve the risk sensitivity of the standardized approach without becoming overlycomplex, the Committee has proposed the use of external credit assessments, such as credit ratings.Many comments noted drawbacks to this approach, but those that have seriously considered thetrade-off between simplicity and risk sensitivity generally have agreed with the Committee’s decisionto make use of external credit assessments. This is particularly true for sovereign credits where there is
3BIS Review 51/2000widespread support for finding an alternative to the current OECD/non-OECD distinction. In otherwords, OECD membership would no longer be relied on for setting regulatory capital for sovereign orbank claims.Notwithstanding this support, many commentators have offered modifications to the Committee’sproposed standardized framework, which several observers have suggested does not go far enoughtoward risk differentiation. The Committee has taken this concern to heart, and is actively evaluatingwhether it would be feasible to incorporate additional risk weights into the standardized approach, and,if so, how this should be done.As we work toward greater risk differentiation among claims that are rated, we will continue to giveextensive thought to the treatment of unrated claims, given that the penetration of external ratingsremains low in most countries. It is difficult to avoid creating incentives to remain unrated while at thesame time retaining continuity with the existing Accord’s treatment for these credits. Further workwould be needed to develop a standard for unrated claims that would be more risk-reflective but,unfortunately, few commentators offered significant suggestions in this regard.ProcyclicalityThe Committee has considered what some observers have noted is the potential for introducing greatercyclicality in a more risk-sensitive capital framework. That is, the capital requirements for loans totroubled borrowers will tend to increase at just the point when such trouble is becoming apparent.This is an important point, and one that must be given serious consideration. It is my view that theglobal financial system needs to move toward addressing potential credit problems preemptively -before these problems have time to grow from minor disturbances to major disruptions. A more risk-sensitive capital framework should help ensure that banks hold appropriate capital behind high-riskcredits in the first place, and thus reduce the tendency for accentuating the need for capital afterproblems arise with such loans.Credit risk mitigation techniquesGreater recognition of the benefits of risk mitigation techniques - such as collateral, guarantees, creditderivatives and netting - also is at the forefront of the Committee’s work in revising the Accord.In January of last year, the Committee held consultations with over 50 banks and industry associationswithin the G10 on their methods for mitigating credit risk. We are now evaluating how to incorporatethe risk-reducing benefits of the best of these practices, while at the same time addressing potentialrisks that remain from their use.As we finalize our proposals for making capital charges reflective of risk mitigation techniques, we arestriving to find the right balance between recognizing a material reduction of risk with a structure thatis applicable beyond internationally-active banks to both domestic and non-G10 banks. While werecognize that the treatment of credit risk mitigation techniques might differ in some respects betweenthe standardized and the internal ratings-based approaches, we want to ensure a high degree ofconsistency between the two.Interest rate and other risksThe Committee recognizes that in refining the measurement of credit risk, we should also take theopportunity to explore the potential coverage of other important risks, such as interest rate risk in thebanking book and operational risk.For interest rate risk, we are pursuing a methodology that would require a capital charge only forso-called “outlier” banks whose interest rate risk is significantly above average. The envisionedframework for determining “outlier” banks for interest rate risk is similar to the general framework forcredit risk - the most sophisticated banks would use internal measurement systems for assigning
BIS Review 50/20004capital, while banks without sufficiently robust internal systems would use a simple standardizedapproach. The Committee is still working out a number of issues on this topic, including the definitionof an “outlier” bank and supervisory assumptions that would need to be built into the standardizedapproach.The Committee, through its Risk Management Group, also is engaged in the development of a capitalrequirement for other risks, in particular operational risk. Over the past year, it has met with numerousbanks and industry associations including the British Bankers’ Association. These meetings haveallowed us to better understand the range of practices currently in use. Over the next year, the RiskManagement Group will work with the industry to develop an evolutionary framework comprised ofapproaches of varying sophistication, ranging from a simple to an internal-based method. We areparticularly interested in creating the right incentives through a set of robust criteria that will enablebanks, subject to supervisory approval, to employ increasingly sophisticated approaches for settingcapital requirements for other risks.Second and third pillarsLet me also briefly touch upon the two other pillars of the revised capital adequacy framework -supervisory review and market discipline. These topics are certainly familiar and important ones to allof you.Supervisory review of capital is a critical complement to minimum capital requirements. TheConsultative Paper proposes that supervisors should ensure that each bank has sound internalprocesses in place to assess the adequacy of its capital, based on a thorough evaluation of its risks. Iwant to stress that this proposed approach in no way intends to replace the judgement and expertise ofbank management, or to shift responsibility for capital adequacy to supervisors. On the contrary, it iswell understood that bank managers have the most complete understanding of the risks theirinstitutions face, and it is they and the bank’s board of directors who have primary responsibility formanaging those risks.The task for supervisors in this framework is to evaluate how well banks are assessing their capitalneeds relative to their risks, including whether banks are appropriately addressing the relationshipbetween different types of risks. Most importantly, in proposing this second pillar the Committeeintends to foster a more active dialogue between banks and their supervisors, such that whendeficiencies develop, prompt and decisive action can be taken to restore capital. The Committeecurrently is in the final stages of preparing a paper on how the supervisory review of capital can beimplemented effectively.The third pillar of the new capital adequacy framework, market discipline, will serve to reinforcecapital regulation and other supervisory efforts to promote safety and soundness in banks and financialsystems. The Committee, in January of this year, issued a paper on bank disclosures, covering banks’capital structures, risk exposures and capital adequacy. Currently, our Transparency Group isconsidering whether it is possible to establish a set of core disclosures that would bolster marketdiscipline. This will involve drawing upon our existing disclosure recommendations, and reviewingthe extent to which disclosure in new areas - the internal ratings-based method, external ratings orinternal assessment of other risks - might be appropriate.I hope that this overview has given you a sense of the key points the Committee has learned from theconsultative process, and where we are headed. In the near-term, we are completing our work andexpect over the next few months to make progress in a number of areas, including greater riskdifferentiation in the standardized approach and the development of supervisory standards for internalratings.As we continue to fine-tune the new capital adequacy framework, we also are striving to avoid gettingbogged down in secondary issues that could slow down the overall process. As I have often remarked,the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good. It is imperative that we stay on track in our goal torelease a new capital adequacy framework by early next year, with a comment period and industryimplementation to follow shortly thereafter.
5BIS Review 51/2000Corporate governanceMy remarks thus far have focused on the need for a more risk-reflective capital framework. Clearly, astrong capital position is crucial to the sound operation of any banking organization. It allows banks’board of directors and senior management to focus on strategic objectives and growth opportunities,supports the business activities of the organization, and provides the financial strength necessary tosustain the occasional losses that are inevitable in a business of taking calculated risks.In this latter sense, capital represents the last line of defense against potential loss-creating problems.But, I want to briefly address the first line of defense - effective bank management, which increasinglyis an important element of today’s supervisory framework as banks’ activities and their associatedrisks become ever more complex.There are several aspects to effective bank management. The importance of good corporategovernance cannot be overemphasized. Broadly speaking, corporate governance refers to theorganizational infrastructure necessary to achieve a workable corporate strategy, to effectivelyimplement that strategy, and to continually evaluate its risks and benefits to the organization. Thesebasic infrastructural elements include:–independent and competent outside directors;–capable and experienced management;–a coherent corporate strategy and business plan; and,–clear lines of responsibility and accountability.There are three key points that are closely related to good corporate governance and critical to anybanking institution. The first is a rigorous internal control apparatus, which is essential to the soundand successful execution of banks’ strategic objectives. Second, each banking institution must have inplace the technical systems and management processes necessary to identify the risks associated withits activities. Third, an effective risk management and control structure must be accompanied by theinstitutional management culture required to ensure that policies and procedures are translated intopractice, with buy-in at all staff levels.Primary responsibility for ensuring that the bank has in place good corporate governance, rigorousinternal controls and effective risk management lies with the board of directors and seniormanagement. The task of the board of directors is to oversee the development of the overall strategy ofthe organization and the decisions made by senior management in pursuit of that strategy. The role ofsenior management, in turn, is to assure that day-to-day decisions made within the organization areconsistent with the policies and long-term objectives of the board. With regard to the board ofdirectors, I recognize that it can be difficult to elect members with the necessary skills and time todevote to overseeing the bank. While this can be a major challenge, it is obviously important that weget it right for the overall well-being of the bank.ConclusionIn closing, I want to emphasize that effective supervision of modern banking organizations willnecessarily entail a closer and more cooperative partnership between industry participants and officialsupervisors. The industry’s participation in the formulation of a more risk-sensitive capital adequacyframework is a good example of this kind of constructive interaction. Indeed, the three pillars of theproposed framework - minimum standards, supervisory review of banks’ capital assessmentmethodologies, and market discipline - reflect the understanding that regulatory requirements alone areno longer sufficient to address the growing complexity of banks’ activities and the associated risks.Consistent with this notion is the need for effective corporate governance, which plays an increasinglyimportant role in a rapidly evolving banking environment.It is clear to me, as a former commercial banker and now as a supervisor, that only if the industry andsupervisors work together, each meeting our responsibilities and reinforcing the other, will we be ableto successfully manage and supervise a modern financial system. While perspectives may differ from

1BIS Review 50/2000Lars Nyberg: Are the risks growing in the banking system?Speech given by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at an analyst meeting atEnskilda Securities, held in Stockholm, on 14 June 2000.*      *      *I would like to thank you for inviting me to today’s analyst meeting and giving me the opportunity todiscuss financial stability issues with such a qualified audience.I would like to start by briefly explaining the Riksbank’s analysis of financial stability. In addition tothe inflation target, the Riksbank has another primary task, namely that of being responsible forfinancial stability. These two important functions are closely linked. A stable financial system isimportant for price stability since financial imbalances can threaten the inflation target. Likewise, aninflation target policy contributes to stability in the financial system, as it has a levelling effect oncyclical fluctuations.The Riksbank’s analysis of financial stability can be interesting for analysts of bank and propertyshares, since we closely monitor the banking sector and property market within the scope of thisanalysis. Our perspective is somewhat different, however, since we are mainly interested in riskswhich can threaten the stability of the financial system and which often appear to be relativelyimprobable, while stock analysts attempt to assess the most likely developments in the market.However, the information about the markets is largely the same and analysts also need to consider therisks in the companies which they are covering.After this introduction, I will then go on to discuss the strong credit expansion in Sweden and themeasures that a central bank can take if it assesses that this development constitutes a potential threatto financial stability. I will conclude by looking at international developments, since the developmentin Sweden is by no means unique.The Riksbank and financial stabilityThe comprehensive changes that have taken place in the financial sector and the financial crises thathave occurred in various parts of the world have meant that the work on securing financial stabilityhas become increasingly prioritised. Those countries which have undergone severe banking crises inmodern times are now leading the way in terms of the work on financial stability. For example,Sweden was the first country in the world to regularly and openly publish special stability reportsanalysing the situation of the financial system. We would say that the initiative was received withmixed feelings by other central banks, some of which were concerned that these kinds of reportswould cause problems rather than preventing them. However, the attitude of the Riksbank has beenthat it is through open and honest communication with the financial players that we can observe andremedy potential problems at an early stage. Despite some initial scepticism, several countries havenow followed the Riksbank’s example. Norway and the UK now publish stability reports andDenmark also recently issued its first stability report. Since the financial markets operate acrossnational borders, the Riksbank works together closely with foreign central banks on these issues. Forexample, the Riksbank participates in several ECB committees related to stability issues and takes anactive part in the ongoing work to reform the capital adequacy regulations.It is also stipulated in law that one of the primary functions of the Riksbank is to promote a stable andefficient payment system. In order to fulfil this task, the Riksbank must closely follow developmentsin those financial institutions that are of central importance to the payment system, i.e. primarily thefour major banks, which are each sufficiently large to cause problems for financial stability if they fail.The analysis focuses on three main areas. The first area concerns general developments in the bankingsector - how the competitiveness and long-term profitability of the banks are developing. The secondarea examines credit risks related to the banks’ lending to households and non-financial companies.
BIS Review 50/20002The third area that is analysed is counterparty and settlement risks that arise in connection with thebanks’ trading and taking positions in the financial markets. The analysis is undertaken on an ongoingbasis and is presented in the Financial Stability Report, which is issued twice a year.I will mainly focus on the analysis of the banks’ credit risks associated with lending to households andcompanies. This is a subject that has attracted growing attention as lending, especially to thehousehold sector, has risen significantly. A certain increase in lending is normal in an economicupswing, when companies need to borrow in order to invest, while households borrow, for example, inorder to meet rising house prices. In an economic boom, loan losses are also generally low, while theytend to be higher during a recession.The increased level of indebtedness has also come under discussion. The question has been raised ofwhether households and companies today borrow to such an extent that this could lead to problems inthe banking sector when the economic cycle turns downward. History shows us that the factor whichhas triggered banking crises in modern times has often been extensive loan losses caused by changesin the macroeconomic environment. This was also the case during the Swedish banking crisis at thebeginning of the 1990s.Is the growth in credit worrying?So what is the situation at present? Figures for April show that total lending to the general public is up7.3% compared with April 1999. The main growth is in household lending, which has risen by 8.8%,while corporate lending has increased by 4.1%.1 A perspective on these figures can be obtained if weconsider them in relation to GDP. This gives a measure of whether lending is growing at a faster ratethan the economy as a whole, which provides us with an indication of whether imbalances are beingbuilt up.Corporate lending in relation to GDP has remained relatively constant over the last four years, and iscurrently far below the levels which prevailed at the end of the 1980s. The financial statementspresented by companies are also currently strong, which suggests good solvency. In this context, Iwould also like to point out that those companies within the “new economy” that are currently verymuch in the news and which show weak profitability finance themselves primarily via the risk capitalmarket and not via bank loans. This means that a possible downturn in this part of the corporate sectorshould only have limited direct effects on the banks.In terms of household lending, the situation is rather different. Lending to households has risenrelatively strongly over the last two years and currently amounts to over 40% of GDP. It is thereforeapproaching the levels we saw at the end of the 1980s. However, it should be stressed that households’interest expenses are currently lower due to the low interest rates. This rise in lending is also reflectedin the household debt ratio, i.e. debts in relation to disposable income, which has risen and which nowamounts to 104%.Households are borrowing to an increasing extent, at the same time as their economic situation hasimproved as a result of rising disposable incomes and falling unemployment. Households havetraditionally borrowed mostly for housing, and the current increase in this type of lending is perhapsnot so surprising in view of the fact that housing prices in metropolitan areas have risen relativelysignificantly. What is more remarkable is that lending for other purposes is increasing at a higher rate.It is difficult to see from the statistics exactly how the borrowed money is used, but lending both frombanks and finance companies is now growing at a faster rate than lending from mortgage institutions.This has given rise to apprehensions that households are borrowing for consumption or in order toinvest in shares, which could lead to rapid increased risks. In order to gain a better understanding ofwhether or not this is the case, the Financial Supervisory Authority has recently commenced anexamination of the banks’ lending to the household sector.1Excluding repos.
3BIS Review 50/2000There are several reasons why property prices play a central role in any discussion of financialstability. In addition to the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that the credit demand among households islargely governed by the demand for and price level of property, property can also be used as collateralfor loans. Another reason for monitoring the property sector is that a large part of the banks’ lending isto property companies. These companies also accounted for a large part of the loan losses during thebanking crisis in the early 1990s.Property prices have risen recently, and in particular the prices of residential property in metropolitanregions. In contrast to the 1980s, we do not see the same broad price increase across the whole ofSweden, as was the case then. Likewise, the causes of the rising prices appear to be low interest rates,a high rate of new occupancies and low construction activity rather than speculation. This indicatesthat there are currently no major risks of a fall in residential property prices. However, there is everycause to observe developments carefully. New construction always takes place with a considerabletime lag and experience shows that many projects are not ready and do not come onto the market untilafter a turning point has occurred, at which point things can quickly deteriorate.With regard to commercial property, the development has been more moderate. Again, it is mainly inthe metropolitan areas that prices have risen due to high demand. The level of new constructioncontinues to be low and most premises today are already leased before building commences.One way of analysing the extent to which speculative tendencies are inherent in property prices is toplace the direct yield in relation to risk-free interest.2 At the end of the 1980s, the risk-free interest ratewas considerably higher than the direct yield on properties, which suggests that people boughtproperties on the expectation of future price rises and/or significant rent increases. Today, the situationis different. Direct yield levels appear reasonable in relation to risk-free interest. With regard toapartment buildings in Stockholm, the direct yield is lower than the risk-free interest, but at the sametime prices are affected by the fact that most property deals are made in connection with convertingapartment buildings to tenant-owned apartments. For these types of transactions, direct yield cannot beused as a measure since the tenant-owners association does not have a required return comparable tothat for an owner of a rental property.The financial statements presented by property companies are also considerably stronger today thanwhat they were ten years ago. The risks associated with lending to this sector by the banks appear tobe considerably lower than then. Among listed property companies, it seems as though many considerthat the level of indebtedness has become too low, considering the extensive interest in buying backshares within the sector. At the same time as buying back shares can lead to a higher return on equity,there is reason for companies and their credit granters to observe the risks associated with higherindebtedness. Above all, the companies can become extremely sensitive to changes in interest rates.An overall assessment of the credit situation in Sweden thus suggests that there is greater cause to bepleased that lending is growing as an integral part of the current economic upturn than to worry aboutthe risks which may accumulate. However, an integral part of the Riksbank’s role is to remind aboutchanges that can occur both rapidly and unexpectedly.What is the situation in other countries?Getting back to the credit expansion in the household sector, the development we see in Sweden todayis not unique. The American economy has been the subject of much recent discussion. A growingnumber of voices have warned that the risks have been built up into something of a financial bubble.The apprehensions derive from highly inflated asset values, low saving and increased indebtedness,i.e. in principle, a similar situation to the one we currently have in Sweden. Total lending by Americanbanks increased in March by 10.1% compared with March 1999 and lending in relation to GDP iscurrently at a historically high level. The lending statistics show that the primary increase is in lending2For example, a 5-year government bond.
BIS Review 50/20004for housing, due to rising property prices. At the same time as lending is increasing, saving isdeclining. Over the last five years, saving as a proportion of disposable income has fallen by nearly 5percentage points and amounted to a low 2% during the last quarter of 1999. Sweden has shown asimilar development. During the last five years, the saving ratio has fallen by over 9 percentage pointsand is currently at 2%. There are thus several signs of a development that is worrying from the view offinancial stability. The rising debt ratio has without a doubt made households more vulnerable.However, as in Sweden, employment and households’ financial assets have increased, which favoursthe households’ ability to pay.Another example is the Netherlands which, like Sweden, is normally characterised as a small, openeconomy. Even there, worrying signals similar to those in the Swedish and American economies canbe perceived. The improved economic activity has led to falling unemployment and rising asset prices.During the last two years, total lending has risen at an annual rate of around 15%. In the Netherlandstoo, a large part of this rise in lending can be explained by rising prices, especially house prices. Dutchhouse prices rose on average 15.8% during 1999. As a comparison, it can be mentioned that Swedishhouse prices rose by approximately 8% during the same period (prices for tenant-owned apartmentsrose to a considerably higher extent, however). In the Netherlands, household indebtedness in relationto GDP has traditionally been low, but has risen dramatically in recent years and today amounts toalmost 45% of GDP.If we compare the developments in Sweden, the USA and the Netherlands, we see Dutch propertyprices have risen considerably faster than Swedish and American prices both in real and nominalterms. In this context, the development in Sweden appears to be less sensational.What can the Riksbank do if the build-up of risk increases?An increasing level of indebtedness in the economy, combined with rising asset prices, involvesgreater vulnerability to changes in the macroeconomic environment, i.e. growing risks. The obviousquestion then, is what the authorities can do to prevent such a build-up of risk. The Riksbank discussesa number of possible measures in its latest Financial Stability Report. Firstly, the Riksbank tries toinfluence developments by communicating our views on what is happening publicly and in the form ofa dialogue with the banks. The Financial Stability Report plays a central role in this context. TheRiksbank can in certain situations provide a more comprehensive picture of the risks than theindividual market players, as the latter attaches greater importance to evaluating developments in theirown portfolios.If the Riksbank believes that an unhealthy build-up of risk is occurring and our assessment has not hadthe intended influence on the individual market players, there are other measures that the Riksbank cantake. In extreme cases, quantitative regulations may be introduced, such as raised required capitaladequacy ratios or a reserve requirement. Nor can an increase in the repo rate be ruled out if financialstability is threatened. However, these are more far-reaching measures and would only be used if thebuild-up of risk was assessed to constitute an acute problem. The assessment of the situation made bythe Riksbank and other authorities will always be marred by a large measure of uncertainty, as it isextremely difficult to evaluate how serious the build-up of risk actually is. If drastic measures are to betaken, the assessment must be based on a strong foundation.The development we can see today is, as I mentioned earlier, far from requiring any intervention. TheRiksbank’s assessment is that if the macroeconomic situation should worsen, it will lead to problemsfor individual households in meeting their payment obligations, but will hardly comprise a serious riskfor banks in general and therefore not threaten financial stability either. In this context it is importantto mention that the household sector normally accounts for a small percentage of loan losses, evenduring the banking crises. There is thus no reason in the current situation for the Riksbank to resort tospecial measures to intervene against the build-up of debt currently occurring in the household sector.When discussing the banks’ loan losses, I have alluded to the risk that households and companies willnot be able to pay their loans. Loan losses can also arise when the banks cannot meet the obligationsamong themselves. These risks are usually called counterparty and settlement risks. This type of risk
5BIS Review 50/2000arises in the banks’ trading and taking positions in the financial markets. As the major Swedish bankshave extensive commitments to one another and also to foreign banks, problems in one bank canrapidly spread to the others and cause problems throughout the entire financial system. Such a problemneed not be due to a bank being insolvent; it may be based on, for example, a failing computer systemor similar. The Riksbank has on several occasions pointed out that these individual exposures are agrowing problem from the point of view of stability. To overcome this problem, the Riksbank hasbegun a review of the regulations, together with the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.ConclusionIn the current situation there are great expectations that the future will bring economic growth andgood times. “The new economy” with a low inflation rate and high levels of employment and growthhas gradually crossed the Atlantic to reach us. In such times of strong confidence in the future,consumption and indebtedness increase, while saving declines. We have seen this happen many timesbefore. If the expectations are fulfilled, there is no problem. However, if the expectations race ahead ofeconomic developments, asset prices and indebtedness can develop in a way that causes imbalances. Ifthere is an economic downturn, households may find difficulty in meeting their payment obligations,which will lead to a rapid increase in saving, falling asset prices and a decline in demand. This is alsosomething we have seen in other contexts.While this development could give cause for concern, it is important not to paint an excessivelynegative picture. As the Riksbank has pointed out earlier, a decline in the macroeconomic situationwould probably lead to problems for individual households, but would hardly cause sufficient loanlosses to threaten the banks’ stability.However, there is every reason to be vigilant with regard to continued developments, particularly froma price stability perspective. Continued rising asset prices and credit expansion could risk leading tooverheating and thus rising inflation. An increase in the repo rate would in this case contribute both tocounteracting incipient inflation tendencies and to reducing the risk of financial imbalances, through adampening effect on demand for credit and on asset prices.
1BIS Review 50/2000Eddie George: A snapshot of developments in the global economySpeech by The Rt Hon Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s Dinnerfor Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, on 15 June 2000.*      *      *I spoke last year - somewhat hopefully, even optimistically for a central banker - about the still nascentglobal economic recovery from the Asian crisis and its aftermath. But, more characteristically, Iworried about the international imbalances affecting the major industrial countries, and the relatedimbalance within our own economy.The good news, my Lord Mayor, is that the global recovery has turned out to be rather stronger thanwe dared to hope a year ago. The world economy is currently growing at around its long-term trendrate - of 4% or rather more - and is expected to continue to grow close to that rate over the next coupleof years. Although global inflation has meanwhile so far remained generally subdued, monetary policyin the major industrial countries - which had been directed to stimulus during the period of sharpworld economic slowdown - has, to varying degrees, reverted to being less accommodating with theequally sharp recovery.The less good news is that the worrying international imbalances within and between the industrialcountries persisted through most of the past year - though just between you and me, my Lord Mayor,and so long as you don’t breath a word to the Chancellor, there is a glimmer of a suggestion - no morethan that - that those imbalances may now be becoming somewhat less worrying.In the United States evidence of a sustained improvement in the rate of productivity growth haspersisted. We, in this country, must fervently hope that the seeds of this technological modification areblown in our direction and find a receptive environment here. There is no obvious reason why weshould be immune from this highly desirable infection - though sadly the symptoms of contaminationare still hard to detect. In the meantime its supply-side effects in the United States imply that the USeconomy can sustain faster growth than seemed possible before, without necessarily overheating - atleast for a time and up to a point. But the same developments have also helped to raise the temperatureon the demand side of the US economy, and the Federal Reserve has been administering monetarysedatives at intervals throughout the past year. But finding exactly the right dosage, and the righttiming, to keep the body temperature near normal in present circumstances really does demand thewisdom of Solomon - or at least the wisdom of Greenspan. Notwithstanding some more encouragingrecent signs, there is still a possibility that continuing imbalance between domestic and externaldemand will need additional sedation or that it will eventually precipitate a sharp fall in the dollar andUS asset prices. But the dollar has come off its recent peak and some of the exuberance may now havegone from equity prices - including some of the froth from the “new economy” sector, so the risks ofsharp correction may be less than they were.Elsewhere, in Japan, after a long convalescence, there may now at last be some better prospect of agradual but self-sustaining recovery in private sector demand. And there has been more substantialevidence in recent months of strengthening domestic demand and output growth across the Eurozone.That fully justified the European Central Bank’s gradual shift away from its earlier accommodatingmonetary policy stance; it may also have contributed to the beginnings of a recovery of the euroexchange rate towards a more comprehensible level.We are certainly not yet out of the woods - there is a long way to go before anyone can feel confidentthat we are in fact in sight of a more sustainable balance between the major industrial economies. But Iam more hopeful that we are now at least moving in the right direction.And that is encouraging news for the UK.On a macro-economic overview, our own economy remains in pretty good shape. In the year to thefirst quarter total output grew by just over 3% while prices rose by 2.7% measured by the overall GDP
BIS Review 50/20002deflator or by 2.1% on the Chancellor’s RPIX target measure. That is the fifth time in the past sevenfiscal years that output growth has exceeded the rate of inflation.Since the recession of the early 1990s both output growth and inflation have averaged around 2¾%.The number of people in employment - as we saw from yesterday’s figures - is at an all time high. Therate of unemployment, on a claimant count basis is as low as it has been for 25 years. And interestrates over the past few years have been more stable and just about as low as anyone can remember.Now it’s true that there are uncertainties ahead - as there always are - which could make for a bumpierride. The welcome weakening of sterling - which had risen to quite unrealistic levels against theexaggeratedly weak euro - will tend to reverse the downwards pressure that it had previously beenexerting on retail prices. Domestic demand growth will need to moderate to compensate for that -although there are some tentative signs in the recent data that it may be beginning to do so. Thesustained tightness in the labour market could still put upwards pressure on earnings growth and paysettlements - though the latest data are somewhat reassuring for the time being. We can’t be confidentabout the effects in this country of the new economy - though we remain open-minded. Nor can we beconfident of either the extent or the likely persistence of what appear to be exceptional downwardpressures on retail margins. We don’t know for sure what is likely to happen to the oil price - and soon.We will - in the best central banking tradition - need to be eternally vigilant. But for all theuncertainties, the overall prospect for the economy as a whole over the next couple of years - in myview, but it is a view that I think is broadly shared by most of the other members of the MonetaryPolicy Committee, is for continuing steady growth, at or a bit above its longer-term trend, forcontinuing high employment, and for continuing low inflation at around the Chancellor’s target.And that, too, my Lord Mayor, is not a bad prospect either.Our problem - and it has been a persistent headache over the past two or three years, as I haverepeatedly tried to explain on earlier occasions - is the imbalance between the domestic sectors of theeconomy, which have by and large been doing pretty well, and those that are heavily internationallyexposed. Those sectors have had a tough time over the past few years - what with the global economicslowdown and particularly more recently with the seemingly remorseless rise of sterling against theeuro. That went well beyond constructive pressure to improve efficiency to destructive agony. We’vebeen only too well aware of that - we could hardly not have been; and we’ve not been insensitive to iteither. We have consistently taken account of the unexpectedly persistent strength of the exchange ratein both our forecasts and in our monetary policy judgements. But when you come right down to it, foras long as economic conditions between one country and another diverge, whether for cyclical orstructural reasons, there is a choice. Countries can either aim to stabilise their respective domesticeconomies, accepting that that may mean exchange rate volatility, or they can aim to maintainexchange rate stability, accepting that that may destabilise their respective domestic economies. Theseare the horns of the uncomfortable dilemma we have been on.I have no doubt, in terms of the macro-economy as a whole, that we have been right to persist inaiming to stabilise our domestic economy - the facts speak for themselves. It is possible - even perhapslikely - that our dilemma may now become less acute, at least for a time as the euro strengthens to amore sustainable level. Our best chance of maintaining that happier position - if indeed it occurs - is topersist in domestic stabilisation and structural reform alongside our European partners, but it isdifficult to be confident at this stage that the dilemma will not re-emerge.
1BIS Review 49/2000Bank of Japan’s June report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 14 June 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s View2The improvement in Japan’s economy is becoming distinct. Recovery has been observed in someareas of private demand, with business fixed investment continuing to increase.With regard to exogenous demand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue to follow anupward trend due to steady developments in overseas economies, and public investment is picking upreflecting the progress in the implementation of the supplementary budget for fiscal 1999. As regardsdomestic private demand, housing investment is on a moderate declining trend, and the recovery inprivate consumption continues to be weak through lack of notable improvements in employment andincome conditions. Meanwhile, business fixed investment is increasing.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production is increasing, and corporateprofits and sentiment continue to improve. Firms as a whole still strongly feel that they have excesscapacity and employees, and that they should reduce their debts to restore financial soundness.Nevertheless, the number of firms that take positive action, such as increasing the amount of fixedinvestment, has been increasing, especially in high-growth sectors. Regarding employment conditions,although the decrease in the number of employees and in wages is slowing, efforts by firms to reducepersonnel expenses have prolonged the severity of households’ income conditions.As for the outlook, public investment is likely to increase for some time. This, along with thefavorable financial environment created partly by the Bank’s monetary easing, is expected to continueunderpinning the economy. Moreover, net exports are likely to follow an upward trend reflecting therecovery of overseas economies, and it is also highly probable that business fixed investment willincrease gradually with an improvement in corporate profits and sentiment. However, housinginvestment is expected to decline for the time being. While there seems to be no substantial change infirms’ stance to reduce personnel expenses, an improvement in households’ income conditions, whichshould support private consumption, is likely to be moderate at the most. In addition, since firms’prospects for sales remain modest, careful monitoring is still required to determine whether therecovery in business fixed investment is sustainable and whether it is likely to spread to a wider rangeof industries.With regard to prices, import prices are decreasing slightly, reflecting a temporary decline ininternational commodity prices such as crude oil prices. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstandingthe fall in prices of electric machinery, are unchanged mainly due to the rise in prices of petroleum andchemical products reflecting the increase in crude oil prices to date. Meanwhile, consumer pricescontinue to be somewhat weak owing to the slight decrease in the prices of private-sector services andthe decline in prices of imported products reflecting the past appreciation of the yen. Corporate serviceprices are still falling slowly.As for the outlook, upward pressure on prices is likely to arise from the gradual improvement indomestic supply-demand balance and from the rise in crude oil prices. On the other hand, downward1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 12 June 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 12 June 2000 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 49/20002pressure is expected from the long-term declining trend of machinery prices due to technologicalinnovations and from the fall in prices of imported products reflecting the past appreciation of the yen.On balance, overall prices are likely to remain unchanged. However, attention should still be paid tothe downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand, although the pressure has weakenedgiven some recovery in private demand.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has generally stayed near zero, and financial institutionshave been confident about the availability of overnight funds. The amount of funds outstanding in thecall money market is declining gradually.Interest rates on term instruments basically continue to be stable but have increased somewhat fromthe start of June. The Japan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds have been moving in the range of 1.6-1.8 percent. The yieldspread between private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds remainsmostly unchanged.Stock prices fell sharply until the end of May triggered by the drop in U.S. stocks but have recoveredthereafter.In the foreign exchange market, the yen temporarily rose to around 110 yen in mid-May but thenstrengthened against the U.S. dollar. The yen is currently being traded in the range of 105-107 yen.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Given this, major banks are becoming more active in extending loans,while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is increasing in parallel with a recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result, creditdemand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish. Issuance of corporatebonds and CP has been steady.Money stock (M2 + CDs) grew slower in May compared with the previous month on a year-on-yearbasis.In this financial environment, corporate financing conditions are easing, and the lending attitude offinancial institutions is perceived by firms as less severe. It continues to warrant careful monitoringhow these favorable developments in corporate financing environment will affect economic activities.
1BIS Review 49/2000Eddie George: Financial stability and the City -the evolving role of the Bank of EnglandSpeech by The Rt Hon Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, at the London Chamber ofCommerce Conference, held in London, on 13 June 2000.*      *      *Thank you, Chairman. I’m pleased to take part in this Conference, and to share the platform thismorning with Gavin, but also with Howard Davies my long-standing partner in crime - or perhaps Ishould say in crime prevention.You ask me to talk about the evolving role of the Bank of England, in relation to financial stability inparticular, which I’m happy to do. In fact it is rather easier to talk confidently about our role these dayssince it is now more clearly defined.A remarkable thing about the earlier legislation - the 1946 Bank of England Act - was that it made nomention of the Bank’s essential “raisons d’être” - what we were there to do. It seems to have beentaken for granted that everyone knew what our role was. But about a decade ago we decided to defineour core purposes more precisely for ourselves, primarily for internal management reasons. Weidentified three core purposes.The first two:–the maintenance of monetary stability; and–the maintenance of the stability of the financial system are key objectives of central bankspretty well everywhere.Our third core purpose - the promotion of the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial system inserving the interests of the wider economy - was more unusual for a central bank, but arose from along-standing tradition of catalytic involvement in the development of our financial system, including,in its international dimension in particular, encouragement of the role of the City.These three core purposes have been essentially carried over into the new statutory frameworkintroduced through the Bank of England Act of 1998. There are certainly some very important changesin the more precise nature of the Bank’s role. In relation to monetary stability, the Bank, through itsnew Monetary Policy Committee, now has independent responsibility for the operation of monetarypolicy and for achieving consistently low inflation as defined by the Chancellor. And in relation tofinancial stability, responsibility for banking supervision has passed from the Bank to Howard at theFSA - which helps to explain why I have retained more of my hair ... than ... I might otherwise havedone!But, notwithstanding these important changes, our core purposes remain.The Memorandum of Understanding between the Treasury, the Bank and the FSA, in particulardefines our respective responsibilities in relation to financial stability and provides a structure for thenecessary close cooperation between us.In the terms of the MOU the Bank is responsible for the overall stability of the financial system as awhole. The MOU implicitly recognises the inter-relationship between monetary and broader financialstability, which is fundamentally important: just as we could not hope to deliver monetary stability ifthe financial system was crashing around our ears, so, too, monetary stability is a very necessary -though in itself still insufficient - condition for stability of the financial system. Specifically the MOUrecognises the Bank’s role - as the bankers’ bank - at the heart of the payments system; and itrecognises our capacity, in exceptional situations and subject to override by the Chancellor, to act aslender of last resort in order to limit systemic damage. The MOU acknowledges more broadly theBank’s oversight role which enables us to advise on the financial stability implications of
BIS Review 49/20002developments in domestic and international markets and payments systems; and it acknowledgesfinally also our role in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial sector, withparticular regard to international competitiveness, but which can also contribute to the robustness ofthe financial system.In the context of the UK’s highly developed and increasingly integrated financial services industry, inwhich distinctions between banks, building societies, investment intermediaries, insurance companiesand so on have been becoming increasingly blurred, the argument for moving away from a fragmentedsupervisory and regulatory structure, in which banks were separately regulated, was compelling - andHoward and his team have done a tremendous job in bringing all the different strands of financialservices regulation together under the FSA umbrella seamlessly and in a relatively short space of time.A potential downside from the Bank of England’s perspective was the possible loss of informationfrom, or contact with, the banking sector which might reduce our capacity to exercise ourresponsibility for the stability of the financial system as a whole.Now of course it is early days to begin to assess the new arrangements from this perspective. It is truethat we have not had any serious threats to financial stability in this country over the past three years,but I suppose that putting that down to the new structure would be a bit like the man who claimed thatthe absence of pink elephants in Hyde Park was the direct result of his clicking his fingers there on hisregular morning walks. We really haven’t been tested.All I can say is that I am encouraged by the close cooperation between the Bank and the FSA which Iam confident we can build upon, enabling us to withstand the strain when the first pink elephant issighted!The Standing Committee of the Treasury, Bank and FSA has met each month over the past couple ofyears. Cross-membership of our respective Bank and FSA boards is firmly established. Howard and Imeet regularly together. And most fundamentally our respective staff are in more or less continuouscontact at working level - it is a culture that we must continue to work together to maintain. To behonest I have felt as closely in touch with significant developments, even in the banking sector, as Idid before and perhaps better informed about developments in the financial system more widely. Inpart this is because, without day by day responsibility for banking supervision, particularly itsconsumer protection dimension, the Bank has been able to refocus on and develop its wider oversightrole, focusing particularly on strengthening the market infrastructure, intensifying our surveillance andcrisis management, both nationally and internationally.I think perhaps you can get the flavour of our broader focus if you look at our half-yearly publication -the Financial Stability Review. The next edition is due out in a fortnight or so, and I’m sure that myoffice would be happy to make it available to you for a small commission - or you can download itfree from our website.So, Chairman, although Howard took with him responsibility for banking supervision, and some 20%of our staff, to the FSA, the Bank’s essential concern with, and responsibility for, the stability of thefinancial system as a whole - and its role in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the financialsector, including the promotion of the City - remain much as they were. What has more clearlychanged over the past few years is the external environment within which we pursue these tasks. Andin my remaining remarks I should like to comment on three particular developments - the introductionof the euro, the impact of information technology, and continuing broader financial globalisation -which have increasingly preoccupied the Bank in our work in these areas.First, the euro. Whether the UK is in or out of the euro, the Bank has a keen interest in its success as awidely used trading and investment currency - for the contribution that can make to financial stability,to financial sector efficiency, and to financial activity here in the City.Well before its introduction, the Bank played an active role in coordinating the City’s technicalpreparation for the euro, and in encouraging the City’s professional institutions to work with theEuropean Commission and the ECB in developing the necessary legal and technical framework. TheCity’s contribution to the successful introduction of the euro is widely acknowledged on the
3BIS Review 49/2000Continent. And the City has continued to play a very active part in developing market activity in thenew currency ever since. In many respects the City is already an integral part of the Eurozone.There were those who argued that the City would suffer if the UK failed to join from the outset. Thatclearly has not so far happened - quite the reverse. The argument now is that we will suffer if we don’tjoin reasonably soon. That’s not something you can actually prove either way. It’s not a general pointabout the City’s competitiveness. It’s euro-specific, with the implication that somehow or otherobstacles will be put in our way. That possibility cannot be altogether excluded, but it would beillogical. Most of the people that I talk with recognise the positive contribution the City is making tothe development of euro financial markets - it is in fact the most positive contribution that we canmake from the outside. Of course it represents competition with other European financial centres, butat the macro-economic level such competition is a positive - not a zero - sum game from whichborrowers and lenders and market intermediaries collectively all stand to gain. Certainly the City hasbenefited from the euro’s introduction, but not at the expense of other centres, rather alongside them.Against that background the Bank is continuing to work constructively with the ECB though itsmembership of the General Council, while at the same time we are working with the Government andthe financial sector to ensure that we are technically prepared for transition to the euro if and when thatis what the Government, Parliament and the people of this country decide.The build-up to the euro roughly coincided with the accelerating advance of information andcommunications technology that is sweeping across the global economy.This development, too, can give rise to technical concerns - the Bank and FSA cooperated, forexample, in helping to ensure that the financial sector was properly prepared to combat theMillennium bug. But its ramifications go very much wider.We are having to monitor very closely the potential impact of the “new economy” on productivitygrowth and what that may mean for monetary stability; and we are having to keep a very close eye onfinancial market volatility as investors struggle to assess its impact on relative stock values for itseffect on financial stability.In the financial sector in particular the new technology is perhaps the main driver of innovation andchange. It makes possible the introduction of new services and products, and is radically altering theway in which existing services are delivered - often at a fraction of the initial cost and, potentially, atlower risk. In wholesale markets it has the capacity to change fundamentally the relationships betweenend-users, intermediaries and organised exchanges by affecting the whole spectrum of activity fromtrading through clearing to payment and settlement, across the whole range of financial instrumentsand across national boundaries - not just within Europe which was until recently the immediate focusof attention, but much more widely internationally.Beyond a general evolution towards international consolidation of trading activity and parallel, thoughnot necessarily coincident, consolidation of clearing and settlement, it is not at all clear preciselywhere all this is taking us - just where the end point is or what the stepping stones are that will get usthere. But it is clear that standing aside is not an option. That’s why we are seeing such a proliferationof initiatives as the various market participants feel their way ahead. It is in that context that I welcomethe iX initiative which Gavin has described to us this morning. The process of integration will involvea huge cooperative effort on the part of market participants, but it will also involve active cross-bordercooperation between the relevant financial regulators and central banks. Our role is not to determinethe way ahead, but to facilitate the steps that the markets themselves decide upon, consistently withour public policy concerns. The prize - of greater market efficiency and liquidity and of more effectiveinternational allocation of financial resources - is immense. I have no doubt at all that the City has theprofessional and technical capacity, and the self-confidence, to make a major contribution to thisprocess.Let me touch, finally, Chairman, on financial globalisation more generally. As we have seen, theincreasingly free flow of capital internationally has the capacity to contribute massively to theexpansion of the world economy; but it can become distorted, with the risk of destructive volatility,which in turn can pose a significant threat to financial stability on a world-wide basis. Since thesudden onset of the Asia crisis some three years ago with its global repercussions there has been a
BIS Review 49/20004huge international effort to reduce the risk of volatility. This has involved drawing up codes of bestpractice - covering everything from fiscal and monetary prudence, external balance sheet and liquiditymanagement and greater transparency, to increased financial regulation as well as higher legal,accounting and corporate governance standards - which national governments particularly in capitalimporting countries, are being encouraged to apply. It has involved extensive and ongoing reviews ofthe financial infrastructure and regulatory practice also in creditor countries. And it has involved acontinuing review of the role of the international financial institutions in preventing and managinginternational debt crises. The Bank has been very intensively engaged in much of this work - with theTreasury in the G7, the G10, the new G20 and the IMF, with both the Treasury and the FSA in thenew Financial Stability Forum; with the FSA also in the Basel Committee; and with our central bankcounterparts in both the BIS and the ECB.All of this, too, points to the critical importance of coordination and cooperation, nationally betweenthe Treasury, the Bank and the FSA, but also to an ever increasing degree with our various interestedcounterparts abroad. And in this context, given the international importance of the City, we, togetherwith the FSA, have a particular role to play in engaging the private sector financial community in theconsultation process: we have a common interest in the outcome.All of these developments, Chairman, pose major challenges both for market participants and for theauthorities. But, for the markets at least, with major challenges come major opportunities. Our job is tohelp the markets take advantage of those opportunities by providing a stable and orderly financialenvironment within which markets can function more effectively. It is very much in the interests of theCity that we should succeed. We - like you - have plenty to do.
1BIS Review 48/2000Laurence H Meyer: The New Economy meets demandSpeech by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Governor of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Boston Economics Club, Boston, on 6 June 2000.*      *      *I often draw the themes for my talks from the questions I hear about the intersection of the economicoutlook and monetary policy. This evening, I begin with two questions that are central to theeconomy’s prospects and the challenges facing monetary policy. First, Is there a new economy? Andsecond, What role, if any, do traditional economic principles, specifically the role of supply anddemand, continue to play in today’s economy?Before I proceed to those questions, I want to emphasize why the answers matter. It almost - and I say,almost - goes without saying. Nevertheless, I can’t stress too often that we care about the balance ofsupply and demand in the economy because we care about promoting both full employment and pricestability and, thereby, maximum sustainable growth. We want to contain inflation because doing sohas been crucial for sustaining the economic expansion that we now enjoy and for providing anenvironment conducive to private decision-making and longer-term planning so critical for takingadvantage of new technological opportunities. Containing inflation has, I am sure, contributed to thelength and strength of the economic expansion we now enjoy - an expansion, by the way, that is thelongest in our nation’s history. And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have wasdearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil Warand the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.Precisely because inflation is the critical issue that hangs in the balance of new economy possibilitiesand old economy regularities, I will offer some observations on how I read the recent data on laborcompensation and price inflation. My comments are in the spirit of inflation reports that many centralbanks with explicit inflation targets regularly issue.Before proceeding, let me remind you that the views expressed on the outlook and on monetary policyare my own. I am not speaking on behalf of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open MarketCommittee.Is there a New Economy?So, is there a “new economy”? The answer is: it depends. It depends on how you define new economy,and it depends on where you live.There are broader and narrower definitions of the new economy. The narrow version defines the neweconomy in terms of two principal developments: first, an increase in the economy’s maximumsustainable growth rate and, second, the spread and increasing importance of information andcommunications technology. The latter is presumably the major contributor to the acceleration in laborproductivity that, in turn, is the principal source of the increase in trend growth in real GDP. A third,and perhaps related, development is a possible increase in the economy’s sustainable utilization rates,specifically a decline in the non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).Our laboratory for the new economy is the United States, given that there is very little evidenceoutside the United States for even this narrow definition of the new economy. In the case of the UnitedStates, however, there is little doubt that the underlying rate of productivity growth has increasedsignificantly in the second half of the 1990s.From 1974 to 1995, labor productivity advanced at about an annual rate of 1½%. Productivity thenaccelerated to a rate of about 2½% in the second half of the 1990s. This acceleration appears to havebeen spread out over the second half of the 1990s, so that the average rate over that period understatesthe rate of productivity growth at the end of the period.
BIS Review 48/20002Productivity typically grows faster than its longer-term trend when GDP growth is rising and fallsbelow trend when GDP decelerates. This pattern simply reflects lags in adjusting employment tochanges in GDP growth. Measuring productivity growth over a long period, such as 1974 to 1995,effectively eliminates this shorter-run component of productivity growth. And because GDP growthwas relatively stable during the second half of the 1990s, shorter-run dynamics appear not to havebeen an important contributor to the higher productivity growth in that period. Moreover, carefuleconometric attempts to isolate the short-run dynamic and longer-run structural components generallyhave concluded that structural productivity growth increased from about 1½% in the earlier periods toaround 2½% to 3% by the end of the decade. That would put the sustainable rate of GDP growth up to3½% to 4%.Still there is considerable uncertainty about trend productivity growth, including whether it might beaccelerating, especially given the brief period over which higher and rising structural productivitygrowth has been experienced. Important questions about the measurement of productivity aggravatethis uncertainty.And there is also considerable uncertainty about how long the higher productivity growth will persist.For example, periods of more rapid productivity growth might be best understood as a transition to ahigher level of productivity that is based on major technological developments. The persistencequestion is more important for assessing longer-run fiscal prospects - including the solvency of SocialSecurity - than to monetary policy decisions that are made in the context of a one to two year period.Using the neoclassical model, and disaggregating capital into information and communicationstechnology and other capital, Dan Sichel and Steve Oliner of the Board staff decomposed productivitygrowth into contributions from capital deepening (the growth arising from an increase in the ratio ofcapital to labor) and multifactor productivity growth (the growth in output that cannot be accountedfor by increases in labor and capital inputs) and into the contributions from the use of informationtechnology and from increased efficiency in the production of computers. According to their estimates,a bit less than half of the productivity acceleration was due to a pickup in capital deepening and a bitmore than half to an increase in multifactor productivity growth. More than 90% of capital deepeningcame from information and communications technology equipment, and nearly 40% of the increase inmultifactor productivity growth came from increased efficiency in the production of computers andembedded semiconductors. Altogether, therefore, information and communications technologyaccounted for slightly more than two-thirds of the increase in productivity.1Besides the direct effects of information and communications technology through capital deepeningand the more efficient production of computers, this technology may also indirectly raise productivitythrough spillover effects. If the use of information and communications technology generatesexternalities throughout the economy - for example, through new efficiencies from e-commerce - theoverall efficiency in production will increase. In a traditional growth accounting setup, these effectswould show up in multifactor productivity growth. Evidence of spillovers is extremely sparse. Someback-of-the-envelope calculations by Oliner and Sichel suggest that such effects have been quite smallto date, though the explosive growth of e-commerce, particularly in the business-to-business segment,suggests a potential for a more important contribution over time.But do these developments - specifically higher trend productivity growth and the spread ofinformation and communications technology - alone justify the “new economy” label? We could, forexample, explain recent US economic performance in terms of “new parameters in the old paradigm”.1For papers on recent productivity performance and attempts to separate cyclical and trend components and the role ofcapital deepening and multifactor productivity, and to measure the contribution from information and communicationstechnology, see Robert J Gordon, “Does the New Economy Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past,” Journal ofEconomic Perspectives (forthcoming); Dale W Jorgenson and Kevin J Stiroh, “Raising the Speed Limit: US EconomicGrowth in the Information Age,” 1 May 2000; Macroeconomic Advisers, “Productivity and Potential GDP in the ‘New’US Economy,” September 1999; and Stephen D Oliner, and Daniel E Sichel, “The Resurgence of Growth in the Late1990s: Is Information Technology the Story?” working paper, Federal Reserve Board, February 2000.
3BIS Review 48/2000Specifically, we could increase the estimate of trend productivity growth, based on higher multifactorproductivity and capital deepening - both due in large part to information and communicationstechnology - and have a fairly good explanation of the remarkable performance of the US economy.This approach would explain the recent productivity performance without denying the continuedrelevance of old economy regularities, including the role of supply and demand imbalances as a sourceof inflation dynamics.The alternative - and the broader interpretation that often seems to underlie the new economy label - isthat we are witnessing a more fundamental change in the paradigm. The old rules no longer apply.Throw out the NAIRU. Heck, throw out supply and demand. No limits, no business cycles. All right,this is a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point that I am not especially partial to the broaderinterpretation of the new economy concept!Still, to be fair, there are other potential and perhaps more far-reaching implications of the spread ofinformation and communications technology, including the role of the Internet and e-commerce.Today, these are, in my view, best expressed as questions about future prospects rather than asprinciples underlying the present economy. For example, do these developments increase thecompetitiveness of markets, and, if so, how does this affect inflation dynamics? They appear toincrease the speed and effectiveness of price discovery. What does this imply for pricing leverage andinflation dynamics? Do they contribute to a permanent increase in sustainable utilization rates, perhapsby increasing the efficiency of the matching of available workers with available jobs? Do they result inrapidly growing sectors dominated by increasing returns to scale, where increases in demand lowercost and hence prices? These are all provocative and important questions, but none of thesedevelopments, in my view, are powerful enough at this moment to support the notion that labor andother utilization rates can rise ever higher without triggering accelerating prices - the broader versionof the “new economy”.So, is there a new economy? As I said, it depends. For my part, I accept the proposition that there hasbeen a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth in the United States, that it is veryclosely tied to improvements in information and communications technology, and that it is likely tospread around the world. But I resist the new economy label because it seems to encourage adisrespect for the old rules that could seriously undermine our success in taking advantage of the newopportunities. This brings me to my second topic.Welcome back supply and demandI was startled by the bold title of an article that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on 31 December1999: “So Long, Supply and Demand”. But it illustrates the unbounded optimism - some might evencall it irrational exuberance - about economic prospects and a willingness to abandon time-testedeconomic principles that offer cautions and imply constraints on economic opportunities.I was rather certain that confidence in supply and demand would make a comeback, and so I wasdelighted to see the front-page story in The Wall Street Journal on 16 May 2000 - the day of the lastFOMC meeting. The title this time was “Firms Start Raising Prices, Stirring Fears of InflationFighters,” and it began: “Even in the new economy, at least one old rule still applies: if demandexceeds supply for long enough, sellers will raise prices.” So let me count the ways that supply anddemand help us to understand the recent experience and the challenges facing monetary policy today.First, a productivity shock affects aggregate demand as well as potential supply and may initially havean even larger effect on demand than on supply. In early discussions about the productivity shock, theemphasis was, not surprisingly, exclusively on its supply-side implications - specifically a faster rateof productivity growth and hence of sustainable GDP growth. The natural corollary seemed to be thata faster growth of supply than of demand would be a powerful disinflationary force.But during the period over which productivity has accelerated, demand has grown faster than potentialsupply. The demand effects - to the extent that they are directly related to the productivity shock -likely reflect the more favorable investment opportunities, the effect of expected profitability on equityprices and hence household wealth and consumption, and the effect of the increase in expected future
BIS Review 48/20004labor income on current consumption. Demand, it appears, received an additional boost over thisperiod from a run-up in equity prices that the higher productivity growth alone could not fully accountfor.The balance between supply and demand can be inferred from movements in utilization rates,specifically in the unemployment rate. When actual output is expanding at the same pace as potential,the unemployment rate will be stable. When output growth outpaces the growth of potential, theunemployment rate declines. And the unemployment rate has declined almost 0.4 percentage points ayear for the past four years. This translates into excess demand growth of 0.75 to 1 percentage pointrelative to potential supply growth.The second insight - and enduring old economy wisdom - is that a proximate source of changes ininflation is an imbalance between the levels of aggregate supply and aggregate demand. This can beexpressed as an imbalance between actual and potential output or as a divergence of theunemployment rate from the NAIRU. The imbalance between the growth rates of aggregate supplyand demand is, of course, the source of changes in the balance between the levels of aggregate demandand supply. But inflation is related directly to the levels not to the growth imbalance. And, even in thenew economy, excess aggregate demand ultimately drives up inflation. Thus the limits may havechanged, but the consequences of overtaxing the limits remain the same.Do we have excess aggregate demand? In my judgment, we have excess demand conditions in thelabor market. The central tendency for my estimate of the NAIRU is in the range of 5% to 5¼%,compared to the 4.1% current unemployment rate. This estimate is consistent with most large-scalemacroeconometric models and with the estimates of the NAIRU that underlie the economic andbudget projections of both the Council of Economic Advisers and the Congressional Budget Office,but there is nonetheless legitimate uncertainty about the estimate of the NAIRU. This uncertainty hasbeen, in my view, an important consideration in the way monetary policy has responded to recenteconomic developments. Obviously, whether the NAIRU is closer to 4% or to 5% affects the difficultyassociated with rebalancing supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.But why has inflation remained moderate if there is persistent excess demand in the labor market?This is still another supply and demand story. The economy is subject to two fundamental types ofaggregate economic shocks: supply shocks and demand shocks. These two types of shocks give rise todifferent challenges for monetary policy.Supply shocks come in two varieties: relative price shocks (such as changes in the relative price of oil)and productivity shocks. Earlier in this episode, the economy benefited from a series of favorablerelative price shocks and, throughout the last several years, has been adjusting to an increase inproductivity growth. Both of these developments have had a temporary disinflationary effect. Togetherthey suppressed inflation for a while, countering the potential inflationary consequences of theprogressive increase in aggregate demand relative to potential supply. Once the disinflationaryimpetus from supply shocks begins to dissipate or to reverse, the inflationary consequences of thesupply-demand balance will begin to show through. The disinflationary effect of an increase inproductivity growth begins to dissipate once productivity growth stabilizes at a higher level. So unlessproductivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.When favorable supply shocks dominate, growth in demand is stimulated and utilization rates rise, butinflation tends to moderate. The result is offsetting implications for the setting of the nominal fundsrate and, thus, monetary policy may be left with little work to do. This accounts for the relativeinactivity of monetary policy from 1996 through the end of 1999, at which point the federal funds ratewas within 1/4 percentage point of where it was at the beginning of the period.But once the disinflationary effects of the favorable supply shocks dissipate or reverse, the challenge ismore like one that accompanies demand shocks. Excess demand, evidenced by utilization rates abovesustainable levels, will put upward pressure on inflation, and monetary policy must restrain aggregatedemand to bring it into balance with potential supply to avoid rising inflation.
5BIS Review 48/2000A brief inflation reportBut is there any evidence that inflation pressures are in fact building? Of course, overall inflation hasclearly increased significantly over the last year. The consumer price index, for example, has increasedat a 3% rate over the last twelve months, compared with a 2.3% rate over the previous twelve months.Similar trends are evident in the PCE and in the GDP price index. But this increase in overall inflationreflects mainly the rise in oil prices over 1999 and into 2000. Assuming that oil prices stabilize, theeffect will dissipate, and overall inflation will return toward, and indeed dip slightly below, the corerate (the rate net of food and energy prices). So, looking forward, the core inflation rate is the moreimportant consideration.The core CPI advanced at a 2.2% rate over the last twelve months, a rate equal to that over theprevious twelve months and only about 1/4 percentage point above the cyclical low reached inJanuary. These numbers suggest that inflation pressures remain well contained. But digging a littledeeper, the evidence, in my judgment, supports the conclusion that core inflation has moved modestlyhigher over the last six to nine months.First, the introduction of a methodological change in measuring the CPI in January 1999 lowered CPIinflation relative to the earlier period. As a result, on a methodologically consistent basis, core CPIinflation in the last twelve months has actually been up a couple tenths of a percentage point. But,more important, the higher-frequency data provides some evidence of a rising trend in core inflation.For example, at an annual rate, core CPI inflation is 2.4% over the last nine months, 2.5% over the lastsix months and 3.2% over the last three months. So I conclude that the underlying trend for core CPIinflation has moved up to close to 2½% today.The core PCE and the GDP price indexes also have accelerated over the last six to nine months. Thecore PCE index increased at a 1.4% rate over 1999. Over the last year the rate was 1.6%, over the lastsix months 1.9%, and over the last three months 2.4%.The higher core inflation could be explained by a pass-through to the core of earlier increases in oilprices. However, whether such a pass-through leads to a one-time increase in the price level or tocontinuing inflation depends on whether or not monetary policy accommodates the higher inflation.Whether such accommodation occurs, in turn, depends on how policy deals with the excess demandthat will be felt in the first instance in wage pressures in a very tight labor market.I therefore turn to an assessment of the pressures coming from labor compensation. Here the data areeven more confusing. For example, consider the trend in year-over-year growth rates for the three keymeasures. For the employment cost index, the trend is decidedly up; for average hourly earnings,however, the year-over-year growth rate has been flat; and for compensation per hour in theproductivity and costs report, the trend is actually down. Again, we need to dig a little deeper, but thisexcavation will not allow us to reach a definitive judgment from this extraordinarily mixed set ofindicators.Until the May employment report, the recent monthly data clearly pointed to an acceleration inaverage hourly earnings - given the 4½% rate posted over the first four months of the year after a 3½%rate over 1999. But the unexpectedly small increase in May left the year-over-year increase in averagehourly earnings at just 3.5%, about the same as over the previous twelve months. Year-to-date,average hourly earnings has increased at a 3.8% rate - still an acceleration, but one that is far lessdefinitive than that based on the data through April. There will be considerable interest in the nextreport for further evidence on the degree of upward trend in this measure.There are, in my judgment, some grounds for discounting the productivity and cost measure. Duringthe last benchmark revision, this measure was adjusted up sharply. I will have more confidence in therecent data for this measure of labor compensation if the deceleration remains intact after the nextrevision. In addition, this measure tends to use trends instead of real-time data for benefit costs -although the Bureau of Economic Analysis does adjust the trends judgmentally in response to thereal-time ECI data on benefit costs. Lately, the benefit component of the ECI has rebounded sharply.Even if the evidence for an acceleration in nominal labor compensation were more definitive, theimplications for inflation are not altogether straightforward. If the trend in the growth of labor
BIS Review 48/20006compensation is upward, it could be a response to the uptick in overall inflation last year or to overlytight labor markets or to a catch-up to the higher rate of productivity growth. Just as the slowing inoverall inflation in 1997 and 1998 contributed to a moderation in nominal wage demands, the higheroverall inflation in 1999 and 2000 would be expected to boost nominal wage demands. But anyrebound in nominal labor compensation could also reflect a catch-up to higher productivity growth. Ifnominal compensation is just matching the higher productivity growth, this source of acceleration innominal compensation would not itself be inflationary. But there is an important caveat here. The slowinitial response of nominal compensation to higher productivity growth is the source of the temporarydisinflationary effect of a productivity shock. Therefore, once the catch-up is under way, thisdisinflationary impetus gradually disappears. And at this point, the pass-through from higher inflationand the effect of tight labor markets have no offset and will begin to dominate. So even the catch-upstory plays a role in the upward trend in inflation.A second reason that nominal compensation is so difficult to factor into an inflation forecast is thatcompensation practices are changing. For example, our measurement has not caught up with theincreased importance of stock options. Stock options are incorporated, based on gains upon exercisingthe options, in the productivity and cost measure, but not in the ECI. In addition, many ways in whichfirms are recruiting and retaining workers - such as in-house fitness and child care centers, flexiblehours, educational assistance, on-site personal services, and in-kind payments - are not reflected incompensation measures (although hiring and referral bonuses will be included in the ECI in the nextrelease). Finally, the growing importance of variable pay and of temporary workers may haveimportant implications for wage dynamics that are not fully understood.So what is the outlook for inflation, and how does it relate to the interplay of new economy forces andtraditional supply and demand considerations? In my judgment, we took the benefits of both the earlierfavorable relative price shocks and the productivity shock, partly in a decline in the unemploymentrate below the NAIRU and partly in a decline in inflation. This is not a statement about whatpolicymakers planned, but rather about what evolved as we responded to unexpected developments ininflation and growth. At any rate, we could have taken more of the benefits of the favorable supplyshocks in lower inflation, but given that inflation was already so low, the combination we ended upwith seems, after the fact, to have been reasonable. At some point, however, when the temporarydisinflationary impetus of the favorable supply developments dissipate, not only will there be somerebound in inflation, but unless a transition is made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be arisk of a continuous upward movement in inflation. During that transition, at least some of the earlierdecline in core inflation will be reversed.To be sure, it has been difficult to be precise about both sustainable utilization rates and the path ofinflation because of uncertainties about the NAIRU and other aspects of inflation dynamics in a periodof significant structural change. But I believe the qualitative story that I have set out is the right one.Given our uncertainty about sustainable utilization rates and wage-price dynamics in the neweconomy, however, policy setting must remain flexible and responsive to new information about boththe supply and the demand sides of our economy.Conclusion: the challenge facing monetary policyThis analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge - rebalancing aggregate supply anddemand to contain the risk of higher inflation. I believe that we have been moving effectively to getthis job done. The major question in this respect is whether slowing the economy to trend alone willget the job done or whether we need a period of below-trend growth to unwind an imbalance betweenthe levels of aggregate demand and supply. If the task is only slowing the economy to trend - becausethe NAIRU turns out to be close to 4% - the task is not as challenging, and inflation will remain stablenear current levels. If the NAIRU turns out to be closer to 5%, then the task is more demanding, andgrowth will have to slow to below trend for a while, and inflation is likely to rise somewhat furtheruntil the rebalancing is complete. If successful, in either scenario, the payoff from monetary restraintwill be both to contain the risk of higher inflation and to extend the life of this remarkable expansion.
7BIS Review 48/2000Several considerations provide some optimism that the outcome will be a benign one - a soft asopposed to a hard landing. First, we are now in a high-growth rather than a low-growth economy.Even if we have to slow growth to below trend for a period, the resulting growth rate could remainwell above the average growth rate over the previous 25 years and still get the job done. Second,supply forces could smooth the transition. If oil prices have now at least peaked - and, better yet, ifthey decline at least modestly over the next year and a half, as suggested by expectations reflected infutures markets - the upward impetus to overall inflation from oil prices will dissipate or even reverse.In this case, overall inflation is likely to decline next year, and this decrease could help moderate therise in core inflation into the following year. Third, long-term inflation expectations remain firmlyanchored, reflecting considerable confidence that monetary policy will contain any threat of higherinflation. This should damp the rise in inflation in the short term. Fourth, monetary policy got a headstart on containing inflation by beginning to tighten last June, before the signs of building inflationpressures were evident. Fifth, the tighter monetary policy is now contributing to a less accommodativeset of financial conditions throughout the economy - including higher short- and long-term privateinterest rates, lower equity prices, a stronger dollar, and more stringent lending conditions at banks. Ifthese tighter financial conditions remain in place, we will have made significant progress inestablishing the foundation for slower growth.ReferencesGordon, Robert, J, “Does the New Economy Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past”, Journalof Economic Perspectives (forthcoming).Jorgenson, Dale W, and Kevin J Stiroh, “Raising the Speed Limit: US Economic Growth in theInformation Age”, 1 May 2000.Macroeconomic Advisers, “Productivity and Potential GDP in the ‘New’ US Economy”, September1999.Oliner, Stephen D, and Daniel E Sichel, “The Resurgence of Growth in the Late 1990s: Is InformationTechnology the Story?” working paper, Federal Reserve Board, February 2000.
1BIS Review 47/2000Laurence H Meyer: The challenges of global financial institution supervisionSpeech by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, International Banking Conference,held in Arlington, Virginia, on 31 May 20000.*      *      *Most of my long-time academic and business friends and acquaintances believe that Federal Reservegovernors spend virtually all their time in monk-like contemplation of economic projections andmonetary policy. Well, reality is certainly different. Most of my time is occupied by issues concerninginstitutions and markets, regulations and supervisory policy. In the process, I have learned that themost difficult and most under-appreciated job is yours - bank supervision. When times are good,bankers and policymakers don’t see the need for your services. In not-so-good times, they blame youfor not seeing problems soon enough.Adding to the supervisor’s problems is the increasing scale, scope, span of operation, and generalcomplexity of the largest banks operating in the United States - the “global financial institutions” ofmy title, or, as we call them at the Fed, large, complex banking organizations (LCBOs). These entitiesare becoming increasingly difficult to supervise and evaluate because of their complexity andopaqueness. The banking agencies have recognized this difficulty and each has developedmore-or-less special programs and approaches for the organizations it supervises.Let me underline that these observations are not intended to suggest that regional and communitybanks are unimportant. Rather, they are intended to convey that the modifications - recent and future -required in the supervision of those smaller banks are far fewer than those required for the LCBOs.The capital reforms being developed at Basel, for example, are really addressing developments atcomplex organizations, and the extent of changes at most other commercial banks in this country willbe, I think, quite modest.In the balance of my remarks today, I would like to discuss what I think are the major approaches thatwe should take in addressing the challenges of supervising the increasingly complex and large globalfinancial institutions.Internal ratingsFor the past decade or so supervisors have recognized that snapshots of the balance sheets of complexbanking organizations are not very helpful for supervisory evaluations. Positions just change toorapidly. Moreover, the complexity of positions implies a major commitment of time and supervisoryresources. Thus, all the banking agencies have adopted, in one form or another, an approach thatemphasizes careful analysis and evaluation of each bank’s internal risk management policies andprocedures, as well as transactions-testing of those policies and procedures.I suspect that a new, and I think evolutionary, supervisory vehicle - one that supplements theevaluation of risk-management systems - will soon be a required part of supervision for all of us. Irefer, of course, to the development, use, and application of internal credit-risk-rating systems bybanks. Systems for credit-risk rating in one form or another, are widely used by LCBOs for internalmanagement purposes. As they improve, these systems can increasingly be expected to figureprominently in our supervisory process. That dual use - for both management and supervision - is adramatic innovation, creating a link between bank management and supervisory standards that hasbeen needed for some time.Cutting-edge banks have already begun to classify their loan portfolios into risk classes of finer andfiner gradation and to use those classifications for internal capital allocations, for loan pricing, and fordetermination of loan loss reserves among other purposes. When the classification scheme is used for
BIS Review 47/20002internal capital allocations, a probability of default, as well as a loss rate from default, is calculated foreach loan. Regulatory agencies and central banks around the world are working on ways to use thissame information as the raw material for the development of a much more accurate regulatory capitalrequirement.The purpose of capital, I need not remind you, is to absorb unexpected losses. At least in principle, abank’s quantification of probabilities of default, and of loss rates given default, in combination withother information, allows both management and policymakers to determine how much capital isneeded to cover unexpected losses within a certain minimum probability. Indeed, I believe that aconsensus is developing among G10 countries around just such a use - that is to say, a capital accordin which the capital requirements for individual banks will vary with their individual credit riskprofiles, based increasingly on the bank’s own internal risk evaluations. To be sure, there remains theproblem of supervisory validation of these internal risk systems to ensure first, that the riskclassifications are objective and reliable and, second, that they are also used by management fordecisionmaking. No less critical is the tying of risk weights to internal risk classifications in such away as to minimize inconsistencies of capital treatment among banks that have similar risks. From thework I’ve seen, these problems look solvable, at least in stages.Getting the numbers right is both a science and an art - and is critical. If we simply create a few morerisk weights and buckets we will, I submit, have done no more than create new opportunities forcapital arbitrage. In short, we will simply continue to induce banks to retain their risky assets whentheir own internal capital allocations exceed the regulatory levels and to sell, securitize, and otherwiseshift off-balance-sheet those assets for which the regulatory capital requirement exceeds the economicrequirement. The net result is likely to be riskier and less transparent banks - quite the opposite ofwhat policymakers, supervisors, legislators and the public want.Regardless of what we do, and I cannot emphasize this enough, those banks on the frontier of riskmanagement, small in number now but increasing, will continue along their current path of ever moresophisticated use of internal risk classifications. And whenever regulatory capital differs fromeconomic capital by more than the cost of arbitrage, they will arbitrage. Another way of saying this isthat regardless of our actions, frontier banks will always attempt to manage their businesses to earncompetitive risk-adjusted rates of return on equity. Today, our capital regulation, with itsone-size-fits-all risk weight for loans, encourages banks to withdraw from low-risk credit markets, orto arbitrage, when regulatory capital requirements exceed levels consistent with an activity’sunderlying economic risk. Not only is this situation costly and inefficient for banks and theircustomers, but it also has become increasingly difficult for supervisors to assess the residual capitaladequacy of LCBOs, as relatively low risk assets have been removed from the banking book. That iswhy we need a new regulatory capital framework, and why it is so critical that both the bank and thesupervisor use capital weights that are as risk-sensitive as possible.Supervisors, of course, cannot simply take whatever banks are using in their internal riskclassifications. Indeed, some large banks are, surprisingly, behind the curve in developing their owninternal risk classifications. Their systems have too few categories, are based on insufficient historicaldata, have been subject to inadequate stress-testing, and are too simplistic. In mid-1999, the FederalReserve told these banking organizations that they should catch up, and we required our examiners toexplicitly evaluate these catch-up efforts in their examinations. I trust that these lagging bankingorganizations in their own self-interest will promptly revise their systems, both to meet comingrevisions in the regulatory capital system and to avoid the market’s criticism as information aboutmore institutions’ systems becomes better known to creditors of banking organizations.Market disciplineIndeed, harnessing the market to assist in the process is critical to supervising global financialinstitutions. Reality requires that we emphasize that even with improvement in risk classifications andmore accurate capital requirements, we have limited public-policy choices for large and complexorganizations. Choice 1: we can accept systemic risk as a cost of having large, global organizations inthe marketplace. Choice 2: in order to limit systemic risk, we can adopt very detailed regulation and
3BIS Review 47/2000supervision programs that include a growing list of prohibitions. Choice 3: we can rely more onmarket discipline to supplement capital reforms and can maintain a level of supervision similar to theone we have today. Given the choices, we simply must try market discipline - and its necessaryprerequisite, public disclosure.Large, complex banking organizations already rely heavily on funding from sources other than insureddepositors. These other creditors - including, but certainly not limited to, holders of subordinateddebentures - should anticipate that the failure of the organization would, in a financial restructuring bythe authorities, entail losses - at a minimum, significant haircuts. Fear of loss, if linked with theavailability of sufficient information so that creditors are able to determine a bank’s real risk profile,should in turn induce uninsured creditors to behave like those of any nonbanking business. That is,uninsured creditors could be expected to command risk premiums linked to the portfolio risks andother risks of the organization. Such risk premiums should, in turn, act both as curbs on the risk-takingbehavior of banking organizations and as supplementary signals to supervisors. But, if either effect isto materialize, the uninsured creditors must have both a credible fear of loss and the information aboutthe individual institution necessary to make judgments and decisions.As most of you are aware, late last month the Fed, in cooperation with the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency and the Security and Exchange Commission, set up a private-sector advisory group.Composed of senior executives of banking and securities firms, the advisory group is to review thestate of the art in public disclosure, to counsel us on best practices, and to suggest improvements inthose practices. The group’s report will be public. While I have no idea what will be in the report, it ismy hope and expectation that we will learn more about how to use market discipline both tostrengthen our banking system and to avoid additional regulation and supervision of global financialinstitutions. At the Federal Reserve, we plan, however, to require that at least the large, complexbanking organizations establish and implement a disclosure policy to provide stakeholders withinformation that can be used to evaluate the organization’s risk profile. Our examiners, as part of boththe holding company inspection and the state member bank examination, will review and evaluatesuch disclosures for their conformance to best practices and their contribution to stakeholders’understanding of their risk at that organization.We should all be aware that additional public disclosure is not a free good, especially if it works.Banks will find that additional market discipline constrains their options, and supervisors will beconcerned about creditors’ response to bad news. But both constrained options and swift marketpunishment are part of the desired effect of market discipline.SupervisionIf, and I underline “if”, (1) banking organizations develop working, verifiable, and reasonably accuratemethods of evaluating and categorizing credit risks (2) capital requirements are linked tightly to thoserisks (3) public disclosures induce realistic market discipline and (4) market, operational, and legalrisks are under control, then the direction for supervisors seems reasonably clear: to validate systems,policies, and procedures. Now, I have purposely set up a straw man so that we can all appreciate howmuch work remains to be done.Despite the many tasks that lie ahead, the path that I believe we are on will, I think, lead to supervisoryefforts that focus on a bank’s management information and risk-management systems and onproviding management with evaluations and criticisms designed to improve those systems. To be sure,transactions-testing will remain an important effort. But, critically, the safety and soundness of thebank will depend on how well its risk-management systems work, the judgment its managementbrings to bear in using those systems, and the effectiveness of market discipline. It will, I think,increasingly be the job of the supervisor of global financial organizations to evaluate and test systemsand to evaluate and criticize the accuracy and helpfulness of the information banks disclose about theirown risk profiles.
BIS Review 47/20004Internal systems and public disclosure, in short, are the real first line of defense. The only alternativefor the large and complex banking organization, as I have noted, is intrusiveness and detailedregulation, which would dramatically reduce flexibility and innovation in our banking system.We have, I believe, already started down the path I have described. Several problems remain to besolved. Any one of them could slow or even stop our progress. I have already mentioned the need todevelop procedures for validating risk classifications and for converting risk classifications into riskweights on an equitable basis across banks. The challenge of reaching a consensus at Basel is anotherobstacle. But whatever we develop, either here or on an international basis, we will be relying on thegood judgment and sophistication of the nation’s examiners and on their development of the skillsneeded to keep pace with the activities of banks operating in the United States.CooperationBut skill and good judgment are, unfortunately, not sufficient. For better or worse, supervisors andpolicymakers function in a multi-agency environment. We must cooperate across agencies if we aregoing to get the job done. Most global US banks are supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency. All bank and financial holding companies and some large banks are supervised by theFederal Reserve. Nothing in this structure was changed by the recently enacted Gramm-Leach-BlileyAct. The challenges of supervising large, complex banking organizations raise yet again the questionof how to make the supervisory structure mandated by the Congress work efficiently and in the publicinterest. All the parties, it seems to me, must work out relationships and operating norms that serve theobjective of safe, sound, and efficient financial markets. The implicit tensions among the regulatorsare a fact of life; goodwill and cooperation are required if we are to carry out the law.Before I proceed further, it might help if I spend a moment on the philosophy underlying umbrellasupervision and distinguish this supervisory approach from direct supervision of insured depositoryinstitutions.As you know, all large and sophisticated financial services companies manage their risks on aconsolidated basis, requiring, in turn, oversight of risk-taking by the consolidated entity. Theconsolidated, or umbrella, supervisor aims to keep the relevant regulators informed about overallrisk-taking and to identify and evaluate the myriad risks that extend throughout such diversified bankand financial holding companies in order to judge how the parts and the whole affect, or may affect,affiliated banks.To fulfill its responsibility, reaffirmed by the recent legislation, the Federal Reserve plans to focus onthe organization’s consolidated risk-management process and on overall capital adequacy. For the newfinancial holding companies, the consolidated capital issue is complicated by the affiliation of bankswith institutions that have their own financial regulator and capital regulation. We are in the process oftackling these issues, knowing that responsibility for ensuring adequate management processes andcontrol relies, in the first instance, with a bank’s management and its primary supervisor. As umbrellasupervisor, the Federal Reserve seeks to gain an overview of the organization’s activities and to detectpotential threats to affiliated US depository institutions.The role of a financial and bank holding company supervisor is significantly different from that of abank supervisor. The difference reflects the difference between an insured depository institution and anonbank affiliate of the holding company. Depository institutions are covered by the federal safety net- deposit insurance and access to the discount window and to other guarantees associated with theFederal Reserve’s payment and settlement system. Access to the federal safety net dampens theincentive of investors and creditors to monitor banks’ risk-taking, which in turn breaks the linkbetween bank risk-taking and funding costs. Bank regulation and supervision aims to compensate forthe resultant breakdown in market discipline and to limit bank failures that could overwhelm thedeposit insurance fund.The financial modernization law did not change the focus of the safety net. But the relative growth ofactivities in bank holding companies outside the insured depository institution, as well as the increasedfocus by both management and supervisors on consolidated risk management, may make maintaining
5BIS Review 47/2000the distinction between the insured bank and its increasingly nonbank affiliates more challenging. Ifwe let public perceptions, let alone supervisory actions, blur the distinction, we will surely extend theimplicit safety net and expand its moral hazard, to the detriment of efficient markets and, ultimately, athigh cost to taxpayers.The recently enacted law provides that, when specialized functional regulators already oversee thenew permissible activities, duplication of supervision, and hence excessive regulatory burden, shouldbe avoided. In addition, because market discipline operates more effectively in connection withnonbank activities not subject to the moral hazard of the safety net, regulators should try to avoiddiminishing market discipline in the new financial holding companies. Thus, the act discourages theextension of bank-like regulation and supervision to nonbank affiliates and subsidiaries. The FederalReserve can contribute to this goal by being clear in word and deed that the affiliation of nonbankentities with a bank does not afford them access to the safety net.However, the Congress also saw the need for an umbrella supervisor to protect insured depositoryinstitutions from the risks of activities conducted by bank holding company affiliates. The law limitsthe extension of credit by insured depository institutions to their affiliates, and the umbrella supervisor- the Fed - is charged with limiting other forms of risk exposure to the depository institutions from thebank holding company structure. Clearly, there is a tension between protecting banks from such risksand avoiding the extension of bank-like supervision to affiliates. The provisions of the law dealingwith the relationship between the Federal Reserve and the functional supervisors of certain types ofnonbank affiliates - the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the state insuranceregulators - attempt to balance these considerations. As you know, these provisions call for the FederalReserve to rely, as much as possible, on the examinations conducted by the functional supervisors andon public reports to obtain information about broker-dealers, insurance companies, and futuresmerchants. The Federal Reserve may examine such functionally regulated entities only if (1) the Boardhas reasonable cause to believe that the entity is engaged in activities that pose a material risk to anaffiliated depository institution, (2) the Board determines that an examination is necessary to informthe Board of the entity’s risk-management systems, or (3) the Board has reasonable cause to believethat the entity is not in compliance with the banking laws.We are in the process of working out satisfactory procedures with functional regulators. But it seemsto me that we also must work harder to cooperate and share information among the umbrella and banksupervisors in a manner that is satisfactory to both and that minimizes regulatory burden and overlap.In principle, the relationship between the umbrella supervisor and the primary federal bank regulatorcould involve the relationship between the Federal Reserve and either the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation or the OCC. In practice, however, the key relationship for large, complex financialholding companies will be between the Federal Reserve and the OCC because the banks in large,complex financial holding companies are either state member banks or national banks. Indeed, most ofthe large and complex institutions likely to take advantage of the new opportunities have lead banks,as I have noted, with national charters.This relationship between the primary bank regulator and the umbrella supervisor must respect theagencies’ individual statutory authorities and responsibilities. At the same time, the primary bankregulator and the umbrella supervisor need to share information that allows them to carry out theirresponsibilities without creating duplication or excessive burden.Given the systemic risk associated with the disruption of the operations of large banks - and the role ofthe bank within the broader banking organization - the Federal Reserve believes that it needs to knowmore about the activities within large insured depository institutions than can be derived from accessto public information or from the reports of the primary bank supervisor. Similarly, the primary bankregulator needs information about the activities of a bank’s parent company and its nonbank affiliatesaimed at protecting the bank from threats that might arise elsewhere in the consolidated organization.The need is particularly pressing when companies manage their businesses and attendant risks acrosslegal entities within the structure of a financial holding company.As I have noted, the result is a complicated relationship, one with unavoidable, inherent, tensions. Weeach have our specific statutory responsibilities - the primary bank regulator for the bank and the Fed
BIS Review 47/20006for the consolidated holding company. Yet to be most effective we need to work cooperatively and tokeep each other informed. This cooperation should, when necessary, include participation in eachother’s examination teams.The bottom line is that the primary bank regulator and the Federal Reserve as umbrella supervisorshould establish practical operating arrangements to ensure that the relationship avoids duplication,minimizes regulatory burden, respects individual responsibilities, and still ensures the wider flow ofinformation required to meet their individual and collective responsibilities. There are, I am pleasedreport, ongoing discussions between the Federal Reserve and the OCC focused on improving ourcooperation and coordination where we are both involved in the supervision of individual LCBOs. Inmany cases today, the existing relationships and coordination between Federal Reserve and OCCexaminers are already excellent. Working collaboratively, we will assess our coordination at severalLCBOs to draw lessons from those cases where the relationship is already working very well. We willuse this information to improve the consistency of our relationship across all the LCBOs where we areboth involved in supervision.In addition to improved cooperation among US banking agencies, supervision of global financialinstitutions requires strong relations among supervisors worldwide. Most certainly, we have sought todo that, for decades now, through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and its predecessor.Although the work of that committee has focused on banks in G10 countries, the supervisoryprinciples and sound banking practices that it has identified have helped to strengthen banksupervision around the globe. Development of the “Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision”, is a prime example of those efforts. The creation of the Financial Stability Institute,under the joint sponsorship of the Bank for International Settlements and the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, is another and represents an important effort to help developing countries traintheir supervisory staff.The need for international cooperation extends beyond banking systems and bank supervisors,however, and must embrace the full range of regulated activities that large, complex financialinstitutions conduct. Toward that end, authorities from around the world have established the JointForum, made up of representatives of agencies regulating banking, insurance, and securities activities.The Financial Stability Forum, established by the G7 in 1999, is another effort to promoteinternational financial stability through information exchange and cooperation in financial supervision.The Forum regularly brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability insignificant international financial centers - including both securities and banking supervisors -international financial institutions, and representatives of international groups of supervisors andregulators. Other groups exist and will, necessarily, be created to address issues of specific interest andmay have short or long lives.The point is, it is important that we communicate and coordinate our activities, so that we understandeach other’s responsibilities and oversight techniques. As international problems emerge - as they will- knowing our counterparts abroad and trusting their judgment could be essential to resolvingproblems in a timely and orderly way.ConclusionThe challenge of supervising global financial institutions is the challenge of the decade forsupervisors. Large banking organizations are likely to become increasingly complicated and wide-ranging, and the banking supervisory agencies will have to adjust to that. In my view, the adjustmentwill require increasing reliance on banks’ own internal risk management, and especially on internalrisk classification systems; on regulatory capital linked to internal risk classifications; on supervisionthat focuses on evaluation of, and supervisory feedback on, risk-management systems; on marketdiscipline; and on increased cooperation among agencies. None of these steps will be easy. The goodnews is that we’ve started on all of these efforts, and that progress has already been made.
1BIS Review 46/2000I J Macfarlane: Medium-term developments in the Australian economySpeech by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Australian Business inEurope, in London, on 26 May 2000.*      *      *It is a great pleasure to be in London again speaking under the auspices of Australian Business inEurope. The last time I spoke to this group in London was in mid-1998, which was very close to thelow point of the Asian crisis. My main purpose on that occasion was to reassure investors in the Citythat Australia would get through the Asian crisis in reasonable shape. As you are, no doubt, all aware,the results were better than any of us could have predicted at the time. The economy continued to growat 4% plus, inflation remained low and, although the balance of payments deteriorated, it wastemporary and not all that different to what has occurred on a number of other occasions in the past 20years.The international situation is a lot different now. Most of the Asian economies are growing again andworld output growth is a good deal stronger than in 1998. At the same time, the structure of worldinterest rates has moved up, as has Australia’s. Whereas two years ago the focus of attention was onAsia and other emerging markets, the focus now seems to be more on the United States than in anyearlier stage I can remember.I would like to take the opportunity today to update some of the things I said two years ago, but to doso in a way which focuses on medium-term developments. I will take as my starting point acomparison of economic growth rates of developed countries over the most recent decade (Table 1).These figures from the OECD show that except for Ireland, which everyone in this audience wouldknow is a very special case, the Australian growth rate has been higher than for any comparableOECD country. (Incidentally, each of the countries in this list experienced a recession at some stageearlier in the decade, which helps explain why the decade averages look a bit lower than the growthrates that we have been accustomed to over the past few years.)Table 1: Real GDP GrowthAverage annual rate (over 1990s)-------------------------------------Ireland                           6.7Australia                         3.5Norway                            3.3United States                     3.2Netherlands                       2.9New Zealand                       2.6Spain                             2.4Canada                            2.3Denmark                           2.2Germany                           2.1Belgium                           2.0United Kingdom                    2.0France                            1.7Finland                           1.5Italy                             1.4Japan                             1.3Sweden                            1.3Switzerland                       0.9-------------------------------------Sources: National Statisticsagencies, IMF and OECD.
BIS Review 46/20002For me, however, the interesting thing about this table is that this is the first decade in my working lifewhere Australia has figured in the top half of the table, let alone being virtually in the top position. Wemust have been doing something right.One of the things that we are doing right is that we have kept the 1990s expansion going longer thanthe expansions of the 1970s or the 1980s (Graph 1). The 1980s expansion was quite a strong one but itturned down midway through its seventh year. The 1970s expansion was a much weaker one eventhough it lasted a bit longer. The 1990s expansion shown in the diagram covers the eight-and-a-halfyears to December 1999, but we are confident that it has continued through the ninth year, and by thetime we reach the September quarter we will be in our tenth year. So, sustainability of the expansion isthe first key to our improved performance.The second key is improvements in productivity. Here, if we use the simplest measure of productivity,which is labour productivity, the pattern in Australia is very similar to the pattern in the United States(Graph 2): strong growth in the 1960s, a flattening out in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a pick-upin the 1990s. But the pick-up in the 1990s in Australia has been more pronounced than in the UnitedStates. We have gone from 1.7% per annum to 2.9% per annum, whereas the United States went from1.5% per annum to 2% per annum. I do not want to suggest that this means we have higherproductivity than the United States; remember we are only talking here about rates of change ofproductivity. The fact that we have been able to speed up more than they have is, in large part, becausewe were starting from a lower base.
3BIS Review 46/2000Whilst I am on the subject of productivity, I want to make two general points:The first is the obvious one which I have made on numerous occasions that the main reasons behindthe pick-up in productivity growth have been structural changes made over the past 15 years in theAustralian economy which have increased flexibility and competitive pressures. These changesinclude:-further tariff reductions;-financial deregulation;-labour market deregulation;-privatisation; and-a more stringent regime of competition policy.It has not been easy to put these changes in place, even though there has been for most of the decadeconsiderable bipartisan political support for change. Inevitably, compromises have had to be madeand, viewed in isolation, some of the individual changes do not look to be all that thorough. But takentogether, I think the total is larger than the sum of the individual parts. Of course, one aspect of theeconomy that was not reformed during this period was the tax system. But that will change in about amonth’s time when a Goods and Services Tax is introduced to replace the old wholesale sales tax andto take some of the weight off income taxes.The second point about productivity I want to make concerns the new economy/old economy divide.Some people tend to judge a country’s technological sophistication by, for example, the number oflisted companies in the IT sector. Although Australia has a number of companies that fit thisdescription, about 70 or so in fact, their combined share of the stock market is not large byinternational standards. But that is only one measure of technological sophistication. Another equallyimportant one is the country’s or the business sector’s willingness to embrace new technology. Thismay be a better guide to productivity improvements than focusing only on the IT sector. I have twomeasures of the spread of technology:- The first is Internet usage per cent of population, which shows Australia in a relatively highposition of the countries compiled by the Consulting Group, NUA (Table 2).Table 2: Internet UsagePer cent of population-------------------------------------Norway                           49.8United States                    45.3Sweden                           44.3Canada                           42.8Finland                          38.1Australia                        36.4Denmark                          35.5Netherlands                      28.5UK                               26.6Switzerland                      23.4Slovenia                         23.0Austria                          22.7Taiwan                           21.7South Korea                      21.3Belgium                          19.6Germany                          19.4Japan                            16.8Italy                            16.4Ireland                          16.3New Zealand                      15.8-------------------------------------Source: nua.ie.

BIS Review 46/20004- A measure that is more specific to the business sector is the number of e-commerce serversper head of population.

This, along with the measures I mentioned earlier, helps to explain why there has been such asignificant lift in the rate of growth of productivity over the last decade.A big lift in productivity growth has a beneficial effect on many areas of the economy. A lot of it ispassed through to consumers and, in the process, this makes it easier to maintain low inflation. Someof it can also make businesses more profitable, which is, after all, the incentive that drives much of theefforts towards improving productivity in the first place. The two broadest measures of corporateprofits as a percentage of GDP in Australia have been trending up over the past decade, with profitsafter interest showing a much sharper rise than profits before interest, again another indirect benefit oflow inflation (Graph 3).
5BIS Review 46/2000You will note that this measure of corporate profits is adjusted for privatisations. If that had not beendone, the lines would have trended up more sharply because of the significant number of privatisationsthat have occurred over the last decade. Largely as a result of these privatisations, the percentage ofthe population in Australia who are now direct shareholders has risen sharply and is exceptionally highby world standards. The proportion who hold shares directly is 41%. I have not got a table ofcomparisons with me, but I believe this figure is now about as high as in the United States. If weadded to the number who directly hold shares, the number of people who voluntarily hold sharesthrough equity unit trusts (or mutual funds, to use US terminology), the number would go to about54%. And, of course, if we added in those who contribute to an accumulation pension fund, exposureto shares would be almost universal.Table 4: Consumer Price InflationAverage annual rate (over 1990s)-------------------------------------Spain                             4.0United Kingdom                    3.5Sweden                            3.0United States                     2.9Germany                           2.5Netherlands                       2.4Norway                            2.4Ireland                           2.3Australia                         2.3Switzerland                       2.2Belgium                           2.1Canada                            2.1Denmark                           2.1Finland                           2.0France                            1.8New Zealand                       1.8Japan                             1.1-------------------------------------Source: OECDCan I turn now to inflation? If we look at an international ranking of inflation rates over the pastdecade comparable to the one I showed for real GDP growth, Australia finishes in the middle of thefield with an average inflation rate of 2.3% per annum (Table 4). This is a huge improvement onprevious decades, but, of course, virtually every country has also shown a significant improvement.There are a number of factors behind this improvement, but the one I would like to mention today isour monetary policy regime. Like a number of English-speaking countries - the UK, Canada, NewZealand - Australia has a monetary policy regime which is based on the trilogy of an inflation target,
BIS Review 46/20006an independent central bank and a floating exchange rate. Our inflation target is not all that differentfrom that of the UK in that we aim for an average inflation rate of somewhere between 2 and 3% overthe long term, recognising that it could go above or below that range from to time, but like the UK, itis the average that matters.One consequence of lower inflation in Australia is the convergence of our bond yields to internationalnorms, or at least the US norm (Graph 4). Some of you may have been able to remember that asrecently as a decade ago, Australian government bonds were 400 basis points higher than USgovernment bonds. We think of that as the bad old days, but if you were an international fundsmanager, you may look back on it as the good old days.Another factor that has contributed to the improved acceptance of Australian government paper is therecognition that our fiscal policy is very responsible by international standards. The Budget has beenin surplus for some time now. This, together with the proceeds of the privatisations I referred toearlier, has meant that the outstanding stock of government debt has fallen in absolute terms, and as apercentage of GDP is now the lowest among developed countries (Table 5).Table 5: Public DebtPer cent of GDP; 1999-------------------------------------Italy                           117.7Belgium                         114.1Japan                           105.4Canada                           86.9Spain                            70.4Sweden                           68.3France                           65.2Netherlands                      62.9Germany                          62.6United States                    59.3Denmark                          55.4United Kingdom                   54.0Finland                          44.9New Zealand                      34.8Norway                           34.3Australia                        31.3-------------------------------------Source: OECD Economic Outlook,December 1999I am not sure how fully aware international investors are of these excellent figures on growth,inflation, productivity, public debt, etc., so I have taken the liberty today of indulging in a bit of
7BIS Review 46/2000trumpet blowing. One economic fact, however, that markets are aware of is that Australia always runsa substantial current account deficit and, therefore, is a net importer of capital. I have nothing verynew to say on this subject other than to point out that it is the result of private agents’ decisions ratherthan government’s demands on capital markets, and that its magnitude has not changed very much inthe last 20 years. It has varied cyclically, of course, but around a basically flat trend. At its cyclical lowpoints it tends to be about 3% of GDP, and at its high points a bit over 6% (Graph 5). In this cycle,which was heavily influenced by the contraction of our Asian markets, the deficit touched 6.1% ofGDP in the September quarter of 1999, but has since fallen noticeably. The conditions are right forfurther falls over the next year, given that exports are now growing rapidly again (up 19% over the last12 months). The medium-term issue, of course, is whether the capital we are importing is being put togood use. The output growth, the productivity growth and corporate profit story suggest that it is.So far this year, exchange rates have been in the forefront of attention. For the first few months of thisyear, the Australian dollar declined quite sharply against the US dollar, more so than other majorcurrencies. More recently, it has been a bit steadier, while a number of other currencies have weakenedmore noticeably against the US dollar. With firstly the euro, then the pound, then some other smallercurrencies joining in, the position of the Australian dollar is now not so lonely. With the United Statesbeing perceived as the country most likely to need higher interest rates, we should not be surprised byan international adjustment mechanism which has seen other currencies all falling by a somewhatsimilar amount against a rising US dollar.Turning to the medium term, these developments have meant a fall in the Australian Trade-WeightedIndex or effective exchange rate over the course of 2000. The more noticeable thing, however, is thatsince about the second year of the period of floating in Australia, i.e. since about 1985, the Australiandollar in effective terms has fluctuated around an essentially flat trend, with its present value beingnear the low end of this range (Graph 6).I think I have taken enough of your time on the medium term. Turning briefly to the period ahead, weexpect that the current expansion will continue into a tenth and eleventh year, i.e. for the length of ourcurrent forecasts. Beyond that, the outlook is too distant for us to forecast. We are conscious that thereason we have done so much better this time than in previous expansions is that we did not let theusual late-cycle imbalances develop. The most common of these, of course, is inflation. We areconfident that our early action on monetary policy, plus our adherence to the discipline of the inflationtargeting regime, will mean that we continue to maintain low inflation in the years ahead.
1BIS Review 44/2000Villy Bergström: The role of the Riksbank in Swedish societySpeech by Mr Villy Bergström, Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at Fristående SparbankersFörbundsstömma, held in Stenungssund, on 22 May 2000.*      *      *In my speech today I would like to concentrate on the role of the Riksbank in Swedish society. I amgoing to begin by trying to clarify the sometimes exaggerated idea about the meaning of the Riksbankhaving an independent position in relation to our democratically elected representatives. Later in myspeech, I will take up issues relating to the Riksbank’s role in reducing the risk for financial crises andthe important function of the bank system.The duties of the RiksbankThe Riksbank is an authority subject to the Riksdag. The areas of responsibility that have beendelegated to us in one way or another involve ensuring that our money plays its part well in society. Inorder for a modern economy to function efficiently, there must be access to money that is accepted byeveryone as a means of payment. It must also be possible to make payments for the enormous flows ofgoods and services in a developed economy in a secure and efficient way. Last but not least, it isimportant that the country’s currency functions as a store of value, a demand that is met if inflation islow and predictable. Stable prices reduce uncertainty when agreements about future payments are tobe concluded, for instance pay agreements. Another benefit that is usually emphasised is that stableprices do not create the same arbitrariness in income distribution between savers and borrowers ashigh inflation does.By ensuring that our money fulfils its functions, the Riksbank makes its best contribution to citizens’welfare. This is the ultimate objective of all economic policy and monetary policy is no exception.When the value of money and financial stability are maintained, we contribute to creating goodconditions for growth, which is usually considered to be an important part of welfare. However, thefunds the Riksbank has at its disposal cannot affect productivity growth in the long run. As there isconsiderable agreement that it is neither possible nor desirable to use regulations as a normalcomponent of policy, changes of the shortest interest rate are normally the monetary policy toolavailable to the Riksbank.Our tasks have been formulated as follows; the Riksbank shall (1) maintain price stability, (2) promotea safe and efficient payment system and (3) be responsible for the supply of banknotes and coins.The core activity that the Riksbank is responsible for is stated and regulated in the Riksbank Act. Anew act came into force on 1 January 1999 and was occasioned by the demands made on the conductof monetary policy according to the so-called Maastricht Treaty.The Riksbank in a democracyWhen Sweden became a member of the European Union and the Government signed the so-calledMaastricht Treaty, this entailed, among other things, acceptance of the requirement that the Riksbankwas to have an independent position in relation to the Government and the Riksdag. However, manyregarded it as a controversial demand, not least in the Swedish trade union movement and withinsocial democracy. It is hardly surprising that there were strong reactions in many places as anindependent central bank is a quite new and unfamiliar element in Swedish public administration. Itmeant that the conduct of monetary policy should be delegated to an authority that was only restrictedby legislation. This procedure can be most closely compared with the independent interpretation oflaws by the courts.
BIS Review 44/20002However, on closer inspection of the content of the new law and the practice established since then, itcan probably be said that the reactions and concerns were exaggerated. Mention is often made ingeneral discussion of, for instance, “the independence of the Riksbank”, which may call to mind anorganisation that can carry out its policy wholly without control and parliamentary supervision. In fact,in my view, what is involved is rather more a sensible arrangement, where the objective of monetarypolicy, stable prices, has been established by law. In addition, the Act states that the Riksbank, withoutprejudice to the objective of price stability, shall support general economic policy with a view toachieving sustainable growth and high employment. Furthermore, when the new Act was passed,responsibility for general issues relating to foreign exchange policy was transferred from the Riksbankto the Government It is thus the Government that is to decide on the krona’s relationship to othercurrencies. This means, for instance, that it is the Government that shall decide whether and whenSweden shall apply for participation in the European exchange rate mechanism, ERM2. However, theRiksbank is responsible for setting the exchange rate at which the linkage shall be made in this caseand the width of the band in which the krona shall be allowed to vary. In practice, it is reasonable toassume that this takes place in consultation with the Government, not least because Sweden cannotdecide on this unilaterally.Control is exercised in various ways to ensure that monetary policy is conducted in accordance withthe law and the intentions of the democratically appointed government authorities. What is involvedtherefore is not at all complete independence. The Government authorities naturally exercise control ofhow the Riksbank performs its work.We on the Executive Board of the Bank have also responded to the consequences of this independenceby the way in which we have organised the monetary policy decision-making process. I shall here dealbriefly with the government authorities’ control of the Riksbank and the bank management’s responseto increased independence.The control of the Riksbank by the government authoritiesThe government authorities exercise control of the Riksbank in at least four different ways:1. The Riksbank is an authority subject to the Riksdag. The Bank was previously controlled bythe Riksdag’s standing committee, the Governing Board. In the new organisation whichstarted on 1 January 1999, the Governing Council appoints the six members of the ExecutiveBoard, the Governor and the five Deputy Governors. However, these appointments takeplace for different periods of time. This means that the Governing Council renews a mandateor appoints a new Deputy Governor each year. In this way, the Riksdag’s committee, theGoverning Council, can indicate discontent with the policy carried out by the Riksbank’sExecutive Board each year.2. The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Governing Council take part as a rule in ExecutiveBoard meetings. They have a right to speak but not the right to vote or make proposals. Inthis way, these persons have a complete insight into the Riksbank’s work and can assess thequality of the Executive Board’s work.3. Twice a year, the Governor of the Riksbank and sometimes another Executive Boardmember appear before the Riksdag’s Standing Committee on Finance to give a report on thepolicy of the Riksbank. This takes place in connection with a written report on the policycarried out and the current state of the Swedish economy.4. Finally, it is important to remember that the assignment to the Riksbank is given in the formof an ordinary law. It is inter alia formulated that the Riksbank shall maintain stable prices.This means that the Riksdag can at any time reformulate the task of the Riksbank in anordinary law. The EU Treaty sets limits, however, as to how the assignment can beformulated.
3BIS Review 44/2000The bank management’s reaction to independenceWhen the new Executive Board met before the New Year in 1999 to draw up policy for independence,the starting point was that the Bank was to work in conditions of complete openness. A verysubstantial openness is required for the Riksbank’s monetary policy to obtain public confidence andfor the approach to an inflation target to be completely understood. This has been our lodestar whenplanning our work.1. The Riksbank’s target for stable prices is given as 2% inflation measured by the consumerprice index with a tolerance interval of 1% in each direction. When we consider that the CPIhas been affected by factors that do not permanently affect the CPI, we can, however, decideto disregard these. The reason is that if we try to counteract these, it would lead tounnecessary fluctuations in production.2. The underlying material for the monetary policy decisions is published. Four times a year theRiksbank produces a so-called inflation report. This is a detailed account of the state of theSwedish economy, which leads to an assessment of inflation in the coming two years. Theseassessments are based on the development of GDP, investments, consumption, publicexpenditure, the central government budget balance, foreign trade and various prices. Theforecast horizon is adapted to the time period that “the Riksbank’s weapon”, the so-calledrepo rate, has an effect on the economy.3. The morning after the Executive Board has made an interest rate decision, which normallytakes place 6-8 times a year, the decision is published with a motivation in a press release.The Governor of the Riksbank, the Executive Board member responsible for preparing themonetary policy decisions and some of the Bank’s economists also take part in a pressconference and answer questions when decisions have been made to change interest rates orwhen the so-called inflation report is published.4. A few weeks after the Executive Board has had a monetary policy meeting, minutes arepublished from the Executive Board meeting where the submissions made by the differentBoard members are presented anonymously but where any reservations against the inflationreport and/or majority decisions on the interest rate are reported stating names.The Riksbank, together with the Bank of England, has a distinctive position among central banks withregard to openness. In this respect the Bank of England has shown the way for the Riksbank. I daresay that the Swedish general public know more about the Riksbank’s monetary policy now than whenit was controlled by elected politicians. And this is how it has to be. As I said before, openness is aprerequisite for independence.Sometimes, I come across fantastic ideas about the Bank’s independence, but when I explain thesituation, I often meet understanding for the Riksbank’s new position.What I have talked about primarily concerns how we handle the duty to maintain price stability. Thechanges that took place at the beginning of 1999 were, as I said earlier, occasioned by the demandsmade by the Maastricht Treaty on the monetary policy decision-making process, which madenecessary a new Riksbank Act. The Riksbank’s conduct of monetary policy is also what usually givesrise to discussion. As long as the payment systems function, financial stability is not threatened andaccess to cash means of payment is good, there is no reason on the part of the general public and themedia to focus attention on this issue. The Riksbank will only be called to account if problems arise,although the Bank devotes considerable resources to these areas under normal conditions too.The Riksbank is responsible for the supply of cashFor about a year now, an independent subsidiary, PSAB, Pengar i Sverige AB, has been responsiblefor the operational cash management in Sweden. The Riksbank still has overall responsibility for cashsupply, of course, but we now exercise this largely by carrying out supervision of PSAB.
BIS Review 44/20004Financial stability leads to a secure payment systemAn important component of the Riksbank’s task of promoting a secure and efficient payment system isto monitor and evaluate developments in the bank system. Since the banks have a key role in provisionof banknotes and payment services to the general public, it is important that their activities functionwell. A prerequisite for this is that financial stability is not threatened. Unlike many other countries,the Swedish central bank does not have the role of supervisory authority. Here instead there is aspecial authority, Finansinspektionen (the financial supervisory authority), that bears the responsibilityof supervising the individual institutions while the Riksbank focuses its supervision on detectingsystemic risks.The Riksbank has decided to act with the same openness and clarity as regards the responsibility for asecure efficient payment system that characterises the monetary policy decision-making process. Animportant component of this strategy is the production and publication of a report on financial stabilitya couple of times a year. This report goes systematically through the risk factors that could lead tomajor imbalances being created in the financial systems so that financial stability is threatened in abroad sense. Since the Swedish bank system is concentrated in four major banks which have largeexposures to one another, problems in one bank can rapidly spread to the entire bank system. Bypointing out the risks that the Riksbank sees and publishing our assessments, it is probable thatconduct that could otherwise lead to systemic risks can be prevented. Openness can thereby be said toconstitute a means in our monitoring of the payment system. This also applies to monetary policy,where openness and clarity do not only have the function of creating understanding for the inflationtarget but also probably affect and stabilise inflation expectations in the economy.Stable prices reduce the risk of financial crises?An issue that is highly relevant for the Riksbank is the extent to which monetary policy focused onprice stability reduces the risk for the incidence of financial crises. An economic policy focused onprice stability is considered to create the basis for macroeconomic balance. The financial crises wehave seen to date have often been preceded by periods of strong credit expansion and building-up ofmacroeconomic imbalances. Increasing asset prices have also commonly preceded a crisis. Borrowersas well as banks seem often to have based their decisions on loans and lending on expectations ofcontinued high asset prices and that the growth in wealth that rising share and property prices give riseto would be permanent. When these expectations subsequently prove to have been exaggerated, thisinitiates a process that in some cases has led to financial crises in the bank system.The development in the U.S. economy has brought up the risk that financial imbalances can developdespite stable prices and balanced government finances. As we know, demand and growth have beenhigh there for many years without inflation accelerating. Demand has been stimulated by high shareprices and the private sector’s financial balance has decreased markedly.The strong credit expansion that preceded the bank crises in Sweden at the beginning of the 1990stook place at the same time as a strong increase in private consumption and investments, which led toan increasing deficit in the balance of trade, considerable overheating and high inflation in theSwedish economy. It is reasonable to assume that a large expansion in credit would create inflationarypressure now as well that would motivate restrictions in monetary policy. In this way, the creditexpansion should be dampened and the risk for problems in the bank system reduced. On the otherhand, it cannot be excluded that situations will arise with strong credit expansion, for instance basedon increasing asset prices without an increase in inflation being anticipated. Strong internationalcompetition combined with low, stable inflation expectations could possibly mean that inflation wouldnot accelerate despite increased use of resources. It is also possible to conceive of situations with acredit expansion driven by high turnover on the asset markets. It is thus far from self-evident that amonetary policy based on stable prices would automatically be a guarantee against financial crises.These are questions to which there are no certain answers although they are discussed and investigatedinternationally as well as in Sweden. Purely hypothetically it is conceivable that the Riksbank wouldincrease interest rates even if we regard it as most probable that the inflation target would not be
5BIS Review 44/2000threatened. In this case, the motivation would be that we make the assessment that the credit expansionin the bank system risks threatening the stability of the system, for instance in the event of a large fallin asset prices. An interest rate decision of this kind could probably also be motivated by the risk ofstrongly falling inflation if the risk scenario is realised. In practice, it is probably only in retrospectthat it can be noted that financial assets and liabilities that have been built up have been an expressionfor serious financial imbalances.It is therefore normal that the interest rate weapon is only used if the inflation target is threatened.The pressure for change creates challenges for banks and authoritiesIt is evident from everything that I have said that there are no sharp boundaries between the variousareas of responsibility of the Riksbank. The Riksbank’s analysis of the development of the banks alsoserves as a basis for our assessments of stable prices and financial stability. For instance, structuralchanges in the financial markets probably affect the impact of interest rates on the economy, at thesame time as they change the risks banking activities are associated with.As this meeting has been arranged by the National Association of Independent Savings Banks, I thinkit is appropriate to highlight some development tendencies that entail major challenges for the banksand the Riksbank.Globalisation, deregulation and technical development have changed and will change the conditionsfor traditional bank activities. The role of the banks has primarily been to act as an intermediarybetween savers and borrowers and to make available payment services linked to liquid depositaccounts. Characteristic for a traditional bank portfolio is that lending is long or medium-term whilethe bank’s deposits are quite liquid. This has, of course, meant that the banks have assumed a creditand term risk.Developments in recent decades have meant that competing alternatives have arisen to banks for bothlenders and depositors. The base that has made up the foundation for the growth in profits of the bankshas therefore tended to shrink. There have, for instance, been increased opportunities for bigcompanies with credit risks that can easily be valued to use the security market to finance theirinvestments. At the same time, households have obtained considerably more alternatives to invest theirsavings in and during recent years an increasing number of Swedish households have opted to investtheir savings in shares and share funds.Deregulated financial markets have also entailed that price fluctuations in various financial assets andalso in properties seem to have increased. At the same time, an increasing proportion of lending by thebanks is to smaller enterprises and households, where the possibility of evaluating the credit risk in atraditional way is poorer than for large companies. Altogether therefore considerably higher demandsare made on the banks’ risk management systems than previously. Major investments in knowledge onmodern financial economy and IT-based risk systems are required for instance. This development istaking place at the same time as increased competition is tending to squeeze profits and informationtechnology is changing the conditions for provision of payment services.When traditional bank activities shrink and change, the direction of activities has to be reviewed. Thebanks can for instance opt to take part in the provision of capital in the securities market and generateprofits by charging fees for this activity. One strategy may be to offer businesses and private personsall financial services such as advice, insurance and payment services. In order to be competitive, largerbanks are then often required, which is a driving force behind the increased frequency of bank mergersand mergers between banks and insurance companies taking place.Another alternative is of course to concentrate activities and become competitive within a particularniche. Small and medium-sized enterprises need for instance to have access to capital via banks whichare able to obtain knowledge on the risks associated with lending to these. The possibility of turning tothe securities market to have their need of capital satisfied should above all be confined to largebusinesses. The savings banks with their strong local implantation and closeness to and knowledge of
BIS Review 44/20006customers should be able to play an important role here. Detailed personal knowledge is an unbeatableweapon in competition.In conclusionWith my speech, I have wished to contribute to increasing understanding of and support for theobjectives and tasks delegated to us who have been appointed to manage the Riksbank. I believe it isparticularly important to create clarity in the sometimes exaggerated view of the import of theRiksbank’s independent position. It is my definite view, given the control the government authoritieshave over the Riksbank and the openness that characterises our activity, that the demands made in ademocracy on an authority responsible for a branch of economic policy are well satisfied.
1BIS Review 44/2000Willem F Duisenberg: From the EMI to the ECBSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Banque deFrance’s Bicentennial Symposium, Paris, on 30 May 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to address such a distinguished audience on the occasionof the Banque de France’s bicentenary. Surviving for two hundred years in a sometimes turbulenteconomic and political environment constitutes a notable achievement. I am pleased to be able tocongratulate my French colleagues and the Bank itself on this significant accomplishment and lookforward to their continued success in the future as part of the Eurosystem - our name for the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) and the eleven national central banks that introduced the euro in January 1999.The long history of the Banque de France stands in stark contrast with the youth of the institution Irepresent today. Tomorrow the ECB will complete its first two years of existence. During this time,the introduction of the euro and the subsequent conduct and implementation of the single monetarypolicy have, in my view, been a remarkable success. Most importantly, the basis for lasting andcredible price stability throughout the euro area has been solidified. Price stability has, in turn, helpedto create an environment where economic activity and employment can flourish. Economic prospectsin the euro area are better now than at any time for more than two decades. With continued wagemoderation, fiscal consolidation and the implementation of long overdue structural reforms to labourand product markets, an extended period of sustainable economic growth is possible - provided thatthe single monetary policy remains resolutely committed to the maintenance of price stability, takingthe necessary prompt action to address inflationary pressures as they emerge. The ECB is stronglycommitted to this task.The successful introduction of the euro did not occur by accident. Rather it was the result of a long andpainstaking preparatory process. This process started in Basel, under the aegis of the Committee ofCentral Bank Governors. The Committee of Governors was central to the preparation of the Statute ofthe ESCB and the Maastricht Treaty and, after the signing of the Treaty, undertook the initialgroundwork for the move to Monetary Union. After its creation in 1994, the European MonetaryInstitute, as the institutional precursor to the ECB foreseen in the Treaty, took over the preparatorywork. These preparations drew on the accumulated experience of central banks throughout the world,but - of course - especially those in the euro area. In this sense, the long history of the Banque deFrance that we are celebrating today - as well as the experience of other central banks - has directlycontributed to the success of the ECB during its short initial existence.In my remarks this morning, I will discuss some of the lessons drawn by the ECB from the rich historyof central banking. My comments will focus on three aspects of monetary policymaking: theinstitutional design of the central bank; the monetary policy strategy; and the operational frameworkused to implement policy decisions.The objective of monetary policy - price stabilityMonetary policy is not omnipotent. Unfortunately, in the past, this was not always recognised in thedesign of central bank mandates. Central banks were often charged with meeting several, potentiallyconflicting, objectives, some of which were simply unattainable using monetary policy alone.Unsurprisingly, the resulting inadequately designed institutional frameworks led to poor overalleconomic outcomes.Today, with the regrettable experience of high and rising inflation in the 1970s in mind, thecapabilities and limitations of monetary policy are better - although still not universally - understood.A broad consensus now exists that the maintenance of price stability is the appropriate objective ofmonetary policy. This consensus is rooted in the belief that monetary policy makes its best
BIS Review 44/20002contribution to overall economic welfare by maintaining price stability - and thereby allowing therelative price mechanism to work more efficiently. It goes without saying that this is a consensus withwhich I fully concur.The institutional framework for the single monetary policy described in the Maastricht Treaty reflectsthis economic consensus. Of course, the Treaty was written with the experience of European and othercentral banks in mind. First and foremost, the Treaty clarifies the objective of the ECB. It establishes aclear hierarchy of objectives for the single monetary policy, with price stability unambiguouslyassigned overriding importance.How should this mandate be achieved? The experience of the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated theadvantages of central bank independence in the pursuit of price stability. A monetary policy subject toshort-term political concerns and influences could not adopt the medium-term orientation required tomaintain stable prices credibly. Academic studies of the time consistency problem in monetary policyoffered an insight into this issue, while empirical evaluations showing a correlation between centralbank independence and greater price stability provided compelling supporting evidence. By the early1990s, the benefits of central bank independence had become conventional wisdom. An increasingnumber of central banks achieved greater institutional independence. This worldwide trend wasreflected in the Maastricht Treaty, which made the ECB one of the most independent central banks inthe world.Assigning responsibility for an important public policy to an independent institution needs to beaccompanied by a transparent and accountable policy framework. In a democratic society, a highdegree of transparency and accountability in monetary policymaking should bolster both thelegitimacy of the central bank and public support for its price stability mandate. At the same time,transparency and accountability impose an external discipline on policymakers which can add to thecredibility, and thereby the effectiveness, of monetary policy. The ECB has set high standards in bothregards by establishing channels for communication and accountability suited to the specific, anddistinctive, institutional and cultural setting in Europe.I will return to the important issue of transparency in a moment, when I discuss the ECB’s monetarypolicy strategy. With regard to accountability, let me simply highlight that, drawing on the successfulexperience of several central banks, in October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB decided topublish a quantitative definition of price stability. This definition of price stability as an annualincrease in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2% providesa clear yardstick against which the public, its elected representatives and agents in the media can holdthe ECB accountable.The ECB’s monetary policy strategyWithin this institutional framework, how should price stability be maintained? This question isaddressed by the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. It is obvious that the development of the ECB’sstrategic framework drew heavily on the experience of euro area NCBs prior to Monetary Union. Thisis one area where the experience of national central banks was extremely influential and important.Prior to the introduction of the euro, several central banks, including the Banque de France, assigned aprominent role to money within their monetary policy strategy. Some announced intermediatemonetary targets, while others adopted monitoring or reference ranges for monetary growth. At thesame time, other euro area central banks emphasised the role of inflation forecasts as the key monetarypolicy indicator. Of these, several proceeded to announce direct inflation targets, as becamefashionable in the 1990s. Furthermore, many NCBs in what is now the euro area were pursuingexchange rate targets within the context of the European Monetary System. In several cases, centralbanks adopted various combinations of the above approaches.This rich and varied experience provided the context in which the ECB’s strategy was designed. Ishould like to make two observations.
3BIS Review 44/2000First, the range of approaches employed by NCBs in what is now the euro area was considerable.Nevertheless, once the commitment to price stability was affirmed, each of these approaches achieveda large measure of success. The convergence of inflation rates to low and stable levels across the euroarea in the 1990s was a significant - and, in many quarters, unexpected - achievement. In my view, thisexperience offers a powerful illustration that there are several ways to achieve and maintain pricestability. The strategy adopted by a central bank should reflect the circumstances that it faces,including the initial conditions and consequent need for transition. Those who claim that there is onlyone acceptable or efficient way to operate monetary policy fly in the face of history and experience.Second, on the basis of our investigations of these various approaches conducted at the EMI, weconcluded that the differences among various central bank strategies - differences which are oftenhighlighted in the academic and journalistic debate - are much less important than the similarities.Certain key elements - for example, affirming a commitment to the objective of price stability;defining this objective clearly; evaluating a broad range of indicators, including monetary aggregates,real and financial variables and macroeconomic forecasts - were, in fact, common to all successfulstrategies.Taking note of these two observations, the Governing Council of the ECB adopted a strategy whichaimed to maintain some continuity with the strategies pursued by NCBs in the euro area prior toMonetary Union while, at the same time, ensuring that the new and distinct challenges facingmonetary policy in a wholly new currency area were appropriately addressed.We recognised at the outset that the key feature of a successful strategic framework for monetarypolicy can be described in very simple terms. Monetary policy must always be determined in themanner which best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.In taking monetary policy decisions with the goal of price stability in mind, the Governing Councilrelies on the information about the economic situation and the threats to price stability that is revealedby a thorough analysis of a very broad range of economic indicators. As NCB experience hasdemonstrated, the relevant set of indicators is potentially very wide. In consequence, the ECB adopts a“full information” approach, ensuring all the relevant information is encompassed in the analysis. Toimpose some structure on this body of information, these indicators are organised in the context of thestrategy’s two pillars. Imposing such structure facilitates the pursuit of the strategy’s interrelated roles,namely the promotion of an efficient internal decision-making process and the creation of a clearexternal framework for the presentation and explanation of policy decisions to the public.The first pillar of the strategy, which assigns a prominent role to money, reflects the fundamentallymonetary origins of inflation over the medium to longer term. The prominent role of money issignalled by the announcement of a reference value of 4½% for the annual growth rate of the broadmonetary aggregate M3. It is crucial to recognise that we do not interpret the first pillar as either anintermediate monetary target or solely in terms of the reference value. The first pillar embodies athorough analysis of the components and counterparts of M3, which always takes place in the contextof other indicators. The aim of the analysis is to extract information contained in the monetary andcredit data that is required by monetary policymakers to take decisions. In consequence, the analysisnaturally focuses on the information content of money regarding the outlook for price developmentsconsidering both inflationary and deflationary risks. The first pillar therefore represents an approachwithin which monetary developments are the main determinants of the evolution of the price levelover the medium term.We are aware that the conditions needed to give a prominent role to money are not as favourableelsewhere in the world as they are in the euro area. However, in the euro area, all the availableevidence so far points to the existence of a stable relationship between M3 and price developmentsover the medium term. M3 and other monetary and credit aggregates also demonstrate leadingindicator properties for future price developments. In the end, it is this evidence which makes usconfident that monetary and credit aggregates are an important indicator for assessing risks to pricestability.The second pillar of the strategy is associated with a complementary, but more eclectic, approach,which implies that a wide range of indicators is of relevance for monetary policy. While inflation is a
BIS Review 44/20004monetary phenomenon over the medium term, at shorter horizons it will be influenced by many othervariables. Changes in international commodity prices, such as the price of oil, will influencedevelopments in consumer price inflation. Demand and cost pressures can also influence pricedevelopments in the shorter term. Moreover, policymakers will generally need to tailor their actions tothe prevailing economic circumstances, since the impact of monetary policy on the future evolution ofthe price level at any specific time will depend on a host of factors which are not captured by monetarydata. Analysis under the second pillar is intended to reveal this information, giving policymakersgreater insight into shorter-run price dynamics and their implications for monetary policy.Monetary policymaking in the euro area has to reflect the complexities and uncertainties whichsurround the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in a wholly new economic entity. Theseuncertainties imply that no single approach is likely to be entirely reliable. The inherent uncertaintyfaced by the central bank cannot simply be wished away. Reliance on a single indicator or forecast, ora single model of the economy or view of the world, would, in these circumstances, be extremelyunwise. The strategy needs to incorporate the full range of relevant indicators and assess them in thecontext of a variety of different models. In this respect, the two pillars complement one another. Theyallow for a structured cross-checking of the evidence and analysis underlying policy decisions,encompass all information and allow for various views of the structure of the economy.The academic literature and other external commentators are slowly coming to recognise theimportance of “robustness” in monetary policymaking - something which I believe has beenunderstood by central bankers for some time. A successful monetary policy is not one that performs“optimally” in the context of a specific model or given a particular view of the world. In the light ofour limited understanding of how the economy works, no single model is reliable enough. Rather -given the great uncertainty faced by central banks - a successful monetary policy should perform wellin a broad range of possible situations and across a variety of models or views of the world, each oneof which may capture important aspects of actual economic behaviour or may, ex post, turn out to beclose to reality.Monetary policymaking is therefore complex. The two-pillar strategy chosen by the Eurosystem -where these pillars represent distinct, yet complementary, approaches - captures this complexity in anhonest and genuinely transparent manner.This naturally brings me to transparency - a topic of considerable and ongoing debate in the euro area.In my view, the transparency of the monetary policy process is best understood as the extent to whichthe external, presentational role of the strategy is consistent with the internal, decision-makingprocedure. As a party to both the decision-making and the presentation of the single monetary policy, Ican assure you that the correspondence between the internal and external aspects of the Eurosystem’sstrategy is extremely close. Discussions in the Governing Council take into account, on the one hand,an analysis of monetary developments and their implications for monetary policy and, on the other, anassessment of other financial and economic indicators, including macroeconomic projections based onconventional forecasting models and expert judgement. Comparisons are drawn and links are madebetween these two forms of analysis. Decisions are based on the information revealed through thisexercise. The two-pillar framework that is used to explain policy decisions to the public thereforemimics rather precisely the internal decision procedure. Honesty is thus at the heart of theEurosystem’s approach to communication.An inevitable consequence of our honesty in the face of a complex, uncertain and changingenvironment is that the ECB’s strategy cannot be simple, in the sense that it cannot be described usinga single indicator or forecast. We acknowledge that this can make our strategy more difficult tounderstand, especially at the outset. Sometimes the strategy is accused of lacking clarity on thegrounds that the two-pillar approach is rather complicated and therefore unclear. However, alternativestrategies would only achieve clarity in a superficial sense. Rather than being simple, they mayactually be simplistic - and therefore misleading.Drawing together these arguments, let me emphasise that a monetary policy strategy should not beseen as a machine that mechanically delivers policy decisions. There must be room for a diversity ofviews, for deliberation and for judgement in the Governing Council’s discussion. Monetary
5BIS Review 44/2000policymaking cannot be reduced to a reaction to a single figure, be it monetary growth or an inflationprojection taken from a model or a group of experts. Nor can monetary policy be formulated on thebasis of a single chart, however colourful. The ECB’s strategy provides scope for extensive debate andthe exercise of informed judgement, both of which are essential to policymaking. Taking an eclectic,more diversified approach to inform policy judgements - as is implicit in the two-pillar approach - islikely to lead to a better understanding of the economy, to produce better policy advice, allow betterpolicy discussions and therefore reduce the risk of policy errors. This robust approach to monetarypolicymaking is at the heart of the ECB’s strategy.The Eurosystem’s operational frameworkBefore concluding, I should also like to make a few additional remarks on the operational frameworkused to implement monetary policy decisions in the euro area. For good reasons, the design of theoperational framework was heavily influenced by the experience of NCBs prior to Monetary Union.Maintaining continuity with the pre-existing procedures and instruments was an importantconsideration. At the same time, the introduction of the single monetary policy offered an opportunityto design the operational framework afresh, ensuring that best practice was adopted throughout theeuro area.The resulting framework provides for a broad set of instruments and procedures to implementmonetary policy. Thus far, this framework has worked very effectively in clearly signalling the stanceof monetary policy and containing the volatility of short-term market interest rates. At the heart of theframework is the so-called “corridor” for the overnight market interest rate, which is defined by theinterest rates on the deposit and marginal lending facilities. With the help of the minimum reservesystem, the behaviour of the market rate within this corridor is smoothed, without recourse tofine-tuning interventions by the authorities that might be prejudicial to the market orientation of thesystem. With these features, the ECB has a very simple but probably also one of the most modernoperational frameworks in the world.Concluding remarksEarlier this month I participated in a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Nationale Bank vanBelgië/Banque Nationale de Belgique. Today we celebrate the Banque de France’s bicentenary. Itwould have been extremely foolish if the Eurosystem had not exploited the accumulated wisdom andexperience gained from the long and distinguished history of these institutions and those of the otherNCBs. As I have argued today, both the Eurosystem’s strategy and its operational framework haveexploited this wisdom to the full, while recognising the new and different challenges faced by thesingle monetary policy in the euro area.Let me therefore finish by again congratulating the Bank on its bicentenary, by expressing mygratitude to all those who have dedicated their time and effort to the achievement of Monetary Unionand, finally, by wishing the Bank another 200 successful years - and more - as an important and vitalcomponent of the Eurosystem.
1BIS Review 43/2000Bank of Japan’s May report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 19 May 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s view2The improvement in Japan’s economy is becoming distinct. Recovery has been observed in someareas of private demand, with business fixed investment continuing to increase gradually.With regard to exogenous demand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue to follow anupward trend due to steady developments in overseas economies, and public investment has started topick up reflecting the progress in the implementation of the supplementary budget for fiscal 1999. Asregards domestic private demand, housing investment is on a moderate declining trend, and recoveryin private consumption continues to be weak through lack of notable improvements in employmentand income conditions. Meanwhile, business fixed investment continues to increase gradually.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production is increasing, and corporateprofits and sentiment continue to improve. Firms as a whole still strongly feel that they have excesscapacity and employees, and that they should reduce their debts to restore financial soundness.Nevertheless, the number of firms that take positive action, such as increasing the amount of fixedinvestment, is increasing gradually, especially in high-growth sectors. Regarding employmentconditions, although the decrease in the number of employees and in wages is slowing, efforts byfirms to reduce personnel expenses have prolonged the severity of households’ income conditions.As for the outlook, public investment is likely to increase for some time. This, along with thefavorable financial environment created partly by the Bank’s monetary easing, is expected to continueunderpinning the economy. Moreover, net exports are likely to follow an upward trend reflecting therecovery of overseas economies, and it is also highly probable that business fixed investment willincrease gradually with an improvement in corporate profits and sentiment. However, housinginvestment is expected to continue declining moderately, and there seems to be no substantial changein firms’ stance to reduce personnel expenses. Hence, it may take some time for households’ incomeconditions to improve and, in turn, for private consumption to recover. In addition, since firms’prospects for sales remain modest, careful monitoring is still required to determine whether therecovery in business fixed investment is sustainable and whether it is likely to spread to a wider rangeof industries.With regard to prices, the rise in import prices is slowing, reflecting a temporary decline ininternational commodity prices such as crude oil prices. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstandingthe fall in prices of electric machinery, are somewhat strong mainly due to the rise in prices ofpetroleum and chemical products reflecting the increase in crude oil prices to date. Meanwhile,consumer prices continue to be somewhat weak due to the slight decrease in the prices ofprivate-sector services and the decline in prices of imported products reflecting the past appreciationof the yen. Corporate service prices are still falling slowly.As for the outlook, upward pressure on prices is likely to arise from the gradual improvement indomestic supply-demand balance and from the rise in crude oil prices. On the other hand, downward1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 17 May 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 17 May as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 43/20002pressure is expected from the long-term declining trend of machinery prices due to technologicalinnovations and from the fall in prices of imported products reflecting the past appreciation of the yen.On balance, overall prices are likely to remain unchanged. However, attention should still be paid tothe downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand, although the pressure has weakenedgiven some recovery in private demand.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has generally stayed near zero, and financial institutionshave been confident about the availability of overnight funds. The amount outstanding of funds in thecall money market has remained generally stable.Interest rates on term instruments have weakened somewhat. The Japan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds once rose above 1.8 percent in mid-April but then declined andare recently moving in the range of 1.7-1.8 percent. The yield spread between private bonds (bankdebentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds continues narrowing, primarily that betweenprivate bonds with relatively low credit ratings and government bonds.Stock prices on the whole recovered from a plunge triggered by a drop in U.S. stocks although theyshowed divergent movements by index.In the foreign exchange market, the yen strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar in mid-April butgenerally weakened thereafter. The yen is currently being traded in the range of 108-110 yen.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Given this, major banks are becoming more active in extending loans,while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is increasing in parallel with a recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result, creditdemand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending seems to remain sluggish although itsyear-on-year rate of decline slowed in April for the second consecutive month. Issuance of corporatebonds and CP has been steady.Money stock (M2+CDs) grew faster in April compared with the previous month on a year-on-yearbasis.In this financial environment, corporate financing conditions are easing, and the lending attitude offinancial institutions is perceived by firms as less severe. It continues to warrant careful monitoringhow these favorable developments in the corporate financing environment will affect economicactivities.
1BIS Review 43/2000Alan Greenspan: Evolving challenges for bankers and supervisorsRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the National Association of Urban Bankers, Urban Financial Services Coalition, SanFrancisco, (via videoconference), on 25 May 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to discuss with you the evolving challenges for bankers and supervisors posed byfinancial reform and continuing technological and financial innovation. Today the nation is enjoyingthe longest-running economic expansion in its history. The expansion has not only been unprecedentedin its duration, but also in its strength. Clearly the rapid technological innovation of the past decadehas played a strong role in the expansion’s endurance by improving labor productivity andopportunities for businesses to efficiently expand their output of goods and services. Economic growthhas also been supported by the strength and stability of our banking system, which recently recordedits eighth consecutive year of record earnings. The agility with which our banking system recoveredfrom the severe difficulties of the late 1980s and early 1990s to fulfill a critical intermediary role is atestament to its resilience. However, as our economy continues to evolve rapidly, bankingorganizations will need to continue to adapt to the changing needs of businesses and consumers. Inparticular, with the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, our financial services industry will bebetter able to meet those demands in the decades to come through prudent innovation.As an example of innovation and adaptation, I note that your own organization is widening its scope toinvite membership from the entire financial services industry. Broadening your reach to includeinsurance, brokerage and other financial services not only reflects market realities but should alsoassist in your endeavors to improve the economic development of underserved communities andpromote the professional growth of your members.While innovations and adaptations in our economy have helped create and prolong the prosperity weare now enjoying, they also bring to bear new challenges. Today I would like to provide a briefoverview of what I think are the key challenges, risks, and opportunities faced by bankers and theirsupervisors.To start, I would like to shift your attention from the vibrant economy and exceptional bankingconditions to some of the risks that are always present. For example, the lax standards, excesses andfraud present in the recent few recent bank failures show that even as most banks post record profits,the deposit insurance fund can still experience disproportionate losses from undisciplined institutions.The high cost of recent failures reinforces lessons of the past for banks and supervisors, including theneed for continuous vigilance against causes of bank failure such as fraud, credit concentrations andrapid entry into new and unfamiliar activities.In addition to these risks, institutions face the challenge of fighting both complacency and competitivepressures with regard to their lending practices. There are some recent indications that the industry isaware of these challenges. The most recent Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surveysuggests that banking organizations are becoming more sensitized to risk and are continuing to firmtheir lending practices. In particular, the percentage of domestic banks tightening standards oncommercial and industrial (C&I) loans was the largest since the November 1998 survey. In addition,risk premiums on C&I loans have also risen. While firming loan standards and terms is one techniquefor managing credit risk, sound risk-management systems also involve testing the performance ofborrowers under more stressful conditions to reveal weaknesses. When strong conditions largely maskthe susceptibility of marginal borrowers, stress testing is invaluable for revealing the magnitude ofportfolio risk posed by more challenging economic conditions.Other factors that are important for strong asset quality include maintaining adequate pricing amidstfierce competition from other banks and non-banks alike. Some organizations are responding to thesepressures by moving lower on the credit quality spectrum in a reach for higher nominal yields. In a
BIS Review 43/20002special question added to the latest lending survey, banks indicated that demand for C&I loans hassomewhat strengthened as below-investment-grade borrowers have found unfavorable conditions inthe high-yield bond market and have turned to banks as an alternative. The majority of banks reportingadditional demand from these borrowers also indicated that they were fairly receptive to thesecustomers. While lending to higher-risk borrowers presents opportunities, banks must ensure that theirrisk-management systems can properly discern the difference between nominal and risk-adjustedyields, identify credit concentrations, and allocate enough capital and reserves to offset the higher riskof these loans. Banks without these safeguards, as well as limits and adequate tracking and reporting tosenior management and their boards, have in the past experienced significant problems and sometimesfailure.Credit quality issues are not the only areas of supervisory focus. The trend of narrowing interestmargins at many banks has been coupled with lengthening asset maturities and declining coredeposits. The erosion in bank core deposits is to some extent attributable to competitive pressure fromthe marked rise in equity values and mutual funds. In addition, as run-off of lower-cost deposits hasbeen replaced with higher-cost funding from capital markets, pressures on interest margins andliquidity have intensified. Moreover, the decline in stable core deposits and the steady rise in averageasset maturities has resulted in higher levels of interest rate risk, a trend evident in our surveillancescreens. Banking organizations with strong risk management systems will of course carefully evaluatehow these asset/liability trends are affecting their performance and risk profile and take mitigatingsteps as appropriate.As competitive pressures have intensified, large and small banks alike have sought solutions bybroadening the variety of products they offer and delivering them through innovative deliverychannels such as the Internet. Interestingly, though conventional wisdom would suggest that smallercommunity banks would be at a disadvantage in the competitive financial services arena, this has notbeen the case. By forging cooperative alliances with technology, insurance, brokerage and other firms,community banks have kept up with larger organizations in providing their customers with thediversity of financial tools and products they demand without the attendant fixed start-up costs.Moreover, while larger organizations may have some advantage over smaller banks through theirbrand identity and larger budgets for technology and marketing, community banks are more likely tohave a comparative advantage in understanding the diverse needs of their customer base and in theirability to respond quickly with personalized service.More fully recognizing and responding to customer needs is particularly important when viewed in thecontext of trends in wealth formation in our economy. The Federal Reserve’s most recent Survey ofConsumer Finances suggests that although the current economic expansion resulted in broad gains inmedian household wealth between 1995 and 1998, families with low-to-moderate incomes andminorities do not appear to have fully benefited. For example, median net worth declined over thisperiod for families with incomes below $25,000, and medians for non-whites and Hispanics were littlechanged. In addition, lower-income families were less likely to own homes, which constitute the bulkof the value of assets for those below the top quintile according to income. Despite these troublingindications, there were some encouraging signs. In particular, the share of families with incomesbelow $25,000 fell from 41% in 1995 to 37% in 1998, and more families within that lower-incomegroup reported that they had a checking account. Moreover, home-ownership rates among minoritieshave risen. For example, according to U.S. Census data, home-ownership rates among blacks rosefrom 43% in 1995 to 48% in the first quarter of 2000, suggesting that some progress has been made inaccess to credit for minorities.Although breaking down the barriers that have produced disparities in income and wealth is notsimple, promoting equal access to credit for sound borrowers is one step in the right direction. As Ihave said previously, discrimination is against the interests of business - yet business people too oftenpractice it. To the extent that market participants discriminate, they erect barriers to the free flow ofcapital and labor to their most profitable employment, and the distribution of output is distorted. In theend, costs are higher, less real output is produced, and national wealth accumulation is slowed. Byremoving the non-economic distortions that arise as a result of discrimination, we can generate higherreturns to both human and physical capital. Banking and other lending organizations that develop
3BIS Review 43/2000expertise to tap, educate, and encourage underserved customers are likely to provide better and moreinformed access to credit and expand profit opportunities. In that regard, many banks are wellequipped to tailor their services to individual customer circumstances in a personalized setting and toeducate customers about various products and services that could help them achieve their financialgoals.In today’s more complex world, the diversity of financial product choices facing consumers is trulyastonishing. Similarly, banks are now also facing much broader choices, especially when oneconsiders the opportunities presented by the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. By modernizingour banking laws and making them more consistent with marketplace realities and the needs ofconsumers, the financial services industry will be able to grow and innovate with far fewer artificialconstraints. How various financial service providers choose to take advantage of the act will be one ofthe more interesting dynamics as our financial system evolves in the years ahead.Clearly, many franchises can succeed by continuing to focus on traditional banking. Organizations thatdecide to depart from past successful strategies by expanding into new activities should do so onlyafter careful consideration. As of mid-May, 270 domestic banking organizations and 17 foreignbanking organizations had filed to become financial holding companies. Of those, roughlythree-quarters had less than one billion dollars in assets. I suspect that many of these organizations arenot intending to immediately launch into full-scale brokerage, venture capital, or insurance activities,but rather are looking to keep their options open and retain flexibility should opportunities presentthemselves.If true, that is encouraging, for it is one thing to gain FHC status and begin cautiously experimentingwith these new powers, and quite another to take on the risks related to full-scale acquisitions orextremely rapid growth of new businesses. Whichever configuration financial firms choose,translating the traditional and new financial powers into longer-term economic value for customersand shareholders will be the leading challenge in the coming decades.In this changing environment, supervisors will be challenged to adapt and refine their programs toaccommodate both innovations in traditional banking and new activities permitted by the act. Thesupervisory strategy for addressing banking innovations of the past decade has been a risk-focusedapproach that moves well beyond earlier, one-size-fits-all examinations to achieve what we believe isa more effective and less burdensome process. The risk-focused approach has also been tailored todistinguish between larger, more complex banking organizations, on the one hand, and the moretraditional regional and community organizations on the other. The large, complex companies arereceiving a more continuous level of oversight given the rapidly shifting risk profiles that can resultfrom their operations, while well-capitalized and well-managed regional and community organizationsreceive a greater degree of off-site monitoring and less frequent on-site visitations, consistent withstatutory mandates. I should emphasize that these programs are not meant to be implemented in a rigidfashion; institutions that have characteristics that fall somewhere in the middle of the two programswould be flexibly accommodated through adjustments to our supervisory plan for the institution. Thatkind of flexibility will be essential with the emergence of smaller financial holding companies and theexpanded range of permissible activities. Clearly, these two broad supervisory programs will needfurther customization or segmentation to respond to the evolving diversity of our supervisory caseload.Another area where supervisors are attempting to more appropriately align risks with regulatoryapproaches is capital. You may be aware that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision andRegulation is working to refine and improve the risk-based capital measure to make it more sensitiveto the underlying risks of various banking activities. As you might surmise, those efforts are likely toresult in a revised framework that is geared toward the kinds of exposures and risk-managementsystems typical of internationally active institutions. For these organizations, the benefits from moreprecisely aligning risks with capital charges, we trust, will outweigh the substantial costs of addedcomplexity. However, for community banks with traditional exposures, the costs of such acomplicated framework will likely outweigh any benefits, and hence it will be impractical toimplement.
BIS Review 43/20004This has led to the consideration of a dual or bifurcated approach to capital that parallels our approachto supervision. Such an approach would recognize the potential tension between the complexity andcost of the next version of the international capital standards and the more limited needs of smaller,more traditional banks. Implementing a second, more streamlined capital adequacy standard forqualifying domestic institutions would seem to have merit. Discussions on such an approach are onlypreliminary, but the arguments for continuing to more fully calibrate our supervisory and regulatoryapproaches to the nature and risk profiles of the institutions we supervise are compelling.Capital standards and the supervisory process are two of the three key tools regulators use to get theirjob done. The third tool, disclosure, holds promise for yielding benefits to our financial system bothdomestically and globally. In past decades, the business of banking was fairly opaque butstraightforward, with banking risks largely embedded in the credit judgments inherent in the loanportfolio. Today, with the explosion in financial innovation that has created various derivative,securitization, insurance, and other structured products and the greater diversity in activities permittedby the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, not only are risks more opaque, but even when revealed, sometimesdifficult to interpret.Fortunately, the same technology and financial techniques that have created this added complexity canalso be harnessed to produce more meaningful disclosures that allow markets to analyze risks andexert discipline on those that would take on imprudent levels of exposure. While not a panacea,improved disclosure can complement the supervisory process and regulatory capital, and obviate moreintrusive investigations, holding out the promise of less supervisory intervention. Recently, the FederalReserve, in collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of theComptroller of the Currency, established a private-sector working group to review industry bestpractices and develop options for improving the public disclosure of financial information by large,complex banking and securities organizations. Enhanced disclosures are also being pursued throughregulatory reporting. A proposal to be released shortly will eliminate less meaningful items on the CallReport and request additional information on activities of growing significance for some institutions,including loan servicing, securitizations, venture capital, and insurance. More relevant regulatorydisclosures should not only improve transparency but should also help our off-site monitoring andtailoring of our supervisory program.In closing then, we live in a fascinating period in American history, in which rapid change will forcebusiness and government to continuously reevaluate previously held assumptions and adapt to change.There is no static, optimum model either for financial service providers or for financial regulators, asboth are engaged in a continuously evolving process. I am optimistic that recent financial reforms andcontinuing innovations will translate into more useful financial products and services to a broaderspectrum of consumers and businesses and, in turn, fuller participation by all segments of our societyin the kind of economic progress we have experienced to date.
1BIS Review 42/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The future of banking supervisionand the integration of financial marketsSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the conferenceorganised by Euro Group entitled “Improving integration of financial markets in Europe”, held inTurin, on 22 May 2000.*      *      *I should like to thank the organisers for the opportunity to participate in this interesting event. We arehere to discuss the important and profound changes taking place in the banking industry and financialmarkets worldwide. In Europe, these changes have been significantly intensified by the introduction ofthe euro. I wish to offer my remarks today on the issue of preserving financial stability for the euroarea in this rapidly changing environment.Ensuring effective banking supervision and crisis prevention plays a key role in this respect, and isfacing challenges from two major sources: the internationalisation of financial activities and thegeographical split between the jurisdiction of monetary policy and banking supervision. The monetarypolicy function now embraces the 11 countries that have adopted the euro, while supervision remains anational responsibility. This situation introduced by the Maastricht Treaty is a novelty; it does not havehistorical precedents.It is the view of the ECB that the existing institutional arrangements can provide an adequate andflexible basis for safeguarding financial stability - also in the future. However, the practicalfunctioning of supervision needs to be developed and cooperation between competent authoritiesneeds to be enhanced in order to ensure the effective execution of supervision and corrective action inthe increasingly integrated euro area financial system. Moreover, authorities should be able to take anarea-wide - or even a global - view whenever the situation so requires. The desirability of theseenhancements is also acknowledged in the recent report on financial stability prepared by theEconomic and Financial Committee and endorsed by the ECOFIN Council at its meeting on8 April 2000.Let me proceed by describing in more detail the two challenges for supervision that I just mentioned.After that, I should like to evaluate the necessary steps for promoting adequate cooperation andcoordination among the authorities concerned.Increasing cross-border bankingThere is no doubt that the introduction of the euro has fostered the internationalisation of bankingactivities. In particular, the rapid integration of the wholesale and capital markets, as well aslarge-value payment systems, has already produced more and new kinds of linkages among banks. Asa result, banks are increasingly exposed to risks originating from abroad, and risks to financial stabilityare less and less confined to national borders.The most substantial increase in cross-border activity and market integration has taken place inwholesale activities. For example, the currency-based segmentation of the markets for unsecuredinterbank deposits disappeared very quickly after the euro was introduced. The differences inquotation spreads across countries fell during the first weeks of 1999 to an average of around twobasis points from significantly higher levels. These spreads are deemed to indicate normal thresholds,beyond which arbitrage is no longer profitable. Wider price differentials still prevail in the repomarket, reflecting lower liquidity and remaining segmentation of the national markets owing to legaland other factors.Market integration has not only been reflected in price quotations, but also in trading volumes. Theshare of cross-border transactions currently accounts for more than 50% of overall activity in both the
BIS Review 42/20002unsecured and repo markets. Some large institutions are starting to act as “money centre” banksassuming an area-wide scope of activity. The smaller institutions still mainly operate with theirdomestic counterparts, but nonetheless benefit from the equalised market conditions. Accordingly, theshare of cross-border transactions in the large-value payment transfers through the TARGET systemhas been increasing - from 36% in the first quarter of 1999 to 41% in the fourth quarter. The valuesexchanged cross-border are of substantial magnitude. The average daily value of TARGETcross-border payments is close to 400 billion euro, representing mostly interbank payments. Inaddition, a large amount of payments is channelled through EURO 1 (EBA) and Euro AccessFrankfurt.In addition to the single monetary policy and the creation of the single risk-free yield curve, two mainreasons explain the rapid integration of the wholesale activities in the euro area - of the market forunsecured interbank deposits in particular. First, the smooth functioning of the settlement ofcross-border payments, mainly performed through the TARGET system, allows banks to trade safelythroughout the euro area. Second, the swift acceptance of euro area indices (EONIA and Euribor)forms a common basis for pricing. The experience with TARGET demonstrates the importance of themarket infrastructure in allowing arbitrage to operate effectively. The unsecured market can relyentirely on TARGET for settlement, while no similar integrated system exists for the clearing andsettlement of securities and for managing collateral at the cross-border level, relevant for repotransactions and for all securities transactions in general. For instance, there are currently 22 securitiessettlement systems in the euro area, facing increasing demands for consolidation.The broadening of the market size and increasing share of cross-border transactions has had a positiveimpact on financial stability. If there were only a few market participants and the concentration of theinterbank liabilities were high, the likelihood of a bank failure having stronger repercussions on theviability of other institutions would be greater. In addition, the wider euro area money markets cannow absorb liquidity shortages more easily than before, as banks can borrow more readily fromforeign institutions. However, if some banks should nonetheless enter into a distressed situation, theprobability of the problem spilling over to other euro area countries is significantly greater than before.The wholesale market is a major channel of the transmission of potential financial instabilities.Moreover, the existence of a common framework for accessing central bank liquidity is tying togethereuro area financial institutions to a much larger extent than usually recognised.Let me now turn from wholesale activities to banks’ customer businesses. As European banks aretypically universal banks, they combine at a single institution a wide range of products. The marketsfor these products have varying degrees of integration - some are already global or European, whileothers have remained national or even local. At least the major banks already operate in stronglyinternationalised markets for a number of their products and already have geographically diversifiedactivities. This makes them subject to various influences originating from outside their nationalmarkets. Even if banks remain nationally based, they are increasingly subject to international marketdevelopments and the national tendencies are increasingly influenced by international developments.Hence, the usual argument that cross-border mergers and acquisitions are a necessary condition inorder to achieve a more integrated and international banking system does not seem very strong.In particular, many of the asset management and investment banking services are already quiteinternationalised, as the capital markets have taken strong steps towards integration and growth afterthe introduction of the euro. Banks’ own securities holdings have also become increasingly diversifiedacross borders. The trend has been quite strong for government paper, as well as for corporate bonds.The amount of instruments issued by other euro area governments rose by 38% in 1999, and those byfirms located in other euro area countries by 23% in banks’ portfolios.To take an example of the financial services provided by banks in the capital market area, the leadingunderwriters of bonds issued by European firms are the major European banks, alongside the largestUS investment banks. The “league” in which these players compete is clearly not a domestic one.Another example - which is especially telling of integration - can be drawn from the rapidly expandingnew European markets for technology and growth companies. Underwriting the Initial PublicOfferings (IPOs) of this type of firm is the kind of service where we should expect the greatest degree
3BIS Review 42/2000of national segmentation, since the companies are usually accessing the capital market for the firsttime - possibly as captive customers of local banks. However, the new listings during the first monthsof the present year show that in most cases a foreign institution was present alongside a domestic one.There are significant economies of scale associated with the shift in the dimension of the capitalmarkets from national to euro area-wide. This seems to have already been one significant motivebehind the recent bank mergers and acquisitions, also in the case of the deals that have taken placewithin national borders. Although most mergers have been domestic, cross-border deals also increasedin importance in 1999.By contrast with the services provided to other financial institutions and large corporations, retailactivities referring to personal customers and small and medium-sized firms are still quite stronglyconfined to national borders. Within the euro area, both lending and deposit-taking by banks arelargely conducted with domestic residents - 91% of loans and 87% of deposits still refer to domesticcounterparties. Nevertheless, internationalisation is also progressing in this area; the business withcustomers located in other euro area countries is growing faster than the domestic business in respectof all major balance sheet items of banks.Separation of central banking and supervision in EMUI should like to discuss next the relation between central banking and supervision in the newinstitutional framework defined by the Treaty. As I mentioned, the third stage of Economic andMonetary Union introduced a geographical separation of monetary policy and banking supervision - inaddition to the possible functional separation of the two functions that already existed in somecountries. This is the case because, for the euro area as a whole, banking supervision is now entrustedto institutions that have no independent monetary policy functions (even if they are central banks) andthe Eurosystem has neither direct responsibility for supervising banks nor for banking system stability.The main risk entailed in this institutional setting is the potential absence of an area-wide perspectiveof the banking and financial sector for the euro area.The national central banks continue to be strongly involved in the supervisory tasks: only in three euroarea countries - Belgium, Luxembourg and Finland - is the national central bank not directly involvedin banking supervision. In all other eight countries, they are extensively or even exclusively entrustedwith banking supervisory tasks.Let me be a little more specific about the role and interests of the Eurosystem. One could say that theEurosystem plays the role normally reserved for the central bank in countries where it does not havedirect responsibility for supervision - such as the Bank of England after the creation of the FinancialServices Authority. In this context, central banks still maintain a vital interest in a stable bankingindustry and closely monitor its developments and major systemic risks. This stems from the fact thatthe banking industry is the key channel for the transmission of monetary policy, the counterpart ofmonetary policy operations, and the main provider of payment services, which all relate to the basiccentral banking tasks.Therefore, the Eurosystem is keen to see its actions complemented by an effective conduct of thesupervisory function by the competent supervisory authorities. Central banks are keen to be sure thatsupervision is conducted in such a way as to ensure that banking problems do not jeopardise theconduct of monetary policy. This interest is clearly recognised by the Treaty, which assigns to theEurosystem and the ECB some tasks relating to prudential supervision and financial stability. TheEurosystem has the duty to “contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by competentauthorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financialsystem”. Given the separation between monetary and supervisory jurisdictions, this provision isclearly intended to ensure a smooth interplay between the two. In addition, the ECB must be consultedon any draft Community and national legislation in the fields of banking supervision and financialstability, and the ECB can provide, on its own initiative, advice on the scope and implementation ofthe Community legislation in these fields. Central banks are normally involved in the process of
BIS Review 42/20004drawing up legislation relating to, for example, regulatory standards, safety net arrangements andsupervision, since this legislation contributes crucially to the attainment of financial stability.Moreover, in the event of a financial crisis, the possible provision of emergency liquidity assistance,which is the responsibility of the competent national authorities, may have an effect on the commonmonetary policy, which is the direct competence of the Eurosystem. To limit central bankinterventions and the associated moral hazard problems, it is necessary for crisis preventionmechanisms to be in good shape. Also for this reason, the Eurosystem needs to be assured of effectivebanking supervision and crisis prevention. In general, the crucial issue is that the risk managementsystems of individual institutions guarantee their safety and soundness, and the supervisors shouldassure themselves of this fact.Enhanced cooperation neededAt the moment, banking supervision relies on national arrangements that still show a wide range offeatures. Furthermore, the strategies for corrective actions in cases of bank fragility vary acrosscountries. Having supervision located at a national level - closest to the institutions that can give riseto financial stability concerns - favours timely access to information and allows detailed monitoring ofbanks’ activities. At the same time, the principle of cooperation between the responsible authorities isforcefully stated in the EU Single Market legislation, and several Directives establish a number ofcommon regulations, in order to avoid the drawbacks of a fully decentralised approach vis-à-vis anincreasingly integrated market.Hence, we could say that cooperation is already a “second pillar” of the supervisory framework,alongside national competence. Bilateral cooperation has been established through a nexus ofmemoranda of understanding. In addition, supervisory forums for multilateral cooperation have beenset up. The Banking Supervision Committee of the European System of Central Banks is the keypresent forum for this form of cooperation. It is composed of the representatives of the bankingsupervisory authorities of the EU countries, either forming part of the respective NCB or separatebodies, and the ECB. The Committee facilitates cooperation among supervisors and the exchange ofinformation between supervisors and the Eurosystem, and assists the Eurosystem in performing itsduties in this field. The Committee has already established its functions and developed activities inseveral useful fields. It has also published a number of reports dealing with the structural changes andsystemic concerns in the EU banking system. Another forum for dealing with multilateral cooperationis the Groupe de Contact, a group of EU banking supervisory authorities which, for many years, hasalso discussed individual banking cases in a multilateral way, but at a lower organisational level thanthe high-level Banking Supervision Committee.The need for multilateral cooperation has been strengthened by the introduction of the euro. In fact, Iam convinced that the only way the supervisory function is able to cope effectively with the increasingintegration and to bridge the potential shortcomings arising from the geographical separation ofmonetary policy and banking supervision, is for the competent authorities to enhance their multilateralcooperation.What should be achieved through multilateral cooperation? Ideally, a situation should be reached inwhich the group of European supervisors works collectively as effectively as a single supervisor, whenneeded. This is required when the problems involved are area-wide - because of the institutions ormarkets involved - or there are concerns of systemic problems spreading across borders. Multilateralcooperation can also enhance the quality of supervision by examining common trends in the financialsystem that may not be revealed from the national perspective only.We need to strengthen cooperation between supervisors and central banks to ensure that, if problemsat a major bank or a financial group have contagion effects in other countries, this information iseffectively distributed to the relevant authorities and - possibly - common solutions are sought. Thesedevelopments were seen as vital in the recent report on financial stability prepared by the Economicand Financial Committee, which I have already mentioned.
5BIS Review 42/2000I see the Banking Supervision Committee as a natural forum for the deepening of cooperation alongthese lines. It allows a smooth interplay between EU authorities involved in safeguarding financialstability and it is in a good position to address these issues, since both supervisory and monetaryauthorities need to be involved in the cooperation. The Bank for International Settlements is currentlyfostering the discussion of issues of common interest to supervisors and central banks from a globalperspective.The national differences in the tools and style of supervision are not harmful, as long as there iseffective cooperation, which allows supervisors to exchange views and to select best practices. Agreater convergence of supervisory practices needs to be pursued in order to increase the effectivenessof the instruments aimed at preventing instability in a more integrated market for banking services.Another important tendency, which I have not addressed in my remarks, is the ever-closer linkagesand blurring differences between banking and other forms of financial activity. In some countries - butnot all - financial conglomerates have also gained important market positions. To this end, it is usefuland reassuring that the EU Commission has started work in the area of regulation of financialconglomerates. Moreover, it has facilitated a round table discussion among the Chairs of theCommittees of the different disciplines: banking, securities market and insurance.Finally, it is important that the ministries of finance and supervisory authorities regularly exchangeviews on the adequacy and necessary adjustments of financial regulation - as they already do - in thecontext of the relevant European regulatory fora, as well as in the national context. Central banks alsocontribute to this area of work, as I have already indicated.To summarise, the present institutional setting for banking supervision in the euro area can cope withthe challenges brought about by the increasingly integrated banking and financial system, as well asthe issues raised by the separation of monetary policy and supervisory functions. However,cooperation between competent authorities needs to be further stepped up in order to ensure theeffective supervision and preservation of financial stability. Will the extensive cooperation necessaryfor the system to be effective actually materialise? I am confident that it will. Both supervisors andcentral bankers are well aware of the new environment in which their tasks and responsibilities nowhave to be performed.
1BIS Review 41/2000Dr A H E M Wellink: Introduction to the press conferenceon the 1999 Annual ReportSpeech by Mr A H E M Wellink, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, at the press conference, held inAmsterdam on 17 May 2000.*      *      *The world economy is in good shape. In 1999 GDP growth came out at 3%, exceeding expectations.Yet, this overall pattern masks a number of risks and uncertainties. The motor driving the exceptionalUS economic performance - at the same time the motor driving the world economy - is in danger ofbecoming overheated. Southeast Asia recorded a rapid recovery from the financial crisis, but theJapanese performance remains weak. The first half of 2000, however, holds out better prospects.In Europe, too, economic performance is improving. In 1999 GDP growth reached 2.3%. Thoughseemingly low compared to the 3% growth rate of the world economy, it should be noted thatEuropean growth accelerated considerably in the course of 1999. For the current year, a robust growthrate of 3-3.5% is expected. Thus, prospects for Europe are bright, definitely so if the structural reformpolicies are continued and the renewal of the economy, so evident in the United States, progressesfurther in Europe as well. There are no grounds to suppose that the ICT train will bypass Europe,provided, of course, that we see to it that we are well prepared. Despite the movements in the euro’sexternal value, Europe may pride itself on a successful first year of monetary union. First andforemost, prospects for price stability in the euro area remain favourable, thanks not least to thesuccess of the ECB: whoever would have thought two or three years ago that the launch of the eurowould be as smooth as it has proved to be? In addition, Europe’s vulnerability to external shocks, suchas the Asia crisis, has undeniably diminished as a consequence of monetary union.Good, better, best: in the Netherlands, we may meanwhile be doing too well. The Dutch economy isexperiencing its most prolonged cyclical upturn in fifty years’ time, due in part to the consumerspending impulse emanating from higher asset prices. For 1999 this impulse may be roughly estimatedat NLG 10 billion (1.25% of GDP). In a sense, the situation in our country is comparable with that inthe United States. We have now reached a point where caution is called for. In order to prevent theeconomy from overheating, it is first of all required that, apart from those already decided on, nofurther fiscal impulses should be provided; phrased differently, higher-than-expected revenues are tobe reflected in lower public debt levels. Second, moderate wage movements are to be ensured. Eventhen, the new tax system for 2001 will boost average purchasing power by 4% or even more,representing a powerful stimulus for consumption.Many commentators view the new millennium as the start of a “new economy”. ICT developmentswill undoubtedly have a major impact on world economic performance; still, there is no indicationwhatever suggesting that economic laws have become fundamentally different. For this reason, and inorder to be able to benefit to the full from the renewing economy, we must continue the structuralreform policies (further improving the operation of the labour market, especially on the supply side,and of a number of product markets). More in general, policies must remain geared towards theachievement of well-balanced global macro-economic conditions (low inflation, more equilibratedbalance-of-payments positions). We may well count our blessings, but should not close our eyes toreality.
1BIS Review 41/2000Guy Quaden: Recent developments in the Belgian economySpeech delivered by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, on the occasion ofthe celebration of the National Bank of Belgium’s 150th anniversary, Brussels, on 12 May 2000.*      *      *Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear friends,I should like to begin by telling you how delighted and proud I am, as are the other members of theBoard of Directors and the Council of Regency of our Bank.First, I am delighted to see so many friends of the National Bank of Belgium coming to Brussels thisafternoon to celebrate the 150th anniversary of our institution with us. Friends who have come fromBelgium, elsewhere in Europe, the rest of the world; from the world of public and private finance, butalso from the political, economic, social and academic world.Allow me to express my special thanks to my colleagues and friends, the governors of the variousgroups to which the National Bank of Belgium belong: the European System of Central Banks, theG10, the Belgian Constituency at the International Monetary Fund. All are present or represented here.The world of central banks is exceptional because of its position at the boundary between the State andthe markets, between action and deliberation, and between tradition and modernity, but it is alsoexceptional in the fellowship which prevails there. I am glad to be a part of that.Next I would like to tell you how proud I am, how proud we are, of two things. First, we are proud tobe the guardians of a long and illustrious history, the history of an institution which, as the PrimeMinister reminded us in his speech and as the video we have just seen also showed, has made apositive and substantial contribution not only to the economic and financial history of Belgium, butalso to European unification and international monetary cooperation.In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the three people who have preceded me at the head of ourinstitution, whom we are delighted to have here with us this afternoon: Cécil de Strycker, JeanGodeaux, Alfons Verplaetse.In the second place, we are proud that, right from the start, the National Bank of Belgium has becomea member of the European System of Central Banks and more specifically the Eurosystem, which, inmanaging the new common European currency, links the European Central Bank and the elevennational central banks which are currently members. This represents the realisation of a great politicaland economic dream, and the National Bank of Belgium is proud to have contributed to it, both inplanning the arrangements at European level and in ensuring that our country satisfied the conditionsfor membership. It was vital that Belgium should meet the convergence criteria: the fact that itsucceeded is, of course, due primarily to the effort made by its people, but also to the pursuit of anappropriate economic, fiscal and monetary policy in which the central bank lent its assistance togetherwith the political authorities. We have also been successful in preparing with the sectors concerned forthe introducion of cashless transactions in euros.There has been a marked strengthening of economic growth in the euro area in general, and inBelgium in particular, over the past year. Business and consumer confidence has now reached recordlevels. Of course, the euro cannot take all the credit for this welcome change of climate. Theinternational environment has also improved. But the introduction of the euro has contributed to thisrevival of growth by giving the area a stable internal environment, by irrevocably fixing the mutualparities of eleven currencies, damping down inflation and curbing budget deficits. And the fact thatgrowth is strong, confidence buoyant and inflation low, also proves to my mind that the monetarypolicy of the new Eurosystem has not been inadapted.The appreciable gain in stability brought about by the euro was particularly evident in Belgium. Youwill recall that in the middle of last year our country was the victim of a localised or asymmetric
BIS Review 41/20002economic shock: the dioxin crisis. As I have already said, it is thanks to the euro that the macro-economic cost of that crisis was very small. Without the introduction of the single currency, it ishighly probable that the exchange rate of the Belgian franc and the level of interest rates in our countrywould have come under pressure. The consequences of that crisis would have extended far beyond theboundaries of the sectors directly concerned.Here in Belgium, our motto is: strength in unity. At the National Bank of Belgium, we are certainlynot nostalgic for a monetary sovereignty which in any case had become largely illusory for highlyintegrated small and medium-sized economies. The switch to a single monetary policy, decided by theGoverning Council of the European Central Bank, did not mean any loss of monetary power forBelgium: on the contrary, since the Government and the Bank had decided ten years ago to peg theBelgian franc to the most stable European currency, Belgium was in reality already importing itsmonetary policy from Frankfurt. The difference is that, today, our monetary policy continues to bedecided in that same city, but around a different table at which there is at least one Belgian. Moreover,the implementation of monetary policy is decentralised. And being closer to their respective nationalterritories, the affiliated central banks retain an inimitable role in their contact with the financialplayers, and in communicating with the general public.In the Eurosystem, which is not modelled on any other existing central bank, the principle ofsubsidiarity prevails; that is a principle to which we, and I imagine our other partners, too, are deeplyattached. It means that the European Central Bank has to be allocated all the resources which it needsfor the proper performance of the tasks entrusted to it, but that the national authorities retaincompetence over the tasks not assigned to it.One would distort the character of the monetary union if one tried to force a move towardscentralisation contrary to the provisions of the Treaty and one would thus deprive the monetary unionof its democratic legitimacy. True, like any man-made edifice which aims to last, monetary union isbound to evolve. But if we want this edifice to remain legitimate, any proposed changes must be setout in totally clear terms, and on each occasion we shall need to check that the citizens approve ofthose changes.Studying the national and international economic environment, issuing banknotes and coins, includingin our case printing banknotes, and controlling and sometimes actually developing reliable andefficient payment systems are three activities closely linked with monetary policy, activities which theNational Bank of Belgium developed long ago and which we intend to continue to pursue incooperation with our partners in the Eurosystem.Moreover, modern central banks are rarely just central banks. They are also enterprises providingservices for public authorities, the financial world and the national economy as a whole. However, theNational Bank of Belgium stands out from many of its colleagues in the diversity of the public servicefunctions which the legislative body has entrusted to it for various reasons, notably the Bank’sacknowledged expertise. In passing, I would say that in view of this diverse range of activities, certainhastily drawn comparisons concerning the number of staff used by each central bank are inapt.The National Bank of Belgium acts as the State Cashier. In its Central Balance Sheet and CreditOffices it gathers and processes information on enterprises and individuals, and its statistical tasksexpanded considerably in connection with the modernisation of the Belgian statistical system,launched in 1994; in particular, since that time the Bank has been responsible in particular for theforeign trade statistics and for compiling the national accounts.Two key features are characteristic of the recent evolution of many central banks including our own:the banks have to contend with increased pressure of competition and they enjoy greaterindependence. These changes require us to modify our behaviour.Most of our activities, be they connected with monetary policy or other functions in the public interest,are naturally affected nowadays by the establishment of monetary union, but also by the spread of newtechnologies and the concentration taking place in the financial sector. Having long been shelteredfrom competition, the central banks, too, are now inhabiting a more competitive environment. Whilethey still hold a monopoly on the issue of banknotes, notes are less and less predominant as means of
3BIS Review 41/2000payment. Also, membership of the Eurosystem is naturally encouraging a process of benchmarkingand emulation among the various member central banks.The ethos of an enterprise such as ours has centred on optimum quality of service. This is an aspect ofexcellence which we must, of course, preserve. But at the same time, greater attention is required tothe cost effectiveness of our service. The concern about our production costs is nothing new, but it hasincreased.Under the Maastricht Treaty, the countries of Europe also opted for the model of a European centralbank alongside national central banks with a large degree of independence. According to this idea,once the central bankers have been appointed by the political authority - because, fortunately, they donot coopt themselves - they act to the best of their knowledge and belief, without seeking or acceptingany instructions, in taking the decisions which they consider most appropriate for attaining theobjectives assigned to them by the Treaty on European Union and the national laws.Most people believe that such a system ensures the optimum credibility and effectiveness for monetarypolicy, in particular making it possible to keep interest rates relatively low. But this greater autonomyalso entails greater obligations for us: we are aware of these and I shall pay particular attention tothem. First, there is the obligation to be more conscientious than ever about ensuring objectivity andtotal impartiality in our analyses, decisions and recommendations. Then there is the obligation torender regular and clear account for our actions, to be unflagging in explaining our actions and, ifpossible, winning support, because the ultimate foundation of the independence of a central bank isnot a law, nor even a treaty, but the acceptance by the people concerned of the policy beingimplemented.With this in mind, I think it was among others wise to keep the Bank’s Council of Regency inexistence, even if it has finally lost all monetary power. It offers an irreplaceable opportunity fordialogue between the directors of the central bank and the experts representing the main spheres ofBelgian society.The Bank’s board of directors have duties towards the population; they also have duties towards thestaff of the Bank. The standards expected of the Bank and its staff are traditionally high and have beenaccentuated by the profound changes which I have already mentioned. We need to adapt ourorganisation without being over-hasty but also without dragging our feet, because anticipatingprobable developments is the best way of controlling them.Our staff, thanks to whom the switch to monetary union, in particular, was successfully accomplished,work hard and efficiently, and we still expect a great deal of them in meeting the challenges ahead andfulfilling our ambitions. But we must also be able to define for our staff - and this must be done incollaboration with our partners in the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem - clear prospects forthe foreseeable future, without which, we know, enthusiasm could give way to bitterness.My colleagues on the Board of Directors and I myself have held a strategic reflection aimed atincreasing the quality of the Bank’s response to today’s challenges, and especially the challenges oftomorrow. That reflection will shortly be extended, by degrees, to include all our staff. I have no doubtthat they will enrich the discussion and that together we shall be able to realise the objective of a bankthat is ever better equipped to meet the expectations of Belgian society, and to maintain its position inthe concert of Europe and in international cooperation.We shall probably need to specialise more, perhaps giving up certain activities; we shall undoubtedlyneed to adjust the scale of others, but we shall also have to develop our action in fields whoseimportance is increasing. I will give two examples.The National Bank of Belgium like all central banks, has since long shown an interest in the securityand stability of the financial system. But due to its integration in the European System of CentralBanks, the Bank has been given an explicit responsibility in this field and the Belgian law has recentlyentrusted the Bank with the surveillance (or “oversight”) of payment systems and securities clearingsystems.
BIS Review 41/20004To prevent excessive debts the Government has also decided in principle to set up a “positive” creditcentre, responsible for registering all credits taken out by households preventing default on payments.The competence which it demonstrated in managing the Negative Centre, responsible for registeringcases of default only, and the commercial neutrality which typifies the National Bank it, seem torender her very well-suited for that function.Ladies and Gentlemen, the National Bank of Belgium is 150 years old. I cannot tell you what willhave become of it in 50 years’ time, in 2050. But I will venture to tell you what it aims to be in 5years’ time, in 2005.In 2005 the euro will have been in circulation for three years in Belgium and in ten other Europeancountries in the form of coins and notes, some of which will have been printed by the National Bankof Belgium’s printing department. The National Bank will continue to ensure the quality of the notesand coins in circulation. There will be less branches but the Bank will maintain its presence in eachBelgian province. The National Bank of Belgium will be a faithful, active and appreciated partner inthe Eurosystem. The Bank will also have maintained the quality and relevance of its research andsometimes increased its originality. In its service activities, the Bank will endeavour to offer the bestin terms of value for money; it may develop some of its activities with similarly reliable partners.External and internal communication will have been stepped up. The corporate ethos, centred on thepursuit of excellence, will encourage creativity and initiative more than it does today. In our variousareas of activity, the National Bank will be able to recruit the best people. The entire population willregard it as an independent, competent and accessible public interest institution which provides realadded value for Belgium’s economy and society.Ladies and Gentlemen, we are proud of the Bank’s history and ambitious for its future.
1BIS Review 41/2000Urban Bäckström: The Swedish economy -cyclical upswing or a more fundamental improvement?Speech held by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Boardof Directors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at a meeting with InstitutInternational d’Etudes Bancaires, held in Stockholm, on 19 May 2000.*      *      *The current economic situation in Sweden differs appreciably from the early-1990s, when our countrywas on the brink of a serious financial crisis, with a currency and banking crisis, sizeable public sectordeficits and rapidly rising unemployment. Today the picture is considerably brighter.The question I want to consider here with you is whether the impressive performance in recent yearsamounts to a conventional cyclical upswing or has to do with a more fundamental improvement in theworkings of the Swedish economy.In the three years from 1991 to 1993, the Swedish GDP fell by a total of 5%, employment droppedmore than 10%, unemployment shot up from 3 to 8%, the public sector financial deficit grew to 12%of GDP and government debt accumulated rapidly. Meanwhile, the stock of non-performing loans inthe banking sector peaked at 10% of GDP or 8% of the total loan portfolio. The fixed exchange ratewas questioned, there were sizeable interventions and for some days in the autumn of 1992 Sweden’scentral bank raised its instrumental rate to 500%.Various explanations have been put forward for the depth of Sweden’s economic crisis. They rangefrom the loss of demand in connection with the adjustment to the bursting of the bubble from thelate-1980s, to more underlying structural factors. To some extent the explanations overlap and each ofthem certainly played a part in the dramatic course of events in the early 1990s.In order to understand what happened I believe that we have to go back to the beginning of the 1970sand the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. For it was then that the stability oriented regime - aregime that had worked well in the post-war era - broke down in our country. In the absence of aglobal currency system, it proved difficult to establish a regime in Sweden that would be equallystable. During the 1970s and 1980s Sweden had to manage without a distinct anchor for eithermonetary and exchange rate policy, wage formation or economic policy in general.We moved through a series of devaluation cycles, fiscal discipline was undermined, structuralproblems accumulated and wage formation ceased to function properly. When the financial sector wasderegulated in the mid-1980s, the problems with stabilisation became even more difficult to manage.Meanwhile, the structural weaknesses were being concealed by an overheated economy. Activitylooked strong but the potential growth rate in the Swedish economy had weakened some time before.As the 1980s drew to a close, however, there was a growing awareness that something would have tobe done. The structural problems, high inflation and speculative behaviour all warranted a realignmentof economic policy. In time, the necessity of a change was supported more and more widely. The taxsystem was reformed and so were certain segments of the transfers system. Sweden also applied formembership of the European Union. Our currency was pegged to the ecu and during the wave ofinternational exchange rate speculation in the autumn of 1992 the krona was defended to the bitter endin order to demonstrate the determination to re-establish a credible low inflation regime.The economic policy realignment coincided, however, with the setback that followed the bursting ofthe bubble from the late-1980s and the Swedish economy descended into a profound crisis. Whetherthis dramatic downturn could have been managed somewhat differently is a question that will nodoubt be analysed in the future. Some things could certainly have been done differently in the late1980s, as well as in the throes of the crisis.
BIS Review 41/20002However, I believe that the main lesson to draw is that the roots of the deep crisis ran quite a long wayback. A realignment of economic policy was essential. The fact that there had been no crediblestability oriented policy regime in Sweden for almost twenty years had had far-reaching repercussionsthat ultimately affected our material prosperity. It was high time to establish a new anchor formonetary and exchange rate policy, wage formation and economic policy in general. Structuralreforms were also needed to correct earlier structural mistakes and restore our economic vitality.Whether the measures that have been taken up to the present are sufficient is a debatable issue; but thepoint I want to make is that a change of direction and some political action had already been initiatedin the 1980s. The work has continued since then and been undertaken by governments of diversepolitical hues and personalities. In other words, something happened to Swedish economic policy in awide sense in the late 1980s.When the immediate crisis had been managed in the early 1990s it was clear that the weak governmentfinances would have to be tackled. Moreover, the independent status of our central bank has beenformally confirmed, accompanied by a clear mandate. The floating exchange rate regime and theexplicit target for price stability have worked well. Several segments of the Swedish economy havebeen deregulated, though less has been done in this way in the labour market than in markets for goodsand services. But the labour market organisations have been working on their own account to improvethe system for wage formation.As a result of all this, the Swedish economy is doing better than we have seen for a long time. Theeconomic upswing has now continued for more than six years, during which annual GDP growth hasaveraged around 3%. And notwithstanding the strong growth of demand, inflation has been lower thanone would expect from earlier relationships. Everything suggests, moreover, that the economy willcontinue to impress. Last year, GDP growth was 3.8% and the increase in employment was the highestin the past twenty-five years. Another indication of the good circle in which the Swedish economy isdeveloping at present is that forward-looking GDP assessments have also been revised upwards,whereas forecasts of inflation have not been adjusted upwards to the same degree. Financial marketpricing is also a tribute to the present credibility of Swedish economic policy. Who would havebelieved a decade ago that the Swedish economy would achieve such a favourable path?The successful combination of relatively high GDP growth and low inflation can in principle beattributed to a number of factors. One may be the plentiful supply of unutilised resources after thecrisis in the early 1990s. A change in pricing behaviour may have contributed once the rate of inflationhad been brought down to a low and stable level. Increased competition in connection with, forexample, deregulations, globalisation and IT commerce may also have played a part. But it may alsohave to do as well with an upward shift in trend productivity, so that more goods and services can beproduced without an increase in prices, in other words, a higher rate of potential growth.It can be argued that all these factors have in fact contributed to the favourable development. When theupswing started there were plenty of unutilised resources. It is highly likely that pricing behaviour in alow inflation regime differs from that when inflation is high. Another circumstance worth mentioningis that both external and domestic competitive pressure have increased and led in many cases todownward price adjustments or just a slow increase. The most recent figures for inflation are one ofseveral illustrations of this phenomenon. While this is strictly speaking a matter of a series of one-offeffects, the increased competition can continue to leave its mark on the general price level for sometime to come.Another point worth noting is the prominent part that investment has played in the Swedish economyover the past six years. Increased investment tends to generate higher productivity growth. That in turnraises expectations of future corporate profits, which often leads to higher share prices. Highercorporate valuations stimulate additional investment by the firms in question and also give enterprisesbetter access to risk capital for further expansion. Meanwhile, share-owning households perceive anincrease in the net value of their assets. Increased wealth and optimistic expectations lead in turn to astronger growth of consumption.
3BIS Review 41/2000In this way, a growth process that is driven by investment can create a good circle. The supply side ofthe economy generates increased demand and a favourable composition of demand tends to strengthenthe supply side still more.In the twenty years from 1974 to 1993, the annual growth of labour productivity averaged only 1.4%.The rate since 1994, however, has averaged 1.9% and this cannot be attributed solely to cyclicalfactors. Thus it may indicate an increase in potential growth. While it is not yet on a par with theUnited States, where productivity growth has been accelerating in recent years, it does constitute animprovement.Neither would it be surprising if future productivity growth turns out to be somewhat higher thanobservers have counted on to date, though this is not a matter of any dramatic change. Certainindicators in the early part of this year, although still somewhat uncertain, may point to some upwardadjustment. It would be interesting if this is confirmed because it would mean that productivity growthis tending to move up even in such a late phase of the business cycle. At the corresponding stage of theprevious upswing in the 1980s, productivity growth had already slowed down and price and wageincreases were beginning to accelerate.From this it can be concluded, at least for the time being, that the economic upswing in Sweden hasnot been just a cyclical improvement. It is also a result of factors that are more structural.The transformation of economic development and its new patterns naturally face forecasters andmacro economists, including the Riksbank, with major challenges. From this I conclude that whenmaking assessments of the future, we must be highly alert to new economic information and beprepared to reassess earlier models, relationships and forecasts as and when the need arises.The continuation of a strong demand trend can be expected to render resource utilisation in generaland in the labour market in particular increasingly strained. On the other hand, inflation is still low andthe prospects to date in this respect appear to be balanced. So there are not all that many signs atpresent of resource utilisation becoming excessively strained. Accordingly, it seems that there isground to believe that the Swedish economy is functioning better than before.
1BIS Review 54/2000Hermann Remsperger: The importance of theEuropean Monetary Union in transatlantic relationsSpeech by Professor Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the7th Transatlantic Summer Academy on “Europe facing the 21st century: defining the central issues”,Zentrum für Europäische Integrationsforschung, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Bonn,on 26 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by quoting two of the sharpest critics of EMU.And you may imagine that I do not agree with these critics.Before the start of the euro, MIT professor Rudi Dornbusch made the following statement:“So EMU has gone from being an improbable and bad idea to a bad idea that is about to come true...The struggle to achieve monetary union under the Maastricht formula may be remembered as one ofthe most useless battles in European history. The costs of getting there are large, the economicbenefits minimal, and the prospects for disappointment major.”1Martin Feldstein, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, went even further andwarned that EMU might increase intra-EU conflicts rather than foster political union. He concluded:“Although it is impossible to know for certain whether these conflicts would lead to war, it is too reala possibility to ignore in weighing the potential effects of EMU and the European political integrationthat would follow.”2However, there were not only negative or sceptical views on EMU. One of the most prominentproponents of EMU, Nobel laureate Robert Mundell, describes the benefits of a successful EMU:“Members of the EMU will get not just a currency on par with the dollar and the right to share ininternational seigniorage but also greater influence in the running of the international monetarysystem. The rest of the world will get an alternative asset to the dollar to use in international reservesand a new and stable currency that could be used as the focus for stable exchange rates or currencyboards. The US will get a needed relief from the eventually debilitating overuse of the dollar as aninternational currency, a single-currency continent that vastly simplifies trade and investment, and astrong partner in Europe with an equal stake in constructing an international monetary systemsuitable for the 21st century.”3I think Mundell’s statement is a very good starting point for my own considerations. In the following,I would like to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the euro as an international currency andevaluate them on the basis of the empirical evidence available. I will then analyse what implicationsthe broad international use of the euro might have for monetary policy. Finally, I will examine thepossible impact of EMU on relations between Europe and the United States.Given the limited time available, I will certainly be unable to give full coverage to all aspects of thesubject matter. However, I will be glad to answer any questions at the end of my talk.1R Dornbusch, Euro Fantasies, Foreign Affairs 75, September/October 1996, p 113.2M Feldstein, EMU and International Conflict, Foreign Affairs 76, November/December 1997, p 62.3R Mundell, The Case for the Euro - II, Wall Street Journal, 25 March 1998, p A22.

BIS Review 54/20002A striking feature of the transatlantic relations between “Europe” and the United States was thedominance of the US dollar in the area of international monetary policy during the second half of the20th century. This was partly due to the institutional setting. In the post-war monetary system, the UScurrency was assigned a prominent role as the anchor currency. This - in addition to other factors -fostered the international use of the dollar. However, even after the end of the Bretton Woods systemof fixed exchange rates at the beginning of the 1970s, the dollar maintained its position as the mostimportant transaction, investment and reserve currency - and it did so despite its overall depreciationagainst staple currencies.With the euro, market players now have an alternative currency which may become a seriouscompetitor to the US dollar. Any currency, especially a new one, will only establish itselfinternationally - that is to say, outside its own currency area - if it provides its users with specificadvantages over other currencies. Those advantages may be in the form of lower transaction costs,greater stability or more opportunity for diversification. There are at least four reasons supporting theargument that the euro could play an important role as an international currency:– the economic size of the euro area;– the euro area’s close trade and financial ties with countries outside the euro area;– the favourable changes in the euro area financial markets;– the institutional arrangements for maintaining price stability in the euro area.The euro area has about the same economic weight as the United States; both economic areas are wellahead of Japan. The population of the euro area, at around 290 million, is larger than that of the UnitedStates (270 million) and Japan (125 million).It is obvious that the size and capacity of an economic area is of importance to its currency: economiesof scale play an important role, especially in the use of money. A large economic area generates alarge “natural constituency” for its own currency. If a currency is widely accepted, this normallylowers transaction costs, which, in turn, attracts international customers and leads to a further spreadof the currency beyond its domestic area.The argument of size is important since the euro area is highly integrated into the world economy. Theeuro area accounts for one-fifth of world trade excluding trade within the euro area. This is more thanthe corresponding ratios for the United States with 15% or Japan, which is just under 9%.What is more, the end of currency segmentation has led to a dramatic change on the euro area’sfinancial markets. The range of financial products is expanding, and the markets are becoming moreliquid. The money market, in particular, is now unified. Concerning the European stock exchanges,mergers are being planned, and greater attention is being paid to the wishes of market participants. Allthat tends to have a favourable impact on the efficiency of the euro financial markets, although theyare still lagging behind the US markets in that respect.Despite the introduction of a single currency and cooperation among the stock exchanges, the financialmarkets in the euro area continue to be segmented to a larger extent than those in the United States. Inparticular, issuing on the bond market is heavily fragmented; in the euro area, there is no issuercomparable to the US Treasury. The existence of different securities settlement systems continues toentail higher costs than in the United States. Finally, purchasing securities across borders in the euroarea is still more expensive than buying them in a particular member state.The size and openness of the economic area as well as the dynamism and efficiency of the financialmarkets are definitely important factors in determining a currency’s international success. Ultimately,however, the euro will hold its own in competition with other currencies only if it can be kept stableover the long term. The relevant institutional requirements have been met: the ECB is an independentcentral bank which is primarily committed to the objective of price stability.The euro’s greatest success to date has been as an issue currency on the international financialmarkets. Between January 1999, the start of EMU, and March 2000, 47% of the net issuance ininternational debt securities was denominated in euro, compared with a dollar ratio of 45%. It seems
3BIS Review 54/2000that the large issuers took advantage of the low euro interest rates in order to raise large amounts offunds in euro. However, it is also apparent that the euro’s success in terms of new issues increased itsshare of all international debt securities outstanding only slightly compared with its predecessorcurrencies, namely from 25% at the end of 1997 to 30% at the end of March 2000. At this referencedate, the share of the dollar stood at 47%.The euro’s share of international banking business is somewhat smaller than on international securitiesmarkets, amounting to 28% in the case of bank assets and 24% in the case of bank liabilities,compared with a dollar market share of 40% and 42%, respectively. Relative to the share that theeuro’s predecessor currencies had previously, the euro comes off much better in international bankingbusiness.4From the perspective of a central bank, it would be especially interesting to know the euro’s share ofthe official foreign exchange reserves. It is precisely as a reserve currency that the dollar hastraditionally had the largest lead over all other currencies, with a recent share of more than 60%.Unfortunately, the corresponding share of the euro cannot currently be quantified reliably, since theunderlying database is decidedly incomplete.The euro has developed very quickly into an - at least numerically - important international anchorcurrency. The ECB has recently listed some 50 countries in whose currency regime the euro is playinga role. The arrangements stretch from D-Mark or euro-based currency boards (Bosnia-Herzegovina,Bulgaria, Estonia) and mutual agreements as part of ERM II (Denmark, Greece) to rather informalexchange rate links, which are geared to baskets that, in addition to the euro, include other currencies,too.Two results of my empirical analysis merit particular attention. Firstly, the dollar continues to be theleading international currency in virtually all functions, even though the euro has reduced the gap hereand there. Secondly, the role that the euro is playing on the international financial markets is nowalready clearly more important than that of its predecessor currencies. The weight that the euro arealends to its currency is evidently greater than the simple sum of the 11 participating countries.The euro’s growing importance on the international financial markets contrasts sharply with itsexchange rate movements until mid-May. Between January 1999 and its trough in May, the singlecurrency lost around one-quarter of its value against the dollar, and as a weighted average against thecurrencies of the euro area’s 13 most important trading partners, it did not come off much better either.How can the euro gain market shares on the international financial markets while losing so much of itsvalue?Taking a look back into the past may be helpful in providing an explanation. The dollar has alwaysbeen able to maintain its position as the leading world currency despite the ups and downs in the dollarexchange rate. Apparently, the individual currencies’ positions on the international financial marketsare determined, at least to some extent, by factors other than the exchange rate. In addition, the timehorizons underlying decisions on the foreign exchange market and the (long-term) capital market areprobably different as a rule.If you ask me, Ladies and Gentlemen, what my analysis up to now means for the transatlanticrelations, I would not deny that the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar will always playa central role. However, it is essential to add that the external value of the euro cannot nearly be seenas the sole indicator for the importance of EMU within the transatlantic relationship. I shall return tothis point soon again but from rather an American perspective.Before I continue, please allow me to emphasise that the expanding international use of the euro couldhave far-reaching consequences for monetary policy. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest thatthe capital markets might play an increasing role in the transmission of monetary policy (at the4For some methodological problems connected with the data, see International Banking and Financial MarketDevelopments, BIS Quarterly Review, February 2000, p 33ff and June 2000.
BIS Review 54/20004expense of the banking system). This might enhance the efficiency of monetary policy by reducing thetime lags in the transmission process, since the capital markets usually respond more quickly tointerest rate changes than does the banking system.The exchange rate channel might likewise lose in importance if other countries, for example futureaccession countries, pegged their currencies to the euro. This primary effect would be diminished bythe fact that the Eurosystem’s monetary policy would, in that event, have an immediate impact on thereal economy in those countries, which would feed back to the euro area on account of the close tradelinks. However, in the light of the small weight of the countries which may be willing to peg theircurrencies to the euro, the overall effect should not be overstated.Another aspect may prove to be very important. The more the euro gains acceptance internationally,the more difficult it may be in certain circumstances to interpret monetary growth. Transfers of fundsfrom euro area monetary financial institutions to the banking systems of third countries (and viceversa) and - from 2002 - the circulation of euro banknotes outside the euro area might prove to bepotential sources of distortions. However, the Bundesbank’s past experience suggests that, althoughsuch problems may cause uncertainty in the short run and thus make higher demands on the centralbank’s analysis and communication policy, over the longer term they are controllable by monetarypolicymakers. Judging from the experience gained from the Bretton Woods system and the EMS,however, this applies in an environment of generally flexible exchange rates only.Now, let me take the opportunity to talk about some of the American interests that may be affected byEMU - interests which are divided into three categories: political, institutional, and economic.5Regarding the political aspects, the United States is highly interested in stabilising central and easternEurope. If EMU paves the way for economic and institutional reforms that will ultimately lead tohigher growth in Europe, then EMU is clearly in the political interest of the United States.With regard to institutional issues, pragmatic solutions have been found for the question ofrepresentation, with the result that the ECB represents EMU monetary policy in international bodies.Apart from this, potential changes in the decision-making process in an enlarged European Union havereceived attention in the US due to the substantial implications they have on European-Americanrelations. The US seems to be interested in institutional arrangements within Europe that lead togreater efficiency in international cooperation.As regards the economic interests of the United States that might be affected by EMU there are at leastfour points that ought to be distinguished:First, some US economists seem to be anxious that EMU in combination with the Stability andGrowth Pact might be detrimental to growth in Europe. I think the opposite is true. In addition,structural reform in Europe would stimulate growth in the long run and create positive spill-overeffects in other regions, too. The transformation of the euro area into a “New Economy”, characterisedby more flexibility, higher growth rates and low inflation rates would definitely be much appreciatedby our American partners - and not only by them. Whereas some observers expect EMU to increasethe necessity for and the feasibility of structural reform, others argue that an intensified competition ina currency union might call for more social protection.Second, the smooth financing of the American current account deficit seems to be an issue of concernon both sides of the Atlantic. With the euro potentially rivalling the dollar, some economists have beenexpecting huge shifts in international portfolios which might limit the ability of the US to finance itscurrent account deficit. However, in the light of my remarks about international capital flows, I thinkthat external financing constraints for the United States will not be too narrow as long as a reasonableeconomic policy is pursued.5See, for example, C R Henning (2000), p 17ff.
5BIS Review 54/2000Third, the US is interested in the smooth functioning of the international monetary system. Inprinciple, US authorities prefer flexible exchange rates. In the case of a crisis, however, the US isinterested in an efficient decision-making process at international level.Fourth, systemic stability is an objective with high priority for US policy. The question as to whetherthe emergence of the euro as an international currency might indirectly contribute to systemic risks hasalready been raised. In particular, large and rapid shifts out of the dollar have been seen asproblematic, whereas gradual changes in market shares are not an issue of concern.In the run-up to monetary union, there was much speculation about how the launch of the euro wouldinfluence volatility on the foreign exchange markets. It was said that the rivalry between a few majorinternational investment currencies might lead to stronger short-term exchange rate fluctuations, sincechanging market sentiments would immediately turn out to the advantage of one currency anddisadvantage of the other. It was further argued that the euro area’s degree of openness in foreign tradewould be smaller than that of the individual participating countries prior to their entry into EMU andthat the Eurosystem would therefore probably be more inclined to pursue a policy of benign neglectthan, for example, the Bundesbank had been in the past. Apart from the fact that some of thosetheoretical considerations are on shaky ground, the empirical findings argue against them, too. In alarger and more liquid euro capital market, the reallocation of assets does not necessarily lead toincreased exchange rate fluctuations, and a generally increased exchange rate volatility has not beenobserved so far either. On the contrary, measured in terms of the standard deviation of dailypercentage changes, the average volatility of the euro’s rate against the US dollar between January1999 and May 2000 was actually somewhat lower than the volatility of the D-Mark against theUS dollar between 1991 and 1998.In concluding, I would like to emphasise that although the interests of Europeans and Americans maydiffer here and there, I do not see any fundamental differences, at least not in the economic fields that Ihave just discussed: smooth balance of payments financing, higher growth rates in Europe, stability ofthe financial system and flexible exchange rates between the major currencies. I think most Europeanswould subscribe to these objectives as well.However, EMU will not automatically help to achieve these objectives. Consequently, majorchallenges for European and American policymakers still exist, some of which could be dealt with bycompeting for better policies. Others, such as maintaining the stability of the global financial system,argue in favour of closer cooperation. At many levels - for example, the IMF, the Financial StabilityForum, the BIS - such cooperation actually takes place without being ultimately hampered by thecomplex political structures in Europe.Competition and cooperation will presumably remain the salient features of transatlantic relations inthe foreseeable future. Interpreted as the struggle for the best solutions and by assuming jointresponsibility, these two guiding principles - competition and cooperation - might complement eachother almost ideally.
1BIS Review 53/2000Willem F Duisenberg: Current economic developments andprospects in Europe, as well as other activities of the EurosystemIntroductory statement delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,at the Hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Brussels, on 20 June 2000.*      *      *Once more it is my pleasure to appear before your Committee in order to report on the recentmonetary policy decisions taken by the ECB and on the reasoning underlying these decisions. To thisend, I shall also present the ECB’s analysis of current economic developments and comment briefly onthe outlook for the euro area. I should also like to add a few words on the change in the procedures forthe allotment of liquidity in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem, beginning with theoperation to be settled on 28 June 2000. Moreover, I should like to inform you of other importantdecisions taken by the ECB, particularly in the area of transparency, which is an issue that hasfrequently been raised in the framework of our regular dialogue, and to which the ECB attaches greatimportance.1.Current economic developments and prospectsOver the past few months both pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem haveindicated that upward risks to price stability have increased. The developments in monetary and creditaggregates over the first few months of 2000 clearly indicated that liquidity conditions in the euro areawere generous. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 (covering the period fromFebruary to April 2000) was 6.3%. This followed an increase of 5.9% in the period from January toMarch 2000. There has, therefore, been a further deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of4½%. Annual M3 growth, as measured by the three-month moving average, has been almost1½ percentage points above the reference value since the end of the summer of 1999. It was almosttwo percentage points above the reference value in April 2000. Growth of credit to the private sector,which was already high throughout 1999, increased during the first four months of 2000, reaching, onan annual basis, 11.4% in April 2000. Developments in the first pillar thus indicated that upward risksto price stability had increased over the past few months. They needed to be counteracted in time.Looking at the information provided under the second pillar, the outlook for growth in the euro areahas improved further since our last meeting in March, while upward risks to consumer price inflationhave continued to increase. There is widespread consensus among the forecasts from majorinternational organisations and private institutions that real GDP growth will exceed 3% this year andnext year. This is significantly higher than projected at the end of last year or earlier this year. On thedomestic side, this positive outlook reflects expectations that growth in domestic demand will benefit,in particular, from ongoing employment growth and higher rates of capacity utilisation. On theexternal side, the upturn of growth in the world economy appears to be more robust and broadly basedthan was anticipated earlier. This suggests that the growth of euro area exports should remain strong.Information from recently released short-term indicators, such as the surveys of the EuropeanCommission on consumer and industrial confidence, largely confirm these forecasts. They indicatecontinued strong growth in the first half of 2000, following the upturn in real GDP growth in thesecond half of 1999.With regard to consumer price developments, inflation has recently risen above the level expected bymost forecasters at the end of last year. At the same time, according to currently available forecasts,consumer price inflation will exceed, this year and next year, the levels forecast at the end of last year.The level and the pattern of overall HICP inflation observed over the past few months largely reflectthe impact of oil price developments on the energy component of the HICP. In March, annual headline
BIS Review 53/20002inflation was 2.1%. While it came down to 1.9% in April and May, the rise in oil prices in May 2000points to renewed short-term upward pressures. It should also be considered that, in the context of thefavourable prospects for strong economic growth in the euro area, the pass-through of exchange ratechanges via import prices is normally facilitated. Overall, for these reasons, HICP inflation is notexpected to fall significantly in the near future. In the context of robust economic growth, theseshort-term upward pressures were considered to potentially increase the risks of second-round effects,implying that they could have longer-lasting effects on consumer price inflation, if monetary policydid not counteract these in a timely manner.Therefore, in response to these upward risks to price stability, as they emerged from the analysis underboth pillars of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem, the Governing Council of the ECB decided toincrease ECB interest rates by 25 basis points on 27 April 2000, and by 50 basis points on 8 June. Therate on the main refinancing operations has thus reached 4.25%. The rates on the marginal lendingfacility and on the deposit facilities have now been set at 5.25% and 3.25% respectively. TheGoverning Council also decided on 8 June to switch to a new tender procedure for the allotment ofliquidity in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem. I will discuss this issue later.The decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB reflected the forward-looking character ofthe monetary policy of the Eurosystem. I should like to stress that the decisions of the Eurosystemshould be interpreted as responses to risks to price stability in the medium term before theymaterialise, rather than as reactions to a situation whereby price stability has already been jeopardised.In this respect, the recent increases in ECB rates have been motivated by a desire to avoid beingcompelled to take stronger measures at a later stage. I believe this is the best way to fulfil our mandate,as it is defined by the Treaty, and thereby to contribute to sustained economic growth in the euro area.The sounder the growth process is, the longer will it normally last. The sounder the growth process is,the more permanent and sustained will the creation of new jobs tend to be.An important question in this context relates to the sustainability of the expansion of economic activityat current growth rates. The answer to this question has important implications for our assessment ofthe monetary policy stance, as it potentially affects the interpretation of some of the analysisconducted under both pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem.At our last meeting in March, I already addressed the issue of the reference value for monetary growth.This reference value is compiled from the estimated trend growth of real GDP, the estimated trenddecline in the velocity of circulation of M3 and the quantitative definition of price stability. In the lightof the prospects for strong economic growth and upside risks to price stability which I have alreadymentioned, the question has been raised as to whether these developments would require a revision ofthe reference value for monetary growth. In this context, I should like to recall the GoverningCouncil’s decision to review the reference value on an annual basis, and that the next review will takeplace in December 2000. I should also like to emphasise that the reference value is a medium-termconcept and does not constitute a monetary target. What we aim to capture by trend growth is the rateof growth, which is sustainable in the medium term, which, according to our analysis, has beenestimated as falling in the range of 2-2½%.Let me also emphasise the fact that estimates of potential output (and thus of the output gap) aresurrounded by considerable uncertainty. Therefore, these indicators should be treated with greatcaution. We are currently observing a strong cyclical expansion supported by strong productivitygrowth. However, we need more compelling evidence before it can be concluded that this upturn willbe followed by higher growth potential, which is above trend growth, as it has been estimated so far. Itis too early to tell, but we are monitoring and analysing developments closely. We will take ourfindings into account when reviewing the reference value and taking monetary policy decisions.Nevertheless, I should like to stress that it is hard to imagine that the current growth in M3 could bejustified by an upward revision of potential growth. I should also like to point out that the analysis ofmonetary and credit developments conducted under the first pillar of our strategy is more complexthan simply comparing actual M3 growth with the reference value.The challenge to turn the current expansion into a prolonged period of non-inflationary growth clearlyrequires further efforts in all policy areas. Reforms in the labour market will be a major factor
3BIS Review 53/2000contributing to sustained non-inflationary growth in the euro area. The current level of unemploymentin the euro area, despite some decline, is still too high. In this respect, both appropriate wagesettlements and structural reforms will be important contributions to continued employment growthand to maintaining low inflation. With a view to fiscal policies in the euro area, it is important that theopportunity of the current economic environment is seized to improve the soundness of publicfinances. Member States should take advantage of the current cyclical position in order to achieve andmaintain budgetary positions, which meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreambitious fiscal positions than those targeted in Member States’ updated stability programmes shouldbe achieved, particularly in countries with high debt ratios and especially if economic growth developsmore favourably than expected. In addition, we welcome initiatives to implement tax cuts in a numberof countries, provided that these measures are consistent with the progress to be achieved in the area offiscal consolidation. At the same time, more emphasis should be placed on structural reforms on theexpenditure side of budgets leading to stricter expenditure restraint. At the current juncture, apro-cyclical bias in fiscal policies should be avoided.Let me now turn to the decision of the Governing Council to modify the procedure for the allotment ofliquidity in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem. This change was motivated by purelytechnical reasons, namely by the need to address the problem of overbidding, which has becomeincreasingly severe in the course of recent months. As a matter of fact, since early 2000, the bidssubmitted in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem have been following a steady upwardtrend, leading ultimately to allotment ratios of less than 1% of the bids. For this reason, we decidedthat the main refinancing operations would be conducted as variable rate tenders using the multiplerate auction procedure, beginning with the operation to be conducted one week from now. Contrary tothe fixed rate tender procedure, whereby the counterparties of the Eurosystem submit bids for aspecified amount of liquidity, the new procedure implies that the counterparties will also indicate intheir bids the interest rate they are prepared to pay for the requested amount of liquidity. This shouldeliminate the incentive to overbid, for in the new format of the auction the bidding behaviour ofcounterparties should be constrained by interest rate cost considerations.I should like to stress that the switch to variable rate tenders is in no way intended to further modifythe stance of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem. In order to underline this intention, and to be ableto continue to send a clear signal concerning the monetary policy stance, we decided to introduce aminimum bid rate, below which no valid bid may be submitted. This rate will signal the monetarypolicy stance of the Eurosystem, and thereby assume the role that has, so far, been performed by themain refinancing rate in the fixed rate tender procedure.2.Other activities of the EurosystemTurning now to other activities of the Eurosystem, I should like to begin by informing you of furthersteps which have been initiated by the ECB in the area of its communications policy. In line with theECB’s principle to be as open as possible in the framework of its responsibilities as a central bank, andin order to enhance the transparency of its regulatory framework, the ECB has decided to makeavailable to the general public, as a rule, the ECB legal instruments governing the relationshipbetween the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the euro area. So far, the publication ofsuch documents has been decided by the Governing Council on a case-by-case basis.Obviously, it is indispensable to exclude from this general rule all sensitive information that needs tobe kept confidential in order to protect the public and economic interests underlying the activities ofthe Eurosystem, in particular with a view to monetary and exchange rate stability, the fight againstcounterfeiting and the legal protection of banknotes. Thus, confidentiality has to be maintainedwhenever the disclosure of such information could have significantly adverse effects on the activitiesof the Eurosystem or could seriously prejudice the effective conduct of its operations.All non-confidential legal instruments of the ECB will be published both in the Official Journal of theEuropean Communities and in the Compendium of the ECB, which is also accessible via the ECBInternet website. At the current stage, the Governing Council has approved the publication of threeGuidelines addressed to the NCBs of the Eurosystem. They concern the authorisation to issue national
BIS Review 53/20004banknotes during the transitional period, the exchange of banknotes in Community currenciesaccording to Article 52 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the EuropeanCentral Bank and the protection of confidentiality of individual statistical information collected by theEurosystem. The publication of several other documents adopted by the ECB is currently under way.Let me now briefly refer to two reports relating to the Eurosystem’s tasks in the area of prudentialsupervision and financial stability, which have recently been released to the general public. Bothreports were prepared by the Banking Supervision Committee of the European System of CentralBanks (ESCB), which comprises high-ranking representatives of the central banks and bankingsupervisory authorities of the 15 EU Member States and the ECB.The report on “Asset prices and banking stability” analyses the possible implications for the EUbanking sector in the event of a significant fall in asset prices. Given the difficulties and uncertaintiesin measuring the “fundamental” value of an asset and the generally inconclusive results provided bythe various asset price valuation models, the report does not endeavour to determine the“appropriateness” of asset price levels. Rather, its main objective is to assess the resilience of the EUbanking sector to possible downward developments in asset prices.The report concludes that stock market exposures of EU banks do not currently give any rise toconcern from a macro-prudential point of view. The EU banking sector would not face majordifficulties in the case of a sharp decline of stock prices. However, problems for EU banks could ariseif a fall in stock prices entails second-round effects such as a significant slowdown in economicgrowth leading to a further recession. Moreover, there appear to be some potential risks to EU banksas a result of a possible price fall in the real estate sector, but no major threat to systemic stabilitycould be identified.The report also addresses the policies pursued by the supervisory authorities in Member States in orderto preserve financial stability and to ensure prudent lending practices by banks. The actions taken inthe various Member States range from public communications of concerns to specific regulatorymeasures, such as changes in risk provisioning and/or asset valuation rules. Given the interest of theEurosystem in these kind of issues, the Governing Council has given the Banking SupervisionCommittee of the ESCB a mandate to undertake periodic reviews of asset price developments from thepoint of view of banking stability.The second report that I should like to bring to your attention examines the question of the extent towhich factors such as technological change, financial liberalisation and internationalisation and theincreasing trend towards banking disintermediation have had an impact on the activities and,consequently, on the income structure of EU banks in recent years.The most noteworthy change that has occurred in the income structure of EU banks is the increasingimportance of non-interest income, comprising, inter alia, fees and commissions, net profit onfinancial operations and income from variable yield securities. This trend may have had a positiveeffect on the overall profitability of banks in recent years, even though banks were also confrontedwith increased costs associated with the development of non-interest income activities, e.g. in order toattract and retain highly qualified personnel. The report also indicates that the shift towardsnon-interest income does not necessarily induce greater volatility in the income of banks.The changes that have occurred within the income structures of banks, have also had an impact on therisk profiles of credit institutions. Indeed, some categories of risks, including operational and strategicrisks, have become more significant compared with the risks associated with classical intermediationactivities of banks, such as credit risks. Therefore, the findings of the report seem to supportsuggestions for determining specific capital requirements for risks other than credit risks. Suchmeasures are currently under discussion in the relevant institutional fora, in the context of the reviewof the capital adequacy regime for banks.
1BIS Review 52/2000Jean-Claude Trichet: Structural and financial reformsin Europe in a global economic environmentSpeech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Banque de France, at the International SecuritiesMarket Association meeting, held in Paris, on 16 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,It is a great pleasure for me to take the opportunity of this ISMA meeting in Paris to present someviews on how European economies have entered a new era with the introduction of the euro.First, I would like to elaborate on the pace of structural reforms, which have already produced tangibleand positive effects on the growth rate in the euro zone.Second, I will focus on the integration process which is under way in financial markets across the euroarea.1.The euro area may expect a long phase of steady economic growth sustained by thestrong pace of structural reforms: further liberalization, increasing labor flexibility andgovernment budgetary disciplineLiberalization based on privatization, deregulation and transparency has been a successThe time is long past when a significant portion of the European economy was controlled throughvarious government bodies or regulations. The liberalization movement, which acceleratedsubstantially with the development of the European Union and principally the completion of the singlemarket, includes three aspects:– A significant privatization movement, which has spread throughout all of Europe. Since1990, Europe’s governments have sold more than $200 billion worth of state companies.This movement was particularly important in Italy, France and Germany, where salesrepresented almost three-quarters of the total amount. The change in ownership has pavedthe way for corporate strategies benefiting from an open access to financial markets.– Another force at work in Europe is deregulation. The change is particularly noticeable inseveral key sectors such as telecommunications, transportation, the power supply industryand, of course, the financial sector. This movement has prompted a rapid response fromregulatory bodies to monitor the introduction of market rules and ensure the appropriatefunctioning of fair competition throughout the entire European Union. Today, thisinstitutional framework appears quite appropriate against a background of in-depthrestructuring and numerous mergers and acquisitions all across Europe.– Moreover, the liberalization required for the single market endeavor has been accompaniedby an increasing need for transparency and accountability, which has brought substantialchanges in corporate practices. More detailed rules of disclosure for financial informationand competitive offers for public procurement programs have been implemented throughouta large part of Europe. This phenomenon has enhanced the overall efficiency of theEuropean market economy.A second series of reforms has resulted in increased flexibility in the labor marketDuring the past two years, employment has grown faster in Europe than in the United States. Therehas been strong job creation, particularly in the new economy, as can be seen in the remarkable
BIS Review 52/20002increase in employment in the IT companies listed on the “New market”. Employment in this sectorrose by more than 40% in France and Germany.Besides the improvement in the job situation in the euro area, which results from better economicprospects, it should be mentioned that over the past few years the European Union has embarked ondetermined efforts to promote structural reforms aimed at improving the functioning of labor markets.European countries increased flexibility in the labor market, in particular by developing part-time andtemporary contracts.Let me quote some figures to illustrate this point:– From 1995 to 1999, part-time employment rose from 14% to 17% of total employment in theeuro area. This proportion is more important than in the United States, where it amounts toaround 13% of total employment. More than half of overall net job creation was due topart-time employment.– In conjunction with this development, temporary employment in the euro area rose to 15% oftotal employees in 1999.It is also worth mentioning an emerging trend towards more cross-border mobility of humanresources, especially among young people. More and more university degrees include a stay in one ortwo foreign universities, thus helping to overcome linguistic and cultural barriers in Europe.Last but not least, a key feature which has fostered job creation in the euro area in recent years is wagemoderation, together with reductions in the social charges imposed on employers. This has largelycontributed to the emergence of an environment favorable to price stability and low unit productioncosts, strengthening the competitiveness of our European economy.Finally, all countries have experienced significant fiscal consolidation in the 1990sEnhanced European performances are also evidenced by the significant fiscal consolidation pursued inEurope in the 1990s. The general government deficit for the euro area fell by 3.5 percentage pointsbetween 1993 and 1997 and was brought back below the 3% threshold. Since then, deficits havecontinued to fall. The most recent data point to a public deficit of 1.2% of GDP for the euro area in1999, down from 2.0% in 1998. Four countries of the euro area have managed to achieve a fiscalsurplus since 1999.The fact that European member states have made significant efforts in order to improve their publicfinances does not mean that the process of fiscal consolidation is over. In fact, some member states,including France, still have some way to go to meet the Stability and Growth Pact goal of budgetpositions which are close to balance or in surplus. In addition, there is a need to further reducegovernment debt levels, which remained above 70% of GDP for the euro area.When one considers the cumulative effects of the changes currently experienced - in the field ofregulations, in the labor market and in public finances - which were triggered by the single market andnow by the single currency, one can be reasonably confident that the euro zone is progressivelycatching up with the US economy in terms of long-term potential growth.2.The integration process of the euro-wide financial marketsTurning now to the situation of financial markets, I would like to offer a couple of comments, relatedto the integration of markets and the process of consolidation in the banking sector.2.1First, allow me to recall the important step taken on 24 March 2000 by the Lisbon EuropeanCouncil towards an integrated financial services and capital market in the European Union. In Lisbon,the Heads of State and Government recognized the central role of efficient financial markets forlong-term European competitiveness and for the development of the new economy. The centralbankers and market practitioners who are participating in this meeting share, of course, a commoninterest in achieving the smooth and full integration of financial markets within the euro area: both you
3BIS Review 52/2000and us, because of the very nature of our respective jobs and responsibilities, attach the utmostimportance to the smooth circulation of cash and securities across the euro zone. Indeed, it is crucialthat payments of cash and delivery of securities be performed without undue obstacles throughout thisvery large financial area grouping so many market players keen on operating in deep and liquid capitalmarkets.As regards this crucial issue of financial market integration, it is needless to insist on what has alreadybeen achieved during the last eighteen months. However, it is also important to keep in mind areaswhere some work remains to be done.• The integration of interest rate markets within the euro zone is a first, key achievement thatdeserves to be underscored. The high level of integration that was accomplished can beobserved not only at the short end of the market, in the inter-bank and money markets, butalso at the long end. Market participants across the euro area now trade according to thesame rules and practices, using the same indices (for example the Eonia and Euriborreferences on the swap market). When looking at the behavior of the market for governmentsecurities, it is striking to see how fast intermediaries, but also issuers, have adjusted to thenew environment created by the introduction of a single currency. At the same time, theadvent of the euro has been the catalyst for the development of a buoyant market forcorporate securities. A market for high-yield bonds is already following. I would, forexample, underline the development of asset-backed securities markets in different countries,among which France, to take advantage of demand from global investors for this type ofsecurities. Let me also mention, as regards the short end of the yield curve, the very rapiddevelopment of the market for commercial paper in euro and, in particular, the success of theParis-based market, which has attracted large foreign issuers, thanks to its security, anappropriate regulatory framework and the efficient functioning of DVP procedures.The euro’s market share as an issuance currency reflects, to a large extent, the ability ofintermediaries to promote the deep and liquid markets that issuers and investors need. Hence,as was predicted by observers, since the start of Stage Three the euro has become the secondmost important currency in all segments of international capital markets.• At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbank market took place last yearright from the start of EMU, thanks to the installation of the TARGET system, whichenabled large-value payment systems to move money efficiently and safely in real time fromone location to another. An important feature to have in mind is that this efficiency has beenachieved not through the centralization of payment systems, but through a decentralizednetwork in which national RTGS systems managed by NCBs are linked together. Such astructure is working well. This does not mean that we can now relax and sit back: additionalimprovements will have to be considered in this field. For instance, we have to keep workingon reducing costs, especially concerning cross-border payments. This will certainly lead tofurther harmonization: the harmonization of standards and practices and also theharmonization of systems.• The integration of the euro money market was obviously a prerequisite for the ECB and thenational central banks, the so-called Eurosystem, to be able to conduct the single monetarypolicy efficiently. This challenge has been met successfully in a decentralized framework inwhich each national central bank, acting under the aegis of the ECB, is responsible for thedaily implementation of monetary policy in its country, as regards open market operations,standing facilities and minimum reserves.However, as I mentioned previously, some important work remains to be done before we canconsider that the euro financial markets are fully integrated and that they contribute in themost efficient way to the best allocation of resources.• At the juncture between the bond and the money markets, the repo market still lackshomogeneity and harmonization. This situation derives from the complex nature of thismarket, in which legal and settlement issues play a prominent role. The differences in
BIS Review 52/20004domestic legislation can prove detrimental to the development of an homogeneous repomarket on a euro-wide basis and to the adoption of common market standards. As such, thisissue needs to be addressed. Indeed, a lot of work has been conducted on this issue by marketparticipants - and I know that ISMA has been a driving force in this regard - as well as by thepublic authorities at the European level. To a large extent, it should find its way into thedirective on collateral that the European commission is about to propose to facilitate thecross-border collateralisation technique.• As regards more specifically securities markets, the cross-border circulation and settlementof securities needs to be further enhanced. One can expect the consolidation process that istaking place among securities settlement systems (SSSs) to improve eventually the ability ofmarket participants to move securities efficiently at lower costs across the euro zone.• Similar remarks can be made regarding stock markets. Confronted with fierce competitioncoming from new entrants, our traditional stock exchanges are implementing major changes.The introduction of the euro has been a catalyst which added another strong incentive for therationalization of all the existing market structures. These tremendous changes, perhaps wecould even call them a revolution, have been sped up by the never ending improvements intechnology. Indeed, the technology revolution is transforming not only the architecture ofstock markets, but also the organization of bond markets. It impacts the way intermediariesand investors conduct their business. The outcome of the changes brought about by thesedevelopments are not yet well known. This is why they certainly need to be closelymonitored, not only within individual firms but also at the level of supervisory bodies.• At a moment when all activities are tending to accelerate and render location issues moreacute, changes in the regulatory environment are crucial to fostering efficient financialmarkets. Let me mention in particular the UCITS (mutual funds) Directive and the directiveon occupational pension funds, which ought to eliminate barriers to investment and, ofcourse, the importance of the directive on take-over bids in the context of the integration ofnational stock exchanges.More generally, it is very important for the European Union to accelerate reforms in the financial field.In this respect, as I said, key directives have to be laid down and transposed adequately in nationallaws, whereby the public authorities within FESCO and professionals (like the members of yourassociation) should play a role to facilitate a harmonized set of principles or recommendations.On all these subjects, we can expect a lot of progress in the following months, within the guidelinesalready issued by the European Commission (in its Financial Services Action Plan). France, for itspart, has already expressed its intention to put these matters on the Agenda when it takes over thepresidency of the European Union in July.2.2Coming now to the process of consolidation in the banking sector, there is no need to recallhow banking and financial consolidation has sped up in recent years in Europe. Of course, thisevolution is closely connected to the introduction of the euro and the creation of a single capitalmarket. Some major players are emerging in each country of the EEC. Clearly, we have new andexciting challenges ahead of us on the way to European banking consolidation.The bodies in charge of banking regulations, along with those responsible for the supervision of creditand financial institutions, keep a close eye on these developments.The stance of national regulators in Europe is based on the strong and efficient coordination ofbanking and financial supervision, with ongoing flows of information and, where necessary,coordinated actions which may lead to the designation of a lead regulator.Recently, several examples of such coordinated supervision between European banking authorities,such as that between the Belgian and French authorities for the DEXIA group, have shown thatnational supervisors are well prepared to cope with large cross-border groups.2.3Finally, let me say a few words on the situation of the euro in the foreign exchange market.
5BIS Review 52/2000We have heard quite frequently during the recent months, and especially when the euro weakenedagainst the dollar, that the cause for this situation was to be found in the supposed absence ofstructural reforms that disadvantaged the euro zone vis-à-vis its main competitors.In the same vein, it is often said that the poor performance of the euro reflects the growth differentialbetween the euro zone economy and the US economy.Let me comment briefly on these two points. As regards the lack of structural reforms, I hope that myprevious remarks have underlined that the euro countries have clearly embarked on major structuralreforms - triggered by the single market and the single currency - that will bear lasting effects on thefunctioning of their economies. The central banks of Europe call for the pursuit and reinforcement ofthese reforms. At the same time, in order to serve these economies in the most efficient way, the eurofinancial markets are experiencing the deep and rapid integration process that I described previously.On the second point, one has to keep in mind that the American and European economies are notpositioned identically in the economic cycle, as the latter are probably at the beginning of a morerobust phase of expansion. According to IMF forecasts, growth should reach 3% in the euro area in2001, compared with 3.2% in the US.From a central banking perspective, the present situation is clearly characterized by a misalignment ofthe euro if one refers to the euro area fundamentals: robust domestic growth, inflation under control,strong domestic savings, healthy external accounts.We are, to a certain extent, in a situation symmetric to that which prevailed in 1995 when theweakness of the dollar was clearly out of line with the fundamentals of the US economy. At that time,it took a few months before a correction appeared that aligned the dollar with its economic underlyingfundamentals. The euro has experienced a similar episode recently. This situation seems to be about tocorrect itself, now that more and more signs point to a closing of the growth gap between the UnitedStates and continental Europe.Thus, the potential appreciation of the euro is more than ever a topical question. This potential clearlyreflects the economic soundness, dynamism and strengths of the euro area, supported by the structuralreforms under way. As these winning cards, if I may say so, are now materializing more and moreclearly, I am confident that market participants will soon share our analysis.
1BIS Review 51/2000David Clementi: Technological innovation and e-commerce– the implications for derivatives marketsSpeech by David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the opening reception ofInternational Derivatives Week, held in London, on 19 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I am delighted to address you at the start of what, I am sure, will be an informative andthought-provoking International Derivatives Week.Given the recent rapid pace of technological development, it is fitting that this year’s conferencefocuses on e-commerce and its impact on the derivatives industry. This is certainly a topic of greatinterest to the Bank of England. Maintaining the stability of the financial system and the effectivenessof the UK’s financial services are key objectives for us and recent developments are highly relevant toboth.Nobody doubts that technology has rapidly changed the financial landscape, and will continue to doso. One only needs to spend time online to realise that virtually anything - from commodities, to cars,to Pokemon cards - can be bought and sold by someone with access to a terminal. Electronic tradingand communication networks have greatly increased the “reach” of the traditional financialmarketplaces, but at the same time allowed a wide range of new trading system providers to enter themarkets at relatively low cost. It is a challenge just to stay abreast of the latest developments.I would like this evening to say something first about the role of exchanges in this new environment,and then touch on the role of technology in changing that environment and the implications forclearing houses in managing the resulting risks.Role of exchangesSo far, the established derivatives exchanges retain substantial and often growing volumes although, inrecent years, OTC derivatives trading has expanded much faster than on-exchange trading in manyareas. On-exchange business continues to be dominated by Chicago in the US and by London,Frankfurt and Paris in Europe. The LME remains the world leader in its field, as do the IPE andNymex in theirs. But the number of new trading systems emerging in the various marketsdemonstrates that the winds of change are blowing hard, and today’s market leaders are aware of theneed to innovate to survive in a rapidly evolving market place.Exchanges are responding to these challenges in a number of different ways. Some exchanges look toleverage off their involvement within wider groups containing a range of trading, clearing andsettlement systems. This is not, however, our preferred structure in London; the different tiers havedifferent characteristics and we believe it is generally in the best interests of users if trading, clearingand settlement are kept apart.Some exchanges have chosen to merge or ally with others to provide a larger, more liquid and morecompetitive marketplace. And all are competing for business in a way unthought of a few years ago -witness the competition between LIFFE and Eurex for the long and short ends of the euro yield curve.The latest score in that particular England:Germany match is one all. No doubt German supportersthink this score-line would have been a fairer result on Saturday night, given the balance of play!
BIS Review 50/20002Role of technologyBut the common factor in all of these developments is technology. Physical trading floors forexchanges are fast-disappearing, particularly on this side of the Atlantic, replaced by virtual floorswith trading conducted electronically. And exchanges are utilising their markets and system expertiseto become trading system providers as well as market operators: OM has been a leader in this field forsome time now, and LIFFE has announced some exciting plans - the creation of - fittingly enough -“LIFFE.com” and its recent tie-up with Cap Gemini.On balance, these developments must be in investors’ interests. They reduce costs, improve access andallow exchanges to respond quickly and effectively to users’ changing needs. But they also present anumber of challenges. To move from a trading floor, with its mix of locals, brokers and marketmakers, to an electronic order book, undoubtedly changes the dynamics of a market.For regulators, remote trading also brings some difficult challenges. Technology does not respectnational boundaries; nor does it recognise different jurisdictions. In a world where a German tradercan trade on an exchange in London with a counterparty in the US who uses a French technologyprovider and a Belgian settlement agent, the question of how to ensure that all parts of the process areregulated effectively is a tough one.Some argue there should be some kind of pan-national “super-regulator”. Perhaps that is where wewill eventually get to although one worries about its potential for the worst sort of bureaucracy: and inthe meantime we think that an approach based on close cooperation and the exchange of regulatoryinformation, is a pragmatic way forward and more likely to balance the need to protect investors andthe need to encourage innovative, responsive markets.But let me turn my attention back to the opportunities that technology offers. The scope for newcontracts on B2B and e-commerce networks is enormous. Contracts that would have taken some timeto establish themselves in a pit can be quickly listed on screen at relatively little cost. Trading is nowpossible in such diverse commodities as electricity, telecoms bandwidth and even the weather. Theorganisers of this event may, in future, be able to hedge their exposure to fluctuating wine prices usingexchange-traded futures based on the finest premier cru, I suspect this is one contract where traderswould be happy to go to physical delivery. We central bankers will have to stick to our usual vinordinaire. In any event it will be fascinating to see what other contracts emerge over the comingmonths.Of course, not all contracts that are launched will be successful, and it’s interesting to reflect on whatmakes a successful derivative contract. Lessons can often be learned from looking back to the past.Not far from this location is the home of the London Metal Exchange. Its origins can be traced back to1571, when traders in metal and a range of other commodities began meeting at the Royal Exchange.What was originally a domestic market in physical metal became a major global market, and by theearly 19th century traders had been forced to use nearby coffee shops. As the UK started importinglarge quantities of metal from abroad during the Industrial Revolution, the need emerged for importersto protect themselves against price movements during the long voyage from places like Chile andMalaysia. The “futures” market which developed from those humble beginnings continued to growand, in 1877, the London Metal Exchange Company was formed.That market was successful for a number of reasons. Volatility in the price of the underlying productmade the contract attractive to hedgers and speculators alike. Technology - the telegraph would youbelieve! - encouraged the market’s growth by making shipment arrival dates more predictable. TheLME had a first mover advantage that still stands. Liquidity flourished as traders followed one anotherin using the new market. So there are a number of lessons for today’s exchanges, to do with the needto respond to market needs, the need to make full use of available technology, and so on.Role of clearing housesIt will be very little surprise to many of you that, as the central bank, the aspect of these developmentswhich interests us most is the management of risk.
3BIS Review 51/2000Clearing houses have traditionally played a central role in the derivatives markets and continue to doso as those markets expand. They are also increasingly active in the underlying cash markets. It’s clearto see why the markets value their service and it is fortunate that, in the London Clearing House,London has a first class central counterparty. But clearing houses concentrate risk at a single point.And, by serving multiple markets, they provide a route for disturbance to be transmitted betweenmarkets. So the way they manage their risk, particularly as they expand their activities, is important -to you, I hope, as much as to us.Diversifying across products can provide benefits, particularly if this simultaneously diversifies aclearing house’s exposures across existing clearing members. And expansion into new markets whereexisting members are already active provides clearing houses - and potentially regulators - with moreinformation on members’ overall trading books which they can use to manage their risk moreeffectively.Diversifying across markets does not, of course, help when, for some reason, the markets all movetogether. And it is vital, in any case, that clearing houses continue to have robust arrangements formonitoring and controlling risk, including proper margining procedures and adequate financialresources, and that their procedures and ownership structure gives members the incentive to ensurethat risk is adequately controlled. That suggests to us that control and ownership of the clearing houseshould reside with clearing members, who are, in any case, likely to contribute a major part of anymutual guarantee fund.So we welcome the fact that the product of the LCH/Clearnet discussions is intended to be a non-profitmutual organisation which gives ownership to its users and look forward to as productive arelationship with the new body as we currently have with LCH.The topic of this week’s conference - putting the dot.com into derivatives - presents challenges butalso opportunities. If we can address both, the derivatives industry will be better placed than ever tomeet the needs of users world-wide.I wish you all an enjoyable week.
1BIS Review 51/2000Urban Bäckström: Asset markets and monetary policySpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at a conference organised by theRiksbank and the Stockholm School of Economics, held in Stockholm, on 16 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this conference on Asset Marketsand Monetary Policy that the Riksbank and the Stockholm School of Economics are jointlyorganising. The Riksbank has the ambition to host a conference every other year on a topical subject.Two years ago we organised a conference jointly with the Institute for International Economic Studieson Monetary Policy Rules. This year I am very pleased to announce that we will again be able topresent a set of papers written by scholars of the highest international academic standard and on asubject matter that is extremely topical: asset markets and monetary policy.In my opening remarks two years ago I suggested that the question of monetary policy and asset pricesshould be a topic for a future conference. The interaction between asset prices, the real economy, andmonetary policy is by no means a new matter for central bankers and economists, but the developmentof asset markets in the last few years has brought the question to the forefront of the policy debate.For a practitioner of monetary policy like myself, this area contains a number of difficult issues. I shallbe raising some of them this morning and they will also be discussed during the conference. By theend of the conference I hope we will be able to look back on a fruitful discussion and have a betterunderstanding of the issues and problems involved.How should monetary policy respond to movements in asset prices? This depends on how the centralbank chooses to use the information contained in asset prices.In a regime that explicitly targets inflation, asset prices are taken into account via the effects onaggregate demand. Rising share prices increase household wealth and that would raise consumptionfor a given level of income if these increases in wealth are considered to be of a permanent nature. Atthe same time, consumer confidence boosted by higher share prices could potentially make individualsmore prone to spend their increased wealth.An increase in share prices also makes investment more attractive to firms since it increases collateralvalues and lowers the cost of new capital relative to existing capital. If share prices predict higherexpected output growth, this could also lead to more investment.If the asset prices on which households and firms base their consumption and investment decisionsprove to be too optimistic, this would create inflationary pressure in the short term. An importantquestion in this context is how sensitive households’ and firms’ consumption and investmentresponses are to changes in asset prices.Via the effects on inflation, asset prices are thus taken into account in the formulation of monetarypolicy, although they do not feature explicitly in the target variable.However, the simple use of financial asset prices as indicators is not a panacea for the central banks’forecasting problems. Asset prices can move for a variety of reasons. Understanding those reasons isimportant in determining the appropriate monetary policy response. For example, if a rise in shareprices stems from increased productivity and thus from expectations of higher future profits, theimplications for monetary policy would be very different from a case with no such fundamental reasonfor the higher share prices.This raises a number of questions. The first pertains to the relative informativeness of different kindsof asset prices. The second is how to integrate the information obtained from asset prices with othermacroeconomic information. Notwithstanding the empirical evidence of the indicator properties ofasset prices, the causal relationships between asset prices and real macroeconomic variables have
BIS Review 50/20002proved to be more difficult to understand and model. But, as I have just illustrated, the answers tothese questions can be very important for monetary policy. It seems quite clear that central bankscannot afford to adopt a view of asset markets as merely “side-shows”.There can be other, sometimes less straightforward, situations where monetary policy has reason toreact to movements in asset prices even though the effect on inflation is negligible. One such reason isthe central bank’s responsibility for the stability of the financial system.If asset prices have been driven up to unsustainable levels that do not correspond to the underlyingfundamentals, we are faced with a special kind of problem. We know from experience that speculativeasset price bubbles eventually burst. When they do, collateral values will fall and balance sheetsdeteriorate, potentially threatening the stability of the banking system. To avoid this kind ofdevelopment, the central bank needs to closely monitor the potential for excessive credit growth andthe possibility of asset price bubbles building up.It seems that historically the forming of speculative price bubbles has been closely linked to anexcessive expansion of credit. But we need to operationalise both the concept “excessive” and thedifficult concept of an asset’s “fundamental value”. As history has shown us, judging to what extentrising asset prices reflect strong fundamentals, rather than the “irrational exuberance” of investors, iseasier said than done. How does a speculative asset price bubble get started and how do we spot it?And if we spot it, what do we do about it?In most countries the risks associated with a property price bubble would probably be considered to begreater than in the case of an equity price bubble. This is because in most countries banks are moreexposed to risks in the property market, since real estate is used as collateral for a considerable amountof bank loans. The bursting of a large property price bubble can have serious effects on financialintermediation. This could motivate an early monetary policy response.The cost of this pre-emptive strike strategy would have to be weighed against the fact that inflationand real activity will be lower than desired in the short term. Is this a price worth paying to maintainstability in the financial system? In order to answer that question, we need to know how sensitive thefinancial system is to a severe fall in property prices? Another problem with trying to actpre-emptively is, how do we spot the price bubble in time? So even though in a conflict betweenshort-un price stability and financial stability, the latter were to be viewed as the more important,implementing such a policy could be fraught with substantial practical problems.The grounds for a pre-emptive strike against an equity price bubble are perhaps less compelling thanfor a property price bubble. The US experience from the 1987 stock market crash seems to be that,with an appropriately conducted monetary policy, the effects on real activity can be relatively small.With New York Stock Exchange order flows grossly out of balance on 19 October 1987, with thesolvency of brokerages and clearing houses in doubt, banks were growing nervous and reluctant tolend. This was a clear case of systemic risk and before the market opened on 20 October the Fedaffirmed its responsibilities to serve as a lender of last resort and also substantially eased monetarypolicy. A financial meltdown was avoided and the effects on the real economy seem to have beennegligible.In the 1990s, the global monetary policy picture has in many countries been very different comparedto the 1980s. Low inflation seems to have become the norm rather than the exception. If monetarypolicy is successful in providing price stability, does that mean that the risk of financial instability willbe smaller? In order for a financial crisis to have severe effects on the real economy, substantialfinancial imbalances must have been allowed to build up during the preceding period. In other words,monetary policy makers must have seen no reason or been unable to prevent these imbalances frombuilding up.Thus, an important question is whether a monetary policy for price stability will indirectly preventexcessive debt accumulation in the economy? In other words, how likely is it that large imbalanceswill have time to build up before the central bank judges that its inflation target is threatened andtherefore raises interest rates? Can large imbalances materialise without inflationary pressure buildingup?
3BIS Review 51/2000A related question is whether the choice of monetary policy strategy has a bearing on the risk offinancial imbalances and financial crises? For example, will a monetary policy based on a simplepolicy rule lead to a lower or higher risk of financial imbalances building up compared to a morediscretionary policy? Will an inflation targeting regime lead to a larger or smaller risk of imbalancesbuilding up compared to a monetary targeting regime? These highly relevant questions are being askedby a number of central banks in emerging markets that have recently been forced to abandon a fixedexchange rate policy that was no longer sustainable.The papers to be presented at this conference will hopefully throw some light on a number of thequestions I have raised here this morning. I look forward to learning what our distinguished guestshave to say on these matters.
1BIS Review 50/2000Gordon Thiessen: The Canadian economy - finding the right balanceSpeech by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Kelowna Chamber ofCommerce, Kelowna, British Columbia, on 15 June 2000.*      *      *With the technological revolution that is currently sweeping the globe, dealing with change is agrowing challenge for businesses these days. This revolution is erasing national frontiers, intensifyingcompetition, and transforming economies everywhere. The rules of the game are constantly beingrewritten, and the issues facing businesses are multiplying rapidly.To survive and prosper in today’s world, businesses need to keep abreast of global technologicaltrends, be ready to innovate and apply new technologies to both their production processes and thedevelopment of new products and services for their clients.From a broader perspective, in order to have a vibrant, dynamic economy, we count on the businesscommunity to take the initiatives that increase productivity and competitiveness so that we, as anation, can benefit from rapidly changing technologies and increasingly open global markets.What business people need, in turn, in order to go confidently about their affairs and take theinnovative, and sometimes risky, initiatives we expect of them, is a supportive economic policyenvironment.Today, I would like to talk about what monetary policy is doing to foster such an environment.Low and stable inflation is good for businessNow, more than ever, businesses are operating in a changeable and uncertain world. The Bank ofCanada has been doing what it can by removing one major cause of uncertainty - high and variableinflation.Low and stable inflation is good for business, good for the consumer, and good for the economy as awhole.This is not just a trendy central bank mantra. The emphasis that central banks are placing on pricestability these days is neither fanciful nor unstudied. It is pragmatic. And it has to do with reducinguncertainty about the future, eliminating the inefficiencies caused by inflation, and minimizingeconomic ups and downs.The future is always uncertain. But it is even more so when inflation is rising because the pace atwhich prices rise is rarely stable or predictable. This uncertainty distorts and confuses the informationthat consumers, entrepreneurs, savers, and investors rely on to make their economic decisions.Not only that. Businesses and individuals end up spending more time and money either protectingthemselves against inflation or trying to benefit from it. And interest rates rise to compensate saversand lenders for expected higher inflation and for the risks caused by uncertainty about future inflation.None of this encourages productive investment. In the high-inflation days of the 1970s and 1980s, alot of economic resources were instead devoted to hedging and speculative purchases. Andinflationary booms - here and elsewhere - inevitably turned into busts.We must not let this happen again. That is why the Bank of Canada and the Government of Canadahave agreed to an explicit target for inflation control. This target aims to hold inflation inside a rangeof 1 to 3%.Inflation-control targets also ensure that monetary policy works to moderate fluctuations in output,employment, and incomes. In the nine years since the targets were first adopted, not only has
BIS Review 50/20002underlying inflation been lower than in the previous two decades, but economic growth hasstrengthened and has shown less short-term variability.As we move ahead, we must ensure that this situation continues and that we avoid the boom-bustcycles of the past. Granted, we will not be able to wipe out fluctuations completely. External shockswill still buffet Canada’s very open economy every now and then. And we will get economic surpriseson the domestic front too. But in the past, our economic ups and downs were often amplified byoutbreaks of inflation.Keeping the economy on an even keelSo how is the Canadian economy performing these days and what is the Bank of Canada doing to helpkeep it on an even keel?Our economy has been expanding solidly for some time now - even through the Asian financial crisisof 1997-98 - creating the conditions for the healthy gains in employment and incomes that we are nowseeing.Since mid-1999, the economy has outperformed expectations - growing in excess of 5% at annualrates and with an underlying rate of inflation that, excluding fluctuations in energy prices, hasremained in the bottom half of our 1 to 3% target range. The Bank has raised its projection for growthin 2000 to a range of 4 to 4.5% because of stronger demand for Canadian products from both domesticand foreign sources.When it comes to foreign demand, this stronger momentum reflects faster-than-expected growth inseveral parts of the world, including Europe and the emerging-market economies that were in the eyeof the Asian storm. Even in Japan, where the outlook continues to be uncertain, economic conditionsshould improve this year.But by far the greatest source of this stronger external stimulus is the tremendous buoyancy of demandin the United States - a market that absorbs over 80% of our exports. Demand in that countrycontinues to steam ahead and to push hard against the limits of production capacity. And signs of priceand wage pressures have become more visible. That is why the US Federal Reserve has raised interestrates six times in the past 12 months to cool down the economy.The Bank of Canada has also been concerned that the greater-than-expected US demand for ourexports, along with the strong momentum of spending by Canadians, could lead to undue pressure onour production capacity and consequently on future inflation in Canada. With US monetary actionsreinforcing our view about the risks of a buildup of demand and inflation pressures in that country - abuildup which could spill over into Canada - we have raised interest rates four times since lastNovember.In this connection, I would like to highlight a couple of important points that sometimes get lost in thepublic commentary.Monetary policy actions aim at future inflationFirst, monetary policy is concerned with future inflation pressures.Monetary policy works with relatively long lags. It takes between 18 and 24 months for a change ininterest rates to work through the economy and have an effect on inflation. For this reason, any actionstaken by the Bank of Canada today must be based largely on considerations about the economy andinflation 18 to 24 months down the road - not on what is happening now and not on the current rate ofinflation (except to the extent that these factors colour our view of the future).So, even though the underlying rate of inflation has been in the lower half of the 1 to 3% target range,the Bank has to consider what is likely to happen to prices in the future.
3BIS Review 50/2000Monetary policy actions are based on economic prospects here at homeThe next point I would like to stress is that Canadian monetary policy decisions focus, first andforemost, on the economic outlook here in Canada.So, the critical element is the Bank’s assessment of the balance of forces at work in the Canadianeconomy, and what this means for future inflation. If domestic demand here in Canada was notparticularly strong, greater-than-anticipated US demand for our products would be a compensatingelement and hardly an issue. But if domestic demand was already rising rapidly, and the Canadianeconomy was operating at high levels, the spillover of strong US demand would have the potential tostrain our production capacity and lead to higher inflation in the future.The important judgment that your central bank must make - every step of the way - is how thesedomestic and external forces add up.When the Canadian economy is generally in sync with that of the United States, and interest rates inour two countries are moving in the same direction, I can appreciate that Canadian monetary policymay be difficult to interpret. Some people may be persuaded to think that the Bank of Canada neverhas any choice but to follow the US Federal Reserve. Or, for that matter, that the Bank must have atarget for the Canadian dollar that requires interest rates here to move in lock-step with US rates.But that is just not so.When US monetary authorities raise interest rates, the Bank of Canada has to look carefully at thereasons behind the move and decide what it means in terms of our ongoing assessment of theprospects for total demand and inflation in Canada.Developments in the US economy will always be important to Canada. And moves in US interest rateswill always influence rates around the world, including ours. But that does not mean that we cannothave different interest rates in Canada and that the Bank always follows the Fed. Sometimes we do,and sometimes we don’t. It all depends on what we think is necessary to keep the Canadian economyon a non-inflationary, and thus sustainable, growth path.As I have already noted, in the past 12 months, we raised our interest rates four times while theAmericans have raised theirs six times. On those four occasions, including the most recent increase inMay, the Bank, after careful consideration, decided that the implications of US developments for oureconomy justified higher rates here as well.It is also important to remember that Canadian interest rates are still below comparable US rates for allmaturities - as they have been for the last few years. This basically reflects the fact that we have alower rate of inflation than our US neighbours and that our economy has not been pressing as hardagainst its capacity limits as theirs.We need to keep demand and supply in balanceThrough this discussion, I have talked mostly about total demand, but have not said much about oureconomy’s ability to supply goods and services - except to suggest that a rapidly rising demand couldlead to pressures on capacity and inflation.For the most part, we can be reasonably confident about assessing the various sources and strength ofdemand in the economy. But estimates of the production potential of our economy, are much moreuncertain these days because of major ongoing structural changes.We know that in recent years, and especially since 1996, Canadian businesses have been investingheavily in machinery, equipment, and software, much of which embodies the latest technologies. Thisshould raise productivity in Canada and allow our economy to grow faster than it otherwise would.But, at this point, it is difficult to tell by how much, whether some of the gains are already in, orwhether most are still to come. So far, our statistics yield little direct evidence of a substantial pickupin productivity growth, although recent historical revisions to the National Accounts show somewhatlarger gains than before.
BIS Review 50/20004Because of this uncertainty, the Bank is taking a cautious approach to projecting a permanently higherrate of growth in our economy’s capacity to produce. But we certainly do not want to dismiss thispossibility either. That is why we are following closely a wider-than-usual range of indicators thatcould tell us what is happening on the supply side and give us early-warning signs of pressure oncapacity and prices. For example, we watch for unexpected movements in the underlying trend ofinflation and for changes in expectations of future inflation. We also look at commodity prices, wagesettlements, reports of shortages in product and labour markets, the growth of money and credit, andinformation from the Bank’s business contacts across Canada.Take, for instance, our best estimate of the trend of inflation - what we call core inflation. This is ameasure that takes out of the consumer price index the fluctuations caused by the very volatile energyand food components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes. By this measure, inflation has beensomewhat lower than we had expected since late last year. This very favourable price performancesuggests that our economy has not been pressing as hard against capacity as we had thought. It givesus some more room to explore where the limits of that capacity really are. And this should givebusinesses a greater opportunity to exploit their new equipment and technology to the fullest.Nonetheless, we must not be lulled into thinking that the threat of inflation has disappeared. Given thestrong momentum and high levels of activity in our economy, and given the time that it takes formonetary policy actions to affect output and prices, the Bank must remain vigilant. Nothing will bringthe present expansion to an abrupt halt more quickly than an outbreak of inflation.Assessing the balance between total demand and supply in the economy and the implications forinflation will be an ongoing challenge for monetary policy. I can assure you that the Bank is fullycommitted to the task - because keeping inflation low and stable will help to provide an environmentin which the Canadian economy can enjoy solid growth and achieve its full potential.
1BIS Review 50/2000Urban Bäckström: The inflation targeting approachSpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 28th Economic Conference ofthe Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Wien, on 15 June 2000.*      *      *First a word of thanks for the invitation to attend this conference and discuss challenges for monetarypolicy together with such a distinguished panel.In the last decade a growing number of countries have chosen to conduct monetary policy with anexplicit target for inflation. One reason behind this choice has no doubt been these countries’ poorexperience with a fixed, but adjustable, exchange rate regime.The first country to formally adopt a policy of targeting inflation was New Zealand, in 1990. Canadadid the same in 1991, followed by the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. Since the early 1990sother countries have also introduced some variant of inflation targeting.It is interesting to note that before the 1990s the predominant view was that a floating exchange rateregime was not suitable for a small open economy. Today, I believe that experience among thosecountries that are targeting inflation has been exceptionally good. In fact, even some emerging marketcountries are now building the same kind of regime.It is not without some pride that I recall that, in a sense, Sweden was actually something of a pioneerin explicitly focusing monetary policy, with a flexible exchange rate, on a specified target for prices.Back in 1931, after Sweden had been obliged to abandon the gold standard, its government and thecentral bank declared that the overriding objective of monetary policy would be the stabilisation ofprices. More specifically, the finance minister of the day described the task of the central bank as thatof, “using all means available, preserving the domestic purchasing power of the Swedish krona”. Inthis way, the Riksbank became the first central bank to declare price stabilisation as its policy normwith a floating exchange rate.The norm was based on a proposal made much earlier, in 1898, by Knut Wicksell, often regarded asSweden’s greatest economist at the time. Wicksell’s rule for monetary policy, which stemmed fromhis extension of the classical quantity theory of money, was simple: “The central bank is to raise thediscount rate as long as prices are rising, lower it as long as prices are falling and keep it constantwhen prices are stable”.In other words, price stability was to be achieved through interest policy. Although the rule applied tothe price level rather than to inflation and was not forward looking, it is a clear parallel to the rules ofthumb that are used today by those central banks that target inflation.Sweden’s price stability norm in the 1930s lasted only a few years and was followed by a return to afixed exchange rate regime. During those years, however, it performed the central function ofstabilising expectations as well as prices. This was important not least because to some extent it helpedshield Sweden from the global economy’s depressive impulses and thereby contributed to the recoverybeing speedier than in most other countries.Here I should perhaps add that although this Swedish price stability “experiment” attracted a gooddeal of attention at the time, it certainly did not leave any deep or lasting mark on the modernapproach to inflation targeting. In the aftermath of the depression and the second world war,Keynesianism gained ground. The introduction of inflation targeting in Sweden in the 1930s wastherefore not as pioneering as when this kind of regime was introduced in the early 1990s, first byNew Zealand and later by others.
BIS Review 50/20002A great advantage with a regime that explicitly targets inflation, is that the central bank adjusts theinterest rate continuously in the light of inflation prospects. Compared with a fixed exchange rateregime, imbalances can then be prevented from building up to the same extent. A slight upwardadjustment of the interest rate at an early stage, to reduce the risk of inflation picking up, is somethingquite different from having to hike the short-term interest rate in order to defend a fixed exchange rate.As a personal reflection I can say that explaining the importance of low inflation is much easier - notleast for a central bank governor - than the task of selling the advantages of a stable currency. This isparticularly true as the latter task becomes increasingly pressing if the economy has been hit byproblems with costs and is facing speculative attacks. Some of you may remember that for a few daysin the autumn of 1992 the instrumental rate in Sweden was raised to as much as 500 per cent. In myview, this is probably one important explanation why Sweden is not a member of the ERM system - atleast not at this stage.The challenge during the 1990s for the inflation targeting countries has been to build a rigorousframework around the new regime. Answers have been needed in particular to questions like thefollowing: What rate of inflation should be targeted, what index should be used, are bands around thetarget necessary, the degree of transparency, etc.It has also been important to formulate a monetary policy reaction function, that is, to define thebalance between inflation variability and output variability. The reason why central banks do not aimfor maximum short-term stability in either inflation or output is that attaining only one of the targetswould be costly.On the one hand, the central bank’s legitimacy among the general public could be lost if short-terminterest rates have to move sharply and cause output to fluctuate widely while inflation is being heldstable and exactly on the target. Maximum stability in output could, on the other hand, result in sharpfluctuations in the rate of inflation and erode the target’s credibility. Instead it is a matter of finding apoint somewhere midway between the two extremes.Looking ahead, I believe there are at least two major questions that central banks have to address morethoroughly.First, how should monetary policy react to asset prices, such as equity and/or real estate prices? Weknow from history that the development of asset prices can have a significant impact on both inflationand real economic activity. We need to establish whether or not there are actions that central banks canand should take to minimise the likelihood of macroeconomic instability arising from extremefluctuations in asset prices.Second, how should monetary policy react to structural changes in the economy? On this issue quite alot of thinking has already been done, both among academics and policymakers. Nevertheless, Ibelieve that more must be done in this field, especially since at least some parts of the world economyhave seen something of a productivity shock in recent years. I am carefully trying to avoid using thebuzzword “new economy” here, since history has been full of expressions like that ever since the turnof the 19th century.Unfortunately, I do not have the time to elaborate on the first question. Instead I will say a few wordsabout the second.Although the discussion about monetary policy and a productivity shock is taking place mostly in theUnited States, in the light of the impressive economic performance there and the acceleration in therate of productivity growth, one could certainly ask: What about Europe?Europe is, on the one hand, now in a strong upward economic phase. In addition, new technology,especially the Internet and telecommunications, is gaining ground in many European countries. On theother hand, Europe also differs from the US. The rapid growth of US investment has not yet been seenin Europe. One could also argue that the existence of quite a few structural obstacles in Europe makesan acceleration of productivity growth less likely in the immediate future.A handful of countries - including the Netherlands, Ireland, the UK and, more recently, Sweden andFinland - have achieved strong economic growth and in some cases also low inflation. But with the
3BIS Review 50/2000exception of Ireland, these countries have not yet enjoyed the same strong productivity growth as theUS.Nevertheless, the possibility of a productivity breakthrough also in Europe cannot be ruled out. It willprobably depend on how well Europe succeeds in reforming microeconomic policy.Higher - or accelerating - productivity growth does indeed pose new challenges for monetary policy. Itcould set in motion a complex of effects on aggregate supply and demand, on inflation, equity pricesand interest rates. Just to give a few examples, let me briefly mention the following effects:First, a positive productivity shock raises the economy’s potential growth rate. It also affectsaggregate demand through new, profitable investment opportunities, higher equity prices andexpectations among households of higher permanent income. One question for policymakers iswhether the demand effects are so powerful that they have the potential to outpace the growth ofaggregate supply in the short and medium perspective.Second, there could be temporary disinflation effects at work if the increase in productivity isunexpected initially. If wages are slow to adjust, higher productivity growth lowers unit labour costsand thereby reduces price inflation. Here again there are important questions for policymakers. Shouldthis effect be allowed to result in a temporary reduction of price inflation or unemployment?Third, an increase in the trend rate of productivity growth could also result in a higher equilibrium realinterest rate, when the output gap is closed, in order to balance saving and investment. Fiscal policyand the development of public financial balances could at least partly offset this effect, as could theeconomy’s degree of openness.All this implies that monetary policymakers, also in Europe, could face quite a few challenges. One ofthem is to identify structural changes and distinguish these from cyclical variations. Another challengeis to detect the magnitude of the effects. Furthermore, looking ahead in monetary policy is hard whenthe economy is going through major changes that make it difficult to forecast the future path of theeconomy and inflation.It is quite clear that this demands a great deal of forecasters as well as of those who construct macromodels. The forecasts concern inflation one to two years ahead, which calls, for instance, forreasonable precision in the measurement of the output gap and the relationship between the output gapand inflation.It is already evident, for example, that in the 1990s inflation forecasts in many countries werefrequently on the high side. I believe that the best we can do, at least at this stage, is to pay closeattention to incoming data in the forecasting process, and not mechanically use the results from modelsthat rely too heavily on historical relationships. We have to deal more successfully with the fact thatforecasts of economic developments can never be completely accurate and still allow monetary policyto be forward looking.When discussing monetary policy of today, we must remember that we have come a long way. Theworld economy shows strong growth coupled with low inflation and monetary policy has contributedto this development. However, there are interesting, though somewhat difficult, challenges ahead of uswhich must be met if we are to preserve this bright picture of the world economy. This conference willcontribute to a better understanding of the issues and problems involved.
1BIS Review 49/2000Masaru Hayami: The role of Japan amid the changinginternational financial environmentSpeech by Mr Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Executive Board of Directors’Meeting of the Japan Foreign Trade Council, held in Tokyo, on 7 June 2000.*      *      *1.IntroductionThank you for inviting me to the 263rd Executive Board of Directors’ Meeting. It is a great pleasure tohave this opportunity to address such a distinguished audience. It also brings back memories of mydays as one of the Council’s Executive Directors and Vice Chairman under Chairman Mimura. Yourinvitation today allows me to be here again, for the first time in almost ten years since I left theCouncil to become Chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. Knowing that manyof you come from trading companies which are active globally, today I’d like to share my ideas fromthe viewpoint of the role of Japan amid the changing international financial environment.2.Tensions generated by globalizationHaving previously worked for the Bank of Japan for 34 years, I had a chance to work in the thenForeign Department, our London Office and other positions related to the Bank’s internationalactivities. It was a great experience for me to attend important international meetings such as the BISand the then G5 meetings.Then, two years ago, I returned to the Bank of Japan as Governor. Now, representing the Bank, I havea chance to again take part in various international meetings. Attending such meetings, I have noticedtwo things. First, the number of international meetings has multiplied over the years. In this context, ofparticular note is that the presence of emerging-market countries, particularly the Asian economies,has also increased. One reason for this is somewhat paradoxical in that since the Asian currency crisesof 1997, there is a consensus that the economic and financial stability of emerging-market economiesis crucial for global economic and financial stability. Indeed, the rise in the number of internationalmeetings and participants evidences the extent to which economies are becoming globalized.The second thing I have noticed is that various kinds of tensions have arisen as the market economyhas become more globalized. I clearly recall NGO activists surrounding the WTO’s MinisterialConference in Seattle last December. The IMFC meeting, which I attended in late April on the dayafter the G7 Meeting, was also the target of similar protests.How can it be that the IMF, a pivotal contributor to the development of the liberalized marketeconomy after the Second World War, and the WTO, a legitimate successor to GATT, have becomethe targets of such protests? Perhaps the phenomenon can be seen as a typical example of increasedtension between those who have ridden the tide of the market-oriented economy and those who havegrave concerns about global environmental issues and widening gaps among regions which arepossibly caused by rapid global developments.I think many agree that the world economy is currently in the midst of one of its most importantturning points since the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Ongoing globalization andcomputerization are mega trends which will continue well into the future. In this context, competitionat the global level is expected to intensify. It is global competition which is the principal driving forcebehind economic dynamism. No one can stop this trend and we should react positively. However, wecannot deny the fact that newly formed tensions and uncertainties have emerged. Therefore, we shouldcontinue to look for ways to promote the sound and stable development of the world economy throughsteady efforts to establish appropriate rules and regulations that are compatible with the new trends.
BIS Review 49/20002One thing is certain, such efforts will be accompanied by difficulties, involving some disagreementson the international front, and it is incumbent upon us to try to find solutions.3.Meaning of IMF reformAgainst the background of such trends, the international monetary and financial system is burdenedwith further responsibilities. In particular, the Asian currency crises brought to the fore various issuesof concern to international financial circles including the prevention and resolution of future currencycrises. And, the outcome of discussions constitutes part of the concept of the so-called “new financialarchitecture”. The Financial Stability Forum, which was inaugurated last April at the request of theG7, has published recommendations on such issues as highly leveraged financial institutions (forexample, hedge funds) and international capital flows. This is one example of the fruit of workundertaken by international financial fora.The reform of the IMF has been a most important issue. And it was also the Asian currency crises thattriggered intense debate about the necessity of such reform. The Asian currency crises that broke outas the result of the rapid outflow of short-term capital are called “21st century-type crises”. Here, theIMF has come to be the target of criticism which holds that IMF should improve its surveillanceability and increase transparency of its policy-making processes because it has not sufficiently carriedout its mission of crisis prevention and resolution. I personally think the problems surrounding theIMF are deep-rooted and partly reflect its history.As you well know, the period preceding the Second World War was characterized by such negativefactors as competitive devaluations, restrictions on current account transactions, and the widespreaduse of protectionist measures. Without doubt, these had a significant impact on the internationaleconomy and created tensions between countries, only fueling pro-war sentiment. The IMF wasestablished with the aim of avoiding the repetition of such disruption. The primary concern of the timewas to create a well-structured and crisis-proof international monetary system. For example, fixedparity between the US dollar and gold (with $1 equivalent to 35 ounces), the adoption of the adjustablepeg system, and abolition of restrictions on current account transactions were key elementsunderpinning the Bretton-Woods architecture. Regarding capital account transactions, membercountries of the IMF were allowed to impose some degree of restrictive measures. Therefore, it is fairto say that more attention was paid to the stable expansion of current account transactions rather thancapital account transactions.However, things have dramatically changed since then. With respect to the foreign exchange regime,the so-called “Nixon shock” in 1971 marked an abrupt end to convertibility between the US dollar andgold, which eventually led to the arrival of floating exchange regimes on a global scale in 1973. And,capital account liberalization was pursued much more vigorously than most architects of theBretton-Woods system envisioned. As a result, the volume of today’s cross-border capital flows farexceeds current account transactions. As I noted earlier, the huge increase in cross-border capital flowsseems to exert a bigger impact than current account transactions on the economic and financialconditions of individual countries, and, at times, could trigger serious currency crises.In brief, present conditions surrounding the international financial system are entirely different fromwhat they used to be when the IMF was created. Amid accelerating globalization and accompanyingrising tensions, what kind of contributions can the IMF make to the stability of the internationalmonetary system? What should be the core functions of the IMF in this context? These questions areprime movers behind recent discussions on IMF reform.The IMFC meeting I attended this April in Washington was previously called the Interim Committee.But, unlike the Interim Committee, the IMFC is structured as a permanent forum. Thus, thetransformation of the Interim Committee into the IMFC comprises part of efforts to strengthen theIMF, and it can be seen as a symbol of the current challenges facing the international financial system.At the first IMFC meeting this April, we had lively discussions on how to reform the IMF. Althoughfurther consideration is needed to reach any realistic conclusions, I believe that some kind ofconsensus was formed regarding the future direction we should take in reforming the IMF.
3BIS Review 49/2000First, we agreed to develop rules under the basic concept of utilizing market functions. In this regard,the latest G7 and IMFC communiques underscore the importance of involving the private sector inforestalling and resolving currency and financial crises. At the same time, it was agreed to strengthenthe IMF’s role in making various rules that can be applied to new developments in global markets, andin monitoring the observance of such rules by member countries. Such a role can be considered asensuring conditions for proper market functioning are in place, or to correct market failures.Second, we agreed to review or redefine IMF operations under the basic concept of utilizing marketfunctions. In this regard, it was suggested that, for instance, IMF lending operations be limited toshort-term liquidity provision to members facing capital account crises. It was also argued thatmedium and long-term financial support for promoting development be reduced.Third, since the IMF has been strongly criticized for lack of transparency in its decision-makingprocedures, its accountability should be enhanced in the interest of better governance.IMF reform has just started. However, it is an important challenge that may determine the futurecourse of the international monetary and financial system. Japan is the second largest subscriber to theIMF, following the US. At the same time, Japan is one of the countries most involved in internationalfinancial markets, as witnessed by the fact that Japan is the world’s largest capital exporter as well aslargest net creditor. Japan has made various contributions to the formation of a consensus amonginternational financial circles regarding the direction of IMF reform and it should continue to do so.4.Role of Japan in a changing international financial environment(1)What is expected of Japan?Now, let me clarify Japan’s role in this period of changing international finance. First, Japan shouldactively participate in developing international rules. The introduction of international standards andcodes involves important elements that determine not only the future path of global economicdevelopment, but which may also have a substantial impact on domestic finance and the economy. Forexample, this can be seen in Japan by observing how corporate management is being affected by theintroduction of international accounting rules. In practice, however, to take part in international rulemaking is not as easy as it may sound. It requires an enormous amount of knowledge as well aspowers of persuasion. And here we should note Japan’s position in the global economy as well as therole it plays in Asian economies. It is thus desirable that Japan be actively involved in and contributeto international rule-making efforts with a full understanding of the situation in the region. In thiscontext, the Bank of Japan seeks to strengthen relations with colleagues in EMEAP (Executives’Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks) through more intensive dialogue regarding the regionaleconomy and finance. Furthermore, Japan is expected to contribute to the process of implementingrules in Asia through technical assistance in the field of financial system reform and the establishmentof economic and financial infrastructure such as data collection and dissemination systems.Japan’s second role is to directly contribute to the stable growth of the global economy by securing itsown sustainable growth. For this purpose, bringing the economy back to the recovery phase of thebusiness cycle is an important challenge. Furthermore, it is more important that Japan goes beyondthis by regaining economic dynamism by steadily pursuing structural reform. In addition, as I willdiscuss later, it will be a big challenge for Japan to win global confidence in its economy as a whole.(2)Japan’s economy and the role of the YenI do not have enough time today to discuss Japan’s expected role in a comprehensive manner.Therefore, I would like to focus my thoughts on one of the important issues regarding the role ofJapan’s economy in the global economy and finance; that is “the role of the yen as an internationalcurrency”. This issue is also closely related to the point I have just made: how to win globalconfidence in Japan’s overall economy.
BIS Review 49/20004International currency can be defined as “a currency actively used by non-residents as a tool tomeasure, to store, and to exchange value”. Although non-residents are using the yen, it is perhaps hardto say that it is “actively used”. Rather, it is often argued that the yen is not sufficiently used as aninternational currency relative to Japan’s status in the global economy. What does this mean?For currencies to be widely used in a global manner, there are several conditions to be met. First, it isindispensable to win confidence in the currency internationally. In order to realize this goal, we need astrong economy supported by a stable currency value.In this connection, let me briefly describe the current state of Japan’s economy. It is becomingincreasingly clear that the economy is improving with support from decisive macroeconomic policy.In particular, we are observing welcoming signs in private sector demand as evidenced by a continuinggradual increase in capital expenditures against the background of improving corporate profits. In thecoming period, we will carefully examine momentum of the recovery, focusing on how such recoveryin the corporate sector will spread to the household sector.Here, I come back to the issue of an international currency. As the second condition for theinternational use of a currency, I can point out its “user friendliness”. For a currency to be userfriendly, the existence of a liberalized and open economic environment, which includes deep financialand capital markets, is necessary. Third, the existence of a mechanism by which the creation of aninternational network for a currency is catalyzed and accelerated is significant. For example, the globalactivities of the shipping, finance, and insurance industries under the British Empire, and thenAmerican multinational firms in the finance and IT industries, respectively accelerated global use ofthe pound and US dollar. It may be possible that Japan’s contribution to other countries through moreintensive technical assistance will lead to an expanded network for the yen.In sum, to what extent a nation’s currency is globally used depends on confidence in the nation’seconomy as a whole. To enhance such confidence, every measure should be taken with the threeaspects I mentioned in mind.I would like to take up the issue of the Japanese government bond (JGB) market as an example. Theratio of JGBs owned by non-residents is currently only a few percent, which is extremely lowcompared to the US and other G10 countries. This is especially understandable when Japan’scumulative current account surplus and high savings rate are taken into consideration. However, interms of the global bond index, which world bond investors refer to when making investmentjudgments, the share of JGBs is the second largest next to that of US government bonds. If the currentbudget situation of the two countries remains unchanged for some time, it is possible that the share ofJGBs will become comparable to that of US Treasuries. If so, it is imperative that the JGB marketbecomes attractive for international investors.What is necessary for the JGB market to achieve the global standard? Needless to say, policydecisions that might impair confidence in JGBs must be avoided. In this regard, budget policy of thegovernment should be constrained in the long run. It would also be significant to improve the safetyand user friendliness of the JGB market from the viewpoint of such aspects as the usability of futuresand repo markets, the tax treatment of JGBs, and the standardization of trading and settlementcustoms.In my speech today, I have touched upon three conditions for a currency to be internationally used,namely, confidence in the currency, high degree of user friendliness, and an international network. Ibelieve that these conditions coincide with the direction that Japan should move in the coming century.Let me add that every time I refer to the “internationalization of the yen”, it carries my strong hopethat Japan will adjust to the new global economic order and contribute to international rule making andthe foundation for sustainable economic and financial development in the Asian region.
1BIS Review 48/2000Eva Srejber: The role of monetary policy for growth in SwedenSpeech by Ms Eva Srejber, Second Deputy Governor of Sveriges Riksbank, at theFöreningsSparbanken’s Economics Day, held in Vellinge, on 6 June 2000.*      *      *I would like to begin by thanking you for the invitation to speak here at FöreningsSparbanken’sEconomics Day. In my speech today, I shall try to look beyond the day-to-day monetary policy wherethe focus on interest rate points and minor differences in assessments of the consumer price index attimes entails a risk of a lack of perspective. It can therefore sometimes be justified to remind oneselfand others of the role that economic policy can and should play. For me as a decision-maker at theRiksbank, this applies in particular of course to the role of monetary policy and the importance of thestability of the payment system. I would also like to recall the successes achieved in the Swedisheconomy during the past decade, where fiscal and monetary policy have both made importantcontributions. The challenge now is to reinforce what has been achieved and at the same time bestrong enough to carry out the changes that remain. It is also important to continually evaluate anddiscuss the design of economic policy as new experiences are obtained. This requires openness, whichhas been a lodestar for the Riksbank in recent years.To create understanding and support for the goal of price stability, it has been necessary to explain theconceptual framework that guides monetary policy decisions in a simple, pedagogic way. This hasperhaps resulted in our creating an exaggerated idea that monetary policy decisions are arrived at withthe aid of very simple rules. A simple conceptual framework is a support in a complicated reality.However, factors that cannot be captured in a simple rule for decision-making need to be taken intoaccount. Since the effects of monetary policy extend over a number of years, every decision must reston assessments of probability and individual valuations of the risks that are associated with alternativedevelopments in the macroeconomy in future. In conclusion, I draw attention to some of these risks inthe development of the Swedish economy in the present situation.The three pillars of economic policyA well-balanced economic policy contributes to creating good prerequisites for stable, high growth,which is generally regarded as an important component of the welfare concept. For this, it is requiredthat all components of economic policy play their roles well. This applies to fiscal, structural andmonetary policy. Good conditions for growth are created when uncertainty about future income andexpenditure is minimised. If at the same time resources are used where they make the greatestcontribution to welfare, there are prerequisites for good development. Economic policy should bedesigned so as to minimise uncertainty and so that the regulatory framework and tax system do notdistort the allocation of resources in the economy.If fiscal policy is carried out so that the central government debt is stabilised at a reasonable long-termlevel, certainty is established in the design of the transfer systems and coming tax burdens andinvestment and consumption decisions are facilitated. Structural policy also has an important role withregard to creating good conditions for growth. Structural policy is such a broad concept that I can onlypoint to some important components. The tax and transfer systems, for instance, should be designed sothat they do not create motives for citizens to act in a way that is harmful to long-term growth andwelfare. The task of the educational system is to provide access to relevant, high-quality education andthat of labour market policy to ensure that demand and supply of labour power match.
BIS Review 48/20002The tasks of the RiksbankA monetary policy aiming at price stability reduces uncertainty about future real incomes. Agreementson future payments and assessments of future income are thereby facilitated. Demands forcompensation for risk are reduced which, among other things, stimulates real investments. Pricestability also improves the ability of the price system to spread information about how resources are tobe distributed to areas where they most benefit citizens. In a market economy, it is the task of the pricesystem to communicate information about household preferences and, for instance, to provide signalsas to where productivity is to be best developed.Besides the task of safeguarding price stability, the Riksbank is also responsible for the country’spayment system. It is a prerequisite for the functioning of a modern economy that payments can becarried out in a safe, efficient way. In order for payment systems to function, it is important thatfinancial stability is maintained, which, for instance, means that bank crises shall be avoided. Thereare close connections between the responsibility of the central bank for price stability and itsresponsibility for financial stability. In order for the instrumental rate to have the desired effect oninterest rate formation, it is, for instance, important that the payment system functions efficiently andsecurely, since monetary policy instruments operate via the payment systems. Price stability canfurther be threatened by financial imbalances and by financial instability. At the same time a monetarypolicy focused on price stability per se probably reduces the risk for financial instability. It is notmeaningful to draw a sharp boundary between what is regarded as the central bank’s monetary policytasks and what is included in the responsibility for a secure, efficient payment system. I confine myselfhere to stressing that price stability and financial stability are both required to create good growthconditions in an economy. And the central bank plays an important role in achieving both these goals.On 1 January 1999, a new Riksbank Act came into force. It states that the goal for the Riksbank’sactivity is to maintain stable prices. The Riksbank shall also be responsible for a secure, efficientpayment system. In the preparatory legal material on the Act, it is also further stated that the Riksbank,without setting aside the price stability target, shall also support the objectives of general economicpolicy with a view to achieving sustainable growth and high employment.The price stability goal has then been confirmed by law. The Riksbank’s Executive Board isresponsible for making the price stability goal operational and designing the framework for monetarypolicy. Among other things, this means that the Executive Board decides on how the price stabilitygoal is to be defined and over what period price stability is to be maintained.The Executive Board of the Riksbank has decided that price stability shall be defined as an annualincrease in the consumer price index of 2% with a tolerance interval of plus/minus one percentagepoint. If the consumer price index is affected by factors that are considered to only have a temporaryeffect on CPI, the Executive Board has agreed that we shall be able to disregard this. The reason is thatmonetary policy otherwise risks leading to unnecessary fluctuations in employment and production.A lot has been achieved although some things remain to be doneEconomic policy has been very successful in many areas during recent years. When centralgovernment debt increased dramatically during the first half of the 1990s, when, at the same time,unemployment increased to a very high level and large fluctuations in long interest rates and theexchange rate indicated great uncertainty in inflation prospects in the mid-1990s, there were probablynot many who could imagine that we would so quickly have such a positive development as we are atpresent experiencing. Central government finances have improved markedly and we are now one ofthe best in the EU with regard to the size of central government debt and the central governmentbudget balance.For some time now, growth has been strong and we expect unemployment to fall towards 4% duringthe coming year. And despite this, inflation expectations remains at a stable level close to the target.We can therefore note that the Riksbank has been very successful in creating support and credibilityaround the price stability target. Without such a responsible fiscal policy, it would not have beenpossible to reduce inflation expectations in the way that has happened, however. The prohibition
3BIS Review 48/2000against financing the budget deficit at the central bank was a step in that direction. The rule that theGovernment and Riksdag adopted and which means that fiscal policy is to strive towards a surplus ofan average of 2% over a business cycle furthermore supports the price stability target and creates goodconditions for growth. The expenditure ceiling for central government finances that sets limits for howmuch public activity can expand has the same effect.Many structural reforms that have improved the conditions for growth in the longer term have alsobeen carried out during the past decades. The financial markets are wholly deregulated and the taxsystem is reformed so that it produces fewer distortions than before. During the 1990s, a process hasbeen initiated which has strengthened competition in many areas. Transport, communication andenergy have been deregulated. At the same time, EU membership and continued internationalisationhave exposed the business sector to increased competition.However, there is still a great potential for deregulation. This applies, for instance, to many parts ofservice production where moreover growth prospects look favourable. A study recently carried out bythe Competition Authority confirms that competition has improved during the 1990s, but also points toconsiderable competition deficiencies in many industries. Besides many industries in the servicesector, this also applies, among others, to the construction industry where regulatory frameworks andbuilding norms contribute to excluding competitors from other countries. The study is a follow-up of astudy carried out in 1991. Its conclusion was that lack of competition and concomitant high prices wasa feature of a number of the industries investigated.Exaggerated expectations about the growth path can create macroeconomic imbalanceEven though the growth prospects for the Swedish economy now appear very bright, it is too early towrite off the risk of old problems in our economy again making their presence felt. There is, forinstance, a risk for overheating when households and businesses now seem to make decisions onconsumption and investments based on expectations of strong future real income increases as a resultof higher productivity growth. This can lead to financial imbalances and exaggerated indebtednessheightened by high share prices and increasing property prices. Earlier periods with strong creditexpansion and high demand in Swedish economy have been followed by rising inflation. Lowinflation expectations and price-dampening effects from deregulations can now for a time hold backthe inflationary pressure that builds up when resource use in the economy increases. Low inflationcombined with high growth can per se strengthen the concept that earlier patterns have been brokenaway from in the long term and we have entered a period with long-term higher growth. If demandincreases so much that resources are put under pressure, however, inflation will sooner or lateraccelerate. There is a risk that prices then will increase very quickly and that inflation expectationswill also increase. To get inflation in line with the target in that situation, it may be necessary toconduct a stringent monetary policy for a longer period. If expectations of future growth prospects atthe same time are interrupted, a need for consolidation can arise in the household and business sector,which will strongly dampen growth. The consequences of altogether too strong growth now couldtherefore be instability in inflation and production later. If the financial imbalances have becomealtogether too great, there is a risk that the consequences will not be limited to great variations ingrowth and inflation but will even lead to lower overall production.The same course of development as in the USA?As we have said, it is incontestable that the Swedish economy has functioned better than before.However, there is a risk that we will overshoot. The exceptionally long upswing in the USA hascontributed to strengthening expectations on faster long-term growth in Sweden as well. There arecertain developmental features in the Swedish economy that are reminiscent of the American economywhich could indicate that. An important basis for the favourable development in the USA is probablythe approach to budget consolidation and price stability that has guided economic policy there for along time. And in those areas we have had a similar development in Sweden although the processstarted later here. At the same time, the strong penetration of information technology in the American
BIS Review 48/20004economy is considered to be a factor that has contributed to the productivity improvements recorded inthe USA. As regards information technology, we are well to the fore, although it is first recently thatstatistics indicate some increase in productivity growth. Expectations for a continued strong increasein productivity in the USA have also been a basis for the strong rise on the American stock exchange.The high share prices and the positive expectations have stimulated demand and the debt ratio in theprivate sector has increased. It is not possible to write off the risk of financial imbalances being builtup in the USA, which risks having negative effects on the macroeconomy. However, many analystsconsider that the long-term growth rate has in fact increased in the American economy and that theexpectations that have served as the basis for investments and increased indebtedness will therefore berealised.Even if there are some indications that point to the Swedish economy undergoing a similardevelopment to the American, the structural differences cannot be disregarded, which probably creategreater inertia in the Swedish economy than in the USA. The labour market is one such area. As Imentioned earlier, considerable barriers to competition also remain in the Swedish economy. Anotherdifference is that the cyclical upswing we are now experiencing is taking place at the same time asgrowth is increasing in the surrounding world and resource use is increasing. The American upswingcould benefit from a surrounding world with a lot of free resources and low price pressure and withfew competing investment alternatives for international investors.Should monetary policy counteract financial imbalances?How shall monetary policy be designed if there is a risk for exaggerated indebtedness andoverheating?A decision-making rule the Riksbank sometimes uses to motivate its monetary policy decisions can insimple terms be described as follows: when inflation exceeds the target in a one-to-two year horizon,then the interest rate is increased. Interest rate increases reduce the demand for goods and services,which in turn reduces inflationary pressure. In our simple conceptual framework, inflationary pressureis then assumed to vary with the use of resources in the economy. When there is free capacity,inflationary pressure is low in the absence of so-called shocks. When demand is so high that it exceedsthe level that is compatible with the long-term production path, inflation tends instead to exceed thetarget. The line of reasoning is based on inflationary expectations being established close to the targetfor monetary policy. Price increases when demand is strong may for instance depend on bottlenecksbeing created in some part of the production chain. As the company in this situation, cannot improveits profits by increasing its volume of sales, profit margins are increased by price increases. Shortageof labour also increases the risk for excessively high wage increases. The result will be higherinflation.If we strictly apply such a simple rule for decision-making, we shall then disregard the risk of buildingup of financial imbalances and overheating as long as inflation is not deemed to exceed the targetduring the forecast period.In the most recently published inflation assessments, it was assumed that the price stability target wasnot threatened during the forecast period despite the growth of demand being so strong that use ofcapacity was under strain at the end of the period. The majority view of the Executive Board wastherefore that there was no reason to increase the repo rate. This assessment was based on freeresources in the initial situation, good productivity growth, low price increases on certain recentlyderegulated areas, low import prices and finally low inflation expectations. It is not per se strange thatGDP can increase as much as 3-4% for a couple of years without inflation sharply accelerating, if theuse of resources is low initially.If the pattern from previous cyclical upswings was to be repeated, price pressure should now increase.However, it has proven difficult to identify any exact and very stable correlation. As I mentionedearlier great changes have taken place in the Swedish economy. While there are still considerabledeficiencies in competition in many areas, it is nevertheless not probable that inflation will acceleratestrongly in the next few years. An important reason for this is that the price stability target has now
5BIS Review 48/2000obtained such strong support that inflation expectations are not increasing despite a cyclical upswingthat is stronger than for a very long time. I have, however, for the reasons I mentioned earlier in myspeech, been somewhat more pessimistic than the majority of the Executive Board as regards inflationassessments at the forecast horizon. Fluctuations of consumer prices a few tenths of a percent up anddown around the target in an economy with a strongly accepted price stability regime are per se lessimportant than the mode of functioning of the economy.I am more concerned about what can happen with inflation and growth after the forecast period ifdemand increases at the rate we have anticipated. The simple rule that says that monetary policy shallonly react if the target for inflation is not met during the forecast period is a good help whenconducting monetary policy. However, it is not reasonable to mechanically apply this rule in everysituation. The consequences that the economic development can have for macroeconomic stability andinflation beyond the forecast horizon must also be weighed in. The risk for financial imbalances nowbeing built up when indebtedness is increasing and of inflationary pressure accumulating at the sametime must in my view therefore be taken into account in the monetary policy decisions. Adevelopment that I described earlier can be the consequence if the expansion of demand and creditcontinue to increase at a high rate. The quantity of money and lending, especially to households, arefor instance increasing at present at a rate which is probably not sustainable in the long term.The advantages of simple rules for decision-making are that they are easy to explain which can beespecially important when establishing credibility for a low-inflation regime. With simple rules foraction, it becomes clear what has guided monetary policy decisions. However, as I have shown, thisdoes not necessarily result in optimal policy in every situation in the sense that macroeconomicstability and longer-term price stability are achieved. The difficulties in assessing when demand andthe increase in lending are too strong are certainly considerable although this applies by and large toall the assessments we have to make.
1BIS Review 48/2000European Central Bank: Press Conference - introductory statementIntroductory statement given by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,and Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Press Conference held inFrankfurt, on 8 June 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today’s meetingsof the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB.The Governing Council took the following monetary policy decisions:1. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be raised by0.50 percentage point to 4.25% and applied in the two operations (which will be conductedas fixed rate tenders) to be settled on 15 and 21 June 2000.2. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to5.25%, with effect from 9 June 2000.3. The interest rate on the deposit facility will be raised by 0.50 percentage point to 3.25%, witheffect from 9 June 2000.4. Starting from the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000, the main refinancing operations ofthe Eurosystem will be conducted as variable rate tenders, applying the multiple rate auctionprocedure. The Governing Council has decided to set a minimum bid rate for theseoperations equal to 4.25%. This is the same rate as that which will prevail for the two fixedrate tenders to be implemented following today’s decision.Let me start by commenting on the reasons for this rise in interest rates, before the Vice-President saysa few words about the move to a variable rate tender procedure.Over recent months the risks to price stability in the medium term have clearly continued to increase.This assessment has been supported by the information from both the first pillar and the second pillarof the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy. With regard to the first pillar, strong growth of moneyand credit throughout 1999 and the pronounced expansion of money and credit aggregates over thefirst four months of 2000 have strengthened the view that liquidity conditions are ample. As for thesecond pillar, in a phase of strong growth upward risks to price stability currently relate mainly to thespillover of rising import prices to consumer prices, owing both to the lagged effects of the exchangerate depreciation and to rising oil prices. In fact, most inflation forecasts have been revised upwardsover recent months. This is a matter of concern. Today’s increase in ECB interest rates is a decisivestep to address these upside risks to price stability and it will contribute to the continuation ofnon-inflationary growth in the euro area.Allow me to give you a more detailed overview of the main elements of our assessment of monetary,financial market and other economic developments.Let me start by addressing the latest monetary developments in the euro area. The three-month averageof the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from February to April 2000, was 6.3%,ie significantly above the reference value of 4½%. Thus, the most recent M3 data confirm that theliquidity situation in the euro area continues to be very generous. M3 growth deviated from thereference value in 1999 and growth rates increased further in early 2000. This picture of very generousliquidity conditions in the euro area is complemented by the rapid expansion of credit to the privatesector, which remained close to or above 10% throughout 1999 and exceeded 11% in April 2000.Taken together, such developments would clearly point to upside risks to price stability over themedium term, if not counteracted in time.
BIS Review 48/20002Turning to the second pillar, we have to consider economic and financial market developments as wellas consumer price developments.Looking at economic developments, the outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedlyover the past few months. Overall, indicators for economic activity released since the end of last yearpoint to continued strong growth, following the upturn in real GDP growth in the second half of 1999.All the forecasts currently available from major international organisations and private institutionsnow project real GDP growth to be above 3% this year and next year, which is significantly higherthan expected at the end of last year. This positive outlook reflects favourable domestic and externalconditions for growth. On the domestic side, expansion of private consumption and investment shouldbenefit, in particular, from ongoing employment growth and higher rates of capacity utilisation.Domestic demand is also supported by high business and consumer confidence. On the external side,the upturn of growth in the world economy appears to be stronger, faster and more broadly based thanwas expected at the end of last year. Hence, euro area exports should remain strong.Financial market developments also support the view that the economic expansion in the euro area isset to continue at a fast pace. Moreover, the exchange rate of the euro appreciated at the end of Mayand in the first few days of June, also reflecting expectations that robust economic growth willcontinue in the euro area. Notwithstanding the recent appreciation of the euro, the extent and durationof its previous depreciation will still exert upward pressure on consumer prices.Against this background, the outlook for consumer price developments had become less favourableprior to today’s meeting. In April 2000 inflation - as measured by the Harmonised Index of ConsumerPrices (HICP) - was 1.9%, following 2.1% in March. In the immediate future, the strong rise in oilprices in May 2000 is pointing to renewed short-term upward pressures. Looking further ahead, allavailable forecasts for consumer price inflation for this year and next are now higher than they were atthe end of 1999. Current projections of a rate of inflation of around 2% in 2000 and 2001 are clearwarning signals.In conclusion, with today’s decisions the Governing Council has acted in a forward-looking manner inorder to contribute to the maintenance of favourable conditions for a lasting, non-inflationaryeconomic expansion. This should help other economic actors to rely firmly on the maintenance ofprice stability in the medium term. They are also called upon to contribute to price stability and growthby means of appropriate wage settlements compatible with employment growth, structural reform andfiscal consolidation. At the current juncture, they are especially encouraged to press ahead withstructural reform, and governments are particularly urged to avoid a pro-cyclical loosening of fiscalpolicies. This is particularly important in those countries where there is a risk of overheating.Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about the decision to implement avariable rate tender procedure as from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 28 June 2000.The switch to variable rate tenders in the main refinancing operations is not intended as a furtherchange in the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. The new tender mechanism is a response tothe severe overbidding which has developed in the context of the current fixed rate tender procedure.For the purpose of signalling the monetary policy stance, the minimum bid rate is designed to play therole performed, until now, by the rate in fixed rate tenders. This change does not in any way rule outthe option that, in the future, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem may be conducted inprinciple as fixed rate tenders. A press release setting out a comprehensive description of the newtender procedure will be issued during the course of next week.Turning to today’s other meeting, the General Council considered public finance developments in theEU. The General Council also carried out its first annual review of the functioning of the ERM II, inaccordance with Article 16 of the ERM II Agreement.Finally, let me draw your attention to the calendar for meetings of the Governing Council and GeneralCouncil in 2001. A separate press release listing the dates as well as the related dates for the pressconferences will be made available to you this afternoon. In this context, I should also like to point outthat the press conference previously announced for 3 August 2000 has been cancelled.
1BIS Review 47/2000Donald T Brash: Central banks and financial system stabilityin an uncertain worldAddress by Dr Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to Belgian FinancialForum, Antwerp Region, Brussels, on 6 June 2000.*      *      *IntroductionI am very pleased to be here in Antwerp this evening, and to have the opportunity of sharing with yousome of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s views on promoting financial system stability.Everybody in this room is confronted with uncertainty in their daily interface with financial markets.For those of us who are central bankers or bank supervisors, the task is to guide the dynamic, complexand unpredictable processes in financial markets towards outcomes that meet the policy preferences ofour country. For the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, our task is to deliver price stability and a soundand efficient financial system within a liberal economic policy paradigm.The uncertain world that we operate in can be highlighted by the relatively frequent and unpredictableepisodes of financial instability experienced over the past couple of decades. Since 1980, overtwo-thirds of IMF member countries have experienced at least one serious banking-sector difficulty. Insome countries, bank losses nearly or completely exhausted the banking system’s capital. In somecountries, financial collapses have required significant fiscal expenditure to resolve. And, as we allknow, national financial crises have been transmitted to other countries, threatening not only theeconomic well-being of those countries but also the stability of the international financial system as awhole.Oceans of ink have been spilt in analysing the causes of these crises. Most detached observers seem toagree that the underlying problems can be traced to certain fundamental weaknesses, weaknesseswhich clearly varied from country to country, but which have included poor quality credit analysis bybanks and other financial institutions, politically-directed lending by banks, the end of an asset pricebubble (typically real estate), sharply increased real exchange rates in a pegged exchange ratesituation, distorted incentives in financial markets, and a lack of transparency in financial markets.The widespread incidence and significant economic cost of financial sector problems have promptedcalls for concerted international action to promote the soundness of financial systems. These calls havestrengthened considerably over the last couple of years. The Basel Committee has been at the forefrontof this effort with the release of the Core Principles and proposals for a new Capital Accord. The IMFis making evaluation of financial supervision and regulation part of its annual country reviews, and theWorld Bank is emphasising the strengthening of financial infrastructure as an important part of itsstructural assistance programmes. While these international initiatives have many positive features,there are aspects that conflict with our approach to promoting soundness and efficiency of the NewZealand financial system and give us some concern. I will elaborate on these in a moment.At the national level, the preservation of a stable financial system remains one of the most challengingtasks facing governments today. New Zealand is no exception.Not all of you will be aware that New Zealand had its own banking system problems less than 10years ago. As a result of these problems, our largest bank would almost certainly have failed had thegovernment, as majority shareholder, not been willing on two occasions to provide a substantialcapital injection. One very major financial institution (not a bank, but certainly a quasi-bank, and aninstitution which was in the process of applying for a banking licence) did fail, one of the largestfailures in New Zealand’s history. Another bank would have failed had its private sector shareholdernot been in a position to inject very large amounts of additional capital, and even after that was done
BIS Review 47/20002the institution was eventually wound up. At no point did it look likely that the whole banking systemmight fail, but we certainly had major problems with some of the largest participants in the system.What lessons did we learn from that experience? There were of course a whole host of factors thatcaused these difficulties. One important factor was the sheer inexperience of many of our bankers:they had been accustomed to a highly protected environment, and were ill-prepared to deal with thedemands of a deregulated environment. Nevertheless, I think there were four important lessons that areworth sharing with you. While every country has to make judgements and decisions in the light of itsown particular circumstances – and certainly no two countries are exactly alike – some of the lessonswe learnt in promoting financial system stability may have relevance to other countries as well.I will deal with the monetary policy lessons last and somewhat succinctly, leaving most of mycomments to the prudential policy lessons, where we have moved away from the more traditional‘rules-based’ approach to supervising banks. I have chosen to dwell mainly on the prudential policylessons, as it is here that our experience may have more relevance for you. I suspect that I do not havemuch to offer the National Bank of Belgium on the monetary policy front, given your interests arelikely to be more concentrated on monetary union issues with a single monetary policy for the euroarea now having been in operation for over a year. (As the issue of currency union for New Zealand iscurrently a matter of public discussion in my country, if we have time I would welcome any commentsmembers of the audience might want to make on your experience with monetary union so far.)Prudential policy lessons from New ZealandLesson 1: encourage banks to behave prudentlyFirst, I believe it is important that banks are given every incentive to behave prudently. This may seema self-evident statement, but it is astonishing how frequently the importance of this principle isignored. In New Zealand’s case, we diminished this incentive to behave prudently by allowing theview to go unchallenged that banks were effectively ‘sovereign risk’, or at least ‘too big to fail’. Thismeant that bank creditors felt little need to assess the creditworthiness of the banks with which theydeposited funds - banks were, it was widely believed, effectively guaranteed by government. Bankboards and managements may have felt similarly protected against the possibility of failure, and madeloans with a disregard for risk which was, in some cases, breath-taking. This so-called ‘moral hazardproblem’ may have been particularly severe in the case of two of the three institutions which got intoserious difficulties in the late eighties, both of them owned wholly or in part by government. Therewas little or no direction of their lending by government, but the management of both institutionscertainly embarked upon lending transactions in the newly liberalised environment which rapidly gotthem into serious difficulties.For some of the other countries that have experienced financial instability in recent years, it is possiblethat the incentive for banks to behave prudently was seriously eroded not only by the impression thatmost large financial institutions would not be allowed to fail but also by the extent to whichgovernments directed the lending activities of the banks themselves. After all, if governments aregoing to become extensively involved in directing where banks should and should not lend, it is notunreasonable if the banks and their creditors assume that governments will ‘see them right’ if thingsgo wrong. Bank management certainly has little incentive to carefully assess credit risk if, at the endof the day, the decision on whether or not to lend will be made by the bank’s board under the influenceor direction of higher political authority.At the moment, as we all know, there is a great deal of international attention focused on how thisproblem of poor credit decisions in the banking sector can be dealt with. Most of the attention appearsto be on how to strengthen external regulation of the banking sector, and how to make banking moreindependent of political influence. Certainly, freeing banks from political interference in their creditdecisions is very desirable, and strengthening ‘rules-based’ banking supervision is one possible way toreduce the risks of future problems in the banking system.
3BIS Review 47/2000But we in New Zealand are not persuaded that strengthening ‘rules-based’ banking supervision is theonly way to proceed, or indeed is even necessarily the best way to proceed in all circumstances. Whenwe reviewed what we were doing in banking supervision in the early nineties, we became concerned.At that time, we were conducting banking supervision along conventional Basel Committee lines. Wewere gathering very large amounts of confidential information from banks on a quarterly (sometimes amonthly) basis. We were laying down a large number of rules and limits designed to ensure that banksbehaved prudently.Several things prompted us to review that approach, and one of them was a worry about the riskswhich we were incurring on behalf of taxpayers. What would happen if, despite our bankingsupervision, a bank were to get into difficulties? Might depositors argue that they wanted fullcompensation, since while they had had no knowledge of the bank’s financial condition we in theReserve Bank were not only fully aware of that condition but were also responsible for laying downthe rules and limits by which the bank had been obliged to operate?We consoled ourselves with the thought that our banking supervision was so good that no banks wouldfail under our watchful eye. But then we looked abroad – at the United States, at Japan, atScandinavia, at the United Kingdom and at Australia. We found banks going down in significantnumbers, despite some extremely professional and politically-independent banking supervision. Wecould not be confident that traditional banking supervision would prevent bank failure, and we couldbe confident that, by being the sole recipient of detailed financial information on banks and the mainarbiter of what constituted prudent banking behaviour, there was a major risk that we would be heldliable, politically and morally if not legally, for any losses incurred by depositors.Then we became aware of anecdotal evidence that our banking supervision was reducing the incentivefor bank directors to make their own decisions about crucial aspects of their bank’s operations. Inother words, because the Reserve Bank was laying down maximum individual credit limits, and limitson open foreign exchange positions, and guidelines for internal controls, some bank directors wereassuming that they were necessarily behaving prudently provided they were operating within thoselimits and guidelines. They stopped addressing the risks which their own banks were facing andsimply complied with the general limits and guidelines. To the extent that that was true – and wefound some evidence that it was true in some banks – we concluded that our banking supervisionmight actually be increasing the risk of bank failure, by reducing the incentive for bank directors andbank managers to make their own careful assessment of risk.The outcome of our review was to substantially strengthen disciplines on the directors and managersof banks to operate their banks prudently, and to strengthen the ability of the marketplace to disciplinebanks. We also retain a system of supervisory discipline, which we take very seriously. But we retainonly a few absolute rules within that framework, principally that all banks must at least meet the Baselcapital adequacy rules. We rely mainly on a requirement that banks disclose to the public a substantialamount of financial and risk information quarterly. In addition, all bank directors must sign off thesequarterly statements, at the same time attesting to the fact that the internal controls of their banks areappropriate to the nature of their banking business, and that those controls are being properly applied.We in the Reserve Bank do not attempt to tell banks what those controls should look like, but directorssigning those quarterly statements without making a careful assessment of the adequacy of internalcontrols are exposing themselves to very considerable legal risk in the event that their bank gets intodifficulty.We have also gone out of our way on a number of occasions to make it clear to the public that neitherthe Reserve Bank nor the government of New Zealand is guaranteeing individual banks, and wepublished a booklet designed to assist the general public to interpret banks’ financial information.None of these actions is a guarantee against imprudent bank behaviour of course, but we believe thatwe have gone a considerable distance towards ensuring that banks face strong incentives to behaveprudently. No bank operating in New Zealand is now owned by government, none is guaranteed bygovernment, none is obliged to lend to particular sectors or companies, and our supervision is basedheavily on mandatory public disclosure and director attestations. Three years ago, Alan Greenspancommented that ‘regulation by government unavoidably involves some element of perverse incentives.
BIS Review 47/20004If private market participants believe that government is protecting their interests, their own efforts todo so will diminish.’1 We have tried to minimise those perverse incentives. As William McDonough,President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chairman of the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, said in March this year, ‘… given the accelerating pace of change andinnovation in the financial services industry, our notion of supervision must encompass disciplineapplied by the marketplace, as well as official supervision.’2 In New Zealand, our notion ofsupervision relies heavily on marketplace discipline.Of course, to some extent our approach only works because there is a clear framework of companylaw which makes it clear that company directors and managers have unambiguous responsibilities.Having agreed accounting rules is important. Having risk-proofed payments systems is important.Having a vigorous media, with probing financial journalists, is also of great value, so that when a bankis forced to disclose to the public a deteriorating financial position, or a breach of one of the few ruleswe retain, there is at least a reasonable chance of that being picked up and sensibly analysed by themedia. Not all countries are so lucky. Where countries do not have this infrastructure in place, a morehands-on involvement by supervisors in banks’ activities may well be appropriate. Where thisinfrastructure is in place, as it is in New Zealand, we believe that a supervisory regime based largelyon self-discipline and market discipline is a viable option.I mentioned a little earlier that we have concerns about some of the international initiatives currentlyunderway to address financial system instability. The major issue for us is that we see some of theinitiatives as potentially undermining the incentives we have established for banks to behaveprudently. While there is increasing recognition of the need to harness and reinforce marketmechanisms in the pursuit of supervisory goals, at the same time the international supervisorycommunity appears to be moving towards an ever more prescriptive and intrusive approach to bankingsupervision. An example is the supervisory validation and supervisor intervention proposals in theBasel Committee’s June 1999 consultative paper on a new Capital Accord. If these proposals wereimplemented in New Zealand, they could considerably weaken market incentives and distort thebehaviour of bank directors and managers. We see this occurring as a result of the supervisorbecoming more directly involved in the management of banks, with the associated risk of thegovernment being drawn in to underwriting banks in times of stress.Another potential risk for us is that, because we do things differently, we might be assessed as notfully complying with the Basel Committee’s Core Principles and other international standards that arebeing developed. The concern we have is that New Zealand banks might end up being penalised (forexample, through higher borrowing costs if risk weights in the Capital Accord are linked tocompliance with international standards). This could result if the process of assessing compliance withinternational standards becomes a ‘one-size-fits-all’, checklist, mechanical tick-the-boxes, approach.We have stressed in our submissions to the Basel Committee that assessing compliance with anyinternational standard needs to be focussed on looking at whether the substance, rather than the form,of the standard is being met.I should add that, notwithstanding these concerns, New Zealand strongly supports the introduction ofinternational standards. We consider international harmonisation and co-operation as very important inwhat is rapidly becoming a ‘borderless’ global financial system. Our plea is that the implementation ofsuch standards be done with the appropriate degree of flexibility to adequately cater for the individualcircumstances of each country.To be frank with you, it is impossible to say for sure whether our prudential policy approach isworking or not. We have had no bank failures since the new policy was implemented, but then we had1Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Dr Alan Greenspan, at the annual conferenceof the Association of Private Enterprise Education, Arlington, Virginia, 12 April 1997.2Speech by Mr William J McDonough, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Chairman of the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision, before The Monetary Authority of Singapore, Singapore, on 24 March 2000
5BIS Review 47/2000no bank failures in the previous 100 years either (although we certainly had some banks which wouldhave failed, in the late eighties, had their shareholders not injected a lot more capital). Moreover, allbut one of the 17 banks in New Zealand are now foreign-owned, an increase in the proportion of banksin foreign ownership over the last decade, and that also means that the New Zealand case is notnecessarily a compelling demonstration of the validity of our market-based approach.But there has been quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that bank directors are now taking theirresponsibilities more seriously, and there seems to have been a marked increase in the attention givento internal controls. We had a mild recession in the first half of 1998, and a related fall in the value ofthe New Zealand dollar of some 30 per cent against the US dollar (from peak to trough), and our bankscame through this with absolutely minimal adverse effects, with low ratios of impaired assets andcontinuing strong profitability.So far at least, we are well satisfied by the way in which the new system is working.To conclude what has been a long first lesson, let me illustrate my main point with a specific event. Afew months after the new system first came into operation, at the beginning of 1996, one bank wasobliged to disclose to the public the fact that it had had a credit exposure to its shareholder bank whichconsiderably exceeded the limit which we had stipulated for such exposure. The attention focused onthis issue by the media, and indeed by other banks, created strong incentives for the bank never torepeat that mistake – quite probably stronger incentives than any threat of central bank sanction couldhave created.Lesson 2: beware of government ownership of banks and remove barriers to foreign ownershipThe second lesson from the New Zealand experience in the late eighties is that the ownership of banksis an important issue. For us, the issue was in part government ownership of banks and in part foreignownership of banks. The government-owned financial institutions almost without exception sufferedvarious degrees of financial difficulty – sometimes because their managers had undertaken imprudentlending, and sometimes because they had been obliged to invest in large amounts of governmentsecurities at sub-market interest rates. The large foreign-owned banks suffered to a much more limitedextent from the bad debts and losses which the government-owned banks experienced.There have been various reasons given for this difference, but the most plausible is that the largeforeign-owned banks were under the watchful eye of experienced parent banks, and were thereforemuch less able to stray into some of the riskier propositions which tempted the government-ownedinstitutions, especially in the years immediately after the banking sector was liberalised in themid-eighties. (The newly-arrived foreign-owned banks, however, often did succumb to the temptationof lending on risky propositions, perhaps because, being quite small both in absolute terms and inrelation to their overseas parents, they were subject to much less intensive parental scrutiny.)More recently, New Zealand has been running a very large balance of payments deficit, probablyamounting to more than 7 per cent of GDP at the present time. This balance of payments deficit hasbeen experienced at a time when the government itself is running a fiscal surplus. In other words, ithas been the private sector which has been borrowing heavily from overseas, not the public sector.And while some of this borrowing has been done by the corporate sector directly, much of it has beendone by the banking sector. Comparable levels of overseas borrowing by banks in other countries havebeen sufficient to make foreign lenders very nervous (for example, in some Asian countries in recentyears), and yet similar nervousness has not been at all evident in New Zealand. Why? I can onlyconclude that the foreign lenders take considerable comfort from the fact that most of the banksoperating in New Zealand now are in fact wholly-owned by foreign banks, or are indeed branches offoreign banks. Those parents are seen as being financially strong, and fully able to back the operationsof their New Zealand subsidiaries or branches. (It may also be relevant that, overwhelmingly, theoverseas borrowing being undertaken by New Zealand banks carries no foreign exchange risk for thebanks themselves.)In some countries, there is political reluctance to allow foreign institutions unrestricted entry into localbanking sectors. I would have to say that, as a country where all but one of our 17 banks are owned
BIS Review 47/20006and controlled overseas, we have seen absolutely no disadvantages from this situation, and manyadvantages. We have a financially stable banking sector, with vigorously competing and highlyinnovative banks, all of them subject to the monetary policy influence of the central bank. I have nodoubt at all that the banking sector is considerably more stable than would have been the case had allthe banks been domestically-owned, whether in the private sector or in the public sector.Monetary policy lessons from New ZealandLesson 3: keep prices stableThe third lesson from our experience has been the crucial importance for financial system stability ofkeeping prices stable. I am sure that for this audience the assignment of monetary policy to theobjective of keeping prices stable is not extraordinary, as evidenced by price stability being theprimary objective of the single monetary policy of the Eurosystem. But let me comment on the linkbetween price stability and financial system stability.By the late eighties, New Zealand had experienced nearly 20 years during which consumer priceinflation had been above 10 per cent almost without a break. Interest rates after adjustment for tax andinflation were often strongly negative, and there was as a consequence a strong incentive to invest inreal estate and shares, using as much borrowed money as could be obtained. This was undoubtedly animportant contributor to the severe difficulties which both the corporate sector and some parts of thebanking sector experienced when monetary policy was tightened in order to reduce inflation in thesecond half of the eighties. Interest rates went up and asset prices went down, and several banksincurred very large losses as a consequence.In New Zealand, monetary policy has been directed at achieving and maintaining domestic pricestability since the mid-eighties, with the exchange rate being allowed to float freely since March 1985.Prior to that, the objectives of monetary policy had been much more confused. In New Zealand, asindeed in many other countries, there had been a deeply engrained belief that monetary policy could beused directly to achieve faster growth in output and employment. There was a widespread belief thatpolicy-makers could choose to tolerate a somewhat higher level of inflation in exchange for moregrowth and a lower level of unemployment. (After all, Bill Phillips of Phillips Curve fame was NewZealand’s best known economist.) Since the mid-eighties, we have accepted that there is no suchtrade-off between inflation on the one hand and growth or employment on the other, and that the bestthing monetary policy can do to foster sustainable growth in output and employment is to deliverpredictably stable prices, or a very low rate of measured inflation. And, of course, a sound bankingsector is more likely in an environment of steady economic growth.Unfortunately, relatively low consumer price inflation is not always accompanied by low asset priceinflation. There is no single explanation for asset price inflation and, as New Zealand itself discoveredin the mid-nineties, with quite a strong increase in the price of both residential and rural property, it isoften extraordinarily difficult to restrain asset price inflation even when inflation in consumer prices islow. Nevertheless, we are confident that monetary policy targeted on low consumer price inflation incombination with a floating exchange rate is likely to result in a weaker and less sustained asset pricecycle than would otherwise be the case.The problems caused by asset price inflation have been well illustrated in parts of Asia in recent years.It is at least possible that asset price inflation in Japan in the late eighties – the reversal of which hasdone so much damage to bank balance sheets in that country – was a consequence of monetary policybeing kept too easy for too long, whether to appease the United States after the Plaza Accord or forsome other reason I know not. Similarly, it may well be that if central banks in some other Asiancountries had not been so preoccupied with trying to avoid the appreciation of their currencies againstthe US dollar as capital flowed into these economies in the mid-nineties, their interest rates wouldhave been higher and asset price inflation commensurately reduced. And of course if asset priceinflation had been less, the over-investment in certain kinds of real estate would presumably have beenless and, with it, the subsequent fall in asset prices.
7BIS Review 47/2000Lesson 4: avoid pegging the exchange rateAnd that brings me on rather naturally to the final lesson from New Zealand’s experience, and that isthe danger of pegging the exchange rate unless one is prepared to go all the way to full currency unionas you have done in Belgium, or at least to a currency board, as Hong Kong and some other countrieshave done.In New Zealand, we had a pegged exchange rate until March 1985, as I have mentioned. Prior to thatdate, it was not uncommon for companies to borrow overseas, often at interest rates which were verymuch lower than those within the high inflation New Zealand economy. Some companies made ratherspectacular losses when the New Zealand dollar was devalued from time to time, or when, even whenpegged, the New Zealand dollar depreciated against the currency in which the loan was denominated.(Borrowing in Swiss francs was particularly popular, and particularly painful, for some companies.)But the losses were probably fairly moderate in comparison to the loss which the government itselfincurred on behalf of taxpayers in 1984. In that year, the New Zealand dollar was devalued by 20 percent after a foreign exchange crisis and the government, which had written very large volumes offorward exchange contracts with companies trying to protect their positions, incurred losses of manyhundreds of millions of dollars.Since March 1985, the New Zealand dollar has been freely floating, and indeed I suspect we may bethe only central bank that can claim not to have intervened directly in the foreign exchange market formore than 15 years. (I say ‘directly’ because from time to time we did adjust monetary policy whenwe felt that movements in the exchange rate seemed likely to threaten our single goal of low inflation.)One of the benefits of this has been that, though many companies and banks have borrowed overseas,none of this borrowing was undertaken in the belief that there was no currency risk involved. Overseasinterest rates were frequently much lower than those in New Zealand but, after factoring in theexchange rate risk, the incentive to borrow offshore in foreign currency was substantially reduced.As a consequence, when, after a period of strong New Zealand dollar appreciation between early 1993and early 1997, the New Zealand dollar fell by some 30 per cent against the US dollar, there were veryfew companies unhappy about that fall – and indeed plenty of exporters who were delighted. Evenfewer of our banks were caught out by the depreciation, and to the best of my knowledge noneincurred losses as a consequence of the move. Because they knew that the New Zealand dollar wasfreely floating, they were careful to avoid taking on unhedged positions in foreign currency.ConclusionIn conclusion, in a world of open capital markets, the challenges facing banks are very considerable.Central banks can not prevent all banks from getting into trouble, and nor should they try to do so. Butcentral banks do have a responsibility in all our countries to promote the stability of the bankingsector. In my own view, they can best do that by creating strong incentives for banks to behaveprudently; by discouraging government ownership of banks, and removing barriers to the foreignownership of banks; by keeping the focus of monetary policy on price stability; and by not creating theimpression that borrowing in foreign currency is a riskless activity. We learnt those lessons the hardway.
1BIS Review 46/2000Masaru Hayami: Revitalization of Japan’s economySpeech by Mr Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Japanese Economic ResearchCenter, Tokyo, on 29 May 2000.*      *      *I had opportunities to speak on the structural problems facing Japan’s economy and the medium tolong-term issues which needed to be addressed. And, on each occasion, I emphasized that for Japan toachieve a full-fledged recovery, not only support from policy measures but also private sector vitalityin the form of “creative destruction”, were of critical importance. As Japan’s economy has recentlybeen showing clearer signs of improvement, we have witnessed earnest efforts toward structuralreform being set in motion in various areas of the economy. Bearing in mind such a development,today I would like to talk about the issues which are considered important to Japan’s economy at themoment.1.Recent economic developments and structural adjustmentCurrent state of the economyLet me start by giving our view on the current state of the economy. The improvement in Japan’seconomy is becoming distinct. And, recovery has been observed in some areas of private demand aswitnessed by business fixed investment continuing to increase gradually. Looking back to around thistime last year, it is true that some economic indicators had already begun to show signs of recovery.Such a recovery was brought about by an increase in public investment and favorable developments inoverseas economies, and was far from being a self-sustained recovery led by domestic private demand.To the contrary, the recent improvement has been accompanied by a recovery in private demandcentering on a moderate increase in business fixed investment, and deflationary concerns havegradually subsided, although private consumption, which is a major component of private demand,still remains short of what one would call a recovery. Granted that private consumption is unlikely toreturn to the high growth of the 1980s because of the declining growth potential of Japan’s economyover the long run, and given that consumer sentiment has been gradually improving, the key to theoutlook for private consumption will be the impact of increased production and higher corporateprofits on household income. With this in mind, we continue to carefully monitor the economicsituation.Business cycle and structural adjustmentWhile the economy is on a recovery path, we observe that structural problems have not yet beensolved. Since such an observation leads to controversy over the relation between the business cycleand structural adjustment, allow me to elaborate a little.It is not correct to say that the economy will never recover unless structural problems are solved.Needless to say, some kind of structural problems always exist at any point in time in any economy,and I do not deny that Japan currently faces extremely big problems. Moreover, it should beremembered that at the same time we also experience business cycles. On the other hand, it is notcorrect to claim that an economic recovery has nothing to do with structural problems. If structuralreform does not proceed smoothly, economic recovery will lack strength, or big problems will remainunsolved even after the economy recovers substantially as evidenced by the situation in Japan after thebursting of the bubble. I think it true to say that economic recovery would be all the more robust ifaccompanied by the progress of structural reform.
BIS Review 46/20002The nature of structural problems may differ from time to time and from country to country, and it isnot easy to come up with a clear-cut definition. Having said this, the current structural problems inJapan could be characterized as arising from the process of the economic system adapting to a newenvironment, in other words, it is a problem that has contained the dynamism of the Japaneseeconomy. Indeed, changes in the economic environment in the 1990s such as the progress ofinformation and telecommunications technology and the globalization of market economies had asubstantial impact on Japanese firms in persuading them to change. The aftereffects of the bursting ofthe bubble can also be recognized as a structural problem in that they prevented firms and financialinstitutions from adapting to the change in the environment by eroding their financial strength.Significant changes in the environment can make an existing economic system obsolete and reduceprofitability of the corporate sector. Particularly when the magnitude of change is large and firms areuncertain as to how to adapt, many initially tend to be defensive in their response by reducinginvestment and employment, which only leads to further downward pressure on the economy. In theprocess of cost reduction, however, firms that recover profitability and discover ways to adapt to thenew environment will gradually increase in number. Then, the way a firm overcomes structuralproblems itself will become a source of new growth. This is the stage where firms take the offensive inthat they implement comprehensive reform of their management system geared toward the newenvironment and invest in strategically important areas or new businesses. Though even at this stagethere will exist not a few firms which are still defensive, the overall picture is that the economy willrecover as structural reform progresses. And, as the number of firms taking the offensive increases, theeconomy will eventually shift to a full-fledged recovery path.Characteristics of economic recovery under structural adjustmentCurrently, it is our judgment that Japan’s economy is at the stage where the number of firms taking theoffensive has started increasing, that is, the economy is moderately recovering parallel with structuraladjustment. Let me point out some of the major characteristics of this recovery.First, the recovery has been led by the corporate sector. In the 1990s, the prolonged recession and slowadjustment of employment and wages under the prevailing management system led to a substantialrise in the proportion of labor income to national income, which was one factor behind thedeteriorating profitability of Japanese firms. Putting aside the effects of active monetary and fiscalpolicy as well as steady developments in overseas economies, the current recovery is, to a large extent,triggered by the earnest restructuring of Japanese firms with the aim of restoring profitability. Thus,with respect to the recovery of private demand, it seems natural that the corporate sector, which hasregained profitability as a result of restructuring, should take the lead by increasing investmentfollowed by the household sector as income conditions gradually improve. This is the development weare now witnessing.Second, we observe polarization in various areas of the economy. For example, a moderate recoveryof business fixed investment does not mean a uniform increase across the board. While thoseindustries which produce basic materials are burdened with excess capacity and continue to restraininvestment, those related to information technology, such as electric machinery, have increasedinvestment substantially. Another example. In the labor market, we have recently witnessed thesituation where new job offers have been growing at a double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis whilethe unemployment rate has remained high or even slightly increased. This signifies a wideningmismatching of supply and demand in the labor market. Under the globalization of market economiesand the progress of information and telecommunications technology, while workers with skills thatfirms need are in short supply, workers who have accumulated firm-specific skills under the traditionallifetime employment system are no longer in demand.When economic recovery and structural adjustment proceed simultaneously, we often observeconflicting developments. Thus, to accurately grasp economic developments, it is extremely importantnot only to examine macroeconomic indicators but also to thoroughly understand the microeconomicmovements behind such macroeconomic indicators.
3BIS Review 46/20002.Movements toward structural reformResponse to the aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble - declining financial intermediary functionNow let me turn to the earnest structural reform efforts being seen in various areas of the economy.First, the problem of the declining financial intermediary function after the bursting of the bubble hasbegun to be resolved. It goes without saying that the aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble were oneof the major factors responsible for making the 1990s a “lost decade” in Japan. The bursting of thebubble created the balance sheet problem. Indeed, the non-performing asset problem of financialinstitutions has reduced their risk-taking capacity and impaired the smooth circulation of money. Inparticular, behind the extremely severe recession from the end of 1997 to 1998 was a decline inconfidence on the part of both the corporate sector and the household sector stemming from financialsystem instability and the deterioration of the financial intermediary function which has often beentermed a credit crunch.Since spring last year when the Bank of Japan effected the zero interest rate policy and public fundswere injected into major banks to strengthen their capital base, public confidence in the financialsystem has been gradually restored, and we are observing a favorable impact on the economy.Furthermore, an important development which has not been observed for nearly half a century sincethe end of World War II, is that the financial industry is moving toward large-scale consolidation.Last year, private consumption supported the economy in the midst of a decline in household income,which means a decline in the savings rate. This can perhaps be interpreted as households, which wereconcerned with financial system instability and increased their savings from the end of 1997 to early1998, turning to loosen their purse strings. In this regard, the Survey on Lifestyle and FinancialBehavior conducted by the Bank of Japan indicates that since spring last year not only has concernover the collapse of financial institutions subsided but also the number of respondents expressingworries about job security and earnings or refraining from spending has also gradually decreased. Onthe part of the corporate sector, responses to the Bank’s Tankan survey indicate that the improvementsin the lending attitude of financial institutions and also their funding conditions have been gatheringmomentum. Moreover, the willingness of small and medium-sized firms to invest, which is mostlyfinanced by bank borrowing, seems to have gradually strengthened, though up until now suchinvestment has been contained within cash flow and has not yet led to an increase in bank borrowing.Considering that the non-performing asset problem of financial institutions has not been completelyresolved, and taking into account the excess debt of the corporate sector, we have not yet reached apoint where we can say that the problem of the aftereffects stemming from the bursting of the bubblehas been resolved. In addition, the continuous decline in property prices is another matter of concern.Furthermore, the consolidation of financial institutions is not merely a matter of size. The key tosuccessful consolidation is to become more efficiently managed through a strategy of “selection andconcentration”, and it will take more time for such consolidation to bear fruit. Nevertheless, at thismoment, it should be noted, and welcomed, that amid the irreversible trend of financial globalizationand the advance of information technology it is the initiative of the private sector, not that of thepublic sector, which will pave the way to the new economy.Parallel with such moves on the part of major financial institutions, progress has been made in directfinancing such as the establishment of MOTHERS on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in November 1999,followed by NASDAQ JAPAN established in early May at the initiative of the private sector andwhich will start operation in June. I have repeatedly emphasized that at the present time whenstructural adjustment is much needed, abundant domestic savings should be utilized to financeinvestment in the form of “risk capital”. And, I thus welcome that such markets have been inauguratedto fulfill an intermediary function for risk capital.New phase of corporate restructuringSecond, efforts toward structural reform have also been made in terms of corporate restructuring, and Ithink we have begun to observe the result of such efforts. When talking about restructuring and the
BIS Review 46/20004results in the recent period, those in the business world say that they have been pursuing restructuringfor a long time. I fully commend past efforts toward corporate restructuring, but what I would like toemphasize here is that the restructuring witnessed since last year is of a different nature compared withthe past and such a tendency has recently become more distinct. In my view, past restructuring focusedmostly on cost reductions, in other words, downsizing. To the contrary, current restructuring, thoughinitially having a tendency toward downsizing, has shifted to focus on business content orreengineering, which means the restructuring of production and management systems which have beenrendered inefficient. I believe that the restructuring of Japanese firms has truly entered a new phase.Behind such a change in the focus of restructuring, those in the business world, as in the case offinancial institutions, experienced a protracted recession and were faced with a very severe financialenvironment, particularly from 1997 to 1998. During this period, many small and medium-sized firmsfaced funding difficulties, and from the summer to the autumn of 1998 when financial and capitalmarkets both at home and abroad were under stress due to such factors as the Russian crisis, not a fewrepresentative big Japanese firms also faced similar difficulties. Such an experience linked withchanges in the accounting system, namely the consolidated and mark-to-market methods, broughtabout the recognition or a sense of crisis on the part of firms that Japan’s traditional corporategovernance including the main bank system and cross-shareholdings would not be viable for long andthat for their own survival they should enhance their evaluation in the capital market through suchmeasures as improved capital efficiency. All this seems to have triggered current full-fledgedrestructuring.Current restructuring is different from past downsizing in its nature because firms are required morethan ever to efficiently allocate resources and improve profitability. For example, since big firmsengaged in the production of electric machinery and chemicals could not enjoy economies of scopeany more, they concentrated on areas where they had the most edge, recently termed “areas of corecompetence” in Japan, and at the same time withdrew from or scaled down unprofitable businessareas. And, among basic materials industries burdened with excess capacity, there have beenmovements toward consolidation including mergers and acquisitions and obsolete equipmentbeginning to be scrapped. Recent restructuring and consolidation in the corporate sector, includingfinancial institutions, extends beyond the existing keiretsu and corporate group frameworks, and insome cases has proceeded globally with the involvement of foreign capital. Also, good use is beingmade of such new methods as mergers and acquisitions and the holding company format. Last year,mergers and acquisitions increased substantially and direct investment into Japan, which indicatesforeign capital inflows, reached a record high 1.5 trillion yen on a balance of payment statistics basis,three times the prior-year level. Of course, it cannot be denied that the recovery of corporateprofitability has been largely attributable to past restructuring, that is, downsizing centering on areduction in labor costs. However, current restructuring can be expected to exert pressure on firms towithdraw from low profitability areas and concentrate resources on highly profitable and strategicareas such as investment in information technology-related areas. We continue to pay close attentionto how the recent development will lead to the recovery of corporate profitability and competitiveness,and eventually the restoration of corporate vitality.Possibility of an information technology (IT) revolutionThird, the IT revolution seems to have reached Japan. In the 1990s, with the improvement inproductivity induced by the expansion of IT-related investment, the United States enjoyed prolongedexpansion and price stability, although we observed such distortions as excessive consumption due tohigher stock prices and a rising current account deficit. In Japan, we have recently witnessed a rapidincrease in IT-related investment by semiconductor manufacturers. And, I feel that expectations aregradually emerging in Japanese business circles that a mega change which occurs only once or twicein a hundred years might have started in Japan. However, there still remains a deeply-embeddedpessimism that Japan is more than ten years behind the United States in IT-related business areas andit is not easy even to catch up. To understand the coexistence of expectations and pessimism, let usexamine discussions regarding how the IT-related revolution has been affecting Japan’s economy.
5BIS Review 46/2000One topic for discussion is the spread of IT-related investment in the corporate sector. In this regard, itis necessary to distinguish between investment by IT producers and that by IT users. It is true thatIT-related investment in the United States has centered on the computer and telecommunicationsindustries which have recorded the largest improvement in productivity. But it is also true that IT usersin a wide variety of industries such as other manufacturing, financial, and distribution industries haveimproved productivity by way of IT-related investment, which has laid the foundation for theprolonged expansion of investment. In contrast, the current surge in IT-related investment in Japanseems to be at the stage where IT producers such as semiconductor-related manufacturers expand theirinvestment in response to the worldwide expansion of IT demand. While they are importantinvestments, the experience in 1995 and 1996 shows us that an investment boom is bound to becyclical, which sometimes takes the form of large-scale stock adjustment. Therefore, it is importantwhether investment by IT users is sustainable. It is encouraging news that many firms are consideringstrengthening their production and sales systems by introducing supply chain management with theaim of information sharing among client firms as well as procuring materials through the Internet. Inthe Economic Planning Agency’s Survey on Corporate Behavior published this April, many surveyedlisted firms reported excess production capacity on the one hand, and a shortage of information-relatedequipment on the other. The future outlook for investment by IT users needs to be judged in relation toJapanese-style management. Here, I would like to point out that the spread of such investment to awide area, including small and medium-sized firms, will be the key to the sustainable expansion ofinvestment, and eventually to an improvement in productivity.IT can be utilized by the corporate sector which is called B-to-B, that is, business to business, and alsoby the household sector which is called B-to-C, that is, business to consumer. Another topic fordiscussion is how Japanese firms will respond to the situation when IT is introduced to the householdsector. The IT revolution in the United States in the 1990s substantially enhanced productivity throughthe enhancement of operational processes as personal computer networks were introduced to thecorporate sector. Japan was behind the US in this regard, which is perhaps one of the reasons behindthe “lost decade of the 1990s”. Some features of Japan’s corporate system were said to be related tothis delay. As you may remember, up until the 1980s, Japanese-style management, as represented bykeiretsu transactions, the main bank system, and lifetime employment, had been regarded as superiorin terms of information sharing among related parties through long-term relationships. In contrast,since the US-style big business model was vertically integrated and susceptible to sectionalism, it hadbeen considered inferior to the Japanese system in processing information. However, any managementsystem should be evaluated in relation to the technology available at the time. The Japanese system isno exception and it has been found to be not necessarily superior on all accounts when the cost oftransmitting and processing information is dramatically declining due to the rapid progress ofinformation and telecommunications technology. Rather, the merits of the Japanese system led to alack of incentive to actively introduce IT for cost reduction purposes. In addition, while firms mustreview existing transaction styles and reduce workers to take full advantage of the benefits of IT, theJapanese system tends to make it difficult for firms to implement such changes. Furthermore, it shouldbe noted that the 1990s was a period during which Japan had to face the aftermath of the bursting ofthe bubble and also that it has been difficult to create “venture businesses” in the cultural and socialclimate of Japan. Considering that all this has constituted constraints for Japanese firms to introduceIT, the IT revolution has widened the gap in competitiveness between the United States and Japan.The recent move toward full-fledged restructuring and increase in investment by IT users can be seenas evidence that Japanese firms have begun to be aware of various problems related to IT. Thefoundation for venture businesses to be created and flourish is finally being laid as symbolized by the“bit valley”, and partly due to such development the number of newly established firms as a whole hasbeen gradually increasing since last summer. The use of IT in the corporate sector has just started inJapan. Even though the corporate sector in Japan lags behind that in the United States in the use of IT,there is a piece of good news for Japan. The next ten years are regarded as a period during which ITwill be actively used by consumers, and not only personal computers but also IT-related electricalappliances and mobile phones will be used as IT terminals. Japanese firms have traditionally had acompetitive edge in such areas as electrical appliances and mobile phones, and indeed they are thefront runner in such areas as the utilization of mobile phones as information terminals. Regarding the
BIS Review 46/20006business-to-consumer area, the United States is yet to construct a plausible business model, and thereis still a lot of uncertainty about the future. Notwithstanding this, it is important that even though therelative position of the United States and Japan may not be reversed, the possibility has emerged thatJapan can fully compete with the United States in the IT field. These developments also seem to havehad a positive impact on firms in enabling them to regain vitality.3.Escape from the lost decadeRemaining tasksCompared with my July 1999 speech in which I said that the dynamism of the Japanese economy hadbeen contained, the developments that I have described today indicate that such dynamism haseventually begun to be re-ignited. However, this is far from saying that all structural problems inherentin Japan’s economy have been solved.For example, regarding the balance sheet problem of financial institutions, while the financial systemhas indeed escaped from instability, the problem is not yet fully resolved as I previously remarked.The excess debt problem on the part of firms has yet to be completely solved. Furthermore, as a resultof firms putting more emphasis on capital efficiency, for a while they will continue to reduce assetswith low profitability. In this regard, the Bank of Japan’s March Tankan survey showed that majormanufacturing industries expected the ratio of ordinary profits to sales for the current financial year tobe around 4 percent, which is about the past average. We may be able to say that profitability indiceson a flow basis have recovered to the average level of the past. However, profitability indices on astock basis such as ROE and ROA have remained substantially below the level in the 1980s, which isa different aspect of what I referred to as a “decline in capital productivity” in my speech last summer.Under such circumstances, while investment will be made in highly profitable new areas such as theIT-related field, asset reduction will continue in existing low profit areas in order to raise ROE andROA. According to the Economic Planning Agency’s Survey on Corporate Behavior, about half oflisted firms responded that it would take more than two years for their real estate, buildings, andproduction facilities to return to appropriate levels.With respect to corporate restructuring and the IT revolution, there is no knowing how they will leadto an improvement in corporate profitability and increase in investment. Even if higher profitabilityand larger investment were realized, there is a possibility that the polarization seen in the economymight become, albeit temporarily, more apparent. For example, while there are industries regainingprofitability supported by restructuring and IT demand, not a few firms will be left behind intraditional and domestic demand-oriented industries. In this regard, public utilities, which haveexperienced a series of deregulatory measures, continue to suppress investment, and small andmedium-sized wholesalers and retailers who are susceptible to the effects of the distribution revolutionhave been slow to exhibit a business recovery. Regarding employment, there is a possibility that whiledemand for workers who have skills compatible with the new era increases, demand for workers wholack such skills declines. In this context, the unemployment problem might become an issue. Thesenegatives can be termed the “shadow of structural reform”.Since it is difficult to forecast the impact of IT on corporate profitability and growth, we should bearin mind that there may be large swings in the stock market which tends to strongly respond to a varietyof forecasts. In fact, strong expectations last year for the growth of IT-related industry led to asubstantial increase in the prices of IT-related stocks. On the other hand, while the improvements inJapan’s economy is becoming distinct, IT-related stocks in Japan have recently been bearish reflectingthe worldwide correction of IT-related stocks. These swings are unavoidable to some extent when themarket is trying to identify growth industries and the key firms which lead such industries. The swingsin stock prices will reveal promising new technologies and firms which incorporate these technologies,and nurture them. The Bank of Japan continues to pay due attention to stock price developments, and,in so doing, we think it important to calmly identify the meaning and background of stock pricefluctuations.
7BIS Review 46/2000Furthermore, a declining birth rate and aging society present a long-term challenge to Japan’seconomy. For example, with respect to the high savings rate of the private sector in Japan, I have oftenremarked that the lack of consensus among the public as to how future pensions and medical feesshould be funded has restrained consumption through anxiety about the future. In this regard, theintroduction of a nursing care system from this year is certainly a step forward, and I hope this systemwill take hold.“Creative destruction” revisitedWhen the economy recovers, as is now happening, it might well be the case that efforts for structuralreform might be neglected due to a sense of security. In addition, when the shadow of structuralreform becomes conspicuous, for example in employment, calls to reverse such reform and pressurefor additional macroeconomic policy measures such as the expansion of aggregate demand are verylikely to intensify. However, there is no doubt that structural reform has contributed to the currenteconomic recovery, and we should not forget that remaining structural problems must be solved toachieve sustained economic expansion in the future. Structural problems cannot be solved solely bymacroeconomic policy measures such as monetary and fiscal policy. Now that financial and capitalmarkets are highly globalized, any attempt to wipe out past problems by generating inflation willnever be successful. Let me emphasize again that it is private sector vitality in the form of “creativedestruction” that can solve these structural problems. And, as the US experience shows, private sectorvitality will gradually absorb the adverse effects of structural reform.In this “era of metamorphosis” as represented by the current IT revolution, there exists considerableuncertainty about the future. From another angle, we can say that it is an era where innovation can leadto business opportunities. Under such circumstances, the role which the public sector should play is toprepare a market environment which is conducive to nurturing innovation. One thing is the stability ofthe macroeconomic environment. In this regard, it is the responsibility of the Bank of Japan tomaintain stable macroeconomic conditions through price stability. Other important roles that thepublic sector should play are to promote deregulation and improve the taxation and legal systems sothat firms and households can take appropriate risks more easily and operate more flexibly.As such, it is my view that the role of the public sector in this era of metamorphosis should be to focuson preparing an appropriate market environment. In this regard, we should learn from the USexperience where the early Clinton administration advocated the “information super highway” plan,but which was later dropped in favor of preparing an environment conducive to encouraging the ITrevolution led by the private sector. In Japan, triggered by severe economic conditions in 1997 and1998, we have seen efforts toward preparing an environment suitable for economic rebirth, includingenactment of the Economic Revitalization Law. As we move toward a full-fledged economic recovery,the role of the public sector and economic policy should be flexible so as to be able to remainconsistent with an era of metamorphosis. In this regard, it is necessary to examine the role of publicinvestment, the level of which is said to be very high among industrial countries, from the viewpointof fiscal deficits as well as whether such investment is in line with the current era of metamorphosis.In July 1999 when I spoke on structural problems in Japan’s economy, there were more pessimisticviews about Japan’s economy than today. On that occasion, I said I was proud of Japan’s high qualitylabor force, technology, and management skills which had created a big economic power from theruins after the war, and emphasized the need of ‘creative destruction”. And now, after almost a year, Iam quite encouraged to find that signs of a recovery have been increasing. I hope the current favorabledevelopments will gather momentum and that the day will soon come when Japan’s economy returnsto a full-fledged recovery path led by the private sector. Let me conclude my remarks by saying I hopethat the 1990s will be revaluated as the ten years which laid the foundation for the prosperity of thenext generation.
1BIS Review 44/2000Einar Repse: Macroeconomic stability - a crucial precondition for a successfuldevelopmentSpeech by Mr Einar Repse, Governor of the Bank of Latvia, at the Baltic Business Conference, held inRiga, on 19 May 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen!Today we are living in a world where global economic developments affect individual countries muchmore than they did a decade ago. Along with the unprecedented degree of economic integration withinthe European Union (EU), we see growth also in international trade and financial transactions in otherparts of the world, all of which provides visible evidence of an ever-expanding globalisation.Latvia joined in this process after regaining independence in 1991. The sad experience of fifty years asa part of a closed albeit large economy has convincingly shown Latvia that separation from the rest ofthe world through strict economic boundaries is counter-productive and cannot ensure sustainableeconomic growth. For historical reasons, Latvia and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe hadto start their integration in the global economy from a disadvantageous position. Becoming activelyinvolved in international economic affairs is probably the only means by which these countries cancatch up with economically advanced countries in Europe in the coming decades.When economic borders no longer exist and economic developments in one particular region directlyaffect other regions, it is of vital importance that the economic policies of small countries like Latviaare aimed at securing long-term stability. Being a small, open economy, Latvia cannot entirely avoidexternal influences, but sound economic policies help to mitigate the negative economic impact ofexternal shocks.From this perspective, Latvia’s integration into the EU allows for the simultaneous achievement bothof greater integration in the global economy and sound economic policies. On the one hand, prior toactual EU membership Latvia has concluded the Europe Agreement with the EU, thus greatlyliberalising its foreign trade regime and completely abandoning any restrictions on internationalcapital flows. Hence, efforts to become an EU member have enhanced Latvia’s progress towardsintegration into the world economy.On the other hand, membership in the EU requires a well-functioning market economy, one which isable to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the union, as well as the capacity toundertake the obligations of membership. Thus, pursuit of EU membership incontestably encouragesthe pursuit of economic policies aimed at long-term stability.With respect to Latvian monetary policy it is fair to say that the principles guiding actions at the Bankof Latvia are already very close to those employed by the European Central Bank (ECB). The lawsingles out price stability as the main monetary policy objective of the Latvian central bank and in itsoperational practice, the Bank of Latvia enjoys full independence from the government. Directgovernment borrowing from the central bank is also explicitly banned by the law. In pursuing itsmonetary policy, the Bank of Latvia uses the same market-based instruments employed by the ECB.Latvian experience confirms that an independent central bank and firm anti-inflationary policiesproduce the good results expected. Annual inflation in Latvia declined to 2.4% in 1999. The lats hasproved its stability for over six years, providing a solid foundation for restructuring and growth in theLatvian economy. Even without participation in the EU Exchange Rate Mechanism, the lats has stayedwithin the +/- 15% band against the ECU and later the euro during this entire period.Fiscal policy in Latvia has always been implemented with EU accession in mind, thereby, inaccordance with the European Stability and Growth Pact provisions, avoiding unsustainablegovernment expenditure. Despite the dynamic political environment in Latvia since independence,
BIS Review 44/20002every government has declared EU membership its top priority. Therefore, the pursuit of strict fiscalpolicies has never been threatened.Over the past few years, as prudent monetary and fiscal policies led to productive economictransformation, Latvia has become one of the most successful transition economies in Central andEastern Europe. These policies were tested in 1997-1998 during the Southeast Asian and Russiancrises, but the Latvian economy has recovered from these shocks at a relatively fast speed and is nowon a growth path again.At a time of external pressures, the credibility of national economic policies becomes crucial toeconomic performance, as was evident in Latvia over the previous year and a half. In 1998, the currentaccount deficit in Latvia was financed mainly by long-term capital, as foreign direct investment andother long-term capital inflows amounted to 72% of all capital flows. As a result, Latvia did not sufferfrom a sharp reversal of short-term capital flows that could have damaged the economy. As time wentby and the country’s economic situation remained stable, the confidence of foreign investorsrebounded quickly. In the second half of 1999, inflows of foreign direct investments increased by27%, as compared with the first half of the year.The confidence in the Latvian banking industry was also restored rather quickly among both foreigninvestors and the general public. Presence of foreign capital as a percentage of total bank capitalstrengthened and main banking indicators improved considerably. Bank lending increased, acting asthe engine for economic growth. Total loans increased by 52% in 1998 and by 15.3% in 1999, and95% of all loans have been directed at the private sector. Credit growth has been accompanied by agradual shift from short-term trade finance to increased lending directed towards the productive sectorof the economy. In February 2000, the share of loans with a maturity of more than 5 years amountedto 16.8%, while at the end of 1998 the respective figure was 13%. Increased public confidence in thebanking sector is also indicated by a 6.3% growth in residents’ deposits in 1999. Long-term deposits(over 12 months) grew by 82% in 1999, thus exceeding the pre-Russian crisis level.Positive trends can be observed in other Latvian financial markets as well. After the share prices fellduring the aftermath of the Russian crisis in 1998, the stock market has rebounded: in January 2000,the stock market index in Latvia exceeded the 100 mark for the first time since the Russian crisis. Inthe first three months of this year, the Dow Jones Riga Stock Exchange Index increased by 33%.In 2000, the market for government securities has become both wider and deeper, as 3-yeargovernment bonds were successfully launched in the domestic market for the first time in January,followed by 5-year bonds in March. The share of government bonds with a maturity of 1 year or moreamounts to 86.5% of all government securities. The development of yields on government bondsissued in international markets also shows increasing confidence in the economic policies of Latvianauthorities. The spreads on 5-year Eurobonds in the secondary market narrowed from 330 basis pointsat the beginning of May last year to 148 basis points in February of this year.A balanced central government budget for 1999 had been adopted originally. Strict fiscal policyenabled the government to use the budget as an automatic stabiliser in the aftermath of the Russiancrisis and allow the budget deficit to grow up to 4% of GDP in 1999. However, it is important to stressthat this is considered an extraordinary one-time measure. The government has expressed strongintentions to reduce the deficit to 2% of GDP in 2000, with a balanced budget remaining the target for2001.As a result of these policies, all of which received public support, the unemployment rate droppedfrom 10.1% in March 1998 to 9% in March this year, and real GDP development after a 3.6% growthin 1998 remained positive in 1999 as well.Given the beneficial impact of sound economic policies on Latvia’s integration into European markets,there is little doubt that these policies will be implemented in the future as well. In fact, the provisionsof the European Stability and Growth Pact and requirements for the members of the monetary unionlaid down in the EU Treaty specify the direction of economic policy, a direction to which Latvia iscommitted. Although these criteria are not legally binding for the country prior to EU membership, inthe opinion of Latvian authorities and the Bank of Latvia the Maastricht criteria are the proper
3BIS Review 44/2000principles of sound economic policies. Consequently, economic policy in Latvia will be implementedin a way that facilitates thoroughgoing compliance with these requirements in due course. We stronglybelieve that these policies will establish our country as a small but reliable player in world markets andhence ensure rapid and sustainable growth in Latvia.
1BIS Review 44/2000I J Macfarlane: Statement to House of Representatives Standing Committee onEconomics, Finance and Public AdministrationOpening statement by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to House ofRepresentatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Melbourne,on 22 May 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be here in Melbourne again for our regular half-yearly appearance before theCommittee. I know we met in March and touched upon monetary policy, but that meeting was mainlyabout Reform of the International Financial System. On this occasion, we will no doubt have a lotmore time to spend on monetary policy.I would now like to start this meeting in the traditional way by reviewing the forecasts I gave to theCommittee last November, and then outlining our current views on likely developments over the yearahead.Last November, with half a year’s data available, I said that we expected GDP growth through 1999 tobe 3½%. In the event, it was 4.3%, which continued our record of expecting a modest slowdown thatdid not arrive. I also said that we expected growth to be 4% in the year to June 2000, and on presentindications this still looks likely, even though the rate may well dip below 4% in the year to March. Ofcourse, it will be more difficult than usual to read the true trends this year, with expenditure beingshifted between quarters because of the GST, and the boost from the Olympics.Most monthly indicators of economic activity point to a slowing so far in 2000. However, it is tooearly to know whether this merely represents the slowdown in domestic demand that we have all beenwaiting for, and we have had built into our forecasts for some time, or whether it represents somethingbigger - a significant slowing in GDP growth. Our judgment is that we are seeing mainly the former,namely a change in composition of GDP growth. In other words, the slowing in private domesticdemand, which is undoubtedly occurring, will be largely offset by the boost that we are getting fromnet exports and will soon get from fiscal policy.While we expect some slowdown in GDP in the sense that we do not expect to repeat the 4½%average that we achieved in 1997, 1998 and 1999, we still see quite solid growth ahead. We have noquibble with the sort of figures that were contained in the Budget Papers showing growth in GDP of3¾% over 2000/01. Such an outcome would be quite a remarkable achievement compared with therecord of the past three decades, but I will return to that subject later.On inflation, in November we forecast that the CPI would rise by 2% in the year to December 1999and by 2¾% in the year to June 2000. We got closer to the mark in these forecasts - the outcome forthe year to December 1999 was a little lower, at 1.8%, and we now think that the figure for the year toJune 2000 will be a little higher, at 3%. Some of the increase in the CPI is due to temporary factors, sothat the 3% for the CPI corresponds to about 2½% for underlying inflation. Thus we have finished theperiod when inflation was below the bottom of our band - a period that lasted longer than any of usexpected - and we have moved back to where the CPI is near the top of our band, but partly due tosome temporary factors.Where to from now? This will be particularly hard to judge, given that for at least a year the year-ended figure for the CPI will be obscured by the once-off lift due to the GST, and then the effects ofthe abolition of wholesale sales tax.At present, we feel that the most likely outcome for inflation once all the dust has settled - i.e. once weare well into 2001/02 - is that it will be in the 2-3% target range, probably in the upper half. As usual,there is a large margin of uncertainty attached to that forecast, but the adjustments to monetary policy
BIS Review 44/20002which have been made over the past six months give us more confidence that inflation should becontained.I would now like to move away from the short term and turn to the medium term. Most developmentsin monetary policy can only be understood fully in this context although, by necessity, mostcommentary concerns short periods such as month to month, in line with our Board Meeting, or evenshorter, such as day to day, reflecting deadlines of the daily press.I will start by restating the logic of the inflation-targeting framework, which is the underpinning of ourwhole medium-term approach. We have an inflation target that says inflation should averagesomewhere between 2 and 3% in the medium to long run. We accept that at times it will be outsidethis range, but if we think this is going to happen more than briefly it calls for adjustments to monetarypolicy which will return inflation to the target and then keep it there.We have based our monetary policy on this framework not because we only care about inflation, butbecause we think it will give us the best result for the whole economy in the long run. In particular, ifapplied sensibly, it will enable the economy’s average growth rate to reflect its potential growth rateand therefore deliver the maximum sustainable increase in employment and living standards.We have already seen nine years of expansion with growth averaging over 4%, a considerably longerexpansion than we were able to achieve in the 1970s and 1980s. And there is every prospect that theexpansion will continue for a good deal longer. For the first time in my working life, Australia in the1990s has come near the top of the decade growth rates among developed countries. We grew fasterthan the United States, and only Ireland, among developed countries, recorded faster growth.This growth occurred at a time when our inflation rate averaged about 2¼%, a good deal lower than inearlier decades, and comparable with international standards. There was also less variability from yearto year in growth than in earlier expansions, although some variability is inevitable: we have hadannual growth rates at over 5% and at less than 3% during this expansion, yet its fundamentalmomentum has remained intact. I think the system has proved itself to be a very good one, and I amconfident that it is the best way to ensure that monetary policy makes sense in the medium term.It is also worth noting that during the course of the expansion, we have had one complete cycle ininterest rates - rises in 1994, then falls in 1996-98. These played their part in sustaining the expansion.The increase in official interest rates of 125 basis points that has occurred over the past seven monthshas to be seen in this context. For the present expansion to continue as long as possible, monetarypolicy has to be adjusted as circumstances change. The economy has been undergoing a shift from aperiod when inflation had been below the target to one where it was going to be in the target range.Without policy adjustment, there was the prospect that it would, in time, rise above the desired range.Until relatively recently, we were receiving information on economic activity that indicated theeconomy could even have been accelerating beyond the 4½% growth that had prevailed over the 1997to 1999 period. From our perspective, the decisions to raise interest rates were relativelystraightforward.The situation is not as straightforward now. Signs of a near-term acceleration in growth have gone. Asdiscussed earlier, there are now signs of slowing domestic demand, some of which may be in responseto the tightenings that have already occurred. Other things being equal, this should be helpful incontaining inflationary pressures. Other developments, principally the lower exchange rate, will act inan expansionary direction, and potentially put upward pressure on inflation. It will be a difficult timefor reading and forecasting the domestic economy, and all this will take place against the backdrop ofan international economy dominated by the uncertainty of the unfolding events in the United States.Markets, as always, will be looking for guidance. The more thoughtful will appreciate the complexityof the situation, the less thoughtful will be expecting to be told the “formula” that we are using.Unfortunately, there is no “formula” other than the guiding principle of the inflation-targeting regime.This means that we will be assessing the outlook for inflation as judged by the factors which form thebasis of our forward-looking approach to monetary policy.Growth in demand and output, and the extent to which that places pressure on the economy’s capacity,are clearly important. We judge this by examining all the available monthly and quarterly time series
3BIS Review 44/2000data on economic activity, including those which give an impression of intangible factors like“confidence”. We monitor trends in commodity prices, wholesale prices, and wages, as well as theCPI and the various measures of underlying inflation derived from it. The wages data may beparticularly important in the year ahead, given the difficulties in interpreting price indexes. We have toallow for structural changes - such as the increased competitive pressure in goods markets. This hasbeen an important ingredient in maintaining downward pressure on many prices, and should be helpfulin negotiating the introduction of the GST. Inflation expectations are important - since it is theanticipation of price rises that drives many decisions. We need also to consider the financial side of theeconomy - the expansion of credit, trends in asset markets and the extent of risks which may bebuilding up there.We then complement this essentially domestic analysis with an appreciation of what is happening inthe international environment in which Australian producers and consumers make their decisions. Wecan not afford to ignore the world price level, world interest rates, or the variable which connects bothof them to the Australian economy - the exchange rate. Changes in the price of imports in foreigncurrency terms can have a large impact on domestic inflation as the OPEC oil price rises of the 1970sshowed. The recent oil price increases demonstrate the same principle, on a much smaller scale. Risesin a range of raw materials prices, driven mostly by global trends, are also having an impact on thecost of producing goods in Australia. In the opposite direction, the subdued world price environmentof 1997 and 1998 helped contain any inflationary fallout from the lower exchange rate we experiencedduring the Asian crisis.Movements in the exchange rate clearly affect inflation and, as such, are an integral part of anyinflation-targeting regime. That is why they are frequently mentioned by central banks which operatemonetary policy in this way. But there is no mechanical relationship between the level of the mostfrequently quoted measure of the exchange rate - the rate against the US dollar - and the futuredomestic price level. For a start, the price effects are better approximated by the trade-weighted index.Second, a temporary movement in the exchange rate may have little or no effect on prices and so someattempt must be made at estimating medium-term developments, or at least market participants’expectations of medium-term developments. Finally, a change in the exchange rate may have differentimplications if it primarily represents international views about our economy and policies, or if it isbecause we are being swept along with other countries in an international adjustment process.All of these factors are relevant and have to be taken into account with due weight. But that is doneunder the unifying framework of the inflation-targeting approach to policy. As I have noted above, thisapproach has delivered tangible benefits. I am convinced that it will continue to do so.Mr Chairman, it is a difficult time to be making monetary policy. The world environment is changing.Most of these changes are for the better - our region is in recovery, as opposed to the severe recessionof two years ago, and global growth is strong. Our terms of trade are improving. Some other changes -in world capital markets, for example - are rather less benign for Australia. Adapting to these changingcircumstances presents a challenge.At such times, it is important to keep our eye on the main goals - to sustain a long expansion, and toaddress early potential imbalances which could impede the expansion’s continuation. However, wecannot assume that we have a choice of outcomes for the Australian economy, in terms of growth andinflation, which is invariant to what happens in the rest of the world. While we are benefiting from thestronger world growth compared with recent years, we will also be affected by the contractionaryeffects of the lift in world interest rates. As the forecasts I mentioned in the beginning show, the yearahead will most likely be one of slightly reduced growth, and somewhat higher inflation, comparedwith the exceptional outcomes of recent years.But if we can sustain the economic expansion through a tenth and eleventh year, even if its pacemoderates for a time, and at the same time keep inflation low, we will have achieved something whichhas eluded us for three decades. That is a very worthy goal. It is what we aim to do.
1BIS Review 43/2000Marko Škreb: The transition process - it’s all about people, isn’t it?Text of the Jacques de Larosière Lecture given by Mr Marko Škreb, Governor of the Croatian NationalBank, at the EBRD Ninth Annual Meeting, held in Riga, Latvia, on 21 May 2000.*      *      *Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,Let me first of all say how deeply honored and humbled I am to be chosen to deliver this year’sJacques de Larosière lecture1 on the occasion of the Ninth Annual Meeting of the EBRD. It is a specialhonor not only for me, but for my country, Croatia, as well. Let me thank you all for this. It is aprivilege to deliver this lecture after only two distinguished central bank governors: HannaGronkiewicz-Waltz two years ago and Jacob A Frenkel last year. Which reminds me that right now Iam breaking one of the main BIS rules: “Never speak after Jacob Frenkel”. My only hope is that thetime lag of one year is long enough for your memories to fade.Making a speech to honor Mr de Larosière is an enormous challenge. I have always been veryimpressed by his work and his distinguished domestic and especially international career. I metMr de Larosière for the first time in 1996 (after I became the governor of the central bank) and havemanaged to stay in touch regularly since then. Even in the very difficult moments in Croatia’s historyduring periods of international political isolation, we managed to have a very honest and professionalrelationship, which today I respect even more than I did then. For me the highlight in our relationshiphappened last year when Mr de Larosière accepted the invitation to give the keynote speech at thetraditional Vth Dubrovnik Conference on Transition Economies organised by the Croatian NationalBank. Definitely, his knowledge, experience and insight into the transition process were invaluable tothe Conference.  The title of his lecture was non-pretentious (like the man himself): “TransitionEconomies”, but his messages were very strong and deep (again, like Mr de Larosière himself). In hisconcluding remarks Mr de Larosière, among other things, had the courage to point out some of thenegative human facets of transition, for example: “… in some countries the human costs of transitionhave been high, for instance in terms of male life expectancy ..., growing inequalities of income andincreased poverty.” (de Larosière, 1999, p.10).Of course, there are many positive human sides to transition. What I would like to do today is neitherpresent to you a comprehensive survey of transition as there are numerous articles entitled: “Ten yearsof transition …”, nor give some new empirical evidence about causalities between the main variablesin the transition process. I would simply like to share with you some of the experiences I have had as apolicymaker in transition, experience of course gained in my own country - Croatia. Beside this I willtry, by asking questions, to make you reflect for a moment on some simple ideas. For example, one ofthe questions to which I am looking for an answer is whether we have in the past consistently checkedour progress in transition not only against other countries or international standards, but against whatmust be the ultimate goal of the transition process - increasing the wellbeing of the people.My lecture is divided into three parts. First, I will try to answer a simple question: What is transitionall about? The second part will discuss what the main “ingredients” are in the process of achievingrapid and sustained growth and will focus on human and social capital. In the third part I will discusssome obstacles to transition the way I see them, which means as a central banker. I will end bysumming up my remarks.1I would like to thank Mr. Boris Vujcic and Mr. Gary O’Callaghan for their suggestions while preparing this lecture. Theusual disclaimer applies.
BIS Review 43/200021.What is the transition process all about?Numerous researchers have analysed in depth the transition process in terms of speed of reforms, theirsequencing, results and possible outcomes, but rarely do we ask ourselves the simple questions like:Why has transition started and why are we involved in it? Without elaborating the answer in detail, letme offer just one possible answer. Socialism (as defined in Kornai, 2000), the predominant system incountries where EBRD operates today, has imploded, has collapsed. This system was not able to meetthe growing demands of the population for a better life, that is to say: raising living standards, and thedevelopment of a civil society and political freedoms. In a globalized world, information on livingstandards and developments of civil society and political freedoms from the neighbouring West couldnot be hidden any more from most transition economies, and discontent grew. The political conditionsfor change are symbolized in the fall of the Berlin Wall. This created huge expectations among peoplein the countries of formerly socialist economies. The expectations of the population at that time werethat there would be a rapid catch-up with the western standard of living (including political freedomsas well). With regard to the speed of catching up in terms of economic wellbeing, this turned out to bea naïve view.The main goal of any economic policy should be to increase the welfare of the population, whichincludes a sustained and high growth of GDP and a desirable distribution of income. In other words,we want welfare to increase; we want people to be better off. Not many people should have troubleagreeing with that statement. Today, indeed, there is evidence that the dual goals of growth andequality of income distribution are mutually compatible (Wolf, 2000).Whether policymakers are always fully aware of the ultimate goal to promote the welfare of the peopleis another question. Policymakers in transition face many challenges and bold decisions. Let memention just a few. Whether to privatize rapidly or not? Whether to open up the economy at once orretain external controls for some time? Whether to aim at zero inflation or not? The main point is thatthose (and other similar) questions should not be answered only from the viewpoint of either ideologyor academic debate, but should be answered in the light of the fact that they are only means to achievethe ultimate goal of increasing the welfare of a people in each country in transition. I would argue thatpolicymakers tend to forget this and think of measures in transition as the goal in itself. For example,sometimes they are proud of rapid privatization regardless of its effects.The second danger is that policymakers do not care about the ultimate objective at all. Sometimes,politicians do things in order to enrich themselves, their family or friends, instead of increasingsociety’s welfare. Such behaviour is called a “bad” political culture (Hillman and Swank, 2000). It hasto be stressed that those societies perform badly. Corruption is endemic, tax evasion high, resourcesare misallocated, growth lower, and inequalities higher.In the transition process people are sometimes forgotten. And here I do not refer only to the poor ordeprived, but people in general. Therefore we, the policymakers, have to ask ourselves whether wehave consistently checked our progress against what must be the ultimate goal of the transitionprocess.My message here is not only that transition policies should ultimately benefit the people, but that thepeople have to understand why reforms are necessary and what kind of reforms we should pursue. Inshort they have to understand what the policymakers are doing. Let me stress that because of thelegacy of socialism this goal is even more challenging in transition. Usually people are both averse torisk and have a high discount rate about the future. In socialism those two behavioral patterns seem tobe even stronger. People who have spent part of their lives in a socialist system and came out of it onlyten years ago, on average tend to be even: a) more risk averse and b) have stronger preferences for thepresent.a) In socialism the notion of risk and its consequences were almost unknown. One can think ofsocialism as a big insurance company. No bankruptcies, no unemployment, no financialmarkets, no volatility whatsoever, very little choice (both for households and companies) asalmost everything was laid down by the central plan. Most risks (which always exist) weretaken by society as a whole (socialized) and were not individualized. Or, vice versa,individual decisions rarely affected individual wellbeing. In a market environment there are
3BIS Review 43/2000so many more decisions to be taken and almost each of them is associated with risk and itsconsequences.b) In socialism there was no reason to worry too much about the future. Free schools, freeeducation, free health insurance, no unemployment, secured pensions, in short very fewincentives to take a long-term perspective on life. Questions like: How am I going to financemy children’s education? Should I save for my old age? Will I be able to afford a mortgageif I’m unemployed? were very rarely asked under socialism. So, it was comfortable to thinkonly about the present, as someone else - “the socialist system” - would take care of thefuture. The same reasoning could be applied to companies. Why worry about the long-termmarket developments, when the almighty central planner would take care of that?For those reasons it is even more challenging for policymakers in transition to explain their goals andactions clearly to the population than it would otherwise be.In reality we do not seem to have acted consistently in pursuit of these goals of whether transitionbenefits the people and whether they understand the process. Sometimes the people get left behind andwe embark on a reform without asking whether it fulfils the ultimate goal of raising people’s livingstandards. Moreover, we can fall into the trap of measuring our success in piecemeal reforms withoutasking whether the whole spectrum of economic relations have moved forward together. Therefore, wemust bring the people forward with the reforms and ensure that they are politically accepted. If this isnot the case, it may become a big obstacle to rapid transition (as I will explain further in due course).Which reminds me of an old joke that we used to tell during socialism, and it goes something like this.During a preparatory seminar for future members of the then almighty Communist Party the localParty Secretary explained to the group of candidates that the future belongs to socialism and thatsocialism is the most advanced system in the world. A young candidate asks a question referring topermanent meat shortages under socialism: Mr Secretary, if we are so advanced how come there is nomeat in our shops? The swift answer was: “My dear comrade, we are advancing so quickly into thefuture that the cattle can’t keep up with us”.I am not I arguing for slower reforms in transition, on the contrary, but let us not forget in our rush tomarket economies that transition is done for the benefit of the people.2.What “ingredients” do we need to achieve sustained, rapid growth?Economists agree that for transition to be successful we need sustained growth. Therefore, thequestion of what needs to be done in transition ultimately leads to the question of what causes growth?The literature on growth has been expanding lately, but most work on transition agrees thatmacroeconomic stability linked with structural reforms is essential to growth (Wyplosz, 1999; Fischerand Sahay, 2000). And it is equally true that most transition economies have responded positively tothe combination of the two and after a sharp decline in GDP today have positive growth.We have learned as well that the growth process is much more complex than was anticipated at onetime. We know that the future success of reforms depends very much on elements like: institutionbuilding, contract enforcement, rule of law, etc. To explain the complexity of growth in transition alittle bit I will use two concepts: a) human capital and b) social capital.a)Human capitalLet me immediately start by quoting Lucas (1993) on what causes growth: “The main engine ofgrowth is the accumulation of human capital - of knowledge - and the main source of difference inliving standards among nations is difference in human capital” (p.270). So, if we want sustainedgrowth we must promote the accumulation of human capital in transition economies.The next question is: How does the accumulation of human capital happen? Obviously, there are manyways in which human capital is accumulated but, to mention just a few: it happens in schools, in otherforms of training, particularly on-the-job, in research institutes, etc. Therefore it seems reasonable to
BIS Review 43/20004argue that transition economies should pay special attention to formal education, and other forms oftraining and research. As the empirical evidence suggests (Flanagan, 1998), return to schooling beganto rise rapidly during the transition. Relatively soon, they approximated those in many marketeconomies. Under central planning, the main distortions in human capital formation were theovervaluation of vocational training and the undervaluing of university education. However, thetransition process has quickly started to correct this shortcoming of socialism.Formal schooling need not be the main factor in developing human capital. Let me just mention thataccording to Lucas (1993), the most central feature of human capital accumulation for growth islearning on the job (learning by doing). For this to happen, we need both managers and workers to beconstantly exposed to new challenges, to move up on the “quality ladder”. In the globalized world oftoday it seems that one of the best ways to be exposed to new challenges is by exporting. An old Latinsaying could be paraphrased into: “Exportare necesse est, vivere non necesse est”.2 By opening up theeconomy, we are promoting human capital, which in turn is essential to growth.A similar approach can be used to argue for more foreign direct investments (FDI) in transitioneconomies. FDIs bring not only physical capital, but: new organization, know-how, etc which thenincrease “domestic” human capital. That is why strategic investors with new knowledge are soimportant for overall growth.Let me be a little provocative and state that unfortunately multilateral institutions rarely talk abouthuman capital explicitly. For example, the EBRD Charter (quoted after Bronstone, 1999) does notmention developing human capital as EBRD’s role. A bureaucratic answer might be that that is not itsmandate. But, according to the EBRD’s Transition Report: “The EBRD seeks to foster the transition toan open market-oriented economy and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in all 26 of itscountries of operation”. (EBRD, 1999, p. vi.) If we agree that human capital is so important intransition, I ask myself how we can achieve this ambitious goal without knowing more about the leveland development of human capital in its countries of operation? Does the EBRD have a set ofmeasures of human capital in transition countries (both cross-country and time series), maybe invent anew index on human capital (like the broadly quoted one for privatization), a separate chapter in theTransition report? Please, let me assure all EBRD governors, management and staff that these remarksare made only in good faith in the hope that we will all reflect upon them a little bit.In a more general framework let us ask ourselves the following question: Have we done enough in thepast to achieve this goal? I doubt whether a lot of people in this room (and policymakers in transitioneconomies in general) will say yes without hesitation. Based on the experience in my own country,Croatia, I would say that we have unfortunately somewhat neglected the development of humancapital in the last ten years of transition.b)Social capitalNew literature is trying to explain the complexities of various phenomena by social capital (Collier,1998, Fukuyama, 2000). It is clear that for growth we need not only physical and human capital, butquality social capital as well. Social capital can be described as features of social organisation, such asnorms, trust, networks, etc., that facilitate coordination and cooperation among the group for themutual benefit of the group. A group can be anything from a household to the nation. In the productionprocess it is an addition to physical capital (machines, tools) and human capital (accumulatedknowledge). Social capital can enhance the benefits of both investments in physical and humancapital.One may distinguish between government social capital and civil social capital. Government socialcapital encompasses government institutions that influence people’s ability to cooperate and getmutual benefit out of it. Examples are: the rule of law, enforceability of contracts, civil liberties. Civil2 The original Latin saying is: Navigare necesse est, vivere non necesse est.
5BIS Review 43/2000social capital includes: common norms, values, informal groups or networks that influence the abilityof people to work together.Both of them resolve, i.e. overcome the collective action problem (the prisoner’s dilemma). Trust, aspromoted by social capital, reduces uncertainty and thus reduces transaction costs. This is all clearlybeneficial for growth, so we may conclude: the more quality social capital there is the higher growthwill be.In this lecture I will not elaborate the concept of social capital any further. My intentions are to focusnarrowly on the issue where I think my comparative advantage may be, namely central banking, andits role in promoting social capital. It is not very common to associate central banks with thedevelopment of social capital, but I would argue that by forcefully pursuing its functions the centralbank is increasing social capital especially in transition economies.Central banks are usually associated with two main functions: macroeconomic stability or moreprecisely price stability which today is considered the principal mandate of a central bank andfinancial stability, which is usually narrowed down to banking system stability. Not all transitioncentral banks are responsible for banking supervision, but most are.First let me explore the idea of increasing social capital by pursuing price stability. Today, mosttransition economies have managed to have relatively modest inflation after the initial outburst ofinflation and even hyperinflation. But it is worth remembering that inflation is always a constantthreat, it is never dead, only tamed. Central banks must continuously send a credible message thatcomplacency will not set in and that price stability is their main long-term objective. People mustalways be reminded that inflation is a tax. And this tax is: undemocratic (rarely approved or discussedin the Parliament), regressive (a heavier burden is put on the poor; those that cannot protectthemselves from it), and economically inefficient (high inflation inhibits economic growth andultimately reduces budgetary revenues). And an inflationary environment creates the wrong incentives.In a highly inflationary environment incentives to produce are reduced. For entrepreneurs to take adecision to produce (the “make it” approach) and not redistribute (the “take it” approach) one needs along-term stable environment. Therefore by maintaining price stability the central bank gives a clearincentive to gain experience in production, not in redistribution. Per contra, by not carrying out itsmain function, but letting inflation rise in the economy, the central bank gives incentives to engage inredistribution and in higher than necessary transaction costs to avoid the inflation tax.Let me illustrate this with some Croatian experience. In the twenty years preceding independence(from 1971 to 1991 - Croatia at that time being part of former Yugoslavia), average inflation was 69%per annum. In 1992 and 1993 the average yearly inflation was more than 1000%. Similar trendsremained until October 1993, when the Stabilisation program was launched. From my personalexperience I can assure you that in a highly inflationary environment a household’s objective is toavoid the inflation tax. Currency substitution and “shopping around to find old prices” are the mainbehavioral patterns, not long-term planning. The same can be said for production. What is the purposeof getting a monthly 2% efficiency gain in some production process if monthly prices change morethan 20%? The same principle applies if monthly inflation is more than 4% as it was in Croatia (onaverage) in the two decades preceding independence. Throughout that period GDP was either stagnantor falling.3 GDP started to increase only in 1994, after prices were successfully stabilized.The costs of inflation are relatively well analysed in the literature, so there is no need to analyse themany further, but let me reiterate that it is important that the incentives in a country help people producenew wealth and not put their efforts into redistributing it. Inflation favors predation over production.The second important function of the central bank is a stable financial or, more narrowly, bankingsystem. But, banking crises have affected a large number of countries and almost none of the transitioneconomies escaped them (Frydl, 1999). A lot of transition economies passed through two banking3The dramatic fall in GDP in Croatia in the early nineties cannot be attributed to inflation alone. It was not even the maincontributor. The disintegration of former Yugoslavia, war and transition were taking place at the same time.
BIS Review 43/20006crises: the first was the crisis of the old banks with their legacy (dubious assets) from the previouseconomic system. The second crisis occurred in banks founded after changes in the economic systemthat were not able to remain viable, because of either weak management and/or increased competitionin the market as the transition period progressed.Croatia followed that pattern. The first banking crisis, the crisis of the old banks, as they were called,started with the beginning of the transition process (and even before it), and is even now ending withthe sale of the rehabilitated state banks to foreign strategic investors. The costs of this crisis, broughtabout by the legacy of the past and as is too often forgotten, by the enormous consequences of the war,can be estimated at about 23% of GDP. These high costs are typical of countries caught up in a war,like Kuwait and Israel in parts of their histories.During the first half of 1998 the second banking crisis became visible in Croatia. The then governmentmade a decision to rehabilitate two banks which represented about 7% of the total banks’ balancesheet. Bank rehabilitations are payed out of the budget. The Croatian National Bank required thatbankruptcy proceedings be started in nine banks and four savings banks, while it withdrew theoperating permit from one branch of a foreign bank, one bank and six savings banks. This has imposedhigh budgetary costs for the payment of insured savings deposits in banks in which bankruptcyproceedings have been started. The total costs of the second banking crisis could be estimated at about4% of GDP.The costs of the first and the second crisis represent about 27% of Croatia’s GDP in 1999. It isobviously a very heavy burden on the economy. The costs mentioned are fiscal costs, borne by thetaxpayers. Economic costs are certainly higher. If regulation and supervision are inadequate, bad banks will emerge or proliferate more thanotherwise would be the case.4 This will not only impose costs on the budget, but the economy willsuffer as such banks will not be efficient financial intermediaries. For example, banks may allocateresources (loans) not according to market principles and good banking practices, but in the aim to“favor” themselves (management), their relatives, friends, connected businesses, with other people’smoney. Asset stripping, simple theft and similar activities can easily develop within and around banks.All those features will benefit only the few. As long as management of banks “can get away withmurder” they will continue to behave in such a way.By creating a stable environment (both macroeconomic and financial) the central bank favours thelong-term perspective. People should expect stability in prices and in the financial system, take along-term view and get involved in long-term wealth creation and not only short-term redistributiongains.3.Obstacles to transition - a personal accountCertainly, there is a long list of obstacles to rapid transition. Besides, I am sure that each one of youpresent here would have a different list of obstacles. Today I will elaborate only on two of them,which I consider important from my own experience. They are: a) rent-seeking behavior, and b) lackof broad political support for reforms (which I partly discussed before).a)Rent-seekingIf private returns on predation are larger than private returns on production, this will send “wrong”incentives to people and society will not develop in the desired direction. Therefore we have to makeevery effort to “get the incentives right”. This is not an easy exercise. Socialism and, sometimes evenmore, early transition, have created vested interests and it is understandable that every socio-economic4In no way am I trying to imply that the main cause of the banking crisis is inadequate supervision and regulation. But,they can certainly deepen banking problems.
7BIS Review 43/2000group will fight either to preserve their status quo or try to “grab” even more. The problem isespecially exacerbated if the prevailing mentality in a society as a whole is the “take it” and not “makeit” philosophy.Every change is a redistribution, redistribution of power and relative wealth. Transition by definition isa change. People on average resist change. I have called this the Newtonian Law of Transition,namely: “Every action creates a reaction.” (Škreb, 1998). This resistance to reform (changes) isprobably “time-dependent” and positively correlated with the time spent in transition. In the earlystages reforms are more general (macroeconomic stabilization) and there is much more support forthem. In the later stages “transition fatigue” starts to develop, and disappointment with slowness (oreven a decline or stagnation) in the rise of living standards is more and more present. On top of this,structural reforms imply microeconomic changes (usually labor-shedding). This is a challenge to thestatus quo. These are some of the reasons why structural reforms are so much more difficult toimplement and slower than glamorous macroeconomic stabilization programs or measures like theannouncement of a new currency, a new exchange-rate regime or a new central bank governor.Based on Croatia’s experience I would like to say that some important large-scale privatizations andforeign direct investments were either postponed or abandoned because of resistance from workers andlocal communities. They both preferred the imaginary safety of the status quo. The conventionalwisdom is that government ownership (the status quo) should ensure at least minimal wages and jobsecurity. By contrast, private ownership of a company means job uncertainty for employees, as theyhave observed in many cases of privatized companies that labor-shedding took place. We should beaware that workers will not automatically embrace privatization and restructuring of their companiesin spite of the fact that they are very often carried out in their interest or are the only option for thecompany to stay alive.The same can be said for the case of banking crisis resolution in Croatia. Based on my ownexperience, any resolution is bound to be faced with strong resistance and delays. First, the budget(i.e. the Ministry of Finance) will not willingly accept that it has to pay for the costs of banking crisisresolution. Second, the management of the banks will try to change the banking problem resolutionand not shoulder the costs of their actions. They have clear vested interests in the bank as it is (theirhigh salaries, their influence through credit allocation, the wish to hide previous decisions, etc). Third,depositors (households and companies) will make every effort to minimize their losses and getsomeone else to bear the costs of the problem. Fourth, the owners of banks will try to put politicalpressure on the government to bail them out. Fifth, there is the personnel of the bank, because theyknow that either all or part of them will lose their jobs. Sixth, politicians will try to minimize theproblem in the hope that it will not hurt their “image”.Every decision on the bank resolution problem is a redistribution problem. There are always welfarelosses for some interest groups, so we should be aware that such decisions will create very stronglobbying, corruption, ruthless behaviour, a fight to preserve vested interests, etc. Needless to say, allsuch behavioral patterns mean using scarce resources to influence the outcome in a redistributive way,and not use them to produce new wealth. To overcome this problem policymakers must make sure thatthey have the “incentives right” and have a clear set of rules to diminish the scope of discretionarydecision-making which always gives room for rent-seeking.b)Support for policiesUltimately sound economics is sound politics as well. But the problem is that economic measures maytake time to bear fruit. In other words reforms usually have immediate costs and the benefits are(sometimes) distant. Let me stress again that policymakers must educate the public at large to get theirsupport. If this is not the case, it may be a serious obstacle to rapid transition.With the benefit of hindsight and from the perspective of a central banker I would say that in the pastwe lacked not so much sound economic decisions but good public relations for our policies. This isespecially true in the case where the central bank initiated bankruptcy procedures or withdrew licencesfor 25 banks which was something unheard of in Croatia in the last fifty years. Let us not blame onlypeople or politicians for their resistance to those measures. New economic policy is like a new
BIS Review 43/20008product. It is the responsibility of the producer - the policymakers - to overcome the informationassymetry and inform the consumers - the population and the politicians - of the benefits of thisproduct (bankruptcies in the banking system) and sell it successfully. If central banks in transitioneconomies want to be successful they should be much more “customer-oriented” and educate thepublic and politicians about the benefits of their main products: price stability and financial stability.Otherwise, they risk a weak demand for their services.Without clearly explaining the goals of reforms to the people, policymakers put at risk the necessarysupport for changes. This is a very challenging and long-term task as it is easier to get people out ofcommunism than communism out of people. This problem is nothing new in history. It is not withoutgood reason that it took Moses forty years to bring his people from slavery in Egypt to the promisedland (simply to replace the entire generation), a trip that could be completed in weeks (Hillman, 1999).It is therefore our duty to make the journey in the transition desert as short as possible.4.Summing upTransition has been a tremendous and exciting project in the last ten years, as well as an invaluableexperience for all of us who took part in it in one way or another. Out of it we have learned a lot, notonly about how economic systems function or how to initiate economic changes, but we have learnedabout human nature as well. So, let us keep in mind that the transition process is done for the peopleand by the people. They happen at the same time: the main objective of transition (we have to increasetheir welfare), the main engine of transition (through human and social capital) and the main constraintto more rapid transition (rent-seeking behaviour and lack of political support).Therefore, in my view, policymakers have to ask themselves constantly the following three questions:a) whether they have consistently checked progress in transition against what must be theultimate goal of the transition process;b) whether they have done enough to nurture human and social capital, as without thoseingredients economies will grow slower than they might; andc) whether they have anticipated and tried to overcome the obstacles to transition, since oneshould expect resistance to change and one should not expect broad understanding for everymeasure taken.Finally, ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Monsieur Jacques de Larosière, I have chosen to concludethis lecture with a French saying: “Le bonheur, disait M… n’est pas chose aisée. Il est très difficile dele trouver en nous, et impossible de le trouver ailleurs.” (Sebastien Roch Nicolas dit Chamfort - 18thcentury French Philosopher.)Applied to transition economies Chamfort’s words can mean that we of the transition economies mustrealize that our happiness lies within us. We must look inside our respective countries and findspecific answers to our problems for the better future.Naturally, we should not neglect looking outside as well. There is not a single doubt in my mind thatfor transition to be successful countries need to open up, promote foreign direct investment as much aspossible, extensively use foreign technical assistance, embrace transfers of knowledge, participate andbenefit from globalization, and, last but not least, exploit to the maximum the beneficial role ofinternational financial organizations in general and the EBRD in particular as this institution wascreated for us. All those elements are necessary. But, it is my strong belief that the ultimate test of asuccessful transition lies within us. Why? Simply because, it’s the people’s transition, isn’t it?Thank you very much for your attention.

1BIS Review 42/2000Lars Nyberg: The infrastructure of emergency liquidity assistance- what is required in today’s financial system?Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the CGFS regional meetingin Tokyo, Bank of Japan, on 22 May 2000.*      *      *Sweden experienced a severe banking crisis in the beginning of the 1990s. To manage the crisis, theauthorities had to implement measures that averted a complete breakdown of the financial systemwhile attempting to limit the costs to taxpayers. In addition, it was imperative for the authorities toconsider whether or not their actions would contribute to future moral hazard problems. During thecrisis, an effective division of labour developed between the authorities involved, namely the Ministryof Finance, the Riksbank, the central bank, Finansinspektionen, the financial supervisory authority andthe Bank Support Authority. As the crisis progressed, the Riksbank provided emergency liquidityassistance (ELA) twice, acting in its role as “lender of last resort”. The remarks in this note are largelydrawn from the Riksbank’s experiences in this crisis, and how these experiences can be used toassessing the role of ELA in a general crisis management infrastructure.When discussing the infrastructure that is in place to handle financial crises, two aspects are ofprimary importance. First, ELA must be put in the context of the overall methods of crisismanagement that the authorities would employ should a financial crisis occur. ELA is not a measurethat can or should be used in every financial crisis. The way other crisis management procedures areset up also affects the scope for ELA. This is covered in the first part of this note.Second, the way ELA issues are organised within the central bank is also very important for whether itis an effective measure and, in particular, whether it will reduce or increase moral hazard in thefinancial sector. This is discussed in the second part of the note.Before discussing these two aspects, the importance of speed in granting ELA must be emphasized, asthe speedy implementation of ELA is essential to its being effective in a crisis situation. ELA is theonly measure in the crisis management framework that normally can be used quickly. It should beseen as an acute measure that is used for avoiding a sudden disruption of the large-value paymentsystem, in particular when threats to the system emerge suddenly.Incidents like the failure of Barings bank, LTCM and the Swedish currency and banking crisis showthat threats to the financial system may indeed emerge suddenly, and that authorities must react veryquickly - if not within minutes, at least within hours. The growth and increasing globalisation offinancial markets, the high volatility in these markets and the increasing complexity of financialinstitutions, are all examples of factors that increase the risk for sudden crises and increase theprobability that such crises will spread from one market to another.1.ELA as part of general crisis management and resolutionShould a financial crisis occur, there are a number of measures that may be used by authorities to limitthe consequences of the crisis. In addition to ELA, examples of these measures are financial support toprotect the solvency of institutions, brokering of private sector support to or acquisitions of troubledinstitutions, management of deposit insurance schemes and insolvency procedures for financialinstitutions. In general, these measures may be undertaken by different authorities. A consequence ofthis is that cooperation between authorities is an important element of crisis management. Theauthorities must have a common strategy for how the crisis should be managed in order to avoidexcessive support to the financial sector. Excessive support may lead to undue costs to taxpayers andto unsound incentives for the financial sector. In this context, it is important to emphasise that theseeffects can arise from all kinds of official support. Thus, the authorities must limit the support that is
BIS Review 42/20002offered. Support may be warranted only when there is a considerable risk for a systemic crisis thatmay lead to a severe decline of real economic activity. Typically, real economic activity is affected bya breakdown of payments systems or restrictive granting of credit, a credit crunch.Traditionally, ELA provided by central banks has been seen as a measure to deal with pure liquidityproblems in banks that essentially are solvent. In practice, situations where pure liquidity problemsarise seem to be rare. In most cases where banks face liquidity problems, there is some uncertaintyabout the solvency of the institutions involved. Typically, it takes time to make an assessment of thesolvency of an institution. In the Swedish banking crisis, it took many months to fully assess thefinancial situation of the troubled institutions. Not even the institutions themselves had a good pictureof how large their problems were. Recent developments in the financial system, such as consolidation,the emergence of geographically dispersed financial conglomerates with activity in many product linesand a greater complexity of financial products, make this task even harder. It is unlikely that centralbanks or supervisory authorities will be able to make a valid assessment of the solvency of troubledinstitutions quickly enough. As mentioned above, requests for liquidity support may arise very rapidly.The conclusion of this is that it will in practice be very difficult to draw the dividing line between thecentral bank’s responsibilities and those of other authorities by distinguishing between institutionswith solvency problems and those with pure liquidity problems, at least during a sudden crisis.Another conclusion is that it is crucial to establish rules for information sharing between authorities,especially between the financial supervisory authority and the central bank in advance so that thecentral bank can quickly make an assessment. It is also important that the central bank, even if it doesnot have direct supervisory responsibilities, closely monitors general financial market developments,including in the major institutions, to detect potential crisis situations that may call for ELA.The traditional view that ELA should never be given to insolvent banks can also be discussed fromanother perspective. A prerequisite for all kinds of support, including ELA, should be that there isconsiderable risk for a systemic crisis. Given that, it can be discussed whether it is worse to provideELA to an insolvent institution, or to refrain from an action that could avoid a systemic crisis. If thereis a risk of systemic crisis, it is normally determined that public support even to insolvent institutionsmay be warranted, but this is normally given by the government through the fiscal budget, not by thecentral bank. The moral hazard aspects, which are common arguments for not providing ELA toinsolvent institutions, will be no different if the central bank provides support or if the governmentdoes.The central bank may have a better capability than other authorities to provide financial support if theneed arises very quickly. The main reason for this is that the central bank has the instruments forlending available and it has resources in its balance sheet or the credibility to get resources if they areneeded (for example in foreign currency). It also has an established capacity to judge whether asystemic crisis may occur as a result of an institution’s financial problems. The Riksbank is able tomake this judgement by virtue of its role as provider of the central payment system and theresponsibilities attached to this, its presence in financial markets and its general knowledge of the stateof the economic and financial system. Other authorities typically have greater obstacles to reactingfast, as they do not in most cases have instruments or resources readily available for these sorts ofoperations. There may also be difficult political considerations that have to be taken. For example, aminority government may need to seek support from other parties to use budgetary resources, asupport that may be hard to get or at least take some time. However, this is not to be taken as anargument for governments to use the central bank as a provider of support because it does not want touse budgetary resources. The central bank should be independent and control its own resources.The conclusion of this is that ELA operations should have the role in the general crisis managementinfrastructure of dealing with quickly emerging problems. Where problems arise gradually, othermeasures available to supervisory authorities and governments are more likely to be used. ELA shouldbe seen as a means for handling acute problems, so that the authorities gain time to decide whetherother crisis management measures are needed, such as restructuring of troubled institutions. If privatesector support can be organised, such as in the case of LTCM, that is of course to be preferred.
3BIS Review 42/2000If the view is accepted that ELA should function as a “bridge” measure to prevent acute crises fromoccurring, it is very important that the support is given in a way that minimises the credit risk for thecentral bank, in order to avoid moral hazard effects. The central bank must have a well-considered exitstrategy for its lending operations. The most obvious way to do this is to lend against collateral. Inmost cases where a need for support occurs, collateral that is normally accepted by the central bankwill probably not be available. The central bank may in these cases be required to accept lower qualitycollateral. It should in these cases apply a larger haircut on the collateral than is used for normalcollateral. Another part of a proper exit strategy is that financial support should not be given toshareholders or other holders of risk capital.2.Internal procedures for ELAIn the previous section, two main points were suggested: (1) that ELA is a measure that predominantlyshould be used for problems that arise without warning; and (2) that ELA should only be provided ifthere is a risk that a systemic problem would occur if the central bank did not act. These two featuresbring about requirements for the way central banks should organise the ELA function internally. Thepossible need for speedy assistance necessitates that a central bank must have internal procedures formanaging requests for liquidity support and doing so very rapidly. To accomplish this, central banksneed to have a detailed crisis plan that can be put in place within very short notice. The crisis planshould include the following types of information:Organisational structure• A division of responsibilities for analysis, information, decision-making, etc.• Staffing requirements for different tasks, with substitutes.Analysis plan• A description of the information necessary to make a decision about whether or not asystemic crisis may occur.• Necessary information about systemically important individual banks.Information strategy• A plan for informing and coordinating information and decisions with the other domesticagencies involved in the crisis.• A plan for informing authorities in other countries about the situation.• A plan for communicating with the financial markets.• A plan for spreading information to the public and media (ex ante and ex post transparency).Plan for implementing ELA• A clear description of the routines which must be followed and the legal requirements whichmust be met for ELA.Legal procedures, for example contracts, for lending against other collateral than what is normallyeligible• An inventory of the instruments available for implementing ELA.• Guidelines for acceptable collateral and appropriate haircuts.Internal preparedness is important in order to be able to consider requests for ELA, as the timeframefor reaction normally is very limited. It is important to note that preparation is crucial also if a centralbank is to deny a request for ELA. If the central bank has no organisation for analysing systemicconsequences and the availability of measures, it is very likely that it will not dare not to lend.
BIS Review 42/20004No central bank wants to give financial institutions and markets the slightest reason to depend oncentral bank support rather than their own efforts to avoid financial meltdown. Clearly, ELA is a lastresort measure that central banks use only when the stability of the financial system is at stake. Awell-planned and clear LOLR function need not encourage moral hazard. On the contrary, a centralbank with clear guidelines and a solid analysis capability is in the best position to pinpoint thosesituations in which ELA is necessary. In all other situations, clear guidelines help the central bank tostand firm against the institutions’ demands for help and to force markets to solve financial problemsby themselves.
1BIS Review 42/2000Donald T Brash: The pros and cons of currency union - a Reserve BankperspectiveAddress by Dr Donald T Brash, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the AucklandRotary Club, Auckland, on 22 May 2000.*      *      *IntroductionIn recent years, there has been a huge increase in interest in exchange rate regimes, both within NewZealand and internationally. Should countries maintain their own currencies, or adopt the currency ofsome other country or group of countries? If countries maintain their own currencies, should they“float”, or attempt to “peg” to the currency of some other country?As you know, New Zealand has had its own currency for many decades, and since March 1985 thatcurrency has been floating against other currencies, with its value determined day to day in thefinancial market. But through the mid-nineties as our exchange rate appreciated strongly, many peoplebecame concerned about whether this was the best arrangement for New Zealand (between early 1993and early 1997, an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted measure of the New Zealand dollar appreciatedby some 29 per cent, putting considerable pressure on exporters and those competing with imports).Interest in the subject has become even more widespread in the last couple of years, with 11 of thecountries of Europe abandoning their own currencies and forming a currency union, and with thegrowing interest in several Latin American countries in adopting the United States dollar. Last month,Sir Frank Holmes and Dr Arthur Grimes, two highly-regarded economists, released a study they hadundertaken for the Australia New Zealand Business Council entitled An ANZAC dollar?, and this hasfurther intensified public and political interest in the matter. It is clear that there is strong interest inthe subject on the part of the business community.So today I want to make some comments from a Reserve Bank perspective.But at the very outset I want to make it clear that any decision to abandon our own currency isfundamentally a political issue. Currency unions are generally formed as part of a larger strategic pushto integrate the countries entering the currency union, often in combination with free trade agreements,harmonisation of legal standards, and liberalised migration laws. Viewed in this way, entering acurrency union is a major foreign policy decision, and thus a matter for elected politicians. It is not amatter on which a central banker should express an overall opinion, and I will not be doing so.But the choice of currency regime does have important economic implications which need to becarefully assessed, and I believe it is appropriate for me to comment on those.One other point should be clarified at the outset. There are some differences between “currency union”(implying a new central bank and a new currency to cover a range of countries and currencies, as inthe case of the European Monetary Union) and “dollarisation” (implying the simple adoption of thecurrency of another country, whether in New Zealand’s case that be the Australian dollar or the UnitedStates dollar). And the most important of those differences for us is whether New Zealand would haveany part in making the decisions about the monetary policy which would affect us. In a currencyunion, all the countries included in the union in principle have a say in forming monetary policy forthe area covered by the union. All countries have a voice at the table, even if that is only a single voiceamong many. In the case of dollarisation, however, only the country whose currency is adopted makesthe decisions about monetary policy.The study by Sir Frank Holmes and Arthur Grimes suggested that a currency union with Australia(involving a new central bank for both countries, and a new currency) could have some useful benefitsfor New Zealand. And they suggested a currency union, rather than New Zealand’s adoption of theAustralian dollar, largely for reasons of political acceptability in New Zealand.
BIS Review 42/20002Whether such an approach would meet the political acceptability test in Australia, of course, is a bitdebatable. Preliminary comments from Australia suggest no interest whatsoever in abandoning theAustralian dollar in favour of a new trans-Tasman currency. But whether currency union withAustralia, or the simple adoption of the Australian dollar by New Zealand, the outcome would insubstance be very similar. With the exception of who gets the seigniorage income, on which I willcomment in a moment, both options would involve New Zealand’s relinquishing any effective controlover monetary policy in New Zealand.In the case of the United States dollar, currency union is not even being raised as a possible option.The only possibility in that case would involve New Zealand’s adopting the United States dollar. Andthat too, of course, would mean relinquishing any control over our own monetary policy. Since theterm “currency union” has been widely used in New Zealand to include both currency union asproperly understood and the simple process of adopting another country’s currency, I will for the mostpart use the term “currency union” in the balance of my comments, while recognising that for allpractical purposes we are talking about “dollarisation”, be it “Australian dollarisation” or “USdollarisation”.Some myths about currency unionBefore I comment on some of the economic advantages and disadvantages of currency union, it mightbe helpful to dispose of a few of the myths that have become rather prevalent.The first myth is that the Reserve Bank is opposed to currency union, perhaps because “Don Brashwould lose his job”. Certainly, if we “dollarised”, using either the Australian dollar or the US dollar,there would be no need for anybody to be employed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and thosenow employed by the Bank would lose their jobs. If we went into a currency union, presumably withAustralia, it is also likely that many existing Reserve Bank staff would lose their jobs (though I mustadmit that the European precedent perhaps suggests that job losses would not be great in thatsituation!). But I can assure you that neither the Reserve Bank nor Don Brash is opposed to currencyunion. Nor are we promoting currency union. As indicated a moment ago, the Bank’s responsibility isto advise Ministers about the economic implications of currency union, both the pros and the cons, andto foster informed public discussion on the issue.The second myth is that small countries are in some ways just too vulnerable to have their owncurrencies in the modern world. This is sometimes expressed in terms of the metaphor of a tiny rowingboat, tossed around in a turbulent ocean, with the turbulence arising from the vast flows of capitalwhich every day wash backwards and forwards at the click of a mouse. But there are some extremelysuccessful small countries with their own currencies - Singapore and Switzerland spring immediatelyto mind - and, contrary to popular mythology, the New Zealand dollar is not a particularly volatilecurrency.Not a particularly volatile currency? No. The Reserve Bank has looked at this issue both in terms ofshort-term volatility and in terms of the big exchange rate swings which are, I suspect, of rather greaterconcern.Looking at short-term volatility (measured as 30 day volatility against the United States dollar), theNew Zealand dollar was more volatile than the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen,and the German mark between the time of the float in March 1985 and August 1988. But for most ofthe period since September 1988, and indeed on average over that whole 12 year period, the NewZealand dollar has been somewhat less volatile than any of those currencies.Looking at the big exchange rate swings which made life difficult for exporters and those competingwith imports at some stages during the last decade, we compared the size of the exchange rateappreciation from trough to peak for each of the same currencies. We found that the maximumappreciation which the New Zealand dollar experienced during the decade (measured on aninflation-adjusted, trade-weighted, basis) was, to be sure, at 29 per cent rather greater than thatexperienced by the Australian dollar (at 20 per cent), but was closely similar to the maximumtrough-to-peak appreciation experienced by the German mark (27 per cent), the United States dollar
3BIS Review 42/2000(also 27 per cent) and the British pound (31 per cent), and very substantially smaller than thatexperienced by the Japanese yen (62 per cent). In other words, as I have indicated on other occasionsand contrary to much current mythology, the big exchange rate swings experienced by the NewZealand dollar during the nineties were not in the least unusual by the standards of other currencies.This suggests rather unambiguously that, while currency union would eliminate nominal exchange rateuncertainty for New Zealand traders trading within the currency union, there is no currency which wecould adopt which would eliminate big exchange rate swings against countries outside the currencyunion. And since New Zealand’s trade with Australia amounts to little more than 20 per cent of thetotal, a currency union with Australia would still leave most of our exporters facing currencyuncertainty. In other words, currency union with Australia would buy nominal exchange rate certaintyfor those handling little more than 20 per cent of our trade (perhaps especially those in themanufacturing sector), while leaving those handling the other 80 per cent of our trade still facing suchuncertainty.And I say currency union would buy some traders “nominal exchange rate certainty” to make it clearthat currency union would not buy anybody real exchange rate certainty, or in other words, certaintyof a constant exchange rate after inflation has been taken into account. This is something which HongKong has discovered over the years. Although it has had a currency which has been tightly tied to theUS dollar since the early eighties, its real, or inflation-adjusted, exchange rate has appreciated quitestrongly, both because the US dollar has appreciated against most other currencies and because HongKong’s inflation rate has been markedly higher than that in the United States. This has led to thesteady erosion of the competitive position of Hong Kong’s manufacturing sector, and indeed has beenone of the factors leading to a move of manufacturing out of Hong Kong into southern China.The third myth is that a currency union with Australia would greatly increase competition in the NewZealand banking sector, to everybody’s benefit. I find it very hard to see why this might be the casegiven that all of the large Australian banks are already actively involved in the New Zealand market.Moreover, New Zealand already has an open and contestable banking sector. There are few regulatoryobstacles to foreign banks entering New Zealand, provided that they meet certain minimum qualitativecriteria. It is clearly not necessary to enter a currency union in order to derive the benefits of foreigncompetition in the banking sector. In this regard, I was struck by the figures released by KPMG earlierthis month, which suggested that the net interest margin earned by the major banks in New Zealandhas been falling steadily in recent years, and is now markedly lower than the net interest marginearned by Australian and US banks.1The fourth myth is that currency union with Australia would somehow suddenly enable the NewZealand economy to grow as quickly as the Australian economy, or enable New Zealanders to beinstantly richer. That perception appears to drive quite a lot of the public comment on this matter. Butof course that is nonsense. The fundamental driver of living standards in New Zealand is the rate atwhich we can improve productivity. Currency union may have a modest bearing on our productivityperformance, as I will argue in a moment, but fundamentally productivity is about the quality of oureducation system, the quality of New Zealand management, the incentives provided by the tax andbenefit system to work and acquire skills, attitudes to work and leisure, the pace of innovation, and soon. Currency union would have little effect on these matters. Currency union within Australia itselfhas certainly not guaranteed that economic growth in Tasmania and South Australia will match that inQueensland - any more than currency union within New Zealand has guaranteed that Southland willenjoy Auckland growth rates. And Panama’s adoption of the US dollar in 1904 has not enabledPanama to perform as well as the US economy. Other factors, and other policies, are very much moreimportant for our long-term growth than whether we are part of a currency union.And my final myth is the argument that, because other countries are forming currency unions, ordollarising, New Zealand should do the same. But the reasons why other countries are forming1Financial Institutions Performance Survey 2000, KPMG.
BIS Review 42/20004currency unions or dollarising have very little relevance to New Zealand. The countries of theEuropean Monetary Union formed a currency union, involving a new central bank and a new currency,in a situation where intra-union trade flows were a high proportion of the trade of most of the membercountries (certainly a much higher proportion than is the New Zealand/Australia situation), and wherecurrency union was simply one part of a very much wider agenda of political, economic, andregulatory integration. The countries of Latin America have, in some cases, locked themselves to theUS dollar, and in some cases are thinking of full US dollarisation, after decades of extremely poormoney management and hyper-inflation. Neither of these situations has any relevance to New Zealand.Moreover, in the last few years a large number of countries, particularly but not exclusively in Asia,have moved away from tying their currencies tightly to some other currency, in favour of a floatingexchange rate. Certainly there has not been a generalised international move towards currency unionor dollarisation.The real economic pros and cons of currency unionBut there are some valid arguments why a currency union might have economic advantages.To begin with, a currency union seems certain to reduce the transaction costs incurred now by tradersand travellers exchanging New Zealand dollars for other currencies. This would probably not producea huge saving in a currency union with Australia - although there would be worthwhile benefits fortourists in both directions - but, because so much international trade is conducted in US dollars, thesavings would be rather greater if we were to adopt the US dollar as our own currency.Second, a currency union with Australia might reduce average New Zealand interest rates a little. Overthe last decade or so, Australian long-term interest rates have been pretty similar to those in NewZealand, but for much of that period (though not currently) Australia’s short-term interest rates wereappreciably lower than those in New Zealand. Adopting the US dollar would currently reduce interestrates in New Zealand by rather more. Although the differences are much less now than they were adecade ago, US interest rates are currently lower across the entire range of maturities than those inNew Zealand. By adopting either the Australian dollar or the US dollar, we would avoid the need topay the currency risk premium which savers currently demand for holding New Zealand dollar assets.(There could well be on-going differences in interest rates between New Zealand on the one hand andAustralia or the United States on the other, of course, arising from credit and liquidity risks, but thedifferences would be smaller than currently.)But it is also the case that a currency union would remove any chance of New Zealand interest ratesfalling below those in Australia (or the United States, if it was the US dollar we adopted). While itmight seem unlikely that New Zealand interest rates would ever fall below those in Australia and theUnited States, it is worth recalling that New Zealand’s long-term interest rates were somewhat lowerthan those in Australia through the first half of the nineties and slightly lower than those in the UnitedStates for a time in 1994; and that most interest rates in Canada, Singapore, Switzerland and theEuropean Monetary Union are below those in the United States today.The main reason why New Zealand interest rates have been so high in the last decade is that throughmuch of that period we have been coping with the hang-over of high inflationary expectations,especially in the property market, the result of two or three decades of high inflation bingeing. TheUnited States had very high interest rates in the early eighties, as it grappled with high inflationaryexpectations. If New Zealand continues to keep inflation well under control, and continues to maintainthe confidence of financial markets by following a prudent fiscal policy, it seems entirely reasonableto expect that in time New Zealand interest rates could fall below those in both Australia and theUnited States. In forming a currency union, we would in effect be betting that, no matter with whomwe formed that currency union, their policy performance would be better than our own could havebeen for the indefinite future.Third, while currency union, with Australia or any other single country, would not eliminate theexchange rate uncertainty which New Zealand exporters face, it would clearly eliminate the nominalexchange rate uncertainty for trade with the country or countries forming part of the currency union
5BIS Review 42/2000(and probably reduce the real exchange rate uncertainty also). As indicated earlier, a currency unionwith Australia would eliminate nominal exchange rate uncertainty on only a relatively small part ofour total trade, but it is quite an important part of our trade in a qualitative sense. A much larger part ofour manufactured exports go to Australia than to any other single destination, and the Australianmarket is particularly important as a “testing ground” for small companies just getting into thebusiness of exporting.As a result of this reduction in exchange rate uncertainty within the currency union, it seems verylikely that currency union would stimulate trade with other parts of the currency union. Empiricalresearch on the effects of currency uncertainty on trade is, unfortunately, not very conclusive, withsome studies suggesting that the effects of currency uncertainty are actually pretty small and otherssuggesting that they are quite significant. My own rather subjective view is that a currency unionwould indeed increase trade between New Zealand and other parts of the union, and that seems to bethe view of the business community also. If that is correct, then a currency union, with Australia or theUnited States, would stimulate trade within the currency union, and to that extent could produce someworthwhile productivity gains, as New Zealand producers moved into areas of greatest comparativeadvantage. This is probably particularly true of a currency union with the United States. There isalready substantial trans-Tasman trade, and for that reason arguably less scope for increasing itthrough the creation of a currency union.On the other side of the ledger, there would be one potentially major and one more minor disadvantageof a currency union.The potentially major disadvantage would be the loss of an independent monetary policy, and henceloss of a very important way of moderating demand shocks and of any ability to influence our owninflation rate. And this loss would seem to apply whether the currency union was with Australia or theUnited States, and whether it involved the creation of a new central bank (possible in the case ofAustralia) or simply dollarisation. (Clearly, in the event of New Zealand’s entering a formal currencyunion with Australia, involving a new central bank with representatives from both countries and a newcurrency, New Zealand would have some say in the formulation of monetary policy, but realisticallythat say could only ever be a small voice alongside the much larger voice of the Australian economy.)Views will differ on how important that loss would be. But we can see from recent internationalexperience that the loss can have very substantial and sometimes very adverse implications. And thoseimplications would potentially be more significant if we were to form a currency union with theUnited States than if we were to form a currency union with Australia, given the broad similaritybetween the New Zealand and Australian economies.There seems little doubt that the fact that Argentina has had a more prolonged recession over the lastfew years than have some of the other major countries of Latin America has been largely a result ofthe fact that Argentina has been tightly tied to the United States dollar through its currency boardarrangement. As a consequence, the Argentine currency has been pushed upwards, along with the USdollar, against the currencies of many of Argentina’s trading partners. Similarly, Hong Kong seems tohave had a more prolonged recession than many other Asian economies for the same sort of reason.(Interestingly, during the nineties the trade-weighted real appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, tiedtightly to the US dollar, was much greater than the maximum appreciation of the New Zealand dollarduring the nineties.) Conversely, it seems clear that within the European Monetary Union some of thesmaller economies such as Ireland have been over-heating rather dramatically recently, with monetarypolicy determined by the new European Central Bank in the interests of the whole currency unionalmost certainly too easy for those smaller economies. While that may create prosperity in theshort-term, it may create considerable difficulties down the road.I well recall the mid-nineties, when the most common complaint I encountered speaking to audiencesoutside Auckland was that they were suffering from high real interest rates and a rising real exchangerate even though there was no inflation (so at least it was claimed!) in those areas, the only inflationbeing confined to Auckland. Even had these claims been true, the reality was that all parts of NewZealand formed then, and still form, a currency union, and there is only room for one interest ratestructure and one exchange rate within a currency union. Were we to join Australia in a currency
BIS Review 42/20006union, our interest rates and the exchange rate we faced would be influenced by the common centralbank (in the case of a genuine currency union), or by the Reserve Bank of Australia (in the case ofAustralian dollarisation). In practice, it would be the needs of the Australian economy which woulddominate the monetary policy decisions in either case. And of course, adopting the US dollar wouldmean accepting whatever monetary policy seemed appropriate for the US economy.This would probably tend to increase the magnitude of New Zealand business cycles, and thevariability of New Zealand’s inflation rate. With no ability to use New Zealand monetary policy todeal with these cycles, it would be necessary to use fiscal policy more actively, and to encourage moreflexibility, both up and down, in prices and wages, to moderate these cycles.The minor disadvantage of dollarising, and at this point I need to make a distinction betweendollarising and forming a currency union where a new currency is established for the countriesforming part of the union, would be the loss of what central bankers call seigniorage income. This isthe income which a central bank generates by issuing little pieces of paper, or in our case little piecesof plastic, and calling them money. What happens is that we issue these little pieces of plastic inexchange for good value, and we invest that value in government securities at the going marketinterest rate. The interest income earned is called seigniorage income, and in New Zealand it amountsto about $130 million each year (a currency on issue of a little over $2 billion, invested in governmentsecurities to yield somewhat over 6 per cent per annum). If we were to join a currency union modelledon the European Monetary Union, we would retain a share of the seigniorage income appropriate toour relative size in the new currency union. But if we were simply to adopt the Australian dollar or theUS dollar, it is very likely that we would lose the benefit of that income to the country whose currencywe adopted. Not a huge loss perhaps, but $130 million each year, growing gradually, should not begiven away without some thought!How to weight the pros and cons?As I indicated at the commencement of my comments, joining a currency union, or adopting thecurrency of another country, has potentially important implications which go well beyond economicissues. But even focusing on the economic issues, weighting the various pros and cons is not easy.It is sobering to note that Canada, a country doing almost 80 per cent of its trade with the UnitedStates, has nevertheless chosen to retain its own currency. And a recent article by a senior economist atthe Bank of Canada argued that, given the way in which Canada’s terms of trade behave relative tothose of the United States, having a separate Canadian currency was very much in Canada’s nationalinterest.2It seems clear from the survey conducted for the Holmes/Grimes study by the National Bank of NewZealand that a substantial majority of the New Zealand business community - or at very least asubstantial majority of those who responded to the survey - are in favour of a currency union withAustralia.But I am not myself entirely sure what to make of this strong support for currency union withAustralia. Of course businesses are in favour of less currency uncertainty. I suspect if the businesscommunity were asked if they were in favour of lower taxation they would also register a stronglyfavourable reaction. The real question is not whether less currency uncertainty would be helpful butwhether less currency uncertainty would compensate for the costs of a currency union, such as therisks of greater variability in output and domestic inflation. And the answer to that question is muchless clear.To illustrate, let’s suppose there is a sharp fall in New Zealand export prices. With our own currency,this is quite likely to lead to a fall in the New Zealand dollar, as it did in the second half of 1997 and2Murray, John (1999), “Why Canada needs a flexible exchange rate”, Bank of Canada working paper 99-12.
7BIS Review 42/20001998. This fall in the currency cushions New Zealand exporters to some extent from the adverseimpact of the fall in world commodity prices, effectively by spreading the “pain” of that fall across therest of us, who find that our New Zealand dollars can now buy fewer imports than before. Without ourown currency, on the other hand, there is an increased risk that a fall in New Zealand export pricesleads to no fall in our (new) currency, our exporters have to suffer the full pain of the fall ininternational prices, and may well be forced to lay off staff and reduce output. That has an indirecteffect, of course, on the rest of the country, but those who are not closely associated with the exportindustries may be relatively little affected.In the final analysis, the choice of exchange rate regime is mainly a choice about the nature of thepain we prefer to experience as a consequence of international shocks. It does not provide anopportunity to escape the pain inevitably caused by those shocks.ConclusionIt would be nice to conclude my comments today with a clear conclusion, or an on-balance judgement.I don’t propose to do that, partly because the decision about currency regime is, as I have indicated,finally a matter for elected politicians not for central bankers, and partly because even the economicpros and cons do not point to a clear conclusion.Moreover, it may well be appropriate to widen the range of options somewhat, and to think morelaterally before we reach any conclusions at all. For example, might it be possible to negotiate acomprehensive free trade agreement with the United States as part of a package involving our adoptionof the US dollar and surrender of the relevant seigniorage income? Losing the seigniorage incomemight well be a worthwhile concession in return for a free trade agreement with the US.Clearly, there are lots of potential options. There can be little doubt that this issue will be a matter forpublic discussion and debate for a considerable time to come. I believe the Reserve Bank has alreadymade a constructive contribution to that discussion, through the publication of a number of papersrelevant to the issue.But it is crystal clear that currency union is not a magic path to substantially faster New Zealandgrowth. It is no substitute for domestic policies that promote stronger productivity growth. It is not anissue which should be decided in haste. And it is not an issue on which the Reserve Bank will betaking sides. Anybody who accuses me of promoting a currency union, or for that matter of opposing acurrency union, has not read this speech!
1BIS Review 41/2000Gordon Thiessen: The economic situation in Canadaand the prospects for inflationOpening Statement by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, before the House ofCommons Standing Committee on Finance, Ottawa, on 16 May 2000.*      *      *Mr Chairman, and members of the Committee: it is always a pleasure to appear before you. Sinceother Parliamentary business precluded my appearance before you last fall, I especially welcome thisopportunity to discuss the economic situation in Canada and the prospects for inflation.Last week, we released our 11th Monetary Policy Report. Since our November Report, the Canadianeconomy has outperformed expectations. Bolstered by vigorous external and domestic demand,Canada’s economic expansion strengthened in the second half of 1999 and into early 2000.The buoyant US economic picture, combined with Canada’s high levels of business investment andsolid employment gains, augurs well for continued strong growth in Canada. Given the strongmomentum of demand, the Bank of Canada has raised its projection for growth in 2000 to a range of4 to 4.5%.The trend of inflation in Canada over the past six months has been lower than expected and is amongthe lowest in the industrial countries. Nevertheless, pressures on capacity will likely intensify throughthe year. Consequently, we expect the trend of inflation, as measured by the consumer price indexexcluding food, energy, and indirect taxes, to rise gradually to close to the middle of our 1 to 3%inflation-control target range. To keep this core rate of inflation steady near 2%, some deceleration ineconomic expansion or a more rapid increase in productivity and production capacity will be requiredduring 2001.When it comes to the production capacity of the economy, there is currently even more uncertaintythan usual. The lower-than-expected rate of core inflation would suggest that conventional measuresmay be underestimating the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services without adding toinflationary pressures. While the conditions that would permit an increase in productivity growth andin capacity have improved substantially in recent years, there has so far been no significant hardevidence of such an increase. This makes judging the balance between aggregate demand and supplyin the economy an even greater challenge than usual for monetary policy.The other main risks to Canada’s economic outlook include the possibility that the momentum ofaggregate demand from the US economy will continue to be stronger than expected and the likelihoodof a buildup of inflationary pressures in the United States spilling over into Canada. The US economyhas continued to steam ahead. There is a clear need for the pace of expansion in the United States toslow as we progress through this year and into 2001.Prudent monetary management dictates that we in Canada do not underestimate the upside risks forinflation, especially given the strong growth of aggregate demand in Canada, the United States, andelsewhere. Because of a lag of some 18 to 24 months in the effect of monetary policy on prices, theBank is always trying to anticipate inflationary pressures one to two years ahead.Productivity growth is the only way to achieve long-term gains in incomes and living standards. Thetechnological revolution that is currently sweeping the world provides Canada with a goldenopportunity to improve its productivity. The best contribution monetary policy can make to enhancingproductivity is to provide a low-inflation environment. Low and stable inflation reduces uncertaintyabout future price movements, lowers the incidence of boom-and-bust cycles in the economy, andhelps keep interest rates down. All of this encourages investment in the equipment and softwareneeded to take advantage of the new technology.
BIS Review 41/20002Canada’s inflation-control target and the Bank’s commitment to maintaining that target, should ensurethat monetary policy fosters a climate conducive to continued improvement in the performance of oureconomy.
1BIS Review 41/2000Willem F Duisenberg: Congratulatory speech at theNational Bank of Belgium’s 150th anniversarySpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the officialcelebration of the 150th anniversary of the National Bank of Belgium, Brussels, on 12 May 2000.*      *      *It is a great honour to be invited to speak at this official celebration of the 150th anniversary of theNational Bank of Belgium (the Bank). Before I say anything else, let me first congratulate the Bank onreaching this milestone in its history and allow me to congratulate in particular all those whose workand dedication have ensured its place as a successful and well respected central bank.As we have heard from Prime Minister Verhofstadt, the Bank enjoys a rich and extensive history,which dates back almost as far as the state of Belgium itself and during which time it has contributedgreatly to the development of the Belgian economy. It is also a time in which the tasks andresponsibilities of central banks have evolved to such an extent that they bear little resemblance tothose of a century and half ago.Since then historical, political and technological developments as well as advances in economic theoryhave caused the role of the central bank to evolve and mature. They have also, almost invariably,increased its importance. Of these changes one might first mention the economic consequences of warand of the Great Depression, which focused the minds of economic thinkers and governments on therole that macroeconomic policies should play in achieving higher levels of economic growth andwelfare. Second, the end of the economic boom and the rise of inflation in the 1970s increased ourawareness of the importance of sound money and the need for monetary policy to be aimed atmaintaining price stability. Third, the disinflation process that followed served to emphasise thebenefits of conferring responsibility for this policy upon an independent central bank. However,among those developments that have most influenced the role of Europe’s central banks in recentdecades, there is one which stands out as being pivotal. I am referring, of course, to EuropeanEconomic and Monetary Union (EMU).It is now more than 30 years since the Werner Report first proposed a framework for replacingEurope’s national currencies with a single European currency, more than 20 years since theestablishment of the European Monetary System (EMS) and nearly 10 years since the signing of theMaastricht Treaty, which committed EU Member States to achieving Monetary Union. In that time,the efforts of Europe’s politicians and central bankers have confounded many sceptics by making theeuro an economic and political reality.Clearly, the transition to a single currency did not take place in a vacuum. On the contrary, a numberof factors shaped the path towards EMU. Some of these factors had a positive impact. I am referringhere, in particular, to the remarkable progress that has taken place in establishing a climate of stableprices throughout the European Union. This development undoubtedly reflects the consensus that nowexists among central bankers and politicians alike, concerning the appropriate role of monetary policyin the general conduct of economic policy. Also, one should not forget the dramatic events of 1989,which not only led to German unification and the fall of the Iron Curtain but also redefined theparameters of the economic and political environment in Europe.Yet there were also other factors which, had it not been for the determination of those committed toEMU, could have significantly delayed or even derailed the whole process. Of these, the EMS crisis of1992-93 immediately springs to mind. As a result of this crisis, many of those who already doubtedthe feasibility of EMU became increasingly sceptical as to whether we would actually achieve ourstated goal. Thus when we consider the events of the last decade in particular, we must appreciate that
BIS Review 41/20002the driving force towards the introduction of a single currency was, above all, the political will of theactors involved. In this regard, Belgium’s politicians and its central bankers should be congratulatedon the commitment that kept their country at the forefront of the integration process.This commitment could and still can be seen at various levels. At the political level, the policiespursued both by the Government and by the Bank ensured that the Belgian franc became a stabilisingforce in the EMS and that Belgium was ready to be a founding member of the euro area. Thisachievement owes a great deal to the efforts of many persons. I can only mention a few of them, suchas former Prime Minister Dehaene, the former Governors Verplaetse and Godeaux, and the presentGovernor Quaden, who is often seen as Mr. Euro here in Belgium. Equally, sometimes behind thescenes, I should recall the dedication of persons both from the Treasury and from the Bank for theircontributions to Monetary Union. Among them I should like to single out two individuals. The first isJacques van Ypersele de Strihou who, as President of the Monetary Committee at the end of the1970s, played a particularly important role in the design and establishment of the EMS (small wonder,if you realise that we shared a room as junior economists at the International Monetary Fund inWashington, D.C. in the mid-sixties). The second is Jean-Jacques Rey who made two especiallyimportant contributions: first, as President of the Committee of Alternates of Central Bank Governorsat the time the EMU Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated and, second, as Chairman of theMonetary Policy Sub-committee of the EMI, which developed the operational framework for theimplementation of the single monetary policy which has worked so well since January 1999. Let mefinally mention Alexandre Lamfalussy who, as the first President of the European Monetary Institute,played a key role in the process towards EMU. Without such figures, EMU would never have becomea reality. Since January last year, the euro is a reality. The launch of the euro has been successful.Inflation is low. Economic growth is robust in a climate of price stability. My message to you today isclear. The internal stability of the euro will be maintained. The people, also here in Belgium, can beconfident that their savings and pensions will keep their value over time. This internal stability willhelp to turn the current upswing into a long period of high economic growth and fallingunemployment. Based on price stability and the strength of the euro area economy, the future of theeuro is that of a strong currency.It is often the case that the achievement of past objectives paves the way to new and excitingchallenges. And so it is now for the Bank, which, along with the other national central banks (NCBs)of the euro area and the European Central Bank, has a new role to fulfil as part of the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB) and of the Eurosystem. The importance of this role should not beunderestimated.The Eurosystem operates in a decentralised manner. The single monetary policy could not therefore besuccessful without the essential work carried out by the NCBs of which the Eurosystem is primarilycomprised. In the implementation of monetary policy, the performance of operations by the NCBsensures that the Eurosystem benefits from their extensive operational experience as well as thecontacts built up with the credit institutions operating in their domestic financial markets. In thisrespect, the activities of the Bank are, and will surely continue to be, at least as extensive as they werebefore.As a part of the Eurosystem, the Bank has, of course, maintained a number of importantresponsibilities and has also acquired a number of new, shared competencies. In this regard I shouldmention the important role of the Bank which stems from its participation in the various specialisedESCB Committees. These Committees, which are composed of experts from the NCBs and from theECB, provide expertise in their fields of competence and greatly facilitate the decision-making processof the Eurosystem. As a result, the Bank, along with the other NCBs of the Eurosystem, contributesgreatly to the development of common positions and shared standpoints on a comprehensive range ofissues that are of interest to the Eurosystem.However, in my view, the Bank’s newest and most challenging role results from its involvement in theformulation of the Eurosystem’s policies. Previously, the Bank was the sole monetary authority of animportant but nonetheless relatively small national economy. Now it forms part of a wider institution
3BIS Review 41/2000which is responsible for conducting the monetary policy of an economic area comparable in size to theUnited States.This new role necessitates an increasingly European and international orientation: a Europeanorientation because the Governor of the Bank participates in meetings of the Governing Council as anindividual who is bound to act in the interests of the euro area as a whole, rather than as arepresentative of a single Member State. As a result, the research and analysis carried out in the Bankhas no doubt shifted its focus to an even greater extent than before towards euro area-widedevelopments. The international orientation stems from the fact that the euro is the world’s secondmost important currency, making the Eurosystem an important player on the international stage.I should not, however, dwell further on this, or on any of the Bank’s other current and future activities,as I understand that Governor Quaden intends to speak about such matters and is much better placed todo so than I. Let me therefore finish by once again congratulating the Bank on its 150th anniversary,by expressing my gratitude to all those who have dedicated their time and effort to the achievement ofMonetary Union and, finally, by wishing the Bank another 150 successful years and more as part ofthe Eurosystem.
1BIS Review 40/2000Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Economic policy forour era - the Ohio experienceRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the Cleveland Millennium Conference 2000, held in Cleveland, on 11 May 2000.*      *      *What makes an economy world-class?A world-class economy, as I understand the term, is an economy that successfully competes at theinternational level. I doubt whether there are many places in this nation that have as clear a perspectiveon the world economy as does northeast Ohio. One-quarter of the nation’s manufacturing output isproduced in an area that lies within a half day’s drive from Cleveland. The region generates more than40% of the nation’s transportation equipment, 30% of its industrial machinery, and 44% of its metals -industries that make up an important part of the nation’s re-energized trade sector. Consider thatOhioans exported more than $2,200 in merchandise per person in 1997. About one in four dollars ofmetalworking machinery production, of which this region is a major contributor, was exported. Steelmill producers in Ohio - another of your revitalized industries - have more than doubled their exportvolumes since the mid-1980s. And in the transportation equipment industry, the foreign-owned Hondaassembly plant in Marysville, Ohio, which produced roughly half a million cars in 1998, is the largestautomobile assembly plant in North America.Today, I would like to offer some observations, from the perspective of a policymaker, on the eventsthat have already transformed much of the national and regional economies and that are continuing toreshape business around the globe. Specifically, I want to reflect on the changing role of economicpolicy in our current environment of rapidly improving communications and expanding markets. Tosustain the gains that this region and other regions have made in the past decade and to best ensure ourcontinued global competitiveness, we need to fashion economic policy that, above all else, helps tofacilitate communication through efficient and effective markets.Recent economic developmentsThe national economy is enjoying an impressive period of prosperity. National income, after adjustingfor inflation, has grown about one-third since 1991 - or by about 3½% per year. US joblessness hasfallen to a level not seen in thirty years, and wealth is being created at a pace rarely seen.Growth in this region has been even more impressive. On a per capita basis, Ohioans have seen 5%more income growth than the nation during the past eight years. Economic strength is also reflected inlocal labor market indicators. After many years of sub-par performance, and occasional periods ofoutright decline, the net growth of jobs in the region has kept pace with the exceptional US average.Even more telling has been the remarkable pattern of the local unemployment rate. After averagingmore than 1 percentage point above the national average in the 1980s, joblessness in the Clevelandarea fell under the US average in 1990 and has remained at, or below, the national benchmark everyyear since.The recent prosperity of the region reverses the previous twelve-year period of economic declinerelative to the nation in a rather dramatic way. This decline, not so flatteringly referred to by some asthe “rust-bowl era”, took its toll on labor and business alike. After peaking in the early-1970s, thepopulation of the six county area surrounding and including Cuyahoga County declined annually fornearly two straight decades. But since 1990, more families have been arriving than leaving, which canbe due only to this area’s rejuvenated economy.What accounts for this remarkable reversal in economic fortune? As I have said recently, on thenational level, and in this region as well, the dominant force of late appears to have been a significant
BIS Review 40/20002upshift in the rate of productivity growth. Having increased 1.6% per year from 1990 to 1995, outputper hour in the non-farm business sector - a conventional measure of productivity - has risen at anannual pace of about 2.6% since 1995. Cyclical forces - such as the inability of businesses to add totheir payrolls as rapidly as they would have liked in response to the rise in demand - have probablyplayed some role in these efficiency gains. But I suspect that longer-term, structural changes,reflecting the boom in capital spending and the revolution in information technology, probably havebeen more important. Through this increase in productivity, our national economy has successfullyprepared itself to take advantage of the rapid globalization that has characterized the current economicexpansion.While private decisions rightly deserve primacy in any discussion of the current economic climate,they were taken against the backdrop of important policy decisions. I believe that this productivityincrease might not have occurred were it not for the policy adjustments that were made starting in thelate 1970s and continuing even today. Furthermore, the opening of many nations’ economies to ourgoods and services reflects, in my judgment, the fact that the world’s policymakers have, in general,abandoned the economic policies that were found to be counterproductive. In the end, free trade,deregulation, sound fiscal policy, and sound monetary policy have all played a role in the strength ofthe US economy. These same factors are emerging as equally important in other economies.Economic prosperity, trade and global integrationIn economics, nothing is more fundamental than trade. Trade allows us individually, and as a nation,to devote our scarce resources to their most advantageous uses and then exchange our products withothers to satisfy our diverse preferences. This process allows specialization, and it is what gives rise tothe existence of markets. The lifeblood of trade is communication. Communication allows us to findthe most profitable outlets for our products and suppliers for our needs and wants. The greater ourcapacity to communicate, the greater our ability to specialize, the broader our expanse of markets, andthe more prosperous we become. These are not new ideas. They have been our understanding of hownations become wealthy since being described by Adam Smith more than two hundred years ago.Today, we are experiencing a great technological revolution - a communications revolution. Theproliferation of microprocessors and other innovations of the past several decades has dramaticallylowered the costs of getting and transmitting information. Predictably, the new communicationstechnology has brought with it a growth of new markets. This great expansion of markets has allowedthe US economy to improve its allocation of resources by shifting them to their most internationallycompetitive uses. It also seems probable that these new communications technologies have broughtgreater openness in global markets by helping us to break down the complex and unproductivenetwork of artificial trade barriers that characterized much of the previous century.The role of international trade and finance in bringing renewed prosperity in the past decade to theeconomy of Ohio is noteworthy. From 1987 to 1997, Ohio’s exports grew 60% faster than exportsoverall in the United States - and US export growth was very strong indeed. By 1997, the state hadjumped from being the eleventh highest export state to being the seventh. And in 1996, the Clevelandarea ranked twenty-third in the top seventy export communities in the nation.This region’s influence in the world economy appears to be still growing as its capital base expands.Data from the US Bureau of the Census indicate that, between 1982 and 1996, the amount of newcapital added in Ohio industry grew as a share of all US capital additions. Specifically, while USindustry was adding about 4¼% per year to its stock of industrial capital, Ohio was adding capital toits industry at a 5% clip.In 1998 and 1999, slightly more than 2,100 new major projects were begun in Ohio, which puts thestate among the top five states in attracting and expanding business. Moreover, about 6% of thesebusiness expansions were financed by foreign investors, of which slightly more than one-third wereAsian investors and about one-half were European. The Ohio Department of Development estimatesthat 851 foreign-owned corporations provided only slightly less than one in twenty jobs in the statelast year. Almost 75% of the foreign establishments were in the manufacturing sector, where trade
3BIS Review 40/2000opportunities have been the greatest. And the single largest regional concentration of foreign-ownedbusinesses in the state was in Cuyahoga County, with 145 establishments.What has this investment wrought? Today, output per hour in the region’s manufacturing sector ishardly reminiscent of the economy of fifteen years ago. In industrial machinery manufacturing, forexample, new capital expenditures almost doubled between 1987 and 1996, well in excess of thenational average. At the same time, the productivity of Ohio industrial machinery workers jumpedfrom more than 10% below the national average to more than 10% above the national average. Thisstory can be repeated for a number of industries throughout the region.The cost of growthEconomic transformation has not come without cost. Between 1977 and 1987, US industry reducedproduction jobs in manufacturing by 1.4 million workers. More than 200,000 - or 15% - of those jobswere in Ohio. Of those job losses, over half were centered in two industries - primary metalsmanufacturing and industrial machinery manufacturing - each losing more than 50,000 jobs over thedecade.In fact, the region’s new competitiveness could probably not have occurred were it not for thedramatic changes this area’s economy experienced in the 1980s. Is economic progress possible thatdoes not make obsolete the methods and practices of the earlier, less efficient economy? In his 1950book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, economist Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as asystem “that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying theold one, incessantly creating a new one.” Schumpeter saw that economies continually bounce fromone growth path to another, all the time remaking themselves. He coined the phrase “creativedestruction” to describe this process.Simply put, economies are constantly under competitive pressure to re-invent themselves. As theymove toward higher levels of productivity, they necessarily make other production technologiesobsolete. Schumpeter cautioned that economic policymakers who fail to appreciate the relationshipbetween the relentless churning of the competitive environment and wealth creation will end upfocusing their efforts on the methods and skills that are in decline. In so doing, they establish policiesthat are aimed at protecting weak, outdated technologies, and in the end, they slow the economy’smarch forward.In retrospect, we can tell that some economic policies of the past century have inadvertently, or insome cases intentionally, done just that. They have had the effect of directing or misdirectingeconomic growth by either substituting policymakers’ judgment regarding the distribution of aneconomy’s assets for the combined wisdom of individuals or allowing markets to send false signals. Inthe long run, such policies were destined to fail.The economic policies of the last centuryA very broad reading of economic history reveals that policymakers in many countries during the lastcentury attempted to manipulate trade and other forms of economic activity by altering, artificially, themeasures of value, that is, prices. One such policy followed by some countries during the last centurywas known as the “beggar thy neighbor” policy, the manipulation of the exchange rate in order toboost a country’s exports. Trade restrictions were also often used to protect domestic industries fromimports. A final example from the international sphere is the system of global fixed exchange ratesthat emerged following the Second World War. To blunt market forces, fixed exchange rates wereusually accompanied by capital controls that tried to manage the inflows - and more importantly theoutflows - of a nation’s investment funds. Ultimately, this system of global fixed exchange ratesworked poorly and could not withstand the market forces that emerged in the 1970s.In a similar spirit, some economies used taxes or other incentives to promote one industrial activity ordiscourage another. Obviously, the most egregious form of this policy was in planned economies. Butmany democratic economies, as they recovered from various wars and other national traumas,
BIS Review 40/20004nationalized entire industries. In our society, we never found that degree of government interventionappropriate, but we did regulate some business decisions for certain industries, such as electric powerdistribution and airlines, attempting to overcome the “natural monopoly” or “excessive competition”characteristics perceived in these industries.Finally, some central banks in the past engaged in policies that artificially altered the path of domesticprices in their effort to regulate their business cycles. If the monetary authority wanted more growthabove trend, it lowered money-market interest rates by expanding the stock of money. Such policieswere expected to bolster demand and encourage an acceleration of growth. There was themisunderstanding that somehow a long-run tradeoff existed between inflation and unemployment. Butit gradually became understood that inflation eroded investor and consumer confidence and distortedbehavior, both because the average of prices gave a constantly depreciating reading of the values itwas supposed to represent and because relative prices provided an inaccurate reflection of comparativeworth. Monetary policies that intended to create growth through the inflation of prices ended upimpeding markets and reducing economic prosperity. We now know that there is no long-run tradeoffbetween inflation and unemployment. The US experience of the last several years has also taught usthat low and stable inflation is the underpinning for sustainable growth and that sustainable growthfosters the maximum creation of jobs over time.Emergence of the communications eraIn recent decades, trade restrictions, “beggar thy neighbor” policies, and the pursuit of a supposedlong-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment have all been called into question andgenerally rejected. In part because of the communications revolution and the substantially reducedcosts of transacting from great distances, businesses have sought more globally integrated productionprocesses, and investors have required the development of financial instruments to facilitate theirdemand for international portfolio diversification. Such developments have put enormous pressure onpolicymakers to loosen their grip or abandon policies that led to the misallocation of resources. Tariffshave been reduced, and restrictions on the flow of goods have been eased. Controls on the flow ofinvestment capital have been eliminated in most industrialized countries, and they are rapidly comingdown in many developing nations as well. In some cases, these changes were more or less forced uponthe nations that adopted them. But in many instances the policies have been liberalized because of therealization that markets allocate resources more effectively than governments.Trade is flourishing, gaining great momentum in the ten years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Totaltrade with foreigners now accounts for about one-quarter of total US national output - more than twicethe share of the period between 1920 and 1970 and the largest trade share for the US economy in morethan a century. Not coincidentally, the economy has been expanding at a strong and steady rate.In addition, our economy has benefited from past actions by the government to deregulate industries.The removal of unnecessary government regulation started more than twenty years ago, during theadministration of President Ford, and gathered momentum during the Carter years. It has altered thebusiness landscape. Deregulation allowed, indeed forced, businesses to focus more clearly on amarketplace that has become more competitive, with fewer constraints and increased flexibility.If economic policy is to play a constructive role in building a new world economy, policymakers mustincreasingly focus on policies that eliminate barriers to communication and allow the market to workmost efficiently and effectively. They must develop approaches that do not hinder “creativedestruction” but appropriately cushion its impact on workers and communities. They can encouragethe information revolution by fostering policies and approaches conducive to giving investors andconsumers the information they require to make informed decisions. For example, the Federal Reserveand the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have strongly supported initiatives to improve thequality of national and international disclosure practices. Credible financial statements and otherdisclosures are key means for communicating a company’s operating results and its overall health, aswell as for making more transparent various operating activities.
5BIS Review 40/2000Regarding monetary policy, central banks around the world are now endeavoring to provide stabilityto their domestic price levels. In some cases, this focus on price stability was undertaken in order toreturn credibility to the central bank after a period of unacceptable inflationary pressures.The Federal Reserve, with our mandate, must also seek to facilitate the transmission of the informationthat the price level is meant to convey. By maintaining a stable purchasing power for money, workersand firms will more clearly see the values being attached to their opportunities and more effectivelymake judgments about the allocation of their resources. This is a monetary policy that does not attemptto alter the information being transmitted by the marketplace but to increase its clarity andconsistency.The increased openness of Federal Reserve decisions - reflected in announcement policies aimed atmore rapid and transparent dissemination of Federal Open Market Committee decisions - also needs tobe appreciated as a way to facilitate the communication to and within the marketplace in order topromote the most effective policy possible.Policies for a communications era - a local perspectiveThis perspective on economic policy extends beyond the establishment of the national monetarypolicy that occupies much of my time. A popular bumper sticker says, “Think Globally, Act Locally.”Good advice. Indeed, this simple maxim describes one of the great strengths of the Federal ReserveSystem. Although many tend to think of the Federal Reserve as a Washington-centric institution, it is,in fact, a structure of twelve independent regional Reserve Banks, one of which is just a few blocksfrom here, teamed in harness with the Board of Governors in Washington. Reserve Banks have alwayshad an important role in channeling regional economic information into the deliberations of nationaleconomic policy. Today, they take those responsibilities a step further.In closing, let me give a few examples of some of the local programs that are conceived in this spirit.The latest data from the US Census Bureau indicate that Cleveland and Northeast Ohio lag behindother metropolitan areas in small business growth. Linked by a desire to improve the success rate ofsmall business, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the US Small Business Association, and theGreater Cleveland Growth Association’s Council of Smaller Enterprises in 1997 started the Access toCapital Initiative.The purpose of the initiative was to narrow the gap between the need for and the availability of startupand expansion capital in Northeast Ohio. This collaborative, comprehensive approach to identifyinggaps and barriers to capital access and developing a strategic, community-based plan to address thosedeficiencies has led to the creation of the Access to Capital Network. The network will be an umbrellaorganization that will link small and midsize businesses to the region’s provider of capital andbusiness assistance, primarily through an easy-to-use, interactive software system available free at itsweb site.The Cleveland Reserve Bank has also worked with community organizations throughout the FourthFederal Reserve District to develop resources to promote microenterprise. Microenterprises are verysmall businesses of less than five employees. These businesses can potentially grow and make greatercontributions to the local economy if they can find the capital to do so and if they have adequateaccess to the technical advice that is often provided to them by community-based organizations. TheCleveland Fed provides technical expertise to these community-based organizations and helps themestablish partnerships with financial institutions and other community stakeholders.These are not policies that hope to provide preferential access to financial markets, and they are notdirected at particular enterprises. Instead, they are designed to provide the forums, contacts, and skillsets necessary to form the relationships that facilitate business growth. More generally, the FederalReserve hopes to promote a better understanding among policymakers, community leaders, andprivate-sector decisionmakers about the resources that support successful economic development.
BIS Review 40/20006ConclusionAs an economic policymaker, I believe that “Building a World-Class Economy” isn’t at all abouttrying to manufacture various economic outcomes. Fortunately, most policymakers have come torecognize that their role in building world-class economies is to help develop the infrastructurethrough which people communicate. We need to provide the public with the tools that allow them tojudge value accurately and to see opportunities with the greatest clarity. Economic policy, includingmonetary policy, has to be an integral part of the communications revolution that is sweeping theworld. These are the policies appropriate for our era.
1BIS Review 79/2000Gazi Erçel: Globalization and international financial environmentRemarks by Mr Gazi Erçel, Governor of The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the GeneralMeeting of the 17th Asian Banking Association which was held in Istanbul on 22 September 2000.*      *      *I am honored to participate in this meaningful organization and I would like to thank you for theopportunity to address this distinguished audience today.I would like to begin with a quick review of the recent developments in the international financialenvironment, which I believe will give a clear idea why the issue of globalization is very crucial,interesting as well as challenging.Beginning with an evaluation of the recent financial crises, I will then concentrate on the growingimportance of globalization process and challenges brought by globalization.I.Developments in the international financial environmentThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed significant changes in the international financial markets.With the advent of globalization and rapid integration of financial markets, the world we live in isgetting smaller in every aspect of life. Nowadays, when international banking systems areexperiencing significant changes, banking is being discussed at a global level. Therefore, from theglobal standpoint, what seems to be important for banking systems is not the size, but the level ofcompliance with the internationally accepted rules and standards, and their functionality.In today’s financial environment, dominated by a dynamic, aggressive financial service industry,banks as major players operate with greater freedom. Market participants, however, are exposed togreater financial risks than before due to the appearance of more complex and dynamic transactionsthat have substantially increased uncertainties in the marketplace.Furthermore, there exists more universal banking today than in the past. Advances in IT technology,capital movements and geographical extension of banking business have become the new engines ofglobal integration.The increased awareness of risk concept, together with the higher living standards and rapidtechnological development, has led to substantial change in the hedging strategies.It certainly appears to be the case that the emergence of new markets, such as highly liquid foreignexchange and derivative markets, has provided essential financial transactions and contributed to therapid expansion of global finance. However, the speculative uses of the new financial instruments inthese markets have increased the diversity of risks. Consequently, the availability of a wider range offinancial instruments and deeper financial markets has enabled banks, non-bank financial institutions,institutional investors and companies to better manage their risks by using complex hedging strategies.II.GlobalizationIn this part of my speech, I will concentrate on the opportunities and challenges brought byglobalization.(A)Opportunities and challengesWe define globalization as more integrated financial markets, economies and trade, higher factormobility, and spectacular change in information technology leading to the spread of knowledge
BIS Review 79/20002throughout the world. I, personally, consider globalization to be both a beneficial and a challenging,inevitable, irreversible process for the world economy and the international financial system.Globalization and liberalization of financial markets bring a variety of changes, presentingopportunities as well as risks both in economies and financial systems throughout the world. One factis quite clear: the undeniable benefits of globalization are only available to the countries that bestmanage their economies.(1)One obvious benefit of globalization is that active international capital flows improve theefficiency of the allocation of world financial resources. As the world market economy hasbecome more globalized, we have witnessed rapid growth in world trade, leading to a higherstandard of living during the 1980s and 1990s. In plain language, competition, productivitygains, lower trade barriers and lower cost of external financing on a worldwide basis are thekey factors that have led to growth in world trade and rising standards of living.(2)Globalization also has increased and enhanced competition worldwide. There are severalfactors behind this consequence.(a)Firstly, the integration of world markets and rapid technological change led toefficiency gains and growth driven by the lower transaction and information costs.These in turn increased competition through lower costs and higher marketefficiency, higher productivity, lower barriers to entry, and new investmentopportunities. Geographic distance is no longer a factor that limits the provision ofgoods and services.Hence, competition both in the industrialized and developing countries hasreached almost the same level. At this point, it is worth noting that manydeveloping countries, particularly emerging market economies, have activelyparticipated in the world trade and global economy over the last two decades. Thepresence of emerging market countries, particularly the Asian economies, isgrowing, and their share in world trade has increased significantly.(b)Secondly, the importance of non-bank financial institutions in the financialintermediation process has increased. The main examples of these institutions aresecurities firms, insurance companies and mutual funds.Therefore, we can say that the higher the level of international competition, thehigher the economic growth, the higher the income level, the higher the quality ofproducts and thus the higher the living standards the globalization process wouldbring.(3)Globalization reorganized some concepts such as stabilization, risk-taking, supervision andregulation of banking systems, market discipline, public guaranty on deposit and moralhazard.As I mentioned earlier, parallel to the development of new financial instruments and marketsand the resultant more complex and dynamic transactions, risk measurement and riskmanagement techniques have changed dramatically. Financial institutions have increasinglybeen using internal rating and other risk measurement systems and models such as VAR,stress and back testing, and scenario analysis.As a result of these developments, every trading institution, including central banks, hasbecome more exposed to changes all over the world economies and financial markets.Indeed, the recent Asian financial crisis revealed that the financial and economic stability ofemerging market economies is extremely vital for global financial and economic stability.(4)Banking business and banking transactions have become very complex. Development of off-balance sheet transactions and derivative markets had an enormous impact on the banks’balance sheet structure, level and variety of risks to which they are exposed. Based on thesedevelopments, the importance of derivative instruments in banks’ risk profile has increased.
3BIS Review 79/2000(B)Risks arising from globalizationIf we evaluate the risks arising from globalization, we realize that there are losers as well as winners inthe process of globalization.It is a well-known fact that the process of globalization does not evolve equally worldwide. Somecountries obtain great benefit from the process, mainly driven by their rapid integration into the globaleconomy relative to other countries. In other words, the integrated global economy does not guaranteethat the benefits of globalization are shared by the all countries involved in the process.More importantly, opportunities provided by the globalization process are not always beneficial, asshown by the recent crises. Hence, the process of globalization always carries social, economic,financial, cultural and even political risks in addition to the risk of contagion.There are several reasons for this situation. Some of them are beyond the control of the countriesinvolved such as external shocks and other unexpected changes in external environment. Indeed, mostof these reasons are due to:• weak macroeconomic and financial policies implied;• inconsistencies in domestic policies;• increased vulnerability of national economies to external shocks;• higher international capital mobility (ie higher sensitivity of international capital flowsamong economies);• higher volatility of exchange rates due to integrated financial markets, which hits real sectorsof economies.As countries’ economies become more vulnerable to external changes, they are exposed to shocks andcrises with severe consequences both in financial and real sectors, as well as facing heavy social costs.In this context, I would like to emphasize the importance of the risk of contagion in highly integratedglobal financial environment. As we have all experienced, instability emerging in one country canspread almost instantly to other countries. There is no doubt that every country faces its ownchallenges that are directly affected by their particular economic and social conditions.Positions taken in one country are now being hedged in another and this so-called proxy hedging ofcountry risks spreads shocks and crises across national borders. As a result of this, even a country withno direct exposure to the country in crisis could find itself in deep trouble. In fact, the most recentcrises in East Asia and Russia have reminded us how rapidly and compellingly a financial crisis canerupt.At this point, I would like to briefly discuss the progress of Turkey, particularly the Turkish bankingsector in the globalization process.During the last two decades, the banking sector, which plays a prominent role in the Turkish financialsystem, has made significant progress in implementing structural changes towards a more financiallyliberalized Turkish economy. Combined with the effects of restructuring Turkish economy and theefforts for the integration to the modern world of finance, the Turkish banks achieved importantchanges in their institutional structures on the one hand, and in the quality of services and products onthe other.In this very outward-oriented and closely supervised banking environment, the need for highlyqualified managers and specialized personnel is obvious. With this in mind, Turkish Banks becamemore effective in their utilization of human resources. The number of university graduates andpostgraduates in the banking sector has steadily increased over the last two decades, as has the level ofprofessional training.The increase in the number of banks and qualified personnel, in turn, enhanced competition andcontributed to broad utilization of new financial instruments and techniques. Furthermore, the bankswere motivated to attain a dynamic structure through automation. During the last decade, Turkish
BIS Review 79/20004banks became more automated and efficient, along with their foreign counterparts. For example, thenumber of ATMs in Turkey has increased from zero to over 8,000 in the last decade. Intensecompetition and a desire to integrate with global financial markets has driven banks to improve thequality and the variety of services through information technology and international payment systems.As a result of this, Turkish banks have started to provide interactive banking services to decrease theircosts and increase efficiency of banking transactions. They are also part of the Electronic FundTransfer system for their internal banking transactions and of S.W.I.F.T. for external transactions.Parallel to the process of liberalizing the economy, Turkish banks have made significant progress ininvestments and in organizations abroad. They opened branches abroad and took important steps toincrease their shares in international markets by acquiring financial participations and partnerships.As of June 2000, Turkish banking sector, including branches abroad, operates with the total asset sizeof USD 140.4 billion, more than 8,000 branches and almost 170,000 personnel.The Turkish banking sector is also open to international competition. At present 25 foreign banks,including development and investment banks, constitute 31% of the total number of banks in thesector. The share of foreign banks has also increased during the past few years. While their share was5.8% and 5.6% as the end of 1997 and 1998 respectively, it increased to 6.7% as of June 2000,representing the total asset size of USD 9.4 billion. The majority of this share belongs to foreigncommercial banks.As of July 2000, Turkish banks have:• 83 financial subsidiaries in 24 different countries;• 41 branches in 10 different countries; and• 62 foreign representative offices in 10 countries.At present, the Turkish banking sector has up-to-date technology and is equipped with highly qualifiedpersonnel to compete in the international arena. The result is a more transparent and well-functioningbanking sector whose players have been progressively modernizing their operations in line with thedevelopments in the global banking community.There is a significant growth potential in the Turkish banking sector. Banks will have to compete in anincreasingly challenging environment. In the coming years, strategically and technicallywell-positioned banks will be able to utilize the growth potential of the sector. However, increasingcompetition and squeezed profit margins are expected to force banks to be more cost conscious. Inorder to increase profitability and efficiency, mergers and strategic alliances with foreign banks will beon the agenda of the sector.The integration process with the EU will bring new challenges for Turkish banks to increase theirefficiency and quality of their services by improving their distribution channels. Additionally,increasing compliance with the internationally accepted standards and other structural changes madein line with the integration process with the European Union will attract foreign banks, which in turnwill intensify the competition in the sector.Another significant step taken by Turkish authorities was the introduction of the recent disinflationprogram and the other restructuring efforts.Turkey has suffered from chronically high inflation for years and our economy is the lasthigh-inflation economy among the OECD countries. High level of public deficits and fiscalimbalances, together with self-fulfilling inflationary expectations are the main causes of the inflationprocess. Financing of these deficits has accelerated money growth and stimulated high real interestrates.The most recent developments are a reflection of the fact that Turkey has dedicated itself to solve theabove-mentioned problems. Turkey is fully aware of the fact that this chronic high inflation preventsthe whole economy from settling on a sustainable high-growth path and from integrating with theglobal economy.
5BIS Review 79/2000The ambitious disinflation program rests on three pillars:(i) up-front fiscal adjustment;(ii) a firm exchange rate commitment supported by consistent income policies; and(iii) structural reforms.This program has been supported by the structural reforms in four fundamental areas, namely bankingsector, social security and agriculture and public finance.With the awareness of the fact that the soundness of the banking system is of vital importance in anenvironment where banks are major players in the financial system and are involved in internationalbanking activities, Turkey is continuing to take measures to improve both the quality and theeffectiveness of banking surveillance system on basis of the EU directives and BIS principles.The most radical change towards strengthening the supervision and financial structures of banks wasthe establishment of Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA).Additionally, Central Bank of Turkey has pursued the most independent monetary policy possible.More recently, the first priority of the Central Bank has shifted from maintaining financial stabilitytowards achieving price stability. Regarding the monetary policy implementation, the main pillars ofthe Central Bank’s approach are its transparency, its accountability and its predictability. We, as aCentral Bank, always favor a forward-looking approach.Given the increasing importance of its economic presence and close relations with the countriesworldwide, it is crucial that Turkey improve its domestic markets to contribute to the efficientallocation of world resources. With this in mind, we will continue to implement structural reforms andour disinflation program to realize robust economic fundamentals.Final thoughtsIn closing, I would like to comment on what seems to be important in building a more robust andhealthy global financial system and the world economy.The ongoing process of globalization, along with the revolution in information technology, is likely tocontinue in the future. One consequence of this trend is the intensifying competition at the globallevel. In this context, to benefit from this trend countries all over the world should react positively.The soundness of individual financial systems clearly affects the resilience of the internationalfinancial system as a whole. We should devote our efforts towards creating a healthier globalenvironment by minimizing the volatility of international capital flows and the risk of contagion.More effective supervision and surveillance of banking systems is of the greatest importance intoday’s international banking environment and the emphasis of the recent supervisory changes hasbeen moving from the “rules-based” method of supervision towards a “risk-focused” supervision.Additionally, the globalization of financial markets led to difficulties in auditing cross-bordertransactions mainly due to lack of cooperation between supervisory authorities. However, in recentyears, care has been given to overcome inter-country problems and increase cooperation.Success of countries in integrating into the global financial system and in fulfilling the requirements ofglobalization will depend on deeper international cooperation between national and internationalagencies. At present, there exist several countries and nations that are not yet benefiting from theglobalization. Many obstacles stand in their way towards integration into the global economy.In an increasingly globalized world economy, financial sector stability is most likely to be achievedwhen prudent international standards are met and when markets operate competitively, professionallyand transparently, according to sound principles and practices.Strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework towards achieving a sound and efficientglobal banking system should be a universal goal. In this sense, the works that have been
BIS Review 79/20006accomplished by the Basel Committee, FSI, Financial Forum, etc so far should be regarded asinnovative and constructive in the process of harmonization of rules and standards internationally.In my opinion, effective supervision combined with a multi-dimensional study of past experiences andall the micro and macro level indicators, will help us to find ways to handle what globalization bringsus. I certainly believe that studies on platforms like the one we have here will help us to develop newideas and ways for responding promptly and correctly to the challenges of globalization.We have to look for solutions in the regulations that we impose on the financial sector and try hard tomake them strict enough to prevent circumvention and excessive risk-taking. We must also make surethat our system is liberal enough to promote innovation and growth.I am sure that we will be able to confront the challenges brought by globalization in the new century ifwe clearly acknowledge the two issues:–first, what globalization means for economies and particularly for financial systems; and–secondly, how we, as public and regulatory and supervisory authorities, should react to thechallenge of globalization.I am of the opinion that only in this way can we extend the benefits of globalization to wider partiesinvolved in the process. We must seize the opportunities to build a healthy global financialenvironment. The challenges are great, but the ways to confront them are quite clear. I would like tothank you for the invitation and your audience.
1BIS Review 78/2000Eva Srejber: Globalisation and the IMFSpeech by Ms Eva Srejber, Second Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, atThe Social-Domocratic Student Club, Stockholm, on 19 September 2000.*      *      *Thank you for the opportunity of coming here to Stockholm University and meeting you from thedifferent social-democratic student clubs in Stockholm and others among you who have seen postershere at the University.In a week’s time, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, will have its annual meetings with the WorldBank in Prague. We will probably see demonstrations at these meetings - in the same way as we sawat the World Trade Organisation’s meeting last winter and at the IMF and World Bank meetings inWashington in April. In a short time, the IMF has increasingly become the subject of debate, not leastsince it is closely associated with the controversial and often hard-to-interpret economic trend called“globalisation”.The Riksbank has a reason for taking part in this debate. Most of you will be aware that one of ourtasks is to maintain stable prices. The other main task of the Riksbank is to promote financial stabilityand an efficient payment system and to issue banknotes and coins. As part of this task, we participatein various international organisations which work for financial stability, among other things we are thecontact authority for the IMF in Sweden. This means that we, together with the Ministry of Finance inthe Government Offices, coordinate and conduct Swedish policy in this forum.This evening, I am intending to talk about globalisation - as an opportunity and a challenge. I amgoing to discuss what the International Monetary Fund is and the role that it has in an increasinglyglobalised world. To conclude, I will take up Sweden’s participation in the IMF, and what we canexpect from the meetings in Prague next week.Globalisation and its benefitsBefore commenting on critical remarks often presented on globalisation, let me first begin by notingthat prosperity in the world has improved dramatically during the past decades. Never before in historyhas the situation of so many people improved so much so quickly. Since the beginning of the 1980s,purchasing power per capita in the world has more than doubled. In the poor developing countries, thishas meant that purchasing power correlated GDP per capita has increased by almost 350%. In the richindustrialised countries, the corresponding growth was 220%. In certain cases, developments havebeen particularly spectacular, not least in Asia. In 1975, six out of ten Asians lived in absolute poverty- under a dollar a day. Today, the figure is two out of ten. In China alone, the number of poor hasfallen from 60 to just under 30% in less than twenty years.There are many factors that explain this development. Major technical advances have taken placeenabling manufacturing and other production to be made more efficient. However, a crucial factor hasbeen the increased opportunities for contact between people in different parts of the world, andincreased opportunities for making use of each other’s abilities. All prosperity is based on peopleproducing goods and engaging in trade to obtain other goods from those who are comparatively betterat producing them. This was the case when the Vikings exchanged fur and amber for salt and it stillapplies today when banks sell foreign exchange derivatives and equity. These greater opportunities forexchange are the foundations of globalisation. It materialises in increased trade, increased capitalinvestment, increased travelling and increased flows of information.The greater opportunities are often related to political decisions on deregulation and opening ofborders. Since 1950, the quantity of tariffs and other trade barriers has drastically reduced. This hasmeant that the total trade in goods and services in the world is now sixteen times larger than then. The
BIS Review 78/20002market for consumers and producers has thus become many times larger than before. This has meantthat workers and companies in different parts of the world have been able to concentrate on producingwhat they are relatively best at. Specialisation and increased competition have pushed down prices.The housekeeping money lasts longer. Moreover, we can buy far more types of goods. It was not solong ago that oranges were a luxury. If you go into a food shop today, you will find Swedish bloodpudding as well as Italian salami, Chinese noodles, American peanut butter and coffee from Brazil.The same applies to most other types of goods.Increased trade also benefits the developing countries, which has been shown in various studies.Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner at Harvard University have found that welfare in developingcountries with an open trade policy has increased by 4.7% per year between 1970 and 1990, comparedwith 0.7% per year for those with closed borders. This means that a country can create more than sixtimes as much welfare each year, just by deregulating its trade. No development assistance project inthe world comes anywhere near such figures. The price for shutting oneself off from world trade isvery high.Another important trend in recent years has been the deregulation of the international capital marketsand the new information technology enabling savings capital to move in a second between differentparts of the world, at almost zero cost. Capital is not really different from any other type of good.Some people need capital, and are willing to pay to borrow it. Others have savings and can sell theopportunity to use these for a period of time. Deregulation has meant that savings can to an increasingextent be channelled to where they will be most useful. The medium income countries today financetheir growing industries and their infrastructure with the aid of the savings capital from us in the richpart of the world. At the same time, those who save money - not least all those saving for pensions -can benefit from the growth potential that exists outside of their own country’s borders. Free capitalmovements have also made it possible to diversify savings capital and thus reduce risks. This givesgreater financial security both among those who invest and those who use borrowed capital.Globalisation brings many benefits that are not only economic. Contacts with the surrounding worldhave increased and developments in IT make it increasingly difficult to isolate a country. Openness isincreasing in all areas, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and information and receives furthernourishment from growing economic prosperity. In addition, since it has become less costly to traveland easier to undergo education in other countries, more and more people have had personalexperience of everyday life in other countries.Criticism of globalisationNevertheless - despite the very positive development in many respects - there are many that regardglobalisation as a threat rather than an opportunity. There are a lot of organisations with manydifferent views in this area. However, they seem to share some of the concerns about trends in theworld economy. This may concern the following:• Trade and new technology increase competition and the requirement to change. The changeover tonew types of production makes demands for great, and often swift, adaptation. Some companiesbecome unprofitable and employees both in industrialised countries and developing countries areforced to leave their jobs and look for new.• Although the situation of more and more people is improving, the gap between the poor and therich is increasing. Countries, which due to deficient infrastructure and incapable politicalleadership, etc. are not equipped to take advantage of the benefits of globalisation, risk fallingfurther and further behind.• The global environmental problems are aggravated.• Free capital movements make countries more vulnerable if they carry out less credible policies. Asquickly as investments flow in when economic prospects are good, they flow out just as quicklywhen financiers suspect that growing problems threaten the savings they have the task ofmanaging.
3BIS Review 78/2000These are some of the problems that we cannot ignore. They are among the great challenges for worldpolitics today, and I understand those who feel concern. Many of these issues require coordinationbetween countries, and it is therefore an ambitious agenda that we have to tackle energetically. A lot ofwork is already in progress, nationally and in various multilateral organisations.However, despite these issues being important, the conclusion is not that we should endeavour toreduce trade or have fewer contacts between countries. A number of the problems I mentioned arerather related to growth and economic development in general entailing change. All societies, whetheropen or closed, must find ways of ensuring that people are not excluded when technological progressmakes old industries unprofitable. All societies also have a responsibility for production andconsumption not having too great an impact on the environment since the welfare and health of futuregenerations will otherwise be imperilled.We must be clear that development and collaboration are good. Almost everyone, including many ofthe poor in the world, has experienced great improvements in the past decades. In many respects, it isexactly the increased contacts and trade between countries that has contributed to it being possible tosolve the problems that I have just mentioned. Growth in the industrialised countries has led to usbeing able to afford to conserve our environment, which most poor countries cannot afford to do. Toreverse the trend - to attempt to isolate countries from one another - is not the way forward.Globalisation makes new demandsI will now make some remarks on challanges specifically related to globalisation. Like all otherdevelopment, globalisation is not without problems. These were clearly expressed in the severeeconomic crises that we have seen in recent years - in Mexico in 1994-95, in South-East Asia in1997-98, in Russia in 1998 and in Brazil in 1999. These crises illustrate that increased trade andfinancial flows makes new demands public policy.Firstly, requirements increase on the national institutional settings - on laws, authorities and practices.These systems must be solid enough to cope with increased flows of trade and capital. Some countriesare not sufficiently well prepared to handle the new conditions of the world economy. Sometimes,countries have deregulated their economies too quickly or in the wrong way. Industrialised countrieshave deficiencies too.Secondly, requirements increase on coordination of policy among countries. The countries of theworld are increasingly dependent on one another. A financial crisis in South-East Asia has effects inSweden as well. For this reason, we also benefit from other countries on the other side of the worldacquiring better systems for, for instance, bank supervision and bankruptcies. This means that we havegreater reason to become involved in global issues. We also have reasons to show lenience on issuesthat are important for Sweden sometimes, in order to create common rules of play and agreements thatwill benefit everyone. The old slogan “international solidarity” is national self-interest in a veryconcrete way.International collaboration is thus of great value. Therefore, we have reason to take a great interest inthe multilateral organisations for collaboration that exists. The “Bretton Woods institutions” - the IMF,the World Bank and WTO/GATT - were established fifty years ago during a period when the countriesin the world economy drew the lesson that the trade wars of the 1930s, payment obstacles andcompetitive devaluations contributed to unemployment, lower prosperity and war. Among otherthings, it is the collaboration in these organisations that opened the road for the economic developmentwe are seeing today. It is also in the first place within these organisations that the countries of theworld discuss how the gains from globalisation shall benefit everyone.The World Bank is a development organisation, whose main purpose is to reduce poverty in the world.Every year, the World Bank lends the equivalent of roughly 200 billion Swedish crowns (25 billionUS dollars), to finance several thusand projects in water sanitation, combating AIDS, vaccination, etc.The World Trade Organisation, WTO, that has replaced GATT, is working to remove tariffs, importquotas and other trade barriers. The increased world trade that I recently mentioned is largely aproduct of the work that has taken place in this forum.
BIS Review 78/20004The organisation and purpose of the IMFThe IMF can be characterised as a financial “club”. It is an association of countries that share theirexperiences and help one another during crises, among other ways by lending one another money froma common fund. Influence in this club - in the form of voting rights on the IMF board - is quota-basedand reflects among other things the amount of capital the member countries have provided. Thebackground to this is that the creditors in the IMF wish to have a reasonable control of how theirmoney is used. Not least to be able to justify this to taxpayers in their home countries. Voting power inthe IMF is a balance of creditors’ interests, borrowers’ needs and that all members should be able toexercise influence.Membership of the IMF is open for all countries that meet certain criteria. Today, 182 countries aremembers, which means that very few countries do not take part in the IMF. This broad membership isone of the organisation’s strengths. The IMF’s head office is in Washington DC in the USA. Around3,000 people work there. The major part are economists specialising in macroeconomics andinternational finance. The IMF board which decides on the day-to-day policy in the organisation isalso located in Washington DC. The board meets at least three times per week. It has 24 seats, whereall countries are represented, most of them in geographical groupings.The IMF’s purpose is to work for financial stability. In simple terms, this means ensuring that thevarious macroeconomic variables in a country – the exchange rate, inflation, the budget deficit, forinstance - are dealt with in such a way that the economy can run smoothly and efficiently. A stableeconomy allows people to think in a long-term way when they invest and consume. Without stability,it is not possible to create sustainable growth. In Sweden, we have recent experiences of the opposite.The financial crisis here at the beginning of the 1990s increased unemployment and reducedproduction at the same time as government finances were dramatically weakened and Sweden enteredthe deepest recession since the 1930s. Bear in mind then that Sweden is an industrialised country.Many of the member states of the IMF are poor and have even in calm periods unemployment ofaround 30%, a very strained government budget and limited opportunities to obtain foreign finance.Financial stability is even more important in these countries.Activities to prevent crisesA large part of the IMF’s activity centres around preventing crises arising. Globalisation has meantthat this work has become increasingly important. Few people want to trade with a country that isinsecure, and even fewer to lend money there. Since the flow of information is increasing and capitalcan swiftly be moved between countries, economic crises can arise more quickly in the event ofindications of problems in a country. They can also become deeper and spread to regions farther awaythan previously. The value of a stable, long-term economic policy has therefore been reinforced.Briefly, the IMF’s preventive work involves spreading knowledge, giving advice and creating norms.Spreading knowledge means that the IMF continually monitors trends in the world economy, conductsresearch and spreads knowledge to national governments and the general public. Knowledge aboutwhere the economic risks are has a stabilising effect on markets and also allows countries to tackletheir problems. The IMF continuously surveys economic trends in each member country and alsogives regular advice on economic policy on issues concerning, for instance, exchange rates, inflationand the financial market. Most countries receive a visit from the IMF every year. In Sweden thisusually takes place in the early summer and the delegation stays for a week and visits during thisperiod the Riksbank, the Ministry of Finance, Finansinspektionen [the Swedish financial supervisoryauthority], the social partners and other central economic participants to obtain a picture of theeconomic state of the country. This leads to a report that is discussed in the IMF board.In some cases, the IMF has a very practical involvement in countries. Many central banks indeveloping countries have been established with the assistance of the IMF. An example that is close tohand is the establishment of a central bank in Kosovo. The same applies to introductions of newcurrencies, or the introduction of new exchange rate regimes. The IMF also trains officials fromnational central banks and ministries of finance as part of the work of spreading knowledge.
5BIS Review 78/2000An increasingly important part of its activity concerns creating common rules of play within differentareas that affect financial stability. Many of these are in the form of general minimum standards andrecommendations, for instance, in bank supervision, financial statistics, transparency and foreignexchange reserve management. By encouraging countries to meet these, countries reinforce theirinstitutional framework, at the same time as increased standardisation makes it easier for everyone tobe cognisant of systems in different countries. Not least, this assists investors to make riskassessments.Fund lendingThe areas of activity that I have just mentioned involve in the first place the long-term prevention ofcrises and the promotion of trade and growth. They account for the major part of the IMF’s work.However, the IMF also has the role of fire brigade in the international financial system. Roughly,financial problems occur in four or five countries each year. This often includes difficulties for thesecountries to handle their foreign payments - their foreign exchange reserve runs low since imports aregreater than exports, and there is insufficient foreign capital inflow to bridge the gap. In such asituation, the country can apply to the IMF for a loan. A team of economists is then quickly puttogether and sent to the country to assess how severe the crisis is and what has to be done to regaincontrol over the situation. Together with the country’s government, the IMF staff rapidly creates aneconomic reform programme that runs over a couple of years. The purpose of this programme is toestablish confidence in the country’s economy and in this way turn the outflow of capital to an inflow,so that the country can regain balance in its payments. During the period that the country isundergoing the programme, it can also borrow limited amounts from the IMF to assist in coveringparts of its deficit.The IMF’s lending is thus relatively short-term. It is often sufficient with loans with a three to fiveyear term to restore balance in the foreign payments. In the case of developing countries, however, ithas increasingly been seen that short-term instability often depends on deep-seated structuralproblems. Examples of this type of problem are inability to collect taxes, inefficient bankruptcylegislation, widespread corruption and weaknesses in the banking sector. These types of issues are inthe borderland between the mandate of the IMF and the World Bank and the two organisationscollaborate in initiatives in this area. Among other things, the IMF and the World Bank have certaintypes of loans which, in combination with economic reform programmes, are focused on buildinglong-term, strong structures in poor countries.Another type of structural problem is the unsustainable foreign debts burden that some of the mostpoor developing countries have to contend with. For a couple of years, the IMF and the World Bankhave been working together in debt relief projects for these countries. In practice, this implies writingoff parts of the debts. The debt relief goes hand-in-hand with economic reforms in the countries, aimedat decreasing poverty. In the longer term it is only through a responsible economic policy, focused ongrowth, stability and sound government finances, that these countries can avoid debts building upagain. An important part of the IMF’s work with debt management in the poor countries is therefore tostrive for the resources that are released in the country are invested long-term and in a way thatbenefits all the population.Research shows that IMF lending and programs are successful. In the years a program is implemented,and the countries save to finance their deficits, growth is normally decreased a bit. After a few years,the countries can however reap the fruits of a more stable economy, in terms of lower inflation andhigher growth. Successful programs also have a positive effect on social policy in the countries.Expenditure on education and healthcare in the poorest program countires increased by four per centper capita between 1985 and 1998, and these areas now account for a larger share of the governmentbudgets. Countries with IMF programs have seen more children in schools, increased literacy andaccess to clean water, and lower child mortality.
BIS Review 78/20006Swedish participation in the IMFSweden is one of the creditor countries in the IMF. In the board we share a seat together with theseven other Nordic and Baltic countries. As well as other country groups, we have an office inWashington with representatives who work full time on pursuing our interests on the board. I workedat this office myself for over four years as Nordic-Baltic representative in the board. Our boardrepresentatives receive guidance from their home countries on important issues and statements in theboard are coordinated among our countries in advance. In Sweden, the Riksbank has the mainresponsibility for contacts with Washington, but all issues are coordinated with the GovernmentOffices where the Ministry of Finance is our contact. In certain cases, there is also consultation withthe Ministry for Foreign Affairs.The Nordic and Baltic countries are small on the board - our combined voting power is just over 3.5%of that of the IMF as a whole. Our opportunities to pursue policies on the board are in having sensiblepoints of view on the proposals that are on the agenda and, together with other countries, trying toinfluence proposals so that they move in the direction we want them to. To some extent, we have anadvantage in appearing independent on the board, since we represent neither the most influentialcreditors within G7 nor the large group of debtor countries. This means that our statements sometimeshave more weight than our voting powers indicate.Let me give three examples of issues where our countries have been actively involved in the IMF. Thefirst concerns the transparency of the IMF. In Sweden, we are accustomed to authorities publishingtheir decisions and their way of dealing with items. Many international organisations on the other handoperate behind closed doors. However, the IMF has become considerably more open in recent years,and today material on almost all activities is available, not least on the IMF’s website (www.imf.org).A second example is the issue of capital account liberalisation. Besides working for opening up thecapital account in many countries, we strive for the long-term goal of giving the IMF a clearermandate to regulate issues relating to the international capital market. A third issue where we havebeen active is developing a body of rules for how private creditors are to contribute to the financing ofcountries’ finance requirements in crisis situations.The increased attention in the media about the IMF and the World Bank has arisen during a periodwhen the functioning of these organisations and their mandate have been discussed intensivelyinternally as well. The growth of private capital markets has resulted in many countries no longerrequiring financing from the IMF. At the same time, the need to build institutions, regulation andcoordination is increasing, not least in the financial sphere. Some radical groups have argued that theIMF should be abolished, or considerably reduced in size. Others believe that the organisation shouldtake on more responsibilities, such as within areas concerning the labour market, the environment andmoney laundering. Sweden is among those who believe that the IMF can only be an efficientorganisation if its mandate is kept relatively narrow. The IMF shall work with financial stability, andin particular macroeconomic issues. Within this area, the IMF has its main competence and cancontribute most. At the same time, the world has changed a lot since the IMF was set up at BrettonWoods in the forties, and it is natural for the organisation to expand its involvement in financial issuesand, in particular, with respect to how private flows of capital are to operate within a good regulatoryframework.The annual meetings in PragueThe coming annual meetings in Prague are to some extent a continuation of this discussion. In Prague,the ministers of finance and governors of central banks from the member countries will meet todiscuss the IMF’s future agenda and share views on the work that has been done since the meetings inWashington in the spring. Most of the issues that I have mentioned will be taken up at these meetings.They will discuss trends in the world economy and future risks and opportunities. They will discussthe increased role of private flows of capital and how they affect the IMF’s provision of advice andloans. They will also discuss how the IMF can obtain a more constructive collaboration with privatefinanciers. The experiences of standards within different areas will be analysed as well as the poorestcountries’ debt situation, and not least how the debt relief is to be financed.
7BIS Review 78/2000The IMF has accordingly a key role in what we somewhat carelessly call globalisation. I hope that thetrend towards increasing economic and cultural openness will continue. People continually seek newopportunities to trade and communicate with one another, and find new ways to benefit from oneanother’s knowledge and possibilities. It is fundamentally a very positive development which givespoor and rich people enormous opportunities for greater wealth and reduced suffering. In order tomake use of this potential, intensive international collaboration is required, and energetic nationalefforts. Sweden and all other countries must adapt their national systems so that they can cope with theincreased contacts with the outside world and so that other countries can benefit from increasedcontacts with us.Issues of financial stability and macroeconomics are intimately related to this. The IMF therefore hasan increasingly important function to fill. Economic developments, not least in the financial sphere,take place quickly, however. In order to be able to make an active contribution, the IMF and otherfinancial organisations must continually be reformed and keep in step with this development. Themeetings in Prague are a part of this reform process.
1BIS Review 77/2000Bank of Japan’s September report of recent economic and financialdevelopments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 18 September 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy is recovering gradually, with corporate profits and business fixed investmentcontinuing to increase.With regard to exogenous demand, public investment is about to decrease since the implementation ofthe supplementary budget for fiscal 1999 has peaked out. Net exports (real exports minus real imports)continue to follow a moderate upward trend due to steady developments in overseas economies. Asregards domestic private demand, business fixed investment is on an increasing trend. The recovery inprivate consumption continues to be weak as a whole through lack of notable improvements inemployment and income conditions, although there are somewhat positive signs in some indicators.Housing investment is mostly unchanged.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production is increasing. Corporate profitsand sentiment continue to improve, and the number of firms that take positive action, such asincreasing the amount of fixed investment, is increasing, especially in high-growth sectors. Incomeconditions of households still remain severe but regular and overtime payments as well as new joboffers continue to increase in line with the recovery in corporate activities, and compensation ofemployees has stopped decreasing.As for the outlook, public investment will decrease, but net exports are expected to continueincreasing gradually, reflecting the expansion in overseas economies. In the corporate sector, firmsstill strongly feel that they have excess equipment and that they should reduce their debts to restorefinancial soundness. However, it is very likely that fixed investment in high-growth sectors, includingthose related with information technology services, will increase as corporate profits continue torecover. Moreover, an improvement in corporate profits will increase household income and this inturn is expected to boost private consumption. However, the pace of recovery in household incomewill be modest for the time being, since firms’ perceptions of excess employment still persist, and thussignificant changes have not been observed in their efforts to reduce personnel expenses. Overall, theeconomy is likely to recover gradually led mainly by business fixed investment, unless there are majoradverse external shocks. In addition, the favorable financial environment created partly by the Bank’ssustaining easy monetary stance is expected to continue underpinning the economy.With regard to prices, import prices are rising, reflecting an increase in international commodity pricessuch as crude oil prices since April. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstanding the rise in prices ofpetroleum products reflecting the increase in crude oil prices, are mostly unchanged mainly due to thedecrease in prices of electric machinery. Meanwhile, consumer prices continue to be somewhat weakowing to the decline in prices of imported products reflecting the past appreciation of the yen,although prices of petroleum products and electricity increased from the rise in crude oil prices.Corporate service prices are still falling slowly.1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 14 September 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 14 September as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 77/20002As for the outlook on prices, downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand is decliningsignificantly while an economic recovery is expected to continue moderately. Upward pressure onprices is likely to arise temporarily from the increase in crude oil prices. On the other hand, in additionto the declining trend of machinery prices due to technological innovations, the decline in prices ofconsumer goods arising from the past appreciation of the yen and the streamlining of distributionchannels will exert downward pressure on prices. Thus, prices overall are expected to be stable orweak somewhat.In the financial market, the overnight call rate rose in response to the decision at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 11 August to change the guideline for money market operations,3 and is generallymoving around 0.25%. The amount of funds outstanding in the call money market has increased.Interest rates on term instruments increased towards the end of August, reflecting the termination ofthe zero interest rate policy, and has been mostly stable thereafter. The Japan premium remainsnegligible.Yields on long-term government bonds followed an upward trend from the second half of August androse temporarily to 1.95-2.0%, but is recently moving in the range of 1.8-1.9%. The yield spreadbetween private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds remains mostlyunchanged as a whole.Stock prices rose from mid- to end-August but started to fall from late August and are recently movingaround the level observed during mid-August.In the foreign exchange market, the yen-dollar exchange rate rose temporarily to around 109-110 yenin mid-August, but the yen appreciated thereafter. The yen is currently being traded in the range of106-108 yen to the US dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is at a high level in parallel with recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce their debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result,credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish. Recently, however, theexpansion in the year-to-year decline seems to be ceasing. Issuance of corporate bonds and CPs hasbeen steady.Money stock (M2 + CDs) grew slower in August compared with the previous month on a year-on-yearbasis.Recently, funding costs for firms are increasing, albeit gradually, due to the rise in money market ratesafter the termination of the zero interest rate policy.In this financial environment, there seem to be no substantial changes in the lending attitude offinancial institutions and easing of corporate financing conditions.3“The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move on average around 0.25%.”
1BIS Review 77/2000Jürgen Stark: German financial markets - meeting the challengeSpeech by Dr Jürgen Stark, Deputy Governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the EuromoneyConference, held in Frankfurt, on 19 September 2000.*      *      *It was the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who said panta rhei - that everything is in flux, like a river.No one steps into the same river twice. All things are subject to change and in constant flow. But itmakes a very big difference which river you step into - the gently flowing Main-river, for example, orthe headwaters of the Rhine-river. As far as the financial markets are concerned, there is much toindicate that we are caught up in a raging mountain river which is digging a new bed after heavythundery rain.During the past few years, individuals, enterprises, markets, institutions and governments have beenup against a raging current of change in the conditions under which they operate. Remaining passivein the face of such a development is fatal. It is imperative to take an active role in shaping thoseconditions or, at least, to look ahead and adapt to the given circumstances.In this situation, it is the primary task of the legislature to set the underlying statutory and regulatoryconditions which enable legal certainty, equal opportunity and competition to prevail on the markets -not just nationally, but internationally too. Examples of this to be cited for Germany are theimplementation of EC directives on capital market liberalisation, the construction of an efficientsecurities trading supervision, the planned extensive reform of legislation governing stock exchangetransactions and - probably of greatest significance at the moment - the recent tax reform.It is up to market organisers and market players to create efficient market structures and offer productsthat hold out the promise of sustained profits within the given statutory framework in line with thepursuit of their individual business. Instances of this are the emergence of new stock markets andstock market segments, and the creation of a large number of derivative instruments.Following the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bundesbank is now an integralpart of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The Bundesbank participates in theperformance of the ESCB’s tasks with the primary objective of maintaining price stability, andarranges for the execution of domestic and international payments. Price stability and a functionallyviable financial market structure are the preconditions which permanently have to be ensured so thatthere can be efficiency in financial transactions. In turn, efficient financial markets are theindispensable medium for a predictable and rapid transmission of monetary policy measures. Seen inthat light, monetary policy and efficient financial markets are in a symbiotic relationship.Although the Bundesbank cannot, on regulatory grounds, take on the role of moderator - or evenpromoter - for the financial centre that some market players would like, it is, in fact, always ready togive active support as an advisor and initiator. The modernisation of German debt management or thecustomer-friendly ECB minimum reserve arrangements are illustrations of that. The fact that monetarypolicy has been transferred to the European Central Bank allows the Bundesbank to attend more thanbefore to the continued strengthening of the competitiveness of the financial markets in Germany.A radical transformation is taking place in the financial sector, driven by the “mega trends” ofglobalisation, deregulation, innovation and the use of new technologies. In this connection, the trendhas been strengthened by the introduction of the single currency in Europe. Securitisation was alreadyone of the dominant trends in the early and mid-nineties. The adoption of the euro has now broughtabout a further surge in securitisation and given an additional boost to disintermediation. For theGerman credit institutions, the euro means that they no longer have the competitive advantage of theD-Mark, whereas for others it means that they no longer face the “D-Mark home currency” barrier toentering the market. Competition is becoming more and more intense within Europe and globally.Increasingly, credit institutions not only have to withstand growing competition from other banks but
BIS Review 77/20002are also competing to a greater extent with insurance enterprises, investment and pension funds as wellas online brokers - in some cases even from within their own groups.The response to such developments can basically be either consolidation or specialisation.Consolidation - even if only at the national level - is not an easy undertaking. The past failed attemptsof the big German banks to merge in a range of combinations illustrate how difficult it is to bringtogether different corporate cultures and strategies. It may be that the favourable tax treatment ofcapital gains from the sale of domestic participating interests from 2002 will provide new impetus formergers. Another possibility is cross-border consolidation in Europe with the involvement of Germaninstitutions. However, irrespective of the Common Market and EMU national interests have oftenstood in the way of cross-border activities. It is also often argued in this context that, because of thecomparatively strong competition as a result of the density of banks’ branches, the majority of Germancredit institutions are generally - but especially in retail banking - not profitable enough. To countersuch criticism and create the conditions for cross-border consolidation, further streamlining of thebranch network and the increased use of new technologies therefore seem inevitable.The introduction of the euro created the essential precondition for the development of a largesupranational euro capital market. The fragmentation into national capital markets - particularly bondmarkets - which was essentially due to the existence of different currencies and the resulting interest-rate differentials, can admittedly still be felt. But, under the influence of competition, the previouslynational markets are increasingly merging and gradually losing their special features. The immediateconversion of government issues into euro and the large degree of harmonisation in marketconventions have played a major part in the market becoming more homogeneous.For a variety of reasons, the emergence of a completely uniform European bond market will scarcelybe possible. Despite a greater degree of coordination, the fiscal, economic and social policies of theparticipating countries will, for the present, remain a national responsibility.That is likewise true of government debt management with its significant repercussions for the capitalmarkets. Differences in financial standing, liquidity and issuing procedures, and the varying efficiencywith which the cash, futures and repo markets interact in the individual countries will ensure yielddifferentials in the case of issuers and issues in the medium term as well.In that respect, the Federal Government is in a favourable position. Even after losing the competitiveadvantage of the D-Mark, it has remained the benchmark issuer and is able to borrow at thecomparatively lowest cost. For that reason, the Federal Government - quite apart from the fundamentallegal reservations against a communitisation of debt management - should hardly be interested incommunitised borrowing under the umbrella of a European debt agency. As experience of the GermanLänderjumbos shows, its financing costs might tend to rise. What should also not be overlooked is thefact that competition among the individual countries for the lowest possible financing costs has ahealthy influence on budgetary policy and the efficiency of issuing policy.If the debt agency that is planned by the Federal Minister of Finance does come about - despite manyreservations, not least on part of the Bundesbank - I hope it will be able to maintain or even build onthe present strong position of the Federal Government as an issuer. The Bundesbank is ready to worktogether with the debt agency, to bring its expertise to bear and, in particular, to provide all theoperational banking services for it. This would also signal to the markets that setting up the debtagency does not imply any abrupt paradigm change in debt management. That applies especially toany apparently politically motivated stronger short-term orientation in borrowing.Non-government issuers, too, have successfully adapted to the new underlying conditions. Mortgagebanks regularly put “jumbo mortgage bonds” on the market, and place them successfully with foreigninvestors as well. The issuers are thereby making use of the fact that institutional investors in Europeare gearing their portfolios more and more to euro-area-wide investment. “Exporting” mortgage bondsmeans that the idea of long-term fixed-rate real estate financing is also being exported. I believe this tobe a good thing since it promotes the stability of the financial system in Europe.Despite several signs of becoming more popular, domestically issued corporate bonds continue to leada somewhat neglected existence in Germany. Above all, because one-half of paid interest on
3BIS Review 77/2000permanent debts is included in trade earnings, German enterprises are prompted to issue bondsthrough foreign financing vehicles. Abolishing that regulation would be desirable but would probablybe realistic only in connection with the abolition or reorganisation of trade tax as such.Overall, the “corporate bonds” sector is growing sharply in Germany - as it is throughout the euroarea. Lower government deficits - which are made possible by higher tax revenues, the auctioning ofmobile telecommunications licences, privatisations as well as a consistent course of limitingexpenditure, are creating scope for corporate financing through the bond market. Institutional investorsappreciate the enhanced opportunities of portfolio diversification, which bring with them not onlyhigher yields but also greater risks.There has been a clear improvement in the “share culture” in Germany over the past few years. Large,broadly spread issues, such as those of Telekom or of t-online, have played a part in that in the sameway as the extremely successful development of the “Neuer Markt” as a new stock market segment foryoung high-growth enterprises. The frequent claim that German investors are risk-shy and preferfixed-yield paper has been emphatically refuted over the past few years. The - in some cases -meteoric price increases on the “Neuer Markt” have, if anything, given rise to the fear of widespreadeuphoria leading to a lack of discernment. The more reflective mood that has now set in is only to bewelcomed in the interests of a favourable market development in the longer term.The number and market capitalisation of listed German public limited companies have made greatadvances in the past few years:• At the end of 1995, 527 enterprises achieved a market value equivalent to (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)• At the end of 1999, the figure was already 933 enterprises with a market value of(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:14) billion.• Measured in terms of GDP, market capitalisation is now at 68% compared with 24% at theend of 1995. This means that Germany is still in a lower mid-table position among theindustrial countries. There exists potential for further growth.The European stock market landscape is still distinctly fragmented with a large number of marketmodels, trading and settlement systems. Mergers and close cooperation are inevitable if one wishes toapproach the ideal of the perfect market by means of pooling liquidity and lowering transaction costs.The Deutsche Börse AG recognised that fact at an early stage and took the lead in that development. Inthe “contest of the systems” between “open outcry” and electronic trading in the futures market, it wasconsistent in opting for the electronic alternative and thus decided the competition for the Bund Future- the capital market contract which currently has the highest turnover - in its own favour.Generally, it seems that the triumphant progress of electronic trading systems - whether it be stockexchange or OTC trading - is irresistible. Not being bound to a single location, transparency and lowtransaction costs are major advantages.Not all Deutsche Börse AG’s plans and projects have been realised. Who ventures much will also losesometimes. But who ventures nothing will never gain. As someone said in a recent discussion withGerman banks: “There are no failed experiments. There are only experiments with unexpectedoutcomes.”It is not just for monetary policy reasons that the Bundesbank is interested in efficient financialmarkets and therefore also in efficient trading and settlement systems. As the fiscal agent for theFederal Government, the Bundesbank is also a major market player in on-the-floor bond trading in thestock market and in Xetra bonds. The Federal Government and the Bundesbank have been followingDeutsche Börse AG’s plans for Eurex bonds as a successor system for Xetra bonds from the outsetand, a few weeks ago, decided on active participation. The Federal Government and the Bundesbankhave declared their expectation that the system will be open to a wide range of participants. In thisconnection, I hope that Deutsche Börse AG soon succeeds in the intended linking of the cash, futuresand repo markets and that it can successfully hold its own in competition with other electronic bondtrading systems.
BIS Review 77/20004Germany sometimes has difficulties with reforms. In a federally structured state with numerous stronginterest groups, that comes as no surprise. It is therefore all the more gratifying to state that - despiteall the criticism of specific points - a tax reform has been initiated which deserves the name. The taxreform will bring about a crucial improvement in the conditions for economic activity in Germany. Itwill mean a considerable easing of the burden on enterprises and households and create planningcertainty for the medium term. The fact that capital gains from sales of domestic participating interestsare to be exempt from tax in the case of incorporated enterprises will make the - in some cases -overdue restructuring of German groups much easier. With the lowering of corporate tax rates,Germany will in future occupy a competitive mid-table position in international terms.What is a problem, however, is that the reform will create further competitive distortions owing toretained profits being given preferential treatment over the distribution of dividends by incorporatedenterprises, and other sources of taxable income. This will weaken the steering function of the capitalmarkets. What will prove to be a particular drawback for the financial centre Frankfurt is the plannedtax prohibition on offsetting losses arising from share derivatives against profits from the underlyingshares. Here, a better solution should be found. Another justifiable point of criticism is the continuedfailure even to make a start on simplifying the highly complex German tax system. Tax consultancy isstill going to be a growth industry in Germany.Despite all the satisfaction about tax relief measures, we should not overlook the fact that the taxburden will still be quite high in Germany, which means that Germany has to maintain a consistentcourse of fiscal consolidation. Excluding the receipts from the mobile telecommunications licences,the fiscal balance in 2000 will show only a slight improvement despite much higher tax revenues. Inthe coming year, the structural deficit will increase significantly. In other words: further reductions inexpenditure are required in order to create scope for lower taxes.Maintaining and enhancing Germany’s overall competitiveness - and certainly not just thecompetitiveness of its financial markets - is an ongoing task. International investors are looking to howGermany, as Europe’s largest economy, copes with changed underlying conditions. Much has alreadyoccurred or been set in motion in Germany, such as the privatisation of former public enterprisestogether with market liberalisation and deregulation in such important areas as telecommunicationsand the post services, or price liberalisation in electricity.What still has to be done is the reorganisation of our social systems in line with foreseeabledemographic developments. The basic features of the statutory pension scheme reform presented bythe Federal Government would contribute to distributing the demographically induced burdens moreequally between the present and future generations of pensioners, but consideration should continue tobe given to raising the actual retirement age. The envisaged capital-backed supplementary pensionwould also place the funding of old-age provision on a broader foundation.What is also needed is to make our labour markets more flexible with the aim of reducingunemployment, which is still very high. That would also be an essential condition for bringing downnon-wage labour costs - which are extremely high by international standards - in a systemicallyappropriate manner.Regrettably, the reforms that have already been implemented or are planned in Germany as well as inother European countries have received scant attention up to now outside of Europe. The marketsobviously lean towards an asymmetrical view of things, with matching consequences for the externalvalue of the euro.In conclusion, I would like to say a few words on our own behalf. The establishment of the ECB hascreated a new level of decision-making in the monetary policy of the countries in the euro area. TheBundesbank is now part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). This means that theCentral Bank Council no longer has the power to decide monetary policy.What is necessary under the new conditions is to have a uniform management body located inFrankfurt. This would mean that the provision of Bundesbank services to the regions is notjeopardised.
5BIS Review 77/2000The independence of the ECB and of the national central banks within the ESCB is a key feature ofEuropean monetary policy. The “denationalisation” which this achieved was desired by all of memberstates and explicitly recognised by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which was unanimouslyapproved by the second chamber of the German parliament representing the Länder or regions, theBundesrat. Monetary policy can only be “denationalised”, however, if national aspects no longer playa role in the assessment of monetary policy. That applies all the more to specific regional aspects.The Bundesbank is ready to adjust. During the past few weeks and months, the President of theBundesbank has repeatedly pushed for the necessary measures of reform. As a member of the ECBGoverning Council, he is aware of what kind of reforms are needed. That is not so in the case ofproposals that have recently been put forward elsewhere, which, by contrast, appear to be short of thebasic information about how the ESCB operates. Tackling the reform of the Bundesbank now with allspeed and setting a clear course is something that undoubtedly requires political courage. TheBundesbank’s ability to reform - something which the Bundesbank itself desires - is, however,indicative of the “reform-ability” of Germany as a whole. This, in turn, lies in the hands of thepoliticians. We are waiting for good and forward looking political decisions.
1BIS Review 76/2000Lee Hsien Loong: Post crisis Asia - the way forwardWilliam Taylor Memorial Lecture by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore andChairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, before the Eleventh International Conference ofBanking Supervisors, held in Basel, 20-21 September 2000.*      *      *IntroductionThree years have passed since the Asian crisis struck in 1997. The crisis showed how unstable theinternational financial system could be, and how vulnerable apparently strong Asian economies wereto a sudden shock. It has caused a searching reappraisal of the benefits and risks of globalisation, aswell as the strengths and weaknesses of the Asian economies. I propose to discuss how attitudestowards globalisation have shifted, and what challenges Asian economies face in remedying theweaknesses uncovered.When Mr Paul Volcker, Chairman of the G30, invited me to deliver the William Taylor Lecture to thisdistinguished gathering of banking supervisors, he asked me to share Singapore’s experience indealing with the financial turbulence. I will also explain how we are reforming and liberalising ourfinancial sector, to benefit from globalisation while protecting ourselves against mishaps. Not all thelessons Singapore has drawn will apply to other economies because of differing circumstances. But Ihope Singapore’s case will illustrate the importance of basing financial reforms on a realisticappreciation of the risks and difficulties.In analysing the Asian crisis, and in describing the Singapore experience, I will be underlining theimportance of sound banking systems and strong supervisory oversight. I am particularly pleased to bedoing this at a Lecture held in honour of a man who dedicated his life to these goals.Pre-crisis wisdomFor a decade before the crisis, the conventional belief was that globalisation was an unmitigated good.The dramatic success of the Asian tigers had shown that openness to trade and foreign investmentswas a key source of economic growth. A 1992 World Bank study on the “East Asian Miracle” creditedtheir success chiefly to market friendly and outward oriented policies.There was broad intellectual consensus, including in the multilateral institutions, in favour of freemarkets: put simply, deregulation, privatisation, and trade and financial liberalisation were alwaysgood, and the faster the better. This was what John Williamson called the “Washington consensus”,but the view went beyond the US Treasury, the IMF and World Bank.One important element of this intellectual consensus was the liberalisation of capital accounts. Freetrade in goods and services had enabled countries to exploit comparative advantage and internationaldivision of labour, and produced half a century of unprecedented global prosperity. It was argued thatin the same way, free flows of capital would open new avenues for deploying savings and fundinginvestments, and promote more efficient allocation of resources. Financial markets were globalising,driven by technology and deregulation. The faster countries plugged into the global network, the morethey would benefit.The pre-crisis consensus did acknowledge the risks associated with open capital markets. But itstressed the virtue of market discipline more than the possibility of market failure. Financial criseswere the fault of inappropriate policies. The remedy was more liberalisation, deregulation andprivatisation. Markets would work, if only they had access to timely and accurate information. So theemphasis was on policy transparency and data disclosure, to enable the private sector to make“correct” decisions. So steadfast was the faith in open capital markets that, as late as September 1997,after Thailand had run into trouble, the IMF and G7 countries were still lobbying member states to
BIS Review 76/20002amend the IMF’s Articles of Agreement to give the Fund the mandate to promote capital accountliberalisation.Crisis shockGiven this worldview, the Asian crisis came as a tremendous shock. Financial markets proved highlysusceptible to contagion and herd behaviour. Problems in one country triggered a loss of confidence inits neighbours. Manias, panics and crashes occurred on a titanic scale, shaking seemingly soundeconomies to their roots.Structural flaws in the Asian economies undoubtedly contributed to the crisis. So did policy errors bygovernments and international institutions in responding to the problems when they emerged. Themost serious flaws were in the financial and corporate sectors. Balance sheets were weakened bycurrency and maturity mismatches. Banks were lax in their credit practices. They borrowed short-termfrom abroad and lent long-term at home, often to related companies without proper assessment.Companies borrowed excessively, especially in foreign currencies without hedging their exposures,encouraged by implicitly pegged exchange rates.But lenders in the developed economies could not escape blame either. They were only too eager toextend credit, based on the political connections of the borrowers, or on faith in an Asian miracle.Banks stampeded into the region. When sentiments turned, they stampeded out again, equally indiscri-minately. The sudden massive outflow of funds, especially through banking lines, left countries in asevere liquidity crunch, and was an immediate cause of the crisis.The punishment meted out by the markets was out of proportion to the crime. The damage was not justthe 9% shrinkage in the GDP of the crisis countries, but the social dislocation and political turbulencethat followed.Indonesia suffered the worst, even though the IMF made a pre-emptive house call early in the crisis,and pronounced Indonesia’s fundamentals to be basically sound.1 The Indonesian government hadpursued prudent macro policies and maintained steady economic growth. But companies hadborrowed large sums from abroad, and the banking sector was afflicted by related party lending, poorcredits, and weak provisioning. This, together with concerns about KKN – corruption, collusion andnepotism – was enough to turn an initial loss of confidence into a full-blown crisis of the body politic,forcing President Suharto to resign and pushing the country to the brink of chaos.The origins of the Asian crisis thus lay in institutional weaknesses and inefficiencies. These grew moreserious in the 1990s, but they continued to be masked by generally sound macroeconomic conditionsand investor confidence in a sustained Asian boom. However, the sudden onset of the crisis cannot beexplained without appreciating the panic-prone and panic-inducing behaviour of international financialmarkets.Fortunately for most of Asia, the crisis, though severe, was short. The Russian default and LTCMdebacle in the fall of 1998 were a turning point. The G7 countries, led by the US Federal Reserve,lowered interest rates promptly and decisively. While this lowering was motivated by domesticconsiderations, there was also a collective sense of concern over the weak state of the global economy.In the event, it helped restore liquidity and confidence to global financial markets. Now nearly all theAsian countries are recovering, though in different ways and to varying degrees.Post-crisis cautionAfter this near-death experience, it is not surprising that countries are re-examining their belief in theglobal economic system. What lessons have countries learnt?1IMF News Brief 97/19, 8 October 1997.
3BIS Review 76/2000Firstly, unlike previous crises, the crisis was due mainly to a run on the capital accounts. Thus, therewas no reason to rethink the merits of free international trade and investments. These fuelled the lastAsian boom, and are crucial if countries are to get their economies growing again. The most open ofthe Asian economies – Hong Kong and Singapore – were among the least badly affected by the crisis.The devastating demonstration of the downside risk of globalisation could easily have triggered anationalist and protectionist backlash. Such sentiments have surfaced to varying degrees. No countrylikes to be told what to do by the IMF, or be forced to sell off distressed banks and companies toforeign buyers, especially at fire sale prices.But no country is opting out of the global system. All continue to court foreign investments andpromote exports. Most Asian governments remain convinced that despite the attendant risks, globali-sation is still the best way to achieve progress and economic development. On this most basic articleof faith, there has been no change.Secondly, the crisis has highlighted the problems of capital account liberalisation. The IMF hasacknowledged that capital flows can be highly volatile and a potential source of crisis.2 Countries arenow acutely aware that they must sequence capital account liberalisation judiciously, and to strengthenfinancial supervision and prudential safeguards as they liberalise. But there is still broad consensusthat provided countries take these precautions, they can benefit from international capital flows. NoAsian country has imposed exchange controls as a result of the crisis, except Malaysia. And evenMalaysia continues to welcome foreign portfolio investments in its asset markets.Thirdly, all the affected countries have recognised the dangers of over reliance on bank-basedfinancing. In most Asian countries, capital markets were undeveloped. Bond markets especially wereilliquid or non-existent. This led Asian firms to rely on short-term bank financing to fund longer-termprojects, thus exposing themselves to maturity mismatches. Further, when the banks got into trouble,the firms were left with no alternative avenues to raise working capital. Thin capital marketsaccentuated price movements when investor preferences shifted. As a result, the economies’ ability toabsorb shocks was severely impaired. So across the region, steps are now being taken to developcapital markets.Fourthly, there is now greater recognition that effective prudential oversight and corporate govern-ance are critical to maintaining a sound financial system. Many Asian countries fell short in theseareas, and are now striving to remedy the weaknesses. They need to establish rigorous supervisoryregimes, foster a sound credit culture in banks, and apply international standards of accounting,disclosure, and loan classification.In this respect, the Basel-based committees, BIS, OECD, and other standard setting bodies have donevaluable work, promulgating standards on banking supervision, risk management, corporategovernance and public disclosure. Few would claim that these standards are Western culturalimpositions, and that Asian banks and companies need different norms more suited to their societiesand stage of development.Fifthly, there have been stronger calls to improve the workings of the international financial system,rather than adopt a hands-off approach. No plausible alternative to the existing market-based systemhas emerged. But the consensus view is that the robustness of the system can be improved, inparticular through better monitoring, and greater transparency among market participants. This is workin progress. The Financial Stability Forum and other groups and agencies have made many proposalsto this end. These proposals should help to reduce the risk and severity of future crises, though theywill not eliminate them.2 Joint statement by IMF and World Bank on “An Enhanced Partnership for Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction”,5 September 2000.
BIS Review 76/20004Managing the changeWhile the fundamentals for sound financial systems are universal, specific policies to attain them mustrecognise the unique socio-political context of each country. To succeed, countries must change, or atleast modify, deeply embedded social structures and cultural practices. As the experience of the formerSoviet republics and the former East European economies shows, such a far-reaching change can onlybe an evolutionary process; it cannot happen overnight.The politics in each country will dictate the pace and texture of financial and economic reform. InMalaysia, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed has made clear that in reforming and restructuringthe corporate and financial sectors, his government’s social and political objectives come first. InIndonesia, monetary and banking reforms, important as they are, are subordinate to more fundamentalissues of political transition, security, and national cohesion.The legal framework will constrain what is possible. In many Asian countries, laws are incomplete,and enforcement is weak. For example, not all Asian countries have adequate insolvency laws.Without these, borrowers have an incentive to become “strategic” debtors, deliberately defaulting oninterest and loan payments. Creditors have no incentive to accept realistic write-downs, preferringinstead to reschedule loans and reflect them as performing loans in their books. So supply of freshcredit remains weak.After the crisis some Asian countries have passed new bankruptcy laws, and even established newcourts to administer them. But enforcement continues to be difficult. As Acting Governor of BankIndonesia Anwar Nasution said, in explaining the slow pace of corporate restructuring (this was whenhe was the Senior Deputy Governor): “it will take a while, partly because we have a very rotten legaland accounting system … the most important thing is that we have very weak bankruptcyprocedures.”3The social values of each country underpin the formal structure of laws and institutions. Arelationship-based approach towards doing business is part of the culture of most Asian societies. FewAsian societies have the “contract-based” commercial culture of the West, particularly the US, with itsrobust emphasis on legal and impersonal obligations. Few have made a practice of separating theownership of firms from their management.In some countries, there are close ties between the state, the banks and industry, e.g. the state-ownedenterprises in China, and the chaebols in Korea. All over the region, family-based firms andconglomerates are the norm, especially in banking. Companies in the same group would do businesswith one another, maintaining trust on the basis of family ties and shared ownership. Even in Japan,where ownership of large corporations is not in the hands of families, long-term corporaterelationships and cross-shareholdings have dictated business.This was how entrepreneurship evolved in East Asian societies, and among the overseas Chinese inSouth East Asia. Many of these family firms were hugely successful, driven by the business acumenand entrepreneurial drive of the founding patriarchs, and supported by a web of networks, or guanxi.But the world has changed. Family relationships may be an adequate basis for running a medium sizedcompany, but not for an MNC employing tens of thousands of people. To be world-class, companiesneed to be led by the best man for the job, and this person is not likely to come from the same family,generation after generation. And business based on relationships rather than hard-headed commercialcalculations is prone to abuse and under-performance, as was shown in the Asian crisis.It will not be easy for the families to relinquish control. The instinct to hand an heirloom down thegenerations is still strong. There are also real practical difficulties. If the families sell out, who will thebuyers be? Who will take charge of the companies? Most Asian countries lack a group of institutionalshareholders who can exert market discipline and defend minority shareholder interests, like the3 Straits Times, 26 January 2000.
5BIS Review 76/2000mutual and pension funds in the US. Nor have they developed a class of professional entrepreneur-managers, like those who drive MNCs in the West and Japan.Changing these institutional features of Asian economies will be an arduous task. But over time thecountries can, and must, change discredited practices. State-owned or family-run enterprises can betransformed into firms run along meritocratic lines by professional managers. Greater publicownership can strengthen market discipline and the incentive to improve returns for all shareholders.Companies that are not profitable have to be closed or restructured.Asian leaders understand this. For example, the governor of the Bank of Thailand Mr Chatu MongolSonakul said, describing efforts to promote corporate governance in financial institutions andcompanies:4 “What we are doing is a very long process. We’re not talking of months or years. We aretalking in, maybe, decades or generations. We’re not changing our way of working; we actually try tochange our way of life.”Governments play a key role in fostering and managing this process of change. They have to make thepolitical judgment on how fast to go, how to sell the changes to the people, and what compromises arenecessary. Only they have the mandate to decide, and only they can take responsibility for theoutcomes. South Korea under President Kim Dae Jung is a good example of how this can work, aswell as of how difficult the process can be.External institutions like the IMF and the World Bank are also important, providing advice andapplying pressure to do what is painful but necessary. This means that IMF and World Bank loans andassistance have to come with strict conditionality. But the line between essential conditionality andexcessive intervention is a fine one.In Indonesia, the IMF pushed the Suharto government hard, not just to deal with the immediate crisis,but to implement sweeping structural reforms. President Suharto interpreted this as a threat to his ownposition, and treated the IMF as an opponent rather than an ally. This contributed to a collapse ofconfidence, political turbulence, and finally Suharto’s resignation in May 1998. Whether or not theIMF intended this outcome, it helped to precipitate a decisive and momentous change in Indonesia, theconsequences of which are still unfolding.Singapore’s approachLet me now turn to Singapore’s experience in navigating through the crisis and preparing itself to meetthe challenges of globalisation, especially in the financial sector.Singapore is not entirely typical of the region. We are a small, open economy, about half the size ofthe Swiss economy, and heavily reliant on foreign trade. We are also a financial centre in Asia, andtherefore highly exposed to disturbances in the international financial system. So it is not surprisingthat Singapore was affected by the Asian crisis. Our GDP growth plunged from 8.4% in 1997 to 0.4%in 1998. Retrenchments went up sharply. Our stock market fell, in line with regional markets.Navigating the crisisBut overall Singapore was less affected than most of the region. The banks were unshaken, and Singa-pore companies did not keel over. Why was this the case?Firstly our economic fundamentals were sound. We had pursued pro-business and pro-developmenteconomic policies for many years, and maintained consistently low inflation.5 We had kept oureconomy open, and had taken a market-oriented approach towards economic development. So4 Keynote Address, Meeting on Good Governance for Financial Institutions, Bangkok, 10 June 2000.5 Singapore’s inflation averaged 2.1% between 1981 and 1999 while the average figure for the Group of Seven developedcountries over the same period was just over 4%.
BIS Review 76/20006investments did not go into industries in which we lack competitive advantage, and Singaporecompanies were generally efficient.Secondly, the Government had a strong financial position. Indeed it continued to register a budgetsurplus throughout the crisis. We had no foreign debt, much less short-term debt. Foreign exchangereserves were comfortable.Thirdly, our response to the crisis was to reduce business costs directly, to help businesses stay viableand so preserve jobs. No company was bailed out by the Government; no creditor was prevailed uponto maintain a loan to a failing borrower. Instead we granted rebates in taxes and government chargesacross the board, and reduced employers’ monthly contributions to employees’ retirement fund –effectively a wage cut. Fortunately union leaders understood the gravity of the crisis, and helped topersuade workers to accept this unpalatable prescription. Overall these measures amounted to 7% ofGDP. The measures, and the population’s positive response to them, instilled confidence amongSingaporeans and foreign investors.Fourthly, our banks were sound. Even during the boom years, our banks had been generally prudentand conservative in their lending policies. Also MAS had supervised the banks strictly, requiring highcapital and liquidity standards, insisting on prompt and adequate provisions for non-performing loans,and frowning upon excessive expansion of bank loans. So when the crisis struck, the banks stayed onan even keel,6 even as MAS required them to make large general provisions in anticipation of futureNPLs.Fifthly, we were lucky with our timing as we had deflated a property bubble early. Like several otherAsian countries, Singapore had experienced a property boom. It started in 1993, and in just 3 yearsproperty prices had doubled. By early 1996, the property market was becoming dangerouslyoverheated. The Government decided to prick the bubble. We restricted bank credit by cappinghousing loans at 80% of valuation, and imposed other anti-speculation measures. So by the time theAsian crisis struck a year later, property prices were already declining. The froth had been skimmedoff. Had we not acted in 1996, the adjustment would have been more painful, and the banks wouldhave had more serious problems with their loans.Managing financial sector reformsAlthough the crisis is past, we are not back to the status quo ante. While Asia was preoccupied with itsproblems, globalisation of financial markets proceeded apace, spurred on by deregulation andtechnology. With the internet, markets are becoming borderless. Banks, insurance firms, and nowsecurities exchanges are facing cut-throat competition, and going through a worldwide wave ofmergers and consolidation.Singapore has to keep up with these global trends to remain a sound yet dynamic financial centre. Formany years, we had regulated our financial sector tightly. We insisted on high standards of integrityand competence. We sought to protect investors, especially retail investors, by circumscribing whatthey could be allowed to invest in. We protected local banks and stockbrokers from foreigncompetition, in order to build up dependable Singaporean players. We sought to minimise riskwherever possible, and accepted the trade off for a less vibrant and innovative industry.This approach had worked, and proved its worth in the crisis. But going forward, it no longer suffices.In the new environment, we need to take a bolder, less dirigiste approach. We should regulate with alighter touch, accept more calculated risks, and give the industry more room to innovate. We need toliberalise and allow greater competition.We will not abandon the high standards of integrity and sound financial management which we havebuilt up. But our attitude to supervising risk must change.6 Before the crisis, NPLs were 3% of loans. During the crisis, NPLs rose only to about 12%, most of which was on accountof lending to the region.
7BIS Review 76/2000We should focus more on systemic risk rather than protecting individual firms, or preventing riskyproducts from reaching the market. We should allow investors to judge and take business risks forthemselves. We should rely more on market discipline and full information disclosure to protectinvestors, rather than extensive formal and informal regulation. We need to shift emphasis fromregulation to supervision, and from one-size-fits-all rules to oversight tailored to the characteristics ofindividual institutions.We decided on these fundamental changes in our policy framework for the financial sector in 1997.We went ahead to launch it, just as the storm clouds were gathering, because we saw it as an essentialstrategic shift, independent of short-term ups and downs of economic fortunes. We felt confident ofweathering the storm, although we did not know it would turn out to be a super hurricane.We decided to make a phased transition over several years, rather than have a single big bang. We hadseen how big bangs in some other countries had led to excesses and problems later down the road. Wecould not afford this risk, unlike the more established financial centres like London. Our regulators,financial institutions, and investors all needed time to develop new expectations of one another, andunderstand the new way things worked. We needed to manage the reform process in an environmentmade difficult by the Asian crisis, and keep the system on an even keel.Over the last three years, we have systematically reviewed every part of the financial industry. Wehave freed up the use of compulsory savings in the state retirement fund scheme, demutualised andmerged the stock and futures exchanges, deregulated brokerage commissions, opened up all areas ofthe financial industry to new entrants, and taken steps to develop the bond market.I will focus on two specific changes, to illustrate the trade-offs and considerations in designing ourliberalisation programme. The first is the review of our policy of not encouraging theinternationalisation of the Singapore dollar. The second is our decision to open up the domestic marketto foreign banks, while giving impetus to local banks to strengthen themselves.Singapore dollar non-internationalisation policyWe have long maintained an explicit policy not to encourage the internationalisation of the SingaporeDollar. Being small and vulnerable, we are especially wary of large and volatile capital flowsdistorting our exchange rate, and thus damaging our real economy. Our international trade is 3 timesour GDP, higher than any other country in the world. If our exchange rate moved up and down like theJapanese Yen against the US dollar, we would be in deep trouble.Singapore has no capital or exchange controls. Anyone can move funds freely into and out ofSingapore, whether in S$ or foreign currencies. The non-internationalisation policy does not try toprevent currency speculation per se, or to limit the flow of capital into and out of Singapore. Itimposes only one restriction: non-residents may not borrow S$ for activities unrelated to the Singaporeeconomy, though they may buy and sell as much S$ as they wish. This restriction on borrowing S$ isto make it harder for non-residents to accumulate ammunition through borrowing for a speculativeattack on the S$.Despite the non-internationalisation policy, there is virtually complete capital mobility in Singapore.Empirical studies have shown that domestic S$ interest rates are almost entirely determined by paritywith offshore US Dollar interest rates, adjusted for future exchange rate expectations. In economist’sjargon, the “interest parity condition” holds.The role of hedge funds in the Asian crisis is controversial. There is evidence that the hedge fundswere active in a number of the regional currencies before and during the crisis. Although someobservers are convinced that hedge funds were the main culprits in bringing currencies down, theevidence is not conclusive. Nevertheless, we believe that our policy of non-internationalisation helpedto protect the S$ against excessive volatility during this unstable period. Of course the policy could nothave been effective if Singapore’s economic fundamentals had not been sound, and if we had not hada floating exchange rate which could be managed flexibly in line with these fundamentals. We had aneasier ride than Hong Kong, which also had a sound economy, but whose currency was, for goodreasons, pegged to the US dollar.
BIS Review 76/20008Going forward, we intend to maintain the non-internationalisation policy, but to periodically review itsscope and implementation. In the early phase of our development as a financial centre, internationaland regional business serviced out of Singapore could be conducted in US dollars. But as our financialcentre matured, and our capital markets became more comprehensive and integrated, foreign playersincreasingly wanted to issue S$ debt and equity, and to hedge their positions using S$ swaps andrepurchase agreements. At the same time, the Singapore economy and our foreign reserves havegrown, and so has our confidence in withstanding pressures on our exchange rate.Our policy needed to adapt to these changed circumstances while preserving its basic objective. Aspart of our financial reforms, we have progressively relaxed the S$ restrictions. Notably we have madean exception to the restriction on borrowing S$, to allow foreign entities to issue S$ denominatedbonds and equity, provided they swap or convert the proceeds into foreign currency for use outsideSingapore.We will continue to evolve the non-internationalisation policy, as we gain experience and confidencewith the liberalised rules. The policy will not compensate for unsound economic fundamentals, nor isit a foolproof protection against exchange volatility. But it would be unwise to discard a usefuldeterrent against would-be speculators who might otherwise be tempted to try their luck.Banking liberalisationThe second example of our measured liberalisation approach is the opening of our retail bankingsector, with simultaneous steps to help strengthen local Singapore banks.Our starting position was different from most countries. Foreign banks (mostly British) dominated theSingapore banking system when we gained independence. For three decades, the Government hasprotected the local banks, especially in the retail business, to enable them to expand their market share.We believed that strong and well-managed local banks, with a significant share of the home market,were critical to the resilience and stability of our financial system. We wanted to be sure that in acrisis, we could count on major institutions whose long term interests were aligned with the Singaporeeconomy. We still hold this view.Like banks in other Asian countries, most of our local banks started as family banks, and are still runby their controlling shareholders. But strict supervision enabled them to grow into sound, well-capitalised institutions, free of the problems of improper and imprudent lending to related companies.By Asian standards, the local banks were exceptionally well run. But compared to the bestinternational banks, they lagged in many areas: size, technology, expertise, range and quality ofservice, and shareholders’ returns.We could not afford to let Singapore banks fall behind, or deprive the rest of our economy of world-class financial services. In any case, because of globalisation and cross-border competition, aprotectionist policy was becoming less and less tenable.Therefore we moved last year to open up the Singapore market further to foreign banks. We hopedthat this would spur efficiency and innovation among the local banks, and push well-run banks to seekscale and expand at home and abroad. We were convinced that unless we opened up, thistransformation would never take place. There is no substitute for real competition.We did not want the liberalisation to weaken our banks and destabilise the financial system. So we arenot taking a big bang, laissez faire approach. Instead, we are phasing the liberalisation over five years,and opening the market to financially strong, committed foreign players.At the same time, we are motivating the local banks to strengthen themselves. We have raiseddisclosure standards to international norms, and we now require banks to publish details of their non-performing loans and inner reserves, which were previously closely guarded secrets.We are also raising corporate governance standards, which lie at the heart of the improvementsrequired in Asian banking systems. We instituted nominating committees on bank boards, comprisinga majority of independent directors. Their remit is to ensure that persons appointed to the boards and
9BIS Review 76/2000to key executive positions are selected for their expertise, and their ability to contribute to the bankand to the interest of all shareholders.Most important of all, we are requiring the banking groups to make a clear separation between theirfinancial and non-financial businesses. The banks will have to divest all control of non-financialactivities, and remove all cross-shareholdings. This will help ensure that all transactions with non-financial entities remain at arms length, that the interests of the bank are not confused with the otherinterests of the controlling shareholder, and that management attention stays focussed on theincreasingly complex business of banking.If this programme works, we hope a few Singapore banks will grow to become strong regionalplayers. Of course, success cannot be guaranteed. If the local banks lose too much ground, some of ouranchor players may end up marginalised, or being taken over. Still we have resolved to proceed,knowing that doing nothing would certainly lead us into more difficulty.The local banks are strengthening themselves to compete in an open domestic market, andinternationally. We have encouraged them to merge and consolidate with one another, or at least toform alliances and consolidate some of their back-end operations, so as to derive economies of scale.But the industry trends may be such that even this is not enough for them to hold their own against thelarge global banks. After all, even Deutsche Bank was not too big to feel the need for a merger partner.Local banks which want to be more than niche players may then need to contemplate not just foreignacquisitions, but cross-border partnerships with partners as large as or larger than themselves.The smaller European countries are wrestling with the same issue. In Scandinavia and the Beneluxcountries, the pressing need for economies of scale has forced major banks to look beyond theirdomestic markets for partnerships, and cross-border mergers have been common.In Singapore, the same thing is already happening in the telecommunications industry. The Govern-ment has decided to allow, and indeed to encourage, dominant local players like Singapore Telecom togo beyond foreign acquisitions, to seek foreign mergers. As Singapore banks increasingly confront thesame imperative, we will have to consider exactly how far we are willing to trade off retaining a fewSingaporean-controlled banks against the logic of globalisation.ConclusionThe Asian crisis has led to a rethink of the consensus in favour of globalisation and free capital flows.The result has been to reaffirm the logic of globalisation, and the value of free markets and free trade.But it has also caused a more sober appreciation of the risks of international flows of capital, andclarified the necessary preconditions for countries to minimise the difficulties and reap the benefitsfrom freer capital flows.Singapore’s experience in bringing our financial sector up to best practices during and after the crisisshows how complex and delicate a task it is, despite Singapore’s relatively strong starting point. It willbe even more challenging for countries in less favourable circumstances, to find their way forward inpost crisis Asia. In this quest, these countries deserve the full support of the international community.
1BIS Review 75/2000William J McDonough: The review of the Capital AccordRemarks by William J McDonough, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, before the Eleventh International Conference of Banking Supervisors, held inBasel, 20-21 September 2000.*      *      *I am greatly honored to be here as Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. I’d liketo begin by thanking the Swiss National Bank, Kurt Hauri and the Swiss Federal BankingCommission, and Andrew Crockett and the BIS for organizing and hosting this important conference.They’ve done a wonderful job, for which I know we’re all very grateful.It is also a great pleasure to be with you under such dramatically different circumstances than when welast gathered together. Just two years ago, turbulence in the financial markets around the world hadaffected, in one way or another, the banking systems of virtually every nation, and bank supervisorswere struggling to preserve confidence and stability. Today, of course, the global financial situation ismuch more stable and the outlook is very favorable.In the United States, we continue to enjoy the longest economic expansion in our nation’s history, and,following passage of financial modernization legislation, banks and other financial institutions nowenjoy unprecedented strategic opportunities.In Europe, following monetary union in January of 1999, the banking industry, along with othercorporate sectors, is becoming more efficient and competitive as economic and political reforms havesharpened the focus on shareholder value.In Asia, and in many emerging market economies, meaningful headway has been made towardrecapitalizing banking systems, ridding banks’ balance sheets of problem assets, and improvingsupervisory and regulatory frameworks. As a result, economies are growing again, equity marketshave rebounded, and foreign capital has begun to return. What a difference two years of hard work canmake.When I last addressed this conference in October of 1998, I said that bank supervisors have a specialrole in maintaining financial stability, and that our special role has two components: facilitating theresolution of problems when they occur, and taking the necessary steps to lower the risk of problemsoccurring. Two years ago we were busy with the first component – crisis management and resolution.Today, as we stand on the threshold of a new century, we have the opportunity to focus on the second– prevention.With that in mind, it is my view that the greatest challenge to the long-term goal of financial stability,both locally and globally, is the accelerating pace of change and financial innovation, driven by thesteady march of technological advancement. To be sure, such rapid change has created unprecedentedopportunities for both producers and consumers of financial products and services. But it must also beacknowledged that with such remarkable progress has come new, more complex and potentially far-reaching risks.I’d like to begin by addressing the profound impact of today’s technology on banking and the financialmarkets, then move on to the implications of that impact for effective supervision in the twenty-firstcentury. On the subject of official supervision, I will discuss the Basel Committee’s Core Principlesfor Effective Supervision, and then conclude with an update on the Committee’s major initiative torevise and refine the 1988 Capital Accord.
BIS Review 75/20002Technology changing the world, banking and supervisionIt’s been said that information is power. Whoever said that surely never had to deal with the flood ofe-mail most of us receive each day. Indeed, with increasing frequency, the complaint nowadays isabout “information overload.” With wireless communications enabling us to conduct businessanytime, anywhere, I sometimes feel, as I’m sure many of you do, that no matter where I am in theworld, I’m expected to be awake and working.For those who occasionally feel overwhelmed by technology’s marvels, it’s worth remembering thatthere was a time, and not so long ago, when reliable market information was decidedly scarce andconcentrated in the hands of a privileged few. The Rothschilds built an international banking empireon the wings of carrier pigeons, whose messages enabled the brothers to buy and sell on informationabout investment opportunities or financial disasters in distant places long before their competitorsheard the news.Today, information of all kinds is transmitted easily, inexpensively and instantaneously around theworld, providing finger-tip access to anyone with a laptop computer, cellular phone or palm pilot. Asbut one example, I’d mention that, as of last month, the most popular items on the Federal Reserve’spublic web site – including statistical reports on foreign exchange rates, selected interest rates,consumer credit and industrial production, along with press releases and Federal Open MarketCommittee announcements – are accessible by wireless remote.If information is power, and it surely is, then a profound and irreversible transfer of power isunderway in the global financial marketplace – from providers of products and services to consumers.For example, the Internet – something most of us had never heard of five years ago – is changing howconsumers shop for financial products and services, the prices they pay, and with which providers theyestablish relationships.In response, financial institutions, who once viewed technology mainly as a cost center, now see theInternet and other technological capacities as strategic tools for enhancing the value of customerrelationship through cross-selling and improved customization. A recent survey of bank managers inthe United States reported that, for the first time, investment in Internet technology was cited as thetop budgetary priority, ahead of items such as investments in call-centers and brick-and-mortarbranches.The growing importance of the Internet as a distribution channel is also eroding traditional barriersbetween financial service providers and technology firms. Banks are increasingly providingtechnology services, such as account reconciliation software and “web-enabling” assistance, whiletechnology firms are making inroads into services once the domain of banks and brokerage firms, suchas financial planning and bill payment. Indeed, many banks are beginning to think of technology firmsas competitors – or are contemplating ways to partner with them.I’d guess that most of us, perhaps even all of us, consider the advancement of computing andinformation technologies, and their role in the development of ever-more sophisticated financialinstruments and techniques, to be decidedly positive developments. Such technologies, and theinnovation they enable, have reduced the costs of financial transactions, improved the allocation offinancial resources, increased the competitiveness and efficiency of financial institutions and markets,and opened new avenues through which individuals and institutions can better diversify and hedgetheir risks.But with this progress has also come new and difficult challenges. The rapid pace of technologicaladvancement and financial innovation has introduced new, highly complex elements of risk, increasedthe speed and volatility of the markets, and blurred the barriers between previously distinct sectors ofthe financial marketplace.Even as supervisors confront change, the fundamental questions remain the same. Where is the risk inbanks’ activities, and how effectively are they managing it? Where are banks extending credit and inwhat form? Who are banks’ customers, and how are those customers changing? To what extent arecredit risks being transformed into liquidity and operational risks?
3BIS Review 75/2000The difference today is that the timeframe for answering these fundamental questions is dramaticallyshortened. As supervisors, we must be able to look at rapidly changing financial institutions and assesswhether their strategies make sense and whether they are effectively evaluating the risks associatedwith executing those strategies.Technology and innovation have also rendered geographic boundaries all but meaningless, andundermined the power and control of financial authorities. As you know, one of the principal means ofsupervising internationally active banks has been the process whereby the host supervisor approves theestablishment of a brick-and-mortar presence in its country or jurisdiction. By way of a web-basedplatform, banks can now target customers far beyond the reach of a typical branch, and even crossborders into countries where they have no local offices and may never have conducted businessbefore. We’ve already seen a few cases in which a bank is chartered in one country, handles its dataprocessing in another, and targets customers in still others. Such situations will surely challengetraditional notions of “home” and “host” supervisor, and raise difficult issues regarding internationalcoordination and cooperation, information sharing, law enforcement and privacy.In a world of instantaneous communication, interconnected markets, and more complex instrumentsand risks, effective supervision is more important than ever to maintaining financial stability, bothlocally and globally. To remain effective and relevant, supervisors must understand how and to whatextent the “wired” economy and other technologies are changing banking and finance. At the sametime, we must take care that our efforts to ensure the safe and sound operation of the financial marketsdo not stifle the innovation and creative energy that is changing banking and finance – indeed, theworld – for the better.With these thoughts in mind, it is my firm conviction that to successfully meet the challenges of thetwenty-first century, our very notion of supervision, broadly speaking, must evolve to include financialinstitutions themselves and the discipline applied by the marketplace.Supervision in the twenty-first centuryAnd so what is the purpose of supervision in the twenty-first century? What are the objectives, andhow can those objectives be best pursued?Let me say first of all that there is no easy or single answer to these questions. The twenty-first centuryfinancial marketplace is too dynamic, too complex, and supervisors must work within the politicalrealities of our respective nations. What I envision is a flexible, multi-faceted strategy that emphasizesprudence and problem prevention, compatibility with the market, and a close and cooperative workingrelationship between the private and public sector.With these priorities in mind, I believe there are three essential elements of a modern supervisionframework:• effective bank-level management;• market discipline; and,• official supervision.Let me discuss each of these in turn, noting that each should reinforce the others to effectivelypromote a safe and sound financial system.Effective bank-level managementPrimary responsibility for the safe and sound operation of a banking institution lies with its board ofdirectors and senior management. Boards of directors should oversee the development of the overallstrategy of the organization and the decisions made by senior management in pursuit of those strategicobjectives. In effectively executing these responsibilities, boards make a critical contribution to thelong-term success of the institution. This is a fundamental principal of banking that has not changedwith technological advancement. Indeed, if anything, the greater complexity and sophistication of the
BIS Review 75/20004modern financial services firm require more energy, effort and expertise from directors than everbefore.I see two areas of board operation as being particularly crucial. First, banks and other financialinstitutions must ensure that specific skills and competencies, consistent with the institution’s strategicfocus, are represented on their boards. Institutions that engage in complex credit or market activities,utilize sophisticated financial products, or expand their Internet or e-commerce capabilities, shouldinclude one or more board directors with pertinent expertise in such areas.Second, boards should establish clear guidelines regarding the independence of their directors.Generally, it is desirable for at least some directors, and perhaps a majority, to be independent andfrom outside the ranks of the management of the institution. Further, the board should set parametersregarding at what point, or under what circumstances, a director’s outside business interest becomes sosignificant as to raise questions of a possible conflict.Serious measures to ensure relevant competencies and independence will greatly enhance boards’effectiveness and go a long way toward ensuring they perform their increasingly critical role inoverseeing the decisions of senior management.The role of senior management, in turn, is to set the business strategy, oversee day-to-day decisionsmade within the organization, and ensure their consistency with long-term objectives and policies asdetermined by the board.There are several aspects to effective bank-level management. First, I would underscore theimportance of good corporate governance, the basic elements of which include:• Independent and competent outside directors, as I mentioned a moment ago;• Capable and experienced management;• A coherent corporate strategy and business plan; and,• Clear lines of responsibility and accountability.Together, these elements contribute to an overall operating process conducive to long-term health andprosperity. A tightly run ship with a disciplined crew led by an experienced and competent cadre ofofficers is far better able to survive a long journey that will inevitably confront sudden storms.Closely related to good corporate governance and critical to any banking institution’s well-being is arigorous internal control apparatus. Of course, effective internal control systems have always beencentrally important to sound banking. This point becomes clear if we consider for a moment theirbasic purposes:• To provide reasonable assurance that the bank’s and its customers’ assets are safeguarded,that its information is timely and reliable, and that errors and irregularities are discoveredand corrected promptly;• To promote the bank’s operational efficiency; and,• To ensure compliance with managerial policies, laws, regulations and sound fiduciaryprinciples.With these purposes in mind, it is clear that the long-term success of any banking organizationdepends on the effectiveness of its internal control apparatus.And never has this been more true than today. As the activities of commercial banks have becomeincreasingly diverse and complex, internal controls have become critically important to the sound andsuccessful execution of banks’ strategic objectives.I want to stress this point as strongly as I can. As a former commercial banker myself, I know there isa powerful temptation for management to focus its attention and resources on the front office – thoseareas and individuals that generate profits for the institution. But if something goes wrong in the backoffice, it can quickly become the most important aspect of a bank’s operations. We’ve seen this time
5BIS Review 75/2000and time again. It is essential that sufficient resources, staff and managerial attention are devoted to theback office and internal audit functions.Firmly rooted on the foundation of good corporate governance and rigorous internal controls is thecentral importance of effective risk management. Banking by its very nature is a business of takingcalculated risks. If they didn’t take risks, banks could not perform their essential functions in a marketeconomy. But sound banking also entails the prudent management of those unavoidable risks. Eachbanking institution must have in place the technical systems and management processes necessary toidentify the risks associated with its activities – lending and otherwise – and to effectively measure,monitor and control those risks.But even if an institution has an effective risk management and control structure in place, that structuremust also be accompanied by an institutional management culture that ensures that written policiesand procedures are actually translated into practice, with buy-in at all staff levels. Ultimately, aninstitution's culture is determined – once again – by the board of directors and the senior managementit chooses to install. Management must take active steps to ensure that its commitment to an operatingenvironment that includes effective risk management and rigorous controls filters down the line of theorganization.To summarize, these aspects of effective bank level management – good corporate governance,rigorous internal controls and effective risk management – represent the first and most important lineof defense against potential problems. And this will increasingly be the case as the activities of banksand other financial institutions become more complex and more global.Market disciplineAfter effective management at the bank level, the second line of defense against financial instability ismarket discipline, which is an increasingly important ally of the official supervisor. When armed withtimely and meaningful information on banks’ performance, market participants can, by way of theirinvestment and credit decisions, encourage bank managers and boards of directors to manage their riskexposures soundly. Equally as important, market participants can penalize those institutions that donot.But, of course, effective market discipline is not possible without meaningful public disclosure. Whilesignificant progress has been made in recent years, it unfortunately remains the case that disclosurepractices have not kept pace with the rapid changes in banks’ business activities and risk exposures,and with how these exposures are measured and managed.For this situation to be fully remedied, notions of what is proprietary information and what should bein the public domain must change. Knowing a company’s appetite for risk and its approach to, andmethodologies for, managing risk is essential to understanding the risks of being a shareholder, acreditor or a counterparty. All financial market participants should approach the issue of disclosure asusers of financial statements rather than as issuers.There should be little question about the urgency of achieving dramatic progress in this area. Clearly, afull appreciation of risk cannot be achieved without sufficient information. All of us know that there isno greater enemy to financial stability than a loss of confidence – and nothing undermines confidencemore than a lack of reliable information. Discipline imposed by markets might not be pleasant, butmore, higher quality information – in a word, transparency – bolsters the confidence of depositors andother creditors and therefore makes doing business easier and more secure for everyone.Of course, progress on the disclosure front will be limited until accounting standards are enhanced toensure proper valuation and to reflect innovations over the past decade, both in terms of new productsand modern risk management techniques. Accounting systems serve a variety of purposes, but nonemore important than helping creditors and investors make rigorous and clear-eyed decisions as towhich enterprises meet market tests of efficiency, competitiveness and profitability that are necessaryto fulfill their obligations. Sound accounting systems also enable investors to determine the value ofenterprises, and, in so doing, assist in attracting capital, both foreign and domestic. With these
BIS Review 75/20006important purposes in mind, ongoing efforts to enhance accounting standards worldwide shouldcontinue and even intensify.There is also a need for greater harmonization of accounting standards across countries. We simplymust get to a point where supervisors and market participants alike can analyze and compare allinternationally active financial institutions on a consistent basis. And it will not be possible to haveuniform capital standards until we have achieved some consistency in accounting standards acrosscountries. I applaud the significant progress being made by the International Accounting StandardsCommittee and look forward to the continued cooperation between the Basel Committee and the IASCtoward achieving the goal of harmonization.Official supervisionWhile effective bank level management and meaningful market discipline are crucial elements of anoverall strategy for promoting and preserving financial stability, neither can substitute for the criticalrole played by official supervision. While banks perform functions that are indispensable to thesuccess of any market economy, these same functions, by their very nature, introduce risks that arecapable of undermining the prospects for such success.This reality was acknowledged by Adam Smith over two centuries ago in his seminal tract The Wealthof Nations. And it is with this fundamental reality in mind that governments have long recognized thatbanking and other financial institutions must be subject to at least some form of regulation and officialoversight.The reasons for official supervisory intervention in the banking and financial system can be summedup as promoting financial stability and minimizing systemic risk. This is a broad mandate – to ensurethat markets operate in a fair, transparent, and efficient manner, and that participants comply with therules of the game. To successfully fulfill this critical responsibility, it is clear that the fundamentalapproach, scope and methodologies of official supervision must evolve in line with the way financialinstitutions manage their activities, which increasingly is along business lines rather than legal entities.With this in mind, supervisors should continue efforts to develop a more dynamic, risk-focused andprocess-oriented framework, reflecting the reality that banks and other financial institutions areincreasingly able to alter their risk profiles at will. By “risk-focused,” I mean that supervisoryresources should be directed at the most material risks to which an institution and its capital areexposed, given its array of business activities. By “process-oriented,” I mean that examiners andauditors should determine whether management processes and methodologies are sufficiently rigorousand effective, given the institution’s identified risks. Institutions that demonstrate a sound controlstructure and effective management processes should be subject to less intrusive supervision thaninstitutions that do not have this essential infrastructure in place.The Core PrinciplesSpecific supervisory arrangements, practices and techniques vary from country to country dependingon differences in culture, financial system structure and internal political realities. The diversity ofpractices notwithstanding, a set of basic principles has be identified that should guide all supervisors inan increasingly interconnected, global financial marketplace.In 1997 the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision issued a set of twenty-five Core Principles forEffective Bank Supervision to serve as a benchmark against which the effectiveness of differentsupervisory regimes can be assessed.The Core Principles document brings together concisely all of the fundamental elements needed tocarry out effective bank supervision – a remarkable achievement in its own right. Equally important,in my view, the document also balances the desire to set high standards for supervisory practices withthe pragmatic recognition that not all countries are in the same stage of financial market development.As such, the Core Principles document is of particular importance for developing market economies,
7BIS Review 75/2000as it establishes a clear set of standards against which any country’s current approaches and progresscan be measured.It should be emphasized that, in attempting to craft a document that would have the legitimacy, qualityand flexibility to meet the needs of bank supervisors around the world, the Committee made aconscious effort to consult broadly throughout the various stages of the project, and particularly withsupervisors from emerging market nations. Only through an inclusive approach could we designcomprehensive principles with broad applicability and support.In October of last year, the Basel Committee, in cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank,produced a follow-up document called the Core Principles Methodology. This report was initiated inresponse to requests from a number of countries for additional guidance on how to interpret andimplement the Core Principles. The Methodology document provides specific criteria for evaluatingand implementing each Core Principle. One set of criteria focuses on issues deemed essential for theminimum implementation of the Core Principles; the other focuses on those issues deemed torepresent “best practice.” The IMF and the World Bank currently use the new methodology to assessthe banking sectors in individual countries.It should be stressed that the most important efforts to implement the Core Principles are occurring inindividual countries and, with this in mind, I am pleased to say that approximately 120 countries havenow endorsed the Core Principles. Without the support and backing of national authorities to followthrough with the implementation of these principles, our broader efforts simply cannot be effective.In this connection, the Basel Committee has long recognized the need for effective training ofparticipants in the global supervision community, and over the years has sponsored numerousprograms which have been beneficial in allowing supervisors from different countries to shareexperiences and exchange ideas for improved practices. In 1998, the Basel Committee, along with theBank for International Settlements, jointly established the Financial Stability Institute, which conductsleadership seminars for supervisors in emerging market countries and facilitates technical assistance.Effort to revise the Basel AccordLet me move on to the Basel Committee’s initiative to revise the 1988 Capital Accord. As you wellknow, capital has been, and continues to be, an important supervisory tool.Since 1988, capital regulation has evolved around a set of minimum ratios that were devised by theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision and set forth in a document known as the Basel Accord.The Accord was, without question, a milestone achievement – for the first time, supervisors were ableto use a common yardstick for assessing banks’ capital adequacy. The development of risk-basedcapital ratios has helped to strengthen capital standards in the more than 100 countries that adopted theAccord.In recent years, however, the Accord has exhibited serious shortcoming. One significant weakness isthat the Accord’s broad brush structure may provide banks with an unintended incentive to take onhigher risk exposures without requiring them to hold a commensurate amount of capital. It also has notkept pace with innovations in the way that banks measure, manage and mitigate risk.With these concerns in mind, in June of 1999 the Basel Committee released a Consultative Paper for anew capital adequacy framework. While we knew this paper would not represent a perfect frameworkfor all banks, our aim was to release a credible package that would serve as a basis for discussion. Weactively sought feedback from the industry worldwide during the formal comment period that endedon 31 March of this year, and we are continuing this dialogue.I should note that we are very pleased and encouraged by the more than 200 comments received froma variety of sources, including financial institutions, central banks and supervisors, non-G10 countriesand other market participants. The respondents on the whole have sent us a strong endorsement of ouroverall goal of developing a capital framework comprised of three pillars – minimum capitalstandards, supervisory review and market discipline – that is more risk reflective and appropriate tobanks of varying levels of sophistication.
BIS Review 75/20008At the same time, the respondents raised a number of important concerns and questions that theCommittee is reviewing and considering carefully. The comments offered by emerging market andother “non-G10” countries have figured prominently into the Committee’s review of its initialproposal, and Claes Norgren, who is chairing the next session, will provide an update on theCommittee’s thinking regarding these points.I’d like to take a few minutes to update you on our efforts, focusing on a few topics of special interest.Given the progress we have already made, it is clear to me that the Committee is well positioned tocontinue its momentum and to release a revised Consultative Paper early next year.Internal ratings-based approachThe centerpiece of the new Accord is likely to be the internal ratings-based approach to credit risk. Weenvision that the internal ratings method will be applicable to those institutions that have in placestrong internal rating systems accompanied by robust internal controls. Naturally, our new standardswill also encompass guidance on supervisory oversight and provide for ample disclosure.The Committee is looking to establish standards that are rigorous and yet permit institutions willing tomake the necessary investments to use the approach. I think that it is fair to say that the Committeenow expects that many sophisticated institutions will seek to use the internal ratings-based approach.How will an internal ratings-based approach work? Simply described, there are three components tothe internal ratings-based approach being developed by the Committee. First, a bank would assigneach of its loans or exposures to an internal grade, which reflects the risk associated to lending to eachborrower. A bank would do so by using the expert judgment of senior lenders and its own well-definedinternal rating scale and criteria. The bank would then assess the likelihood of default of borrowers ineach internal grade, based on its own analysis. Many larger banks are doing this now. It is thisassessment of the probability of default that is the core of the internal ratings-based approach.The second step is for the bank to assess the severity of loss should a loan default – most often referredto as the Loss Given Default. The Committee currently envisions two internal ratings-basedapproaches, a foundation approach and an advanced approach with even higher minimum standards. Akey distinction is that under the foundation approach, banks would use supervisory estimates of loss-given-default based on loan characteristics, while under the advanced approach, they could make useof their own analysis.The third step is to derive the bank’s capital requirement. The Committee will set out the risk weightsthat correspond to different estimated probabilities of default and loss-given-default. These riskweights are being developed by the Committee as a measure of unexpected loss, reflecting the amountof potential credit loss for each loan.A key aspect of the internal ratings-based approach is the development of rigorous supervisorystandards for the assignment and quantification of internal ratings. An essential component of thesestandards is the so-called “use test” that requires a system of internal ratings to be an integral part of abank’s risk management and own assessment of capital adequacy. The internal reliance on these riskratings will not only help supervisors gain confidence in the accuracy of a bank’s ratings system, butwill also provide a key link to the proposed second pillar of the Accord, supervisory review.Other work on minimum capital requirementsWhile the focus of my remarks has been on the internal ratings-based approach, the Committee also isworking on other key aspects of the new framework, including revising the standardized approach,developing an expanded treatment of credit risk mitigation techniques and assessing a capital chargefor operational risk.
9BIS Review 75/2000Standardized approachThe Basel Committee remains dedicated to revising the standardized approach as banks andsupervisors in some countries may not yet have the necessary resources to implement an internalratings-based method. To improve the risk sensitivity of the standardized approach, the Committeesought to establish capital requirements that recognized some differences in the probability of defaultbetween borrowers. At the same time, the Committee sought to be attentive to the views of manybankers and supervisors who wanted the standardized approach to remain simple so that banks of allsizes and levels of sophistication could implement it. It consequently proposed the use of externalcredit assessments, such as credit ratings, as a means for helping to assign risk weights, and hencecapital charges, on claims.We were pleased that on the whole respondents agreed with the goal of increasing the sensitivity ofthe standardized approach to credit risk. Nonetheless, given the difficulty of achieving the rightbalance between sensitivity and simplicity, the proposal to base the standardized approach on externalcredit rating agencies’ ratings has raised real concerns. Some have noted that, especially in emergingmarket countries, very few borrowers have credit ratings, and the new framework might then not beable to differentiate credit risk substantially between borrowers. Some also raised questions about theperformance record of some ratings agencies, particularly in the context of various regional financialcrises around the world.Unfortunately, few alternatives were suggested during the comment period. Still, we remain open tofresh ideas and are working hard to address the concerns noted. For example, we are exploring the useof other indicators of a borrower’s credit quality to differentiate between risk exposures in a way thatcould be applied by any bank. Moreover, in response to suggestions made by commentators that thestandardized approach could be expanded to allow for even greater risk differentiation, the Committeeis actively evaluating whether it would be feasible to incorporate additional risk weights, particularlyfor corporate claims and the riskiest assets held by banks. Aligning the capital charges in thestandardized approach more closely with economic risk while retaining relative simplicity is animportant goal, as the Committee wishes to ensure that all banks worldwide that look to the Accord asthe benchmark can subscribe to the new framework.Credit risk mitigation techniquesThe Committee is also looking to allow for greater recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques,such as collateral, guarantees and credit derivatives, while at the same time addressing potential risksthat remain from their use. As we finalize our proposals, we are working to ensure that there is a highdegree of consistency between the treatment of risk mitigation techniques under the standardized andinternal ratings-based approaches, though the two are likely to differ in some respects.Operational riskThe Committee recognizes that in refining the measurement of credit risk, it is also important toconsider the coverage of other important risks, such as operational risk. The announcement of ourintention to incorporate an explicit capital charge for operational risk in the new capital framework hashad a catalytic effect on the industry, which is striving to improve its measurement capabilities in thisarea. The Committee wants to maintain this momentum. It is working closely with the industry todevelop an “evolutionary” approach to operational risk that would reward banks that improve theirrisk management and measurement capabilities. We intend to include this approach in the nextConsultative Paper.Pillar 2: Supervisory ReviewLet me also briefly touch upon the two other pillars of the revised capital adequacy framework –supervisory review and market discipline. These topics are certainly familiar and important ones to allof you.
BIS Review 75/200010As I mentioned in the context of the internal ratings-based approach, supervisory review of capital is acritical complement to minimum capital requirements. The task for supervisors in the revisedframework is to evaluate how well banks are assessing their capital needs relative to their risks,including whether banks are appropriately addressing the relationship between different types of risk.I want to stress that this proposed approach is in no way intended to replace the judgement andexpertise of bank management, or to shift responsibility for capital adequacy to supervisors. On thecontrary, it is well understood that bank managers have the most complete understanding of the riskstheir institutions face, and it is they who have primary responsibility for managing those risks. Mostimportantly, in proposing this second pillar, the Committee intends to foster a more active dialoguebetween banks and their supervisors, such that when deficiencies develop, prompt and decisive actioncan be taken to restore capital.Pillar 3: Market DisciplineThe third pillar of the new capital adequacy framework, market discipline, will serve to reinforcecapital regulation and other supervisory efforts to promote the safety and soundness of banks andfinancial systems. To this end, the Committee has been working to formulate a set of disclosurerequirements that will ensure the availability of sufficient information to assess the appropriateness ofa bank’s capital relative to risk, while taking into account the bank’s proprietary needs. This isparticularly important in relation to the internal ratings approach to credit risk.In January of this year, the Committee issued a discussion paper detailing guidance for strengtheningthe third pillar of the new capital framework. This paper provides recommendations on disclosures ofbanks’ capital structures, risk exposures and capital adequacy. The Committee is continuing to expandon these recommendations as its work on the first and second pillars of the new capital frameworkevolves.As the Committee continues to fine-tune the new capital framework, we are focusing on issues ofprimary concern to the industry and supervisors world-wide, seeking to avoid getting bogged down insecondary issues that could slow the overall process. This most certainly is a broad-scoped effort thatwill not, indeed cannot, meet every priority and concern of everyone. But we are well aware that theperfect cannot be the enemy of the good. With this in mind, I fully expect that we will meet our goalof releasing a new capital adequacy framework by early next year, followed by a short internationalcomment period and then implementation in each of the member countries.ConclusionIn conclusion, let me simply say that the dawn of the twenty-first century is a time of unprecedentedopportunities and unique challenges for financial institutions and supervisors alike. In meeting thechallenges posed by technological advancements and the rapid innovations they enable, and inpursuing the objective of a modern, flexible yet stable financial system, we must acknowledge thatboth the public and private sectors have a critical role to play.While the perspectives of market participants and official supervisors may differ from time to time,our objective is the same – to maintain a strong and vibrant financial system. Indeed, it is evident tome, as a former commercial banker and now as a supervisor, that only if we work together, eachmeeting our responsibilities and reinforcing the other, will we be able to successfully manage a rapidlyevolving, ever-more complex financial services industry.
1BIS Review 74/2000Gordon Thiesssen: The outlook for the Canadian economyand the conduct of monetary policyRemarks by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Calgary Chamber ofCommerce, Calgary, on 14 September 2000.*      *      *Today, I would like to bring you up to date on the Bank of Canada’s views about the outlook for theCanadian economy. Prospects for the period ahead are generally very favourable. But, as is often thecase, there are also uncertainties that the Bank will have to deal with as it pursues its objective ofkeeping the economy on a sustainable, non-inflationary track. Dealing with such uncertainties presentsa constant challenge for the Bank in its job of conducting monetary policy.Another part of our job involves always looking at ways to enhance the effectiveness of policy - byreducing uncertainty about our actions, by increasing transparency and accountability, and bybroadening public awareness of how monetary policy works. Today, I want to outline some newprocedures for announcing changes in official interest rates that we plan to introduce later this autumn.We believe that these procedures should help improve the effectiveness of monetary policy in Canada.But first let me give you an update on the current economic situation.Economic updateThe Canadian economy has been expanding strongly for some time now, and particularly sincemid-1999. Indeed, between mid-1999 and mid-2000, it grew by about 5¼%.Through much of that 12-month period, economic growth outstripped expectations. In part, this can beattributed to the spillover of greater-than-anticipated demand from the United States.The rapid growth of the American economy has been confounding observers for quite some time now.And, as might be expected, buoyant US demand has been pressing against that economy’s capacity toproduce. One safety valve that has helped to relieve the pressures on US capacity has been the inflowof goods and services from abroad.Canada’s export industries have benefited greatly from this spillover of excess demand from theUnited States. Not only have these exports contributed directly to the rapid economic expansion inCanada, they have been a source of encouragement that has added to the surge in purchases ofmachinery and equipment by Canadian businesses. And, of course, the recent gains in employmentand incomes in the export sector have strengthened the momentum of spending by Canadianhouseholds.Together, buoyant exports, strong investment by domestic businesses, and robust household spendinghave led to a surprisingly strong demand for Canadian goods and services.What is remarkable under the circumstances is that pressures on the basic trend of inflation in Canadahave been minimal.Now, I know that the 12-month rate of increase in the total consumer price index has risen to around3% because of the sharp rise in energy prices. Although these higher prices have boosted activity forCanada’s energy producers, they are also raising living costs for most Canadians.The Bank remains fully committed to preserving an environment of low and stable inflation. Butmonetary policy can control only the future trend of inflation - not the temporary ups and downscaused by movements in the prices of very volatile items such as energy and food. Of course, if therewas evidence that higher energy prices were beginning to feed into prices of other goods and services,
BIS Review 74/20002or into expectations about the future trend of inflation, that would be different. But so far, this has notbeen the case.In order to get a better fix on the underlying trend of inflation, we should look at the Bank’s coremeasure of inflation - the measure that excludes fluctuations in energy and food prices and the effectsof changes in indirect taxes. This core measure has remained in the bottom half of the 1 to 3% targetrange we have set for controlling inflation.This is somewhat lower than we had expected. It suggests that total demand, although stronger thananticipated, may not have been putting as much pressure on our economy’s production capacity as wehad thought at the beginning of the year.The economic outlookLet me now shift to the Bank’s view on the outlook for the economy.When it comes to monetary policy, “looking ahead” is very important. Why? Because the actions thatyour central bank takes today will not have their full effect on the economy and on prices for another18 to 24 months. That is why the Bank must always base its decisions on a judgment about futureeconomic growth and future inflation.The Bank’s latest projection for economic growth in 2000 (published in the August Monetary PolicyReport Update) is within a range of 4¼ to 4¾% - somewhat higher than we had expected in the spring.This projection assumes a slowing through the balance of the year from the very rapid pace of the firsthalf. But, even then, output will probably be growing faster than production capacity; and so pressureson capacity are likely to increase. Because of this, we are predicting that the core measure of inflationwill move up to 2% - the centre of the Bank’s 1 to 3% target range - by early next year. At the sametime, if world crude oil prices stabilize, we expect that the rate of increase in the total CPI willgradually come down and eventually converge with our core measure of inflation.But, as I said before, there are a number of uncertainties attached to this projection. The mostimportant uncertainties revolve around future developments in the US economy. Will that economyslow to a more sustainable pace? Or will there be another surprising spillover of US demand into ourexports? Right now, it looks as if the growth of spending by US households is moderating.What if the American economy does not slow fast enough to prevent a rise in US inflation? Will thathave a significant adverse effect on expectations of inflation in Canada? This is where the Bank’scommitment to keeping the trend of inflation within the target range really comes into play. Our role isto reassure Canadians, by seeing to it that inflation here remains low and stable even if US inflationrises.Another major area of uncertainty has to do with our economy’s capacity to produce. As I said earlier,our remarkable inflation record to date suggests that there was probably still some excess capacity inthe economy in the early part of this year. Although our projection assumes that pressures on capacitywill contribute to an increase in the underlying trend of inflation - from around 1½% now to 2% nextyear - there is, in fact, a significant margin of uncertainty around these numbers.It is possible that the investment boom we have witnessed in Canada since 1996 will increaseproductivity growth and capacity more quickly than we are allowing for. There is a good deal ofanecdotal evidence that some of the American experience (burgeoning investments in technologyleading to robust productivity gains) is being replicated in Canada. Until recently, there had been littleevidence of this in our official, economy-wide productivity statistics. But there was a significant gainin productivity in the data for the second quarter of this year that were released recently. Of course, itremains to be seen whether this will continue.
3BIS Review 74/2000Monetary policy responseHow has monetary policy responded to all this? Because of the surprisingly strong momentum ofdemand in Canada since mid-1999, and because of the likelihood that this could lead to inflationpressures in the future, the Bank of Canada raised interest rates four times - by a total of1¼ percentage points - between November 1999 and May 2000.These four interest rate increases followed similar actions by the US central bank. The FederalReserve’s assessment that interest rate increases were necessary because the growth of demand in thatcountry continued to outstrip the growth of supply, was an important factor in our decision to matchthose moves. The reason was that this implied a continued spillover of US demand into Canada, whichwould add to the already buoyant growth in spending by Canadian households and businesses.This additional external demand for our products, at a time when domestic demand here was alreadybrisk, essentially increased the risks that we would run into capacity constraints and pressures oninflation.Clearly, US economic and financial developments will always be relevant for Canada. After all, we doover 80% of our foreign trade with that country. And US financial markets have an importantinfluence on interest rates worldwide, including ours. But that does not mean that the Bank of Canadamust always follow the Federal Reserve, or that interest rate levels here and in the United States mustbe the same.The job of Canadian monetary policy is to respond to trends in our own economy. Naturally, becauseof the close ties between Canada and the United States, economic trends in the two countries are oftensimilar, and may require similar policy responses. But this is not always the case. Since mid-1999, theAmericans have raised their interest rates on six occasions. We have raised ours four times. Moreover,Canadian interest rates continue to be below US rates because inflation here has been lower and oureconomy has not been growing as quickly, or for as long, as theirs (so that the risks of pressures oncapacity and inflation in Canada are not as intense).Still, I can appreciate that, when our economies move together, people may find Canadian monetarypolicy difficult to interpret - particularly when the Bank has moved immediately to match increases inUS policy rates. On those occasions, there has been a tendency to conclude that either the Bank doesnot have much choice but to follow, or that it must have targets for the Canadian dollar that requireinterest rates here to move in lock-step with US rates.Neither of these assumptions is correct. When US monetary authorities take a policy action, the Banklooks carefully at the reasons behind the move and at what it all means for our ongoing assessment ofthe outlook for total demand and inflation in Canada. Our job is to do what we think is necessary tokeep our economy on a non-inflationary, and thus more sustainable, growth path.New procedures for announcing monetary policy actionsI would now like to turn to another aspect of the way we conduct monetary policy in this country.As I said at the outset, the Bank is constantly searching for ways to enhance the effectiveness ofmonetary policy.Over the past couple of years, we have been looking at how other major central banks go aboutannouncing changes in official interest rates, and we have been assessing whether our currentarrangements could be improved. We have noted that most foreign central banks announce theirdecisions on interest rates only on certain dates that are set well in advance. In the United States, thishas been the practice for some time. And now it is also the case in the other major economies(Japan, the euro zone and the United Kingdom) as well as in a number of smaller industrial countries(eg Sweden, Australia and New Zealand).After carefully considering all the relevant issues, we have concluded that pre-set dates for announcinginterest rate actions would improve the implementation and effectiveness of Canadian monetarypolicy.
BIS Review 74/20004We have decided that eight specified dates per year would be appropriate in the Canadian context. Thescheduling of these eight dates would be based on the timing of the flows of economic informationthat the Bank relies on to gauge the economic situation in Canada, to make projections, and to assessthe need for monetary policy action. Each of these eight dates would be separated from US policyaction dates by a week or more. In preparing to move to this new system, we will be consultinginterested parties on the most appropriate day of the week and time of day for announcing interest ratechanges.The way we see it, this new approach has several advantages over the existing arrangements,advantages that should contribute to a more effective monetary policy. I would like to briefly highlightsome of these benefits.To begin with, the new arrangements should reduce uncertainty in financial markets about the timingof policy actions. Under the current system, the Bank can move interest rates on any business day(Monday to Friday), at 9 am because market participants are not sure exactly which day a change ininterest rates may be announced, trading can slow in the early morning, for several days, when there isan expectation that the Bank may move. Removing this uncertainty should improve market efficiencyand liquidity.We also believe that the new system will help to focus public attention more closely on economictrends here in Canada, and on the appropriate monetary policy response based on those critical trends.Let me explain.On each of the eight pre-set dates for interest rate action, the Bank would issue a press release thatwould give a brief assessment of the economic situation in Canada and explain why we chose either tochange interest rates or to leave them unchanged. This would also give us an opportunity to link thelatest developments more directly to the underlying economic trends in the medium term - the18 to 24 months over which the effects of monetary policy actions are spread. Integrating theinformation in these eight press releases with our other key monetary policy statements throughout theyear would provide a more regular, frequent, and continuous account of our views on the Canadianeconomy.In the end, if the Bank does its job of keeping people well informed, we expect that economic analysts,market participants, and the public generally will be clearer about the factors that influence monetarypolicy and will be in a better position to anticipate the direction of policy. This has certainly proven tobe the case in the United States, the euro zone, and the United Kingdom.There could, of course, be extreme cases that might call for an immediate policy response from theBank rather than waiting for the next scheduled announcement date. The new arrangements would notpreclude such an option. It would be used very infrequently, however, and only under extraordinarycircumstances.Details of this new approach to announcing interest rate changes will be issued next Tuesday and willbe posted on the Bank’s Web site, along with an invitation for comments from the public. We plan toimplement this system in the autumn, with the first date for interest rate action set for November 2000.Concluding remarksTo conclude, let me return to my main points regarding our economic situation.The Canadian economy has been performing very well in recent years and the Bank expects that it willcontinue to do so. The task for monetary policy is to ensure that the economy stays on an expandingbut non-inflationary path.Monetary policy faces some challenges in the period ahead - challenges arising from severaluncertainties surrounding the economic outlook. The key uncertainty is the future performance of theUS economy and the implications for Canada. From this perspective, what matters most is that theUS monetary authorities succeed in bringing their high-flying economy onto a more sustainable track.
5BIS Review 74/2000Another important challenge for monetary policy will be to keep demand and supply here at home inbalance at a time when the application of new technology may well be transforming Canada’seconomy and moving it onto a higher growth path. But we are not sure of that yet. While the recentproductivity gains are encouraging, it is too early to tell if this is the beginning of a sustainedimproved performance on this front.Because of this, the Bank will be closely watching all indicators that could provide early signs of suchan occurrence. But we must be careful not to let our hopes run ahead of reality and take risks withinflation. A flare-up in inflation and the higher interest rates that would go with it would discourageinvestments, especially those in high-tech equipment and software, that enhance productivity and areso crucial to improved economic performance in the future.The outlook for the Canadian economy is very promising. The best contribution the Bank can make torealizing this economic potential is to preserve the present environment of low and stable inflation. Forthis is what fosters sustained solid economic growth and improved standards of living over time. I canassure you that the Bank of Canada remains fully committed to the task.
1BIS Review 73/2000Mike Moore: Financial services and the WTORemarks by Mr Mike Moore, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, at a Working Dinnerof Central Bank Governors held at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel on11 September 2000 (prepared speech; not a verbatim transcription).*      *      *I am grateful for the opportunity to talk to you today. The timing is good because we have started newnegotiations on trade in services in the WTO that will certainly include talks on the liberalization oftrade in financial services, an area of great importance to you and to all WTO Members.Financial services has always been seen, from the start of the discussions about whether the GATTshould deal with services at all, as a special and controversial sector in terms of its strategicimportance and political sensitivity: not only is it the largest of all internationally traded services, andthe backbone of all other economic activity, but it is also a key tool for the control of nationaleconomies. For some governments the achievement of greater freedom and security to offer banking,securities and insurance services in foreign markets was the pre-eminent objective of the UruguayRound. Without the insistence of the banking and insurance industries of the US and other countrieson bringing trade in services, and financial services especially, under the framework of multilaterallaw, there would have been no services agreement in the WTO.In the early stages of services negotiations, many developing countries were hesitant. They feared thatcompetition and increased participation and influence of foreign financial institutions would threatentheir control of the key levers of the national economy, as well as their national financial institutions.But even in the developed world there were some underlying systemic doubts: finance ministries in anumber of countries were initially doubtful about the value of a multilateral approach to financialservices. They had been comfortable with bilateral negotiation of banking licenses and other rights -based mostly on reciprocity - and were not convinced of the virtues of granting most favouredtreatment, nor comfortable with the prospect of decisions being subject to dispute settlement in themultilateral framework. The relative openness of financial markets at the time, at least in thedeveloped world, made the need for change less obvious. It seemed worthwhile to embark onmultilateral negotiations only if the results promised something better than what was already there.And a key element in the calculus was how far developing countries would join in the negotiations.Two conflicting approaches - the high ambitions of some developed countries and the nervous cautionof developing countries - are reflected in the long history of the negotiations and in the GATS itself.The Agreement’s design - a framework of rules coupled with national schedules of commitments -allows governments to decide which sectors they will open to competition by guaranteeing the rightsof foreign suppliers and also the extent of those rights. The GATS commitments of many WTOMembers do not offer unrestricted access to their markets. But significant progress has been made, andthe groundwork completed for moving ahead with liberalization in future negotiations.Despite the tension and sensitivities surrounding the early discussions, today 106 WTO Members havecommitments in the sector - more than in any other sector except tourism. Not all of thosecommitments involve liberalization - often they are bindings of the existing level of access andregulation. Let us not forget that in trade negotiations liberalization is always incremental; in the caseof services this is more so since the principle of progressive liberalization has been expresslyrecognized.We sometimes forget that the financial services negotiations that successfully concluded in December1997 coincided with the financial crisis in Asia. Contrary to what some might have feared, the crisishad no impact on the negotiations: no country withdrew or wrote down the commitments it hadnegotiated. Even the Asian countries most seriously affected made commitments to improve access to
BIS Review 73/20002their markets for foreign financial institutions. They did so in the belief that stronger competition andgreater openness would make their national financial infrastructure stronger, not weaker. In fact, thecrisis seems to have strengthened the conviction that competitive financial markets are essential torestore confidence and induce the long-term investment needed for growth and development.Several factors made it easier for crisis-ridden countries to embrace the WTO negotiations. First, thenegotiations were not concerned with the liberalization of the capital account, but purely with theterms on which foreign suppliers would be allowed to do business, subject to whatever capital controlswere in force. While it is true that a government is required to allow capital flows when the countryhas a commitment liberalizing the supply of a service requiring such capital movement, the capitalaccount liberalization involved is limited in extent.Second, the liberalization of financial services trade takes place inside a system of rules andprocedures with the necessary flexibility and safeguard clauses to address prudential concerns.Governments are free to take any measure necessary to preserve the stability of the financial systemand also temporary, non-discriminatory restrictions on trade in services in the event of seriousbalance-of-payments and external financial difficulties. In fact, nothing in the services agreementcurtails governments’ ability to pursue sound macroeconomic and regulatory policies.Third, these particular negotiations were mostly about allowing foreign institutions to establish in themarket - entailing foreign direct investment - to provide services and bring technology, capital andexpertise with them. This was seen not as an additional threat, but as part of the answer to the crisis.Commitments in the WTO provide a guarantee that the terms and conditions on which investmentdecisions are made, and trade is carried on, are not going to change overnight. Since nothing chillsinvestment more than uncertainty about the direction of government policy, such guarantees arevaluable to traders and investors, as well as to governments wanting to attract foreign investment.The financial industry in the US, Europe and Japan has been active in formulating positions for thenegotiations that began this year. The liberalization of the rights of establishment and operation forsuppliers remains essential for the provision of most financial services, and there will be calls forfurther liberalization on this front. At the same time, technological advances in telecommunicationsand informatics are radically changing the manner in which financial services are traded, makingcross-border trade increasingly important. The negotiations will certainly seek improved access andgreater security for this type of trade. This issue is also relevant to the ongoing work on electroniccommerce.Now, what can we do to ensure successful conclusion of these negotiations? There is much that can bedone, especially in creating conditions favourable to further liberalization. Many countries,particularly developing countries, lack the necessary institutions, regulatory structures and legalframeworks needed to support a fast-changing, modern economy. In a sense we find ourselvesbetween two worlds - between an economic system which is increasingly global and a patchwork ofinstitutions and structures which remains largely national in scope.More generally, there is a continuing need for vigorous international dialogue and cooperation. Theefforts being made by the BIS and other international fora are critical for confidence and stability inthe financial systems of the world, which in turn is a key requirement for keeping the trading systemopen.We need to make the markets work. Adequate prudential regulation and supervision, enhancedtransparency and corporate governance, strengthened competition policy, provision of safety nets andproper legal and accounting systems are all preconditions for countries to be able to take advantage ofthe sizeable benefits of liberalization. Your contribution on these fronts is crucial to our efforts.Thank you.
1BIS Review 73/2000Willem F Duisenberg: Economic and monetary developmentsand other activities of the EurosystemIntroductory statement delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,at a hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Brussels, on 12 September 2000.*      *      *Today we shall continue our regular exchange of views on monetary policy and other activities of theEurosystem. I am glad to see that since our last meeting on 20 June the prospects for economic growthin the euro area have remained very favourable. At the same time, upward pressures on prices hademerged which needed to be addressed by the ECB in a timely manner and led to the decision on31 August to increase the ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. I shall start my remarks bycommenting in detail on this step and on our assessment of the monetary and economic developmentsin the euro area which underpinned our decision. Subsequently I shall address some other issues oftopical interest, namely the preparation of the euro cash changeover, the current efforts to improve theavailability of statistical data in the EU and the role of the ECB in the oversight of payment systems. Ishall then be happy to answer your questions.1.Economic and monetary developmentsTurning to the ECB’s decision to increase the ECB interest rates by 25 basis points on 31 August, Ishould like to start my explanations by pointing out that, prior to the interest rate hike, upside risks toprice stability were evident from both pillars of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.Starting with the first pillar, some moderation in the evolution of monetary aggregates has beengradually detectable over recent months. This could be related to the increase in short-term interestrates in the euro area over the course of this year, which has had a dampening effect on the demand forthe most liquid components of M3, namely those included in M1 (currency in circulation andovernight deposits, both of which bear little or no remuneration). However, in spite of the decelerationobserved recently, M3 growth has remained above the reference value. This, in part, reflects therelatively strong increase in nominal GDP in the euro area. Furthermore, in order to assess the overallliquidity situation in the euro area, we have to acknowledge that, owing to the protracted deviation ofM3 growth from the reference value which has occurred since the start of Stage Three of EMU, theactual level of the stock of M3 is much higher than the level implied by the reference value. Therefore,as also evidenced by the continued strong demand for credit in the private sector, liquidity in the euroarea continued to be ample until the early summer. Particularly in a phase of robust economic growth,the continuation of ample liquidity conditions would constitute a risk to price stability.As regards the information provided under the second pillar, the favourable picture of the economicoutlook of the euro area which we saw in June has been confirmed over the past few months. Thisapplies in particular to the prospects for strong growth.On the basis of available short-term indicators, euro area real GDP growth in the first half of this year,compared to the second half of 1999, can be expected to amount to around 3.5% on an annualisedbasis. This underpins the projections of strong growth of above 3% for this year and the coming twoyears as contained in currently available forecasts. If anything, projections have been revised upwardsslightly in the past few months, reflecting the favourable conditions for domestic and external demand.On the domestic side, growth should continue to benefit from the high overall level of confidence,with indicators being close to their respective record highs. Investment growth can be expected toremain strong on account of moderate wage developments and a high degree of capacity utilisation.Growth of private consumption should also remain robust, supported in particular by ongoing strongemployment growth and a concomitant steady fall in unemployment. On the external side, the factors
BIS Review 73/20002supporting growth are the ongoing strong expansion of the global economy and the past gains incompetitiveness of the euro area, reflecting the decline in the exchange rate of the euro. Given thestrength of the conjunctural indicators for domestic demand and exports, euro area growth this yearcould turn out to be even stronger than anticipated in June.Bond markets also continued to point to favourable prospects for economic growth in the euro area inthe period ahead. While the yield curve has flattened somewhat during the course of this year, this hasbeen a consequence of the increase in ECB interest rates. By contrast, long-term bond yields havebeen broadly stable this year, indicating continued financial market expectations of robust economicgrowth in the future.Turning to other indicators related to the second pillar, developments in import prices have clearlybeen less favourable than expected in June 2000. As a consequence, July 2000 annual consumer priceinflation, as measured by HICP increases, stood at 2.4%. This was above the level which the ECBregards as being compatible with price stability. At this juncture, the upward movement of consumerprice inflation mainly reflects the impact of oil prices on the energy price component of the HICP andthe growing pressures on prices stemming from the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro.Overall, due to both oil prices and the exchange rate, consumer price inflation in the euro area is likelyto remain above 2% for some months to come.Monetary policy cannot offset such short-term pressures on the HICP. However, it needs to make surethat temporary deviations from the ECB’s definition of price stability do not spill over into long-terminflation expectations, and to ensure that they do indeed remain temporary. In this sense, it is crucial tomake sure that short-term upward pressures from import prices do not lead to a more protractedincrease in the HICP in a period of strong economic growth.In view of this situation, in which both pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB werepointing to upward risks to price stability, the Governing Council of the ECB decided on 31 August toincrease the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basispoints, to 4.50%. The interest rates on the marginal lending and deposit facilities were also increasedby 25 basis points, to 5.50% and 3.50% respectively.The change in the procedure for the allotment of liquidity in the main refinancing operations of theEurosystem, which I mentioned at our last meeting on 20 June, has proven to be very satisfactory. Asyou may recall, the Governing Council decided on 8 June that, starting with the operation to be settledon 28 June, the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem would be conducted as variable ratetenders with a minimum bid rate. In this procedure, the minimum bid rate took over the rolepreviously performed by the rate in fixed rate tenders in signalling the monetary policy stance of theGoverning Council. Our current assessment is that market participants adapted smoothly to the newprocedure, and that the procedure has served its purpose very well.The Governing Council will remain alert to all emerging risks to price stability. The maintenance ofprice stability will continue to contribute to a favourable environment for growth. However, it cannotincrease the growth potential of the euro area. It is the responsibility of other actors to create thenecessary conditions for sustained high growth in the euro area.First, favourable wage developments will be one key factor to ensure the continuation of robusteconomic growth and the reduction in unemployment in the medium term. In this respect, it is crucialthat forthcoming wage settlements be based on the ECB’s definition of price stability. Any attempt toincrease wages in reaction to recent oil price increases would be highly detrimental to the currentfavourable growth process, since monetary policy would need to react to the resulting upward pressureon prices. It is a matter of fact that recent oil price increases have deteriorated the terms of trade of theeuro area, and thus also reduced real income. This fact needs to be accepted by all parties concerned.Second, some of the main challenges for the governments of the euro area countries relate to theconduct of fiscal policy. At present, one major impediment to an increase in the long-term growthpotential in the euro area is the high level of social contributions and of taxation on labour andcorporate income. While a reduction in taxes and social contributions would certainly be beneficialfrom an economic point of view, it is essential that such a course of action remain compatible with the
3BIS Review 73/2000long-term sustainability of public finances. Therefore, reforms on the taxation side, which we verymuch welcome, should be accompanied, or even preceded, by a reduction in the level of expenditure atpresent and in the future.Taking into account the gradual ageing of the population in the euro area, reforms of pension systemsshould not be delayed. Such reforms are necessary in order to achieve long-term sustainable fiscalpositions and, at the same time, avoid the risk of having to impose an excessive burden on workers andenterprises in the future. While some progress has been made by governments over the past few years,further efforts will be essential in order to support the long-term growth prospects in the euro area.Moreover, fiscal reforms should be accompanied by further progress in other areas. In particular,reforms in the field of labour and product market regulations are essential for the economy of the euroarea to take full advantage of the opportunities created by the introduction of the single currency, theprocess of globalisation and the availability of new technologies. Enhanced labour market flexibilityand increased competition in product markets will be key factors in contributing to a higher growthpotential in the euro area. In several countries notable progress has been achieved in some respects.However, there is still much to be done when looking at the area as a whole.Finally, let me also say a few words about recent exchange rate developments. From a monetarypolicy point of view, they are clearly a cause for concern as they add to upward pressure on consumerprices in the euro area. Furthermore, they do not appear to be appropriate when looking atfundamentals.As you are aware, we already expressed this concern for some time. In the meantime, we havewitnessed a considerable improvement in the economic growth prospects for the euro area. At thesame time, as a result of measures taken by the Governing Council of the ECB, the outlook for pricestability in the euro area remained intact. At present, inflation in the euro area is among the lowest inthe world. The fact that the euro has continued to depreciate in recent months is not in line with thesestrong economic fundamentals of the euro area. Recent global exchange rate developments are also notin line with international balance of payment positions.2.Other activities of the EurosystemLet me now turn to other activities of the Eurosystem, starting with several decisions which weretaken with regard to the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002. The ECB,together with the other European institutions and the Member States, is paying closest attention to thiscrucial event, which will mark the final step in the completion of Economic and Monetary Union. Asyou are aware, the ECB has launched an information campaign on the 2002 cash changeover, onwhich my colleague, Mr. Domingo Solans, reported to you in May. I should like to recall that the ECBshares the Parliament’s view that a coordination of the various information campaigns conducted atthe European and national levels is essential in order to provide clear and consistent information tomarkets and the general public.Moreover, several measures have recently been taken by the ECB in order to facilitate further thechangeover process for market participants and the general public. In July the Governing Councildefined the general principles of the framework for the euro cash changeover, including the financialmodalities for credit institutions. Moreover, 1 September 2001 was fixed as the starting date for thefrontloading of euro cash to credit institutions in the euro area. This implies that credit institutions mayalso commence the sub-frontloading of euro cash to retailers, the vending machine industry andcash-in-transit companies in September 2001.Given that the euro banknotes and coins will become legal tender only as of 1 January 2002, theEurosystem will retain the ownership of all frontloaded euro cash until then. Credit institutions will beobliged to arrange appropriate coverage of the risks of anticipated public use, as well as of destructionor theft. In addition, sub-frontloading shall be performed by credit institutions against the delivery ofappropriate collateral to the national central banks.
BIS Review 73/20004As regards the cross-border exchange of national banknotes within the euro area, you may recall thatthe ECB decided, back in 1998, that each national central bank of the euro area has to provide for atleast one location where an exchange of such national banknotes can be effected at the officialconversion rates. Originally, it was envisaged that this exchange facility would expire on31 December 2001. Now the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to extend this period until31 March 2002 in order to expedite the changeover process. For the sake of completeness, I shouldlike to add that the exchange of national banknotes at the respective national central bank after1 January 2002 will be possible for a much longer period (at least ten years). However, according tocurrent planning in Member States, the time span for the exchange of national coins will, at least insome countries, be considerably shorter, ranging from one year after the coins have ceased to be legaltender up to an indefinite period.The Governing Council also reviewed the number of euro banknotes which will have to be printedbefore the end of 2001, and decided to increase the launch stock of euro banknotes from13 to 14.5 billion. In doing so, the Governing Council took into account the participation of Greece, ahigher than expected increase in banknotes in circulation within the euro area, an anticipated strongdemand for low-denomination banknotes and the slower than anticipated progress in the use ofelectronic money. The total nominal value of euro banknotes will amount to EUR616 billion.Another important issue to which the ECB continued to pay considerable attention relates toimprovements needed in the field of EU statistics. In conducting monetary policy, the ECB uses awide range of statistics - broadly speaking: those published in the 60 pages of tables in our MonthlyBulletin. Two sets of statistics of particular importance to us, namely the monthly monetary data andthe HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) covering the euro area, compare well in quality andtimeliness with corresponding data elsewhere. This is also true for some other areas, such as balanceof payments and securities issues. However, in some areas the timeliness and quality of data availablefor the euro area is still disappointing.In August the ECB published a report entitled “Statistical requirements of the ECB in the field ofgeneral economic statistics”, which outlines the requirements in this area. In broad terms, the areaswhere improvements have the highest priority relate to quarterly national accounts, harmonisedquarterly public finance statistics, labour market statistics, conjunctural statistics and the quickeravailability of data on trade outside the euro area.The European Commission, in coordination with the ECB, is currently preparing an action plancovering priorities for rapid improvement. According to current planning, the action plan is to beendorsed by ECOFIN ministers at the end of this month, giving the work the highest possible level ofpolitical support.I should now like to refer briefly to issues concerning the area of payment systems. As already statedon several occasions, efficient euro payment and settlement systems are essential for the smoothimplementation of monetary policy and for the stability of financial markets. This close relationship isreflected by the fact that the Treaty has assigned to the ESCB the responsibility to promote the smoothoperation of payment systems, which implies an oversight function and includes the possibility for theECB to issue regulations in this area. Moreover, the ECB is also concerned with the security ofpayment instruments, which is crucial for public confidence in the single currency. As part of itscommunication policy and in order to give guidance to markets and the public at large, the ECB issueda statement in June which explains in detail the objectives and activities of the Eurosystem in this area,especially as regards the execution of its oversight function.The focus of the ECB, however, is not restricted to the efficient processing of large-value transactions.The ECB also has a clear interest in the smooth functioning of cross-border retail payment systems.This interest, which the ECB shares with the European Parliament, is reflected by its initiative ofSeptember last year concerning the improvement of cross-border retail payment systems. Since then,the ECB has been in close contact with the European banking industry in order to explore practicalways and means of enhancing the efficiency of cross-border retail payments systems. You may beinterested to know that a progress report, providing an assessment and recommendations of the ECB inthis area, is close to being finalised and will be published soon.
5BIS Review 73/2000As concerns retail payments, I should also like to draw your attention to one particular issue, namelythe costs caused by balance of payments reporting requirements. The ECB shares this concern and has,together with the Commission, national central banks and other statistical authorities, undertakenefforts to reduce such costs, in particular by establishing a common exemption threshold ofEUR12,500, which will come into effect as from 1 January 2002. This means that banks will not haveto report their customers’ cross-border payments and receipts if the amount is below the threshold. Theimplementation of a uniform exemption threshold constitutes a major breakthrough in reducing anadministrative burden which is specific to cross-border payments. As a consequence, reportingrequirements can no longer serve as a justification for high customer fees for cross-border paymentsbelow the threshold. Furthermore, a list of harmonised economic codes is being prepared, whichshould further facilitate the automation of reporting.To conclude my remarks, let me briefly mention the ECB Occasional Papers, a new series ofpublications which was launched in July as a further refinement of the ECB’s communication tools.The ECB Occasional Papers will be drafted by ECB staff members and published under their ownresponsibility. They will address various policy-relevant issues and make available to the public dataand analyses used within the ECB and the Eurosystem.
1BIS Review 72/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The international role of the euroSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the2000 Spruce Meadows Round Table, held in Calgary, on 8 September 2000.*      *      *Let me first thank the organisers of this conference for having invited me to share some thoughts withyou on the international role of the euro. The euro was successfully launched 20 months ago as thesingle currency of 11 Member States of the European Union (EU) - known as the “euro area”. On1 January 1999 these Member States transferred their monetary sovereignty to a new supranationalinstitution, the European Central Bank (ECB). Since then, the Eurosystem - composed of the ECB andthe national central banks (NCBs) of the 11 countries that have adopted the euro - has been in chargeof the euro area single monetary policy and related functions, such as foreign reserve management andoperations and payment systems oversight.The euro has brought about fundamental changes to the economic and financial environment in theeuro area and beyond. By lowering transaction costs and enhancing price transparency, the singlecurrency represents a major contribution to fostering competition and efficiency in goods and financialmarkets across the euro area. As such, the introduction of the euro represents a quantum leap towardscompleting a fully integrated Single Market in the EU and lays a solid basis for the improvement inthe living standards of European citizens. Besides these welfare-enhancing effects on the “domestic”economy of the euro area, the new setting also has far-reaching consequences for the world economyand the international community.Let me shed some light on the international ramifications of Monetary Union by highlighting threeinterrelated aspects. First, the use of the euro as an international currency in the global financialsystem; second, the growing role played by the Eurosystem in international policy cooperation; and,third, relevant aspects of the exchange rate of the euro. Before dealing with these points in turn, Ishould like to recall some key economic features of the euro area.Key economic features of the euro areaLet me begin by putting the euro area into an international perspective. The euro area represents alarge and relatively closed economy. Given its population of almost 300 million people and itssignificant weight in the global economy, the euro area is broadly comparable with the United States.As regards its size and structure, the most striking fact is that the euro area economy has a share ofworld output of around 16%. This is more than three times that of its largest national component(namely Germany, which accounts for 4.7%), significantly higher than that of Japan (which accountsfor about 8%), while being lower than that of the United States (which stands at 21%).Being a large economy, the degree of trade openness of the euro area is much smaller than that of itsconstituent countries, even though it is still higher than in the United States and Japan. Measured bythe average of exports and imports as a share of euro area output, the degree of openness is 16% in theeuro area. By contrast, prior to Monetary Union, the average export ratio of all Member Statesincluding intra-euro area trade stood at around 35% in 1997, ranging from 20 to 60%. At the sametime, the euro area remains more open than the United States and Japan, with ratios of 12% and 11%respectively. Another factor highlighting the role of the euro area in world trade is its share in worldexports. With almost 20%, the euro area is the world’s largest exporter, compared with 15% and 9% inthe United States and Japan respectively.As regards the structure of the euro area economy, the patterns of production are broadly similar tothose of the United States and Japan. While primary production is rather negligible (around 2% oftotal output), the bulk lies with the euro area’s services sector, accounting for almost 70% of totalproduction, which is roughly equal to that of the United States (72%) and higher than that of Japan
BIS Review 72/20002(60%). The industrial sector accounts for around 30%, which is higher than in the United States butsomewhat lower than in Japan.Finally, if you look at the structure of financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, you may note thedifference between the “bank-based” system of finance on the European continent and the“market-based” system in the United States. Although there seems to be a trend away from bankstowards non-bank financing in the euro area, reinforced by the introduction of the euro, banks stillplay a dominant role in providing financial services in the euro area. Domestic credit as a share ofdomestic output accounts for 130% in the euro area, compared with 80% in the United States.Correspondingly, stock and debt markets are much smaller in the euro area than in the United States.While the shares of euro area debt securities and stock market capitalisation relative to GDP remainclearly below 100% (91% and 63% respectively), the figures for the United States are in both caseswell above 150% (155% and 172% respectively). This brings me to the use of the euro as aninternational currency in the global financial system.The role of the euro as an international currencyGiven the weight of the euro area in the world economy and the legacy of the former nationalcurrencies, which have been replaced by the euro, it is no surprise that the euro is the second mostwidely used currency behind the US dollar. A number of observers have argued that one of the mainmotivations behind Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was the development of the euro as amajor international currency. This perception, however, is incorrect for a number of reasons.First, the “euro project” is to be seen as a further logical step in the European integration process,which started more than half a century ago, immediately after the Second World War. Its objectiveswere not - and are still not - purely economic, as European integration aims not only at the creation ofa prosperous but also a stable and peaceful Europe. For a large part, trade, economic and financialintegration aimed at the removal of all barriers to free competition has been the engine of this process.In this context, the euro is to be seen as a major contribution to the completion of the Single Market inEurope. The primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability in the euro area.Second, the international use of the euro is, first and foremost, the outcome of a market-drivenprocess, not to be steered by central banks or by political bodies. The ECB has adopted a neutralstance on the internationalisation of the euro. The ECB intends neither to foster nor to hinder the useof the euro. In the past, major countries have, at times, tended to promote the international use of theircurrency, primarily with a view to potential benefits for their national financial sectors. There havealso been cases in which major countries have resisted the internationalisation of their currency, owingto the uncertainties that this process may imply for the conduct of monetary policy. However, bymaintaining price stability, the ECB almost automatically fosters the attractiveness of the euro as aninternational currency.Third, the international use of a currency is a complex phenomenon that does not lend itself to ad hocpromotion measures. A currency can be used not only for different functions, but also by differentgroups of economic agents. In this context, the use of the euro by private agents as an investment andfinancing currency, as well as a payment and vehicle currency, plays a prominent role. Although theeuro is also used by the public sector as a nominal peg and reserve currency, the behaviour of theprivate sector dominates the internationalisation of the euro. The amount of financial assets managedby the private sector is many times larger than official reserve holdings. In addition, private agentsusually adjust their asset management strategies more rapidly than most public sector institutions. Butwhat are the factors behind the internationalisation of a currency?In principle, two basic factors might eventually determine the international role of the euro - size andrisk. With regard to the size factor, a broad, deep and liquid euro area capital market may lead to agreater use of the euro through lower transaction costs. This may, in turn, facilitate the development ofthe euro as a vehicle currency for trade and commodity pricing. Already at this early stage, theintroduction of the euro has brought about fundamental structural changes in euro area capital markets.Progress in the harmonisation of certain market standards, practices and conventions across the euro
3BIS Review 72/2000area is reflected in a capital market that is characterised by increased market liquidity, broadermaturity spectrum and wider range of financial products. In addition, following the introduction of theeuro, the euro area corporate bond market has grown significantly. The activity of private issuers hasbecome more important than that of sovereign issuers, traditionally dominating the euro area bondmarkets. Positive network externalities and economies of scale have provided incentives for firms toissue their own securities instead of borrowing from banks. However, this trend away from bankstowards markets - the so-called disintermediation process - will take time. The development of abroader spectrum of euro-denominated financial instruments will be a gradual process.In addition to the size factor, the international use of a currency is determined by risk factors, sinceinvestors may use the euro to hedge their risks through diversification across international currencies.If international investors and issuers consider the euro to be a stable currency, they will hold euroassets to minimise risk in their internationally diversified portfolios. In this context, I should makeclear that maintaining price stability not only makes a contribution to improving economic prospectsand raising living standards in the euro area, but it is also a major precondition for a currency to playan international role. Only if investors outside the euro area are confident that their purchasing powerwill be preserved over time, will they engage in euro-denominated financial activities. Therefore thecommitment of the ECB to pursue price stability in the medium term remains a key factor behindmarket confidence in the euro as a stable currency. Besides price stability, the current and expectedgrowth performance of the euro area economy is an additional factor behind the attractiveness of theeuro. Sustained non-inflationary growth in the euro area economy would have beneficial effects onmarket expectations and foster the international use of the euro.As regards the private use of the euro, recent trends show that it has mainly been used as a financingcurrency. With regard to international debt securities, the euro is more widely used than the formernational currencies of the euro area countries. The issuance of euro-denominated assets by residentsoutside the euro area accounted in 1999 for almost 30% of total issues denominated in a currencydifferent from that of the borrowers’ respective geographical residences. By comparison, the combinedshare of all former national currencies of the euro area countries and the ECU amounted to only 18%of total gross international issuance in 1998. The growing use of the euro was mainly mirrored in adecline in the share of US dollar-denominated issues from 58% to 48% between 1998 and 1999. Thesetrends are even more striking if one focuses on the bonds and notes segment of the market. Accountingfor 33% of all announced international bonds and notes issues in 1999, compared with 37% for the USdollar, the euro nearly matched the dollar in that year. In the second half of 1999 euro-denominatedbond issues even exceeded those in the US dollar.As far as the euro’s share in overall official reserves is concerned, the euro also represents the secondmost widely used currency behind the US dollar. According to the latest available data, at the end of1999 the euro accounted for around 13% of the official foreign currency holdings of the world. Apartfrom some technical corrections on account of the conversion of the Eurosystem’s reserves into euro,which led to a slight decline in the euro’s share in overall reserves, there is no evidence of anyreallocation of foreign reserves at this stage. It should also be noted that more than 50 countries in theworld are currently using the euro as a nominal anchor.International cooperationLet me now turn to the institutional side. The introduction of the euro has brought about a majorchange to the institutional framework in which international cooperation takes place. In view of therapid process of globalisation and episodes of crises in a number of systemically important emergingmarket economies, international cooperation should play a role in strengthening the internationalfinancial architecture. In this respect, the new institutional setting in Europe is to be taken intoaccount.By reducing the number of key players, the introduction of the euro will simplify the internationalpolicy cooperation process between the major economies. In particular, it should make this processmore efficient by facilitating the reciprocal exchange of information and views, as well as theformulation of common understandings on economic and financial issues at the global level. Each of
BIS Review 72/20004the main partners - the United States, the euro area and Japan - is in a position to speak for acomparatively large economic area. A more balanced relationship between the major players mighthelp to induce each of them to take on responsibility for contributing to a stable global environment.In many ways, the ECB - which as a rule represents the Eurosystem externally - is already involved inthe work of international institutions and fora in the area of competencies of the Eurosystem. Formaland informal agreements have already been reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS), the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), and the several groupings of ministers andcentral bank governors (G7, G10 and G20).The involvement of the ECB was relatively straightforward for groupings created after theintroduction of the euro, such as the FSF or G20. In the case of pre-existing international fora andorganisations, however, the arrangements to be made were more complicated. The introduction of theeuro heightened the need for international financial institutions - such as the IMF and the OECD,whose internal procedures are organised on the basis of the “one country, one currency” principle - toaccommodate in their bilateral and multilateral surveillance exercises the existence of regional entities.In December 1998, for example, the IMF granted observer status to the ECB. Since February 1999 theECB observer at the IMF has been involved in all relevant work of the Fund on issues falling withinthe competence of the ECB and of mutual interest to both institutions.The fact that the ECB’s overriding objective is the maintenance of price stability has three mainimplications for its participation in international policy cooperation.First, a reciprocal exchange of information and views is a substantial component of the Eurosystem’scooperation with the international organisations and fora. Regular consultation on external economicdevelopments enhances the ability of the ECB to analyse the outlook for price developments in theeuro area, which in turn provides useful input into the effective implementation of its monetary policy.By taking into account possible spillover effects from third countries’ policy actions, consultationcontributes to reducing the likelihood of misinterpreting the impact of foreign developments ondomestic variables. Given its voluntary nature, consultation does not compel the ECB to adopt amonetary policy inconsistent with its objective of price stability.Second, a reciprocal exchange of information and views is supplemented by international surveillance.In this case, a third and independent party, such as the IMF or OECD, regularly monitors and assessesthe economic policies of its members. The ECB participates in the surveillance process for policiesfalling within its competence (e.g. monetary policy, payment systems oversight). This means that,whenever monetary policy is under surveillance, the ECB is solely responsible for its interaction withthe IMF and OECD. Standards and codes recently adopted by the IMF and other relevant internationalinstitutions are a way of defining best policy practices and enhancing transparency in the field ofmonetary and financial policy. In this respect, the ECB’s involvement in regular surveillance furtherstrengthens its accountability through being transparent.Third, in the area of macroeconomic policies, consultation and surveillance are the only forms ofinternational cooperation that are relevant to the Eurosystem. Any form of ex ante policy coordinationof monetary with other macroeconomic policies would neither be advisable for the Eurosystem nor becompatible with the ECB’s mandate and independence. Apart from the well-known recognition anddecision lags in policy-making, attempts to coordinate ex ante would not only blur the specificresponsibilities of individual policy-makers, but also reduce their accountability. In determining itsmonetary policy stance, the ECB should and does take into account all relevant information. It cannotlet its policy solely be determined by the current and future course of other policies. This could easilycompromise the maintenance of price stability.The ECB’s active participation in the ongoing process aimed at strengthening the internationalfinancial architecture is to be seen against this background. The Eurosystem supports such a processfor two reasons: first, since the achievement of its primary objective of safeguarding price stability inthe euro area would be facilitated by a sounder and more resilient international financial system; and,second, because the Eurosystem is expected to contribute to the smooth conduct of policies relating tothe stability of the financial system.
5BIS Review 72/2000Putting one’s own house in order must be at the basis of the stability of the “global village”. In thiscontext, I should like, if you would allow me, to draw attention to the fact that the introduction of theeuro also contributes to international financial and economic stability in a more subtle way. Theprocess towards EMU is not only concerned with irrevocably merging 11 national currencies. It alsomeans building up a sound institutional framework based on monetary stability and fiscalsustainability. The EMU process provides evidence of how effective properly organised policy andinstitutional cooperation can be in fostering economic stability in each individual country. In addition,EMU shows that regional policy cooperation may go well beyond trade matters.One should not be surprised by the number of countries that regard EMU as a relevant example ofregional cooperation. In Europe, EMU represents a powerful magnet for many central and easternEuropean countries. For these countries, accession to the EU will mark the completion of the transitionfrom the former centrally planned economies to fully-fledged market economies. The prospect of EUmembership is an incentive for transition efforts of accession countries and the ultimate adoption ofthe euro is already taken into account in their monetary and exchange rate policy strategies. However,the countries concerned will not adopt the euro by the date of their entry into the EU and the timing forthis step might be quite different from country to country. The path towards full euro area participationimplies progress towards nominal and real convergence. Ultimately, these countries are required toobserve the same convergence criteria with regard to public finance, long-term interest rates, exchangerate stability and inflation as the current euro area countries. In the legal area, accession countries willbe required to provide their central banks with the same degree of independence as today in the euroarea. In the technical area, preparations will require long lead times, and the ECB has alreadyestablished a dialogue with them, to assist when requested.Outside the euro area, an ongoing debate on deepening regional integration beyond trade liberalisationis taking place among Mercosur countries. The relative economic conditions of these countriesappeared even more differentiated than those of European countries when the integration processstarted more than fifty years ago. However, this seems to reinforce their conviction that regionalcooperation is necessary to achieve stable and non-inflationary growth and to overcome latenteconomic conflicts with their trading partners. As in the case of the regional process of integration inEurope, it may well be that the final objective of the Mercosur regional agreement goes beyond that oftrade cooperation.The international community should support regional cooperation efforts among countries that havestrong trade relationships and are willing to achieve progress in economic convergence. These effortshave significant positive externalities and could contribute to greater effectiveness of multilateral andbilateral surveillance.The exchange rate of the euroTo complete the picture of the international role of the euro, let me finally refer to the exchange rate ofthe euro vis-à-vis other major currencies, namely the US dollar and the Japanese yen. I should like totake the opportunity to reaffirm that the ECB does not pursue any exchange rate target in itsstability-oriented monetary policy strategy. Our objective is to maintain stable prices in the euro areaand not a specific level of the euro’s exchange rate. According to our strategy, the exchange rate of theeuro is the outcome of current and expected economic policies pursued in the euro area, and economicdevelopments in both the euro area and abroad.ConclusionsTo summarise, the new institutional monetary setting in Europe has consequential implications forinternational capital markets and international policy cooperation. The pace at which the role of theeuro as an international currency will develop is hard to predict. But what can be said is that the globalacceptance of the euro in the international financial markets depends first and foremost on marketconfidence in the stability of the euro. In this context, the ECB’s monetary policy committed to thepursuit of price stability provides an important contribution. In the same vein, by participating in
BIS Review 72/20006international policy cooperation, the ECB contributes to reducing the risks of negative externalitiesand to fostering the adoption of best policy practices at the international level. This is an importantcontribution of Europe to a more stable international financial system.
1BIS Review 71/2000T T Mboweni: A broadbrush picture of recent financial and economicdevelopments in South AfricaAddress by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 18th OrdinaryGeneral Meeting of shareholders, held on 29 August 2000.*      *      *IntroductionThe South African Reserve Bank has once again met the many challenges posed by the changingdomestic and international environment with great success during the past year. The Bank’s resiliencewas proven without any doubt in coping with such changes as the implementation of aninflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the information technology and other problems arisingwith the new millennium, and maintaining financial stability during very volatile conditions. The Bankalso succeeded in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of internal administrative procedures andcompleted a plan to effect employment equity in all occupational categories.The domestic economy also adapted very well to volatile international financial markets and reversalsin capital flows. Developments in the rest of the world had both positive and negative effects on SouthAfrica. On the one hand, the economic recovery in many parts of the world, together with continuedlow inflation, led to higher international commodity prices and an increased demand for SouthAfrica’s exports. On the other hand, certain inherent weaknesses in the world economy had a negativeimpact on domestic financial markets and, eventually, also on the recovery in domestic production.The external imbalances in the world caused a realignment of currencies, with the dollar becomingnotably stronger against the euro. Risks of sudden changes in market sentiment were exacerbated byincreases in share and property prices. Furthermore, international oil prices rose steeply when theOrganisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and several other oil producers began to curbproduction. Prices rose from about US$ 10 per barrel at the beginning of 1999 to levels in excess ofUS$ 30 per barrel in the first half of 2000. This had a material impact on the import bill and prices inSouth Africa. Despite these developments, South Africa’s balance of payments remained inherentlyhealthy, and the foreign reserves of the country increased substantially.Developments in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa unfortunately had an adverse influence oninternational perceptions of South Africa. Socio-political conditions in a number of countries remainedunstable, and conflicts continued in parts of the continent. Events in Zimbabwe preceding the generalelection affected the sentiment of many investors towards the region, and unjustifiably raisedquestions regarding South Africa’s economic prospects. The understanding by non-residents of theunderlying strength of the South African economy was further clouded by perceived structuralweaknesses in Africa, the slow pace of skills development, inadequate health facilities, the prevalenceof virulent diseases (including HIV/AIDS), and growing poverty and debt. These perceptionsdisrupted domestic financial markets and real economic activity in South Africa during the first half of2000.A fundamentally sound balance of paymentsThe regional events, a shift of funds away from commodity-based countries to high-technology andmanufacturing-oriented economies, a rearrangement of portfolios as a result of the surging energyprices, and higher international interest rates led to large net sales of domestic securities bynon-residents. After being net investors in South African bonds to the amount of R16.5 billion fromthe beginning of 1999 until the end of January 2000, non-residents became net sellers of bondstotalling R15.3 billion in the next six months up to the end of July 2000. Moreover, the net purchase of
BIS Review 71/20002shares by non-residents on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange fell from R40.6 billion in 1999 to onlyR6.8 billion in the first seven months of 2000.At first an inflow of other capital was able to offset the net sales of domestic bonds by non-residents.In 1999 the net inflow of capital, including errors and unrecorded transactions, amounted toR27.1 billion, and in the first quarter of 2000 to a still satisfactory R3.1 billion. However, in thesecond quarter of 2000 a net outflow of capital was recorded, totalling R5.9 billion. The morepermanent inflow of capital in the form of direct investment by non-residents in South Africaremained positive, but was offset by portfolio and trade-related outflows and a further accumulation offoreign assets by residents. Non-resident direct investment in South Africa amounted to R13.3 billionin the eighteen months until June 2000. These direct investment flows, as in other emerging-marketeconomies, can be boosted by large one-off privatisations.Although the current account of the balance of payments moved into a deficit from the second quarterof 1999, the deficit remained relatively small. Throughout 1999 and the first half of 2000 the deficitdid not exceed ½% of gross domestic product, and in the second quarter of 2000 a surplus ofR5.7 billion at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate was recorded. This surplus was a remarkableachievement taking into account the substantial increase in the country’s oil import bill as well assharp increases in the volume of imports from the second half of 1999. The strong performance of thecurrent account can largely be attributed to the growth in merchandise exports. The favourable globaleconomic conditions, a rise in international commodity prices and a competitive exchange rate level inSouth Africa, led to a considerable increase in both the value and volume of merchandise exports.As a consequence of these developments on the current and financial accounts of the balance ofpayments, total net gold and other foreign reserves increased by nearly R28 billion from the end of1998 to March 2000, before declining by R4.4 billion in the next three months. At the end ofJune 2000 the gross gold and other foreign reserves of the country nevertheless stood at R69.8 billion,which is the equivalent of the value of approximately 15 weeks’ imports of goods and services.Moreover, the utilisation of foreign credit facilities to boost gross foreign reserves was reduced byabout R0.3 billion over the eighteen-month period until June 2000.As could be expected, this fundamentally sound balance of payments situation at first resulted inrelatively stable conditions in the foreign exchange market. The nominal effective exchange rate of therand in fact increased by 0.6% from the end of 1998 to the end of 1999. At the beginning of 2000, theexternal value of the rand began to depreciate in an environment of uncertainty in financial marketsarising from the strength of the United States dollar, increases in oil prices and concerns aboutsocio-political developments in sub-Saharan Africa. The weighted value of the rand declined by about8½% from the end of 1999 up to 30 May 2000.Towards the end of May the behaviour of non-residents in the secondary bond market started tochange and the United States dollar weakened somewhat on international foreign exchange markets.Net sales of South African bonds by non-residents of R17.3 billion in the four months endedMay 2000 changed to net purchases of R1.6 billion up to 22 August 2000. The nominal effectiveexchange rate of the rand accordingly, on balance, increased again to a level on 23 August 2000 thatwas about 5% lower than at the beginning of the year.Buoyant but volatile financial marketsThe depreciation of the rand was one of the factors contributing to a temporary reversal in thedownward movement of long-term interest rates and yields in South Africa during 2000. The monthlyaverage yield on long-term government bonds fell from 18.3% in September 1998 to a daily averageof 13.3% in mid-February 2000, influenced by the strength of the rand during that period, lowinflation, fiscal discipline and a positive assessment by international rating agencies of South Africa asan investment destination.Subsequently, bond yields reacted hesitantly to perceived changes in financial markets. In Marchmarket sentiment deteriorated markedly owing to the weakness in the external value of the rand, risingofficial interest rates in major financial centres and higher risk premiums on South African assets. The
3BIS Review 71/2000daily average yield on long-term bonds shifted upwards to reach a peak of 15.2% on 10 May 2000,before the return to more stable financial conditions reduced it to 13.7% on 22 August 2000. Themonthly average inflation-adjusted yield on long-term government bonds amounted to 5.5% in July2000, compared with 10% in September 1998.Trading activity in the secondary bond market was boosted by the uncertainty in international markets.A record annual turnover of R8.8 trillion was recorded on the Bond Exchange of South Africa in 1999,followed by R6.2 trillion in the first seven months of 2000, which was about one-quarter more than inthe corresponding period of the preceding year. In the primary bond market more active borrowing byprivate-sector companies compensated for a decline in the net borrowing of the public sector.The share market entered a long and difficult recovery phase after the financial crisis in 1998. Thedaily average index of all classes of share prices fell by no less than 40% from the end of April 1998to the end of August 1998, and then rose gradually to a new all-time high on 17 January 2000 of 10%above its previous peak in April 1998. Rising interest rates, the depreciation of the rand andcorrections on major international bourses resulted in a decline in the daily average index of shareprices of 28% until 17 April 2000, when it began to recover again. On 22 August 2000 the dailyaverage index of all classes of share prices was nevertheless still 9% below its peak on17 January 2000.The strong recovery of share prices throughout 1999 supported trading activity on the JohannesburgStock Exchange. The value of shares traded in the secondary share market rose to R448 billion in1999, which was 40% more than in 1998. Volatility in share prices fuelled trading activity furtherduring 2000. The value of shares traded in the first seven months of this year was 25% higher than inthe corresponding period of 1999.In contrast to the unstable conditions in the bond and share markets, interest rates in the money marketdeclined sharply during 1999 and remained largely unchanged during the first seven months of 2000.For example, the call rate on interbank funds declined from 17.75% at the end of 1998 to 9.5% on31 January 2000 and remained at that level in the ensuing period. Similarly the three-month bankers’acceptance rate moved down from 17.53% at the end of 1998 to 9.95% on 21 January 2000 and thenfluctuated in a narrow range of between 9.83% and 10.25% up to the end of July 2000. The stability inthe money market during the first seven months of 2000 can mainly be ascribed to the monetary policystance pursued by the Reserve Bank.As a result of the changes in long-term and short-term interest rates, the relatively flat yield curve atthe beginning of 1999 assumed a steep positive slope over the next eighteen months. This reflected aneasing of the monetary policy stance and, in the first five months of 2000, higher long-term yields andinterest rates. From the end of May 2000 the differential between long-term and short-term yieldsbegan to decline again.A slowdown in economic recoveryThe South African economy showed clear signs of a vigorous economic recovery during 1999. Theannualised quarter-to-quarter growth in the seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product acceleratedfrom 1% in the first quarter of 1999 to 3½% in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the expansion ineconomic activity became far more widespread in the course of the year. Whereas the agricultural andtertiary sectors had been mainly responsible for the initial rally in production, increases inmanufacturing and other secondary sectors made a major contribution to output growth in the secondhalf of 1999.Contrary to general expectations, the rate of expansion in the economy slowed down in the first half of2000. Growth in real gross domestic product fell to 1% in the first quarter of 2000 and 1½% in thesecond quarter. To a large extent this was due to a decline in the output of the primary sectors,reflecting poor climatic conditions and an over-supply of coal on international markets. Manufacturingoutput was also affected by negative business sentiment related to the depreciation of the rand, thewithdrawal of portfolio capital by non-residents and socio-political developments in some sub-SaharanAfrican countries.
BIS Review 71/20004As a result of these developments, the inventory accumulation moderated in the second quarter of2000. Domestic final demand continued to increase at relatively modest rates of between 1 and 2½%in the four quarters until June 2000. Over this period the government reduced its final consumptionexpenditure significantly as part of its efforts to maintain fiscal discipline. Public-sector fixed capitalformation also declined throughout 1999 and the first half of 2000. This decrease, together with areduction in private-sector investment, reduced total real gross fixed capital formation by 7% in 1999.However, the rate of decline in total investment levelled off towards the end of the year. Fixed capitalformation increased at an annualised rate of 1½% in the first half of 2000 when private companiesapparently started to increase capital spending in anticipation of stronger growth in domestic andexport demand.In sharp contrast to the developments in other expenditure aggregates, real household consumptionexpenditure rose steeply over the twelve months up to June 2000. Consumer confidence was highowing to increases in personal disposable income, a fall in bank lending rates and a lowering ofeffective income-tax rates. Despite this optimism, consumers avoided the use of excessive debtaccumulation in financing consumption. Household debt as a ratio of disposable income declined fromnearly 60% in the first quarter of 1999 to 57% in the second quarter of 2000. The reluctance ofconsumers to incur debt stems mainly from the volatility in real interest rates over the past two years.The modest economic growth over the past eighteen months did not lead to meaningful employmentcreation. Further reductions were recorded in employment in the non-agricultural private sector as wellas in the public sector, which were neutralised by increases in the informal sector. At the same time,the growth in nominal unit labour costs slowed down significantly because of lower increases in thelabour remuneration per worker and a rise in productivity. The rate of increase in nominal unit labourcosts declined from 8.9% in 1998 to 3.2% in 1999 and only 0.5% in the first quarter of 2000,compared with the same period in the preceding year.Discipline in fiscal policyDisciplined fiscal policies and efficient public administration procedures brought the public-sectorborrowing requirement down from R25.6 billion in fiscal 1998/99 to R10.9 billion in fiscal 1999/2000.Over the past five years the public-sector borrowing requirement has been reduced from 5.8% of grossdomestic product in fiscal 1994/95 to only 1.3% in fiscal 1999/2000. The further decline in theborrowing requirement of the public sector in the past fiscal year can be attributed to substantialimprovements in the financial position of the national government, provincial governments and thenon-financial public enterprises and corporations.A decline in investment spending by public enterprises and corporations was responsible forapproximately 25% of the reduction in the public-sector borrowing requirement. The remaining 75%saving in the borrowing requirement was largely due to the considerable restraint with expenditureallocations exercised by the national government and more efficient procedures for collecting incomeand other taxes.It is important to note, however, that part of the curtailment in expenditure over the past five yearsmay have been achieved at the cost of the development and maintenance of the economic and socialinfrastructure of the country. There is a delicate balance between containing expenditure andmaintaining the infrastructure required for economic development.Greater price stabilityThe effective fiscal, monetary and other policy measures pursued by the authorities, in conjunctionwith lower international inflation, succeeded in creating greater price stability in South Africa. In 1998and 1999 the rate of increase in the consumer price index excluding mortgage interest costs (CPIX)averaged 7% per year. This rate of increase can be compared with inflation rates fluctuating around15% in the 1980s and early 1990s.
5BIS Review 71/2000During 1999 the twelve-month growth rate in the CPIX slowed down from 7.3% in March 1999 to6.5% in October, but then accelerated to 8.0% in July 2000. The rise in inflation was largely due toshocks such as higher international oil prices, floods and volatile financial markets. When the effectsof the price rise in petrol, diesel and food are omitted from the CPIX, the rate of increase over twelvemonths in other consumer prices fell from 6.8% in October 1999 to 6.7% in July 2000.The year-on-year increase in the all-goods production price index accelerated from a low rate of 2.3%in March 1998 to 10.1% in April 2000. This rate of increase, which normally precedes changes inconsumer prices, slowed down to 8.6% in July 2000 in line with the appreciation in the external valueof the rand.Recent developments in monetary aggregates bode well for the inflationary outlook, provided that thedirect impact of external shocks wears off and that the secondary effects of the increase in oil pricescan be contained. The level of the broadly defined money supply (M3) at the end of June 2000 wasvirtually the same as at the end of 1999, whereas M3 had increased at an annualised rate of nearly 19%in the second half of 1999. Moreover, the decline in money supply growth was largely concentrated incheque and transmission deposits and coin and banknotes, ie in that part of M3 reflecting thetransaction demand for money.Growth in bank credit extension, which had moved to single-digit levels in the second half of 1999,remained below 10% in the first half of 2000. The demand for overdraft facilities was buoyant in thefirst six months of 2000. Most of the overdrafts were utilised by the corporate sector to financeworking capital. Mortgage advances, instalment sale credit and leasing finance also picked up with therevival in the real-estate market and in expenditure on durable goods.Monetary policy in a volatile environmentThe volatility in financial markets had a significant influence on monetary policy during the past year.At first, evidence that the emerging-market crisis of 1997/98 was abating made it possible to relax avery stringent monetary policy stance. The repurchase rate of the Reserve Bank was allowed to declinefrom a peak of 21.85% in early October 1998 to approximately 12% on 24 November 1999. TheMonetary Policy Committee then announced that the repurchase rate would be fixed at this leveltemporarily because of possible disruptions in liquidity relating to the computer problems expected toarise at the year-end date change. The marginal lending rate of the Bank, ie the rate on a standbyfacility to bridge the unforeseen liquidity needs of banks, was also reduced from 15 to 5 percentagepoints above the repurchase rate.In addition to these measures, the Reserve Bank deliberately eased liquidity conditions in the moneymarket during the last four months of 1999 to allay fears about the millennium change. When itbecame apparent that no serious Y2K problems would be experienced, the Reserve Bank reinforcedthe reserve dependency of banks on central bank funding. Bank liquidity was drained by increasingreverse-repurchase transactions, issuing Reserve Bank debentures and by concluding foreign exchangeswaps with banks. From 14 January 2000 the Bank began to resume a variable-rate auction inaccordance with the agreed signalling procedures with banks, and indicated that changes in short-terminterest rates at that stage warranted an immediate reduction in the repurchase rate by a further25 basis points.From the middle of January 2000 the Monetary Policy Committee indicated that the repurchase rateshould remain at or around a level of 11.75%. The interpretation of this announcement by the bankswas that the Reserve Bank wished to keep the repo rate fixed at this level. They accordingly tenderedat the daily auctions at exactly this rate. While the Reserve Bank’s objective was to achieve stablemoney-market interest rates in volatile financial conditions, this did not preclude moderate variationsin the repo rate around the 11.75% level.Stable money-market interest rates were regarded as desirable to restrain volatility. In thecircumstances, a rise in rates would have failed to counter the effects of the supply-side shocks ondomestic prices. Moreover, a number of other factors indicated that the upside risks for inflationwould probably be short-lived. Developments such as modest increases in nominal unit labour costs,
BIS Review 71/20006fiscal discipline, excess production capacity, low growth in money supply and bank credit extensionand a prudent monetary policy stance, pointed to a favourable long-term inflation outlook.In a further attempt to create greater certainty about the ultimate objective of monetary policy, aninflation-targeting monetary policy framework was formally adopted in South Africa as part of overalleconomic policy. This was announced in the Budget Speech by the Minister of Finance on23 February 2000, with an annual average inflation target range of 3 to 6% for the year 2002 being set.The new framework provides an anchor for the ultimate objective of monetary policy. It helps to focusmonetary policy, increases transparency and leads to a clear accountability of the Reserve Bank to thecitizens of the country. The successful application of inflation targeting, however, will depend on aconcerted, cooperative effort by the key stakeholders, such as government, labour and business.The inflation target was specified as a range to allow the Bank some discretion in taking decisions onthe monetary policy stance. The target is calculated as the average annual increase in the overallconsumer price index excluding mortgage interest costs in metropolitan and other urban areas for theyear 2002. A variant of the headline inflation rate was used, because the overall consumer price indexis affected directly by changes in the Reserve Bank’s repurchase rate. By including price changes inmetropolitan as well as other urban areas, the most comprehensive price index available in SouthAfrica has been targeted. The year 2002 was selected because of the long lags of between 18 and24 months before changes in short-term interest rates have an impact on inflation.The adoption of an inflation-targeting monetary policy framework for South Africa has certainimportant implications. Firstly, the numerical inflation target becomes the overriding objective ofmonetary policy. Monetary policy operational procedures are concerned overwhelmingly with theattainment of this objective. The objective of the framework is, after all, to achieve the target.However, this does not mean that the central bank is left without any discretion. A rigorously appliedrule would deprive the central bank of its ability to deal with unusual or unforeseen circumstances.Secondly, the pursuit of inflation targets does not mean that the Reserve Bank is not concerned aboutthe achievement of sustained high economic growth and employment creation. Monetary policycannot contribute directly to sustainable economic growth and employment creation. However, bycreating a stable financial environment, monetary policy fulfils an important precondition for theattainment of economic development. Empirical evidence has shown that high and variable inflation isbad for economic growth and that price stability is beneficial to a country’s performance.Thirdly, to be successful, inflation targeting requires nominal exchange rate flexibility. Trying tomaintain an inappropriate exchange rate may be costly in terms of domestic economic activity.Unrealistically valued currencies may lead to large international capital flows with serious disruptiveeffects on the domestic economy. In an inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, exchange ratesshould essentially reflect the domestic monetary and fiscal policies of the authorities and bedetermined by the supply of and demand for currency in foreign exchange markets. This will result influctuations in the exchange rate of the rand, but should at the same time promote domestic economicstability. The Reserve Bank nevertheless takes cognisance of the second-round impact of exchangerate movements on the inflation rate.Fourthly, inflation targeting is a forward-looking approach. Monetary policy is based on the likelypath of inflation. In any monetary policy framework a central bank has to decide how its current policystance will affect future price movements. The difference between inflation targeting and otherframeworks is that inflation targeting makes forecasting explicit and more transparent.For this purpose econometric models are applied and changes in economic circumstances are carefullyanalysed to determine the inflation outlook. With the assistance of a number of other central banks,considerable effort has been made to improve the forecasting capacity of the Reserve Bank. A numberof small and simplified models have been developed to forecast inflation. In addition, the Bank hasinitiated an inflation expectations survey to determine the expected level of inflation.Econometric modelling is only one of the tools used to determine the monetary policy stance.However, the real world cannot be encapsulated adequately by an integrated system of mathematicalequations. Econometric models over-simplify actual economic relations. Determining monetary policy
7BIS Review 71/2000requires a much more detailed analysis of factors that may have an impact on inflation. Valuejudgements are unavoidable. The determination of monetary policy in an inflation-targetingframework therefore remains an art and does not become an exact science.Finally, inflation targeting increases the transparency and accountability of monetary policy becausethe objective of price stability is expressed as a numerical target to be achieved over a specific period.The public announcement of explicit targets enhances the understanding of the policy objectives.Good governance calls for the Bank to be accountable, particularly in view of its operationalindependence in achieving the targets.In order to further facilitate an understanding of monetary policy, the policy stance is explained in astatement issued after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, at Monetary Policy Forumsin major regional centres, in various publications of the Bank and in speeches and presentations to thepublic and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Finance. The Reserve Bank also intends topublish a six-monthly Monetary Policy Review to describe in greater detail the policies pursued andinstruments applied.However, the Reserve Bank does not intend to publish the minutes of meetings of the Monetary PolicyCommittee. The statement published after every meeting provides a good reflection of considerationstaken into account at the meeting. The Bank also does not intend to publish the structure of itseconometric models at this stage because the functioning of these models needs to be evaluated over along period of time. Disclosure of the models could create uncertainty about policy decisions. Oncethe models have been validated, the Bank will consider publishing them.At present it is also the objective of the Bank to reduce its net oversold position in foreign currencywhenever circumstances allow. The foreign currency exposure of the Reserve Bank adversely affectedmarket sentiment and has increased the volatility in the exchange rate of the rand and in other financialaggregates. Recognising this, a policy of gradually reducing the net open position in foreign currencyhas been followed. By buying dollars in the market, the net open position in foreign currency of theBank was reduced from US$ 23.2 billion at the end of September 1998 to US$ 9.9 billion at the end ofJuly 2000. The reduction of the net open position in foreign currency to zero will remove one of therisk factors in the economy.The reduction in the net open foreign position has had the added advantage of reducing the foreigncurrency exposure of the national government as a ratio of government debt from nearly 43% at theend of September 1998 to approximately 24% at the end of July 2000. The comparable ratio for SouthAfrica’s peer group was some 46% at the end of December 1999. Were the Bank to succeed inreducing the net open foreign position to zero, the foreign currency exposure of the government as aratio of government debt, at current levels, would amount to only 6%. This low currency exposuremakes it easier to borrow funds abroad.Maintaining stability in the financial sectorA stable financial environment requires not only low inflation, but also a sound financial sector. Thisinvolves stability in the financial markets where transactions can take place at prices reflectingdemand and supply forces, and with healthy financial institutions capable of meeting contractualobligations without interruption or outside assistance.Stability in the financial sector and price stability are inextricably interrelated. Failure to maintain oneform of stability creates an uncertain operating environment for the other, with causality running inboth directions. A lack of price stability could lead to rapid growth in credit extension and higherinterest rates, with the danger that borrowers could default on loan commitments. Bank failures maypotentially be contagious, which would render monetary instruments ineffective and cause higherinflation. By contrast, stability in the financial sector enhances financial intermediation, improves theallocation of real resources and provides an environment conducive to the implementation of monetarypolicy.
BIS Review 71/20008South Africa is fortunate to have a well-developed and sound financial system. Moreover, thedomestic banking sector proved remarkably resilient during the global financial turmoil of 1997/98. Inthe mature South African financial market with a moderate level of private indebtedness and a goodregulatory and legal framework, the major banks were able to cope efficiently with the effects of highinterest rates and exchange rate volatility.In the past financial year, thorough preparations to avoid the possible impact of the transition to theyear 2000 ensured that normal operations were maintained. Some of the smaller banks experiencedtemporary liquidity problems which were largely solved by allowing the affected banks to discounttheir cash reserves and statutory liquid-asset portfolios. The funding and other corrective measuresenabled the affected banks to restore liquidity positions during the first quarter of 2000.South African banks are well run with sophisticated risk-management systems andcorporate-governance structures. They are also well capitalised and had an average risk-weightedcapital-adequacy ratio of 12.5% at the end of June 2000, compared with the required minimum ratio of8% stipulated in the Basel Capital Accord. More than 60% of the banks had a capital-adequacy ratio ofat least 15% at the end of June 2000.Although non-performing loans have increased since the international financial crisis, South Africanbanks have made greater provision for bad and doubtful debts. As a ratio of total loans and advances,gross overdues in the banking sector came to only 4.6% in the second quarter of 2000. Provision fordoubtful debts amounted to about 60% of total overdues in the same period, which is far moreconservative than the international norm of 40%. However, there are signs that the profitability of thebanking sector is declining somewhat. Lower income combined with higher operating expensesresulted in marginally lower returns on assets and equity in the first half of 2000.The excess of short-term liabilities over short-term assets for banks stood at 16% of their total fundingrequirements in June 2000. In view of the robust capital adequacy position of the banks and efficientmanagement procedures, this is not a cause for concern. South African banks in any event maintainadequate levels of liquidity, with liquid assets exceeding the regulatory minimum by nearly 9% inJune 2000.The Reserve Bank strives to ensure that effective and efficient banking supervision is in place. Arecent assessment undertaken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in termsof a Financial Sector Assessment Programme found that South Africa complies with almost all theBasel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. Where some requirements do fall short,proactive steps have already been taken to address them. The imminent promulgation of amendmentsto the Banks Act and revised Regulations thereunder should further enhance the country’s status in theregulatory environment.In view of the complexity of the financial system and the linkages of banks with other financialactivity in the country, a Financial Stability Unit was established in the Reserve Bank in July 2000.This unit will research and analyse ways of promoting and maintaining a stable financial system. Theaim is to focus on overall financial stability so as to enhance confidence in the domestic financialsystem, increase South Africa’s attractiveness as a regional financial centre and attract foreigninvestment. Considerable attention will be given to strengthening the non-regulatory aspects of thefinancial regime such as incentive structures, market discipline and corporate governance. A prioritywill be to help establish a deposit-insurance scheme for South Africa.One of the most important functions of the regulator of banks is to authorise the establishment of newbanks. The power to grant licences provides the mechanism for preventing the entry of banks whosepresence might be prejudicial to the interests of depositors and the soundness of the banking system.In South Africa our approach is to grant licences to all applicants that comply with a stringent set ofentry criteria. These criteria are that the establishment of a bank should be in the public interest; nosingle shareholder should be able to dictate the bank’s direction without due regard to the interests ofits depositors; the bank should be governed and managed by directors and managers with provenability and integrity to pursue the interests of the owners without harming the interests of depositors;the bank should establish operational and control systems commensurate with the complexity of the
9BIS Review 71/2000risks and exposures it takes; and the bank should be established with sufficient financial strength toensure adequate capital and sustainable profitability.Banks are monitored continuously to ensure that they remain fundamentally healthy. This has mainlybeen done through quantitative and qualitative off-site assessments. In 1999 the Bank began thepreparatory work for on-site reviews of credit-risk management systems and evaluations of assetquality. The process is expected to become fully operational in the second half of 2000. Substantialprogress has also been made with the development of consolidated supervision, ie in reviewing bothbanking and non-banking activities conducted by a banking group domestically and internationally.Despite all these procedures, it is not possible to guarantee that banks will not experience somedifficulties from time to time. In such cases, the policy of the Reserve Bank is to assist only bankswhich have a temporary liquidity problem, whereas insolvent banks are allowed to exit from thesystem in an orderly manner which does the least harm to the banking system and depositors. In allcases of bank failure, the bank’s management is replaced and the individuals involved would normallynot be permitted to hold influential positions in banks again.When a bank experiences funding difficulties on a short-term basis, lender-of-last-resort assistance isprovided to it. Lender-of-last-resort assistance is a recognised responsibility and practice of centralbanks. The objective of such assistance is to enable the bank concerned to implement correctivemeasures and to prevent the contagion effect of a run on the bank. The liquidity under thelender-of-last-resort function is provided on a short-term basis only and has to meet certain importantpreconditions. These preconditions include that the institution has to be solvent; sufficient collateral isavailable; the institution has sought other reasonably available sources before seeking assistance fromthe Reserve Bank; the shareholders of the bank have made a reasonable effort to support it; there is noprima facie evidence that the management is not fit and proper, or that the liquidity problem is due tofraud; and the institution has developed and is committed to the implementation of a viable plan ofappropriate remedial action to deal with its liquidity problems.In an integrated world economy, it is essential to have close cooperation and that information is sharedinternationally. This is becoming even more important with the increased foreign participation in theSouth African banking sector. The Bank continues to develop relations with other banking supervisorsto meet the challenges posed by globalisation. At a regional level, the Bank participates actively in theinitiatives of the East and Southern Africa Banking Supervisors Group to harmonise the bankinglegislation and banking supervisory practices of member states and to share information on mattersrelating to banking supervision.In addition to the banking supervision function, stability in the financial sector depends on theavailability of currency in circulation and the maintenance of an efficient national payment, clearingand settlement system. The Bank incurs considerable expense annually to ensure the availability ofhigh-quality currency in circulation in various denominations as a means to execute transactions. As aprecaution against possible Y2K problems and an increased demand for currency near the year-end, alarge number of additional banknotes were printed during 1999. No difficulties were thereforeexperienced in meeting the higher demand in the last few weeks of the year.Considerable progress was made with the planning and preparations to take over the provision of bulkcash services to banks from SBV Services (Pty) Ltd. A new currency management strategy wasadopted by the Board of the Reserve Bank in February 2000 to deal with this matter. As aconsequence, the infrastructure of the Reserve Bank’s branches will be adapted to provide for theincreased level of currency-handling activity.Further advances have also been made in the national payment, clearing and settlement system toachieve same-day settlement. At present approximately 76% of all payments in the South AfricanMultiple Option Settlement (SAMOS) system are already made on a same-day basis. In terms of theprinciples of international best practice, a start was made with introducing further risk-reductionmeasures in the Payment Clearing House (PCH) batches. PCH agreements are being drafted whichwill assist the industry to remove high-value payments from inappropriate payment streams and, intime, will enable all payments in the SAMOS system to be settled on a same-day basis.
BIS Review 71/200010Another important challenge is the financing of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) whichdo not have securities or other assets as collateral for needed funds. Because banks lend out moneythat they receive from depositors, rigorous credit requirements have to be maintained under allcircumstances. At the same time SMMEs are expected to make a major contribution to employmentcreation and economic development. To achieve this, they will obviously require outside finance. TheReserve Bank believes that the development of a microlending industry is essential for this purpose.Microlenders are well placed to provide such finance to SMMEs as they normally have an intimateknowledge of potential customers. Efficient credit-risk management requires an understanding of acustomer’s business and the risks associated with loan financing.The Reserve Bank wants to actively promote the microlending industry by fostering communitybanking and exempting common-bond savings groups and village financial services cooperatives fromcompliance with the Banks Act, under certain conditions. The establishment of the Micro FinanceRegulatory Council (MFRC) should further boost the already rapid growth in microlending. Onlymicrolenders that are affiliated to the MFRC will be allowed to fund themselves by means of depositsin South Africa and conduct their business within a self-regulatory framework.Broadening of external relationsFollowing the normalisation of South Africa’s relations with the rest of the world, senior officials ofthe Reserve Bank have become more involved with multilateral financial institutions, other centralbanks and international private financial institutions. A number of meetings were attended at the IMFand the Bank for International Settlements in the past year where discussions were held with othercentral bankers on current economic and policy developments. The Reserve Bank took an active partin the discussions about the new international financial architecture. Further headway was made withthe enhancement of cooperation among the central banks of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC). The Committee of Central Bank Governors in the SADC, chaired by the SouthAfrican Reserve Bank and assisted by a secretariat in the Bank, is implementing projects aimed atfacilitating monetary and financial cooperation in the region. These projects include the convergenceof payment, clearing and settlement systems in the region; the maintenance of a common monetaryand financial database; the development of a common legal framework for central banks; theharmonisation of listing requirements on stock exchanges; and the development of norms for goodbanking practice in the SADC. Close cooperation in sharing experiences and skills was also achievedin banking supervision, information technology, protective services and human resources developmentand training.As custodian of South Africa’s foreign reserves, the Bank continues to manage foreign reserveportfolios and foreign credit facilities. In order to increase the efficiency of reserve management, someof the international reserves were handed over to external fund managers to manage on behalf of theReserve Bank. In this way the Bank expects to benefit in the form of training and technology transfers.In June 2000 syndicated loan facilities amounting to US$ 1.5 billion were successfully finalised toreplace a similar loan that had matured.Changes to internal administrationIn the internal administration of the Reserve Bank a focus area during the past year was theestablishment of a Budget Committee which is responsible for preparing and managing the Bank’soperational and capital budgets. This committee gave considerable attention to the budgetary processand procedures followed in the Bank and established definite rules. Roles for the Governors’Committee, the Budget Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Procurement Committeewere clarified. The budget schedule was revised to synchronise with the strategic plans of departmentsand to allow more time for the preparation of departmental budgets and the approval of proposals bythe Budget Committee.The Year 2000 project, which had started in July 1996 and culminated in the transition to the newmillennium, was completed successfully. This was replaced by a number of new projects to ensure the
11BIS Review 71/2000most efficient, cost-effective information technology systems, including the dissemination ofeconomic data and the upgrading of foreign exchange information. Treasury bills were immobilisedand assistance was provided to the Strate system for its equity dematerialisation, clearing andsettlement system.A paradigm shift in exchange control is under investigation. In the new planned philosophy mosttransactions will be permitted, except for certain specified exclusions. Emphasis will be placed on theaccurate reporting of cross-border transactions. The completion of this study should improve thecompilation of the balance of payments and provide more details of transactions in services withnon-residents. The first stage of the implementation of this reporting system is envisaged for 2001.Briefing sessions in this regard have already been held with authorised dealers in foreign exchange andthe other members of the Common Monetary Area.Like many other central banks, the Reserve Bank is seeking to enhance its effectiveness and efficiencyby focusing on its core activities. To this end, considerable emphasis has been placed on the strategicmanagement process. Strategic reviews are undertaken more frequently by the governors, andparticipation in the process was extended by involving advisers, all heads of departments, branchmanagers and the managing directors of the subsidiaries. Feedback on the results of these discussionswas given to the Board in the form of a strategic framework document which provides generalguidelines to departments on aligning departmental strategies and operational plans.In addition, the Bank has embarked on the development of a long-term vision which will serve as theframework for future planning. As part of this Vision 2010 a comprehensive human resources plan hasbeen developed that forms the basis for effecting employment equity. The formulation andimplementation of the plan underscore the Bank’s commitment to transforming the institution,eliminating past employment imbalances and making the staff more representative of the population ofthe country in terms of race, gender and people with disabilities. By the same token, the Bank iscognisant of the need to retain the necessary corporate memory and skills within a transformingenvironment.The plan endeavours to achieve a staff complement comprising a minimum of 50% Black people and33% females across all occupational levels by 2005. The achievement of these targets will becomplemented by a number of action programmes, which include a special drive to recruit peoplefrom the designated groups, accelerated management development and promotions, dedicated trainingand development, early retirement and redundancy procedures, organisational restructuring, wellnessand disability management, and affirmative procurement.The Bank continues to regard the development of the skills and knowledge of its staff as a majorresponsibility. Emphasis is placed not only on the proficiencies required in its daily activities, but alsoon human resources development in such diverse fields as adult basic education, languages, businesspresentations, the conduct of meetings, the power of positive imaging, the personal and professionalgrowth of women, financial and labour relations matters, management and preparing for retirement.The South African Reserve Bank College concentrates on upgrading the central banking skills ofindividuals to the highest level. The college plays an active role in the SADC Training andDevelopment Forum and presents courses to staff of the Bank, private-sector and tertiary educationinstitutions in South Africa and to individuals nominated by central banks in the SADC region.Concluding remarks and acknowledgementsEvents during the past year again illustrate how interwoven South Africa has become in the integratedworld economy. Globalisation has many benefits for emerging-market economies. Capital movementsfacilitate the efficient allocation of saving, channel resources into productive uses and promote thefinancing of international trade and investment. In this way globalisation creates opportunities toincrease international trade, economic growth, employment creation and welfare.Unfortunately, like all good things in life, globalisation also has certain disadvantages. In particular,the integration of South Africa into the world economy has made the country more vulnerable toexternal shocks. These can take the form of supply, demand and financial shocks. In such an uncertain
BIS Review 71/200012environment the pursuit of financial stability has become even more imperative. Although stabilitydoes not provide unconditional protection against reversals in international capital flows, it doesforestall uncertainties on the monetary front and can counter excessive volatility. The Reserve Banktherefore remains determined to maintain financial stability in South Africa.In conclusion, I wish to thank the President and Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, andthe Reverend Frank Chikane, Director General of the Presidency, for their support for the work of theSouth African Reserve Bank. In particular, I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude for their support forthe independence of the South African Reserve Bank. I also want to place on record my appreciationto Mr Trevor Manuel, Minister of Finance, Mr Mandisi Mphahlwa, Deputy Minister of Finance,Ms Maria Ramos, Director General of National Treasury, and the staff of the National Treasury fortheir cooperation with the Bank over the past year. A word of appreciation is also appropriate toMr Alec Erwin, Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Alistair Ruiters, Director General, and the staff ofthe Department of Trade and Industry who have become important collaborators of the Reserve Bank.Informative meetings were held with the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Finance, which wefound very helpful. I thank my colleagues on the Board, including the deputy governors, for theircommitment and undivided loyalty to the Bank. Finally, a word of thanks is also due to the staff of theReserve Bank for their work during the past year and for their loyal support.
1BIS Review 70/2000David Clementi: Crisis prevention and resolution -two aspects of financial stabilitySpeech by Mr David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the Inaugural Lecture atthe South Bank University Centre for Monetary and Financial Economics, London, on 6 September2000.*      *      *IntroductionLadies and Gentlemen,When I was invited to give the inaugural lecture at the Centre for Monetary and Financial Stability, Iwas pleased to accept. It is obviously an honour to be asked to inaugurate any academic institute butsupporting the foundation of a centre dedicated to the pursuit of monetary and financial stability is, fora central banker, a particular pleasure! After all, monetary and financial stability and the interaction ofthe financial system with monetary policy are at the heart of the Bank’s mission. The first of theBank’s core purposes is maintaining the integrity and value of the currency or, in other words,monetary stability; the second is maintaining the stability of the financial system.I intend to focus my remarks on this second core purpose. Financial stability has always been anintegral concern for central banks. We have been reminded of its importance by the events of recentyears. The Asian Crisis in particular set in train a programme of international work and discussions,looking at ways to prevent a recurrence and to handle one if it did. One concrete result was thecreation of the Financial Stability Forum, which meets semi-annually, bringing together central banks,finance ministries and regulators to discuss issues of common concern and to develop policies forcontrolling risks to the international financial system.The work broadly falls into three categories: crisis prevention, surveillance and crisis resolution. It ismy intention today to concentrate on crisis prevention and crisis resolution and to discuss in somedetail two issues currently under debate. The first relates, in the context of the revision of the BaselAccord, to the aggregate capital in the banking system and the optimal level of bank capital. Thesecond concerns the international financial architecture and the respective roles of the private andofficial sector in dealing with liquidity crises.But before I turn to these I would like to say something about surveillance. This responsibility isshared in the UK between the Bank, FSA and HMT. Following the creation of FSA, the respectiveroles of the three parties were set out in a Memorandum of Understanding between them. While HMTis responsible for the structure of financial legislation and the FSA is responsible for the regulation ofindividual firms, the Bank is responsible for the stability of the financial system as whole. To this end,the Bank dedicates significant time and resources to tracking developments in the global economy andfinancial markets with a view to identifying potential threats to financial stability. Major developmentsare discussed each month in the Bank’s Financial Stability Committee. Within the Bank, the FinancialStability Committee occupies a similar position in relation to financial stability as the MPC does formonetary stability. Bank staff present papers to the Financial Stability Committee evaluating theoverall conjunctural position and reviewing issues of specific concern. The staff assessment offinancial stability is shared with the Treasury and FSA and discussed with them in the StandingCommittee, set up under the MoU, that meets each month to monitor financial stability and to considerissues of common concern. The objective is to identify sources of instability before problems emerge,to be in a position to take preventative action or to respond quickly in the event of trouble.The Bank sets out to articulate publicly its financial stability role and to communicate current concernsby the publication semi-annually of the Financial Stability Review. Each edition includes an overviewof financial stability providing an assessment of current threats to the system, ranging from imbalances
BIS Review 70/20002in the major industrialised economies or debt structures in EMEs, to sectoral issues such as equitymarket volatility or gearing in the telecoms industry. While other commentators may talk of economicmiracles, you can rely on central banks to find disaster waiting in the wings! But if surveillance feedsoff central bankers’ capacity to worry, then crisis prevention and crisis resolution, working on rules tominimise the risk or the cost of a financial crisis, may be the only prospect for us to get a decentnight’s sleep.Crisis prevention: bank capital requirementsI would like to discuss one particular weapon in the crisis prevention armoury, which is bank capital.This is, of course, a very topical subject at the moment, with the revision by the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision of the 1988 Capital Accord.Importance of capitalWhy does bank capital have a crucial role in crisis prevention? This question has two aspects: first, theimportance of capital itself; and second, the special role that banks play in the economic system.Capital has a vital two-fold role. First, capital - or rather equity capital - acts as a buffer againstinsolvency. It therefore helps to protect the system and limit calls on the safety net. And second, equitycapital helps to align the objectives of the firm’s owners with the objectives of the authorities. Wherethe owners of firms invest only pinpoint capital, or see their investment erode to the point where thefirm is only marginally solvent, owners have an incentive to “gamble for resurrection”, because withlimited liability, taking on extra risk has substantial potential upside but no extra downside for owners.But with a higher cushion of capital, owners do have something to lose.That said, we should not overstate the role of capital in ensuring the health of the banking system. Ifother fundamentals are shaky - such as the macroeconomic environment, the legal system, or theframework for asset valuation and auditing - capital is likely to produce only limited comfort. Andcapital adequacy is of course only one aspect of prudential regulation, with other aspects of riskmanagement such as liquidity management and systems and controls also being vitally important.The Basel Committee has now of course explicitly recognised that the formal regulatory minimumcapital framework is only one pillar in the edifice of bank soundness. It has to be complemented bysupervisors individually reviewing the capital adequacy of banks in the light of a wide range of riskfactors - the second pillar of the proposed new Accord - and by market discipline on banks, the thirdpillar.On the question of why we focus on banks, it would be difficult to overstate the importance of a stablebanking system to economic health and growth. Banks play a crucial role in intermediating savingsand credit and they are at the heart of the payments system. Most firms in most economies remainheavily reliant on banks for finance, and even in economies where a significant number of firms canturn to the capital markets for finance, banks retain important roles as providers of payment facilities,short-term credit, and backup liquidity. In less advanced economies, their role is even more dominant,to the extent that a number of full-blown macro-economic crises have had their roots in weak bankingsystems.Changes to the Basel AccordAs I have said, the capital framework for banks is currently under review by the Basel Committee. It isworth reminding ourselves what this framework consists of. First, it sets out a method for measuringthe riskiness of assets. Second, it sets out a definition of capital. And third, it lays down a minimumratio between capital, the numerator, and risk assets, the denominator, namely that capital should be atleast 8% of risk-adjusted assets, with at least 4% of this consisting of Tier 1 capital.What changes will the new Accord make to these elements?
3BIS Review 70/2000The work has to date been heavily focused on the first element of the framework, the method formeasuring risk. There will be substantial changes here, with the aim of introducing more risksensitivity to the existing crude measures and to widen the coverage of the measures beyond just creditrisk and market risk which was addressed in the previous review of the Accord. The direction of thechanges was laid out in the Committee’s consultative paper of June last year and I do not intend to gointo a description here.On the second aspect, the Committee has stated that “With respect to the definition of regulatorycapital, the Committee will maintain at this stage the existing rules set out in the 1988 Accord.” Inother words, they will not at this stage be revising their definition of capital. Just to remind you, thisdefinition of capital broadly divided capital into two tiers, of which Tier 1 mainly consists ofshareholders equity and reserves and Tier 2 of certain subordinated debt instruments and an element ofgeneral provisions. There have been some modifications to the definition since 1988, for instance tointroduce another layer of less permanent capital to back short term trading risks, and more recently toaccommodate some more innovative types of issues which can be aligned with Tier 1 for capitalpurposes (but with debt for tax purposes - an outcome which I believe is technically described as“having one’s cake and eating it”!).It would of course be intellectually more satisfying to be reviewing the whole framework together, butthe Committee’s decision not to revisit this definition at this time is, I believe, a defensible pragmaticone: modernising the denominator is proving quite difficult and contentious enough without involvingthe numerator as well. That said, there is a discussion which needs to take place at some point as towhether the definition has achieved the right composition of elements and emphasis on thoseelements.How much capital does the system needIt is on the third aspect of the framework that I mainly wish to offer some thoughts today, that is, onthe level of capital that should come out of the framework. Here again, the Committee has signalled a“no change” or at least a “no change in aggregate” intention, by saying that “The Committee believesthat the new framework should at least maintain the overall level of capital currently in the bankingsystem.”We should of course be under no illusion that the ratios chosen in 1988 were arrived through ascientific process. If I may digress briefly into anecdote, I recall that Bill McDonough once related thathe had asked his staff why, under the market risk amendment to the capital accord, it had been decidedto apply a three-times multiplier to the outcome of VAR models. Why three times? The answer cameback that three times was selected because “two times was too low and four times was too high”. Iimagine that the process of selecting 4% minimum equity was very similar to this. The selection of acapital ratio ought, ideally, to depend upon answers to the following questions: what is the risk we aretrying to limit? What is a good measure of that risk? What residual level of risk are we willing totolerate? And how do we fix a capital level so as to achieve that residual level? These questions werenot explicitly addressed back in 1988, although possibly we can infer some of the implicit answersfrom the regime that was established. However, although neither 1988’s Accord’s measure of risk norits selection of the minimum capital ratio may have been scientifically derived, the Committee’sstatement that we will at least maintain the overall level of capital in the system indicates that, ex post,they are reasonably happy with what the 1988 Accord achieved.But what exactly do they mean by this statement? And how do we go about achieving their intendedoutcome? Is it, indeed, a reasonable outcome to strive for? I will try to address these questions.One way of thinking about the 1988 Accord is that, aimed principally at internationally active G10banks, and using crude measures of risk that assumed some sort of average portfolio and profile of riskfor such banks, it set a “confidence level” for the soundness of individual banks and hence the system.Looked at in this light, the Committee’s statement means that the authorities do not intend to tolerate adifferent - ie lower - level of confidence following the introduction of the new Accord. In other words,
BIS Review 70/20004under the new regime, the average internationally-active G10 bank will not be more likely to fail thanit would be under the old regime.This seems a fairly sensible way to view the relationship of the old Accord with the new version. Itleaves plenty of scope to see redistribution of required capital, from less-than-averagely risky banks tomore risky ones. It also leaves scope for overall capital to reduce over time, if better risk measurementor other techniques lead to a reduction in the risk taken.That said, looking at the appropriate level of capital in this way still means that we have to be able tomeasure the current confidence level for G10 bank insolvency which is established by the existingAccord. This is not an entirely straightforward task. One starting point could be the ratings of G10banks. The median rating of banks, taking the entire rated G10 population of more than 300 banks, isA1 on the Moody’s scale, or A+ on the Standard and Poor’s scale. This would indicate a near-invisibleinsolvency probability for such banks over a 1 year horizon. However, this very small insolvencyprobability does reflect two factors which ideally we would wish to discount. First, the ratings reflectthe bank’s actual capital level which will in most cases be significantly above the regulatoryminimum. And second, in some cases the rating also reflects the agency’s expectation that publicsupport would be forthcoming for the bank, which of course we would wish to strip out. A moreaccurate measure of the confidence level established by the Basel 8% would be the “standalone”ratings produced by some agencies, for those banks whose capital is at or close to the Basel minimum.Even on this basis, nearly all such banks are rated above investment grade. The message thereforefrom this view of the matter is that under the new Accord we should be targeting a minimum level ofregulatory capital for our G10 internationally active banks that is at least consistent with an investmentgrade rating.An alternative way of assessing the regulatory soundness standard would be on a “bottom up” basis,that is by modelling the probability of default arising from a typical credit portfolio if the bank heldonly the Basel minimum capital. The advent of credit risk modelling techniques such as CreditMetricsallow such an exercise to be attempted. Any results under this sort of approach need to be treated witha fair amount of caution, given the number of assumptions involved. The work we have done at theBank, experimenting with these models and using different parameters, at least supports theproposition that G10 international banks (the target constituency for the Accord) should have capitalon the basis of a one-year default probability that is consistent with an investment grade rating.Assuming that we can somehow identify the current confidence level implicit in the existing capitalAccord, we may, as I suggested above, nevertheless want to debate the question of whether theCommittee would be right in aiming to replicate this under the new Accord. Is this a reasonableobjective? Or are we being too conservative?Clearly there are types of banking exposures for which too much capital is being demanded, such aslending to very high quality corporates. This has led to some exposures being moved outside thebanking system, through disintermediation or regulatory arbitrage. This problem is one of the maindrivers behind the Basel Committee’s current review of risk measures. However, there are equallytransactions for which the Basel minimum is severely inadequate, such as lending to some OECDcountries. But the question is really whether on average the regulatory requirement produces the rightlevel of protection.Given the Bank of England’s general concern for systemic risk, we would tend to evaluate thisquestion in terms of whether the existing cushion of capital has given the right level of protection tothe system, ie have we established the right level of tolerance towards banking crises. Individual bankfailures do not prove inadequacy of the framework - although a complete absence of bank failureswould suggest severe overprotectionism.It is very difficult to answer this question definitively, given that bank failures and banking crises tendto have their roots in a number of different causes, not just inadequate capital. It is difficult to saytherefore how much difference extra capital would have made, or how many more crises would haveresulted had the regulatory capital demand been lower. Nevertheless the frequency of crises, even indeveloped countries since the Basel Accord was implemented, is not so low as to make us feel that theregulatory demand for capital is overstated. Using IMF data on banking crises, we find that during the
5BIS Review 70/20001990s four out of 11 G10 countries have suffered a banking crisis - a statistic which I do not findparticularly comforting. And, although developed countries tend to escape the twin plague of abanking crisis combined with a currency crisis, we should not suppose that this rather high incidenceof crisis in developed countries is mitigated by the costs of the so called crises being noticeably low. Ihesitate to put precise numbers on costs, because they do vary quite considerably. However, as Bankof England research which is to be presented later to this conference indicates, both the fiscal andwelfare costs on all the measures used are very significant indeed. On some measures, in fact, theoutput costs of banking crises in developed countries tend to be higher than in emerging markets,largely because the length of crises is longer in developed countries. Overall, therefore, in the light ofpast experience, I think we would be taking an unjustified risk if we deliberately set out to lower theexisting regulatory demand for capital.Crisis management and paymentsStandstills: I want to turn now from crisis prevention to crisis resolution and from domestic banking tomore general international liquidity crises. While the banking system was a source of instability inmany countries during the Asian crisis, a more immediate problem was the liquidity crisis triggered bythe sudden outflow of capital from the region. It is the free movement of capital that I would like todiscuss and, in such a regime, the need for arrangements that would deal with a liquidity crisis wheredeveloping countries get into payment difficulties.The international capital marketGlobal capital flows have exploded since the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1996, real GDP in the G7economies more than doubled. Over the same period, world trade volumes rose by roughly twice thisamount. But since 1970, real gross private capital flows have risen by a factor of more than eight -double the growth in world trade and four times the growth in world income.Rising capital flows have delivered huge benefits to the developing countries. Capital liberalisation,like trade liberalisation, has facilitated “catch-up” in the levels of income of these countries. It deliversa permanent, and potentially huge, welfare gain. The experience of the Asian tigers from the 1970sonwards, and before that of Germany and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, is testimony to that.But large-scale capital flows also bring risks. Capital flows are not just large, but volatile too. Thefinancial crises in Mexico in 1994, across South-East Asia in 1997, in Russia in 1998 and in Brazil lastyear are the most recent and visible examples. But the incidence of financial crisis has in fact beenrising since the early 1980s. And the cost of financial crises are considerable. In the strickenSouth-East Asian countries, capital flow reversals and output losses were anywhere between 5% and20% of GDP. In many of these cases, there has been encouraging evidence of a V-shaped recovery inoutput and asset prices following crisis. But the depth of the V is clear evidence of the potential cost ofvolatile capital movements.Capital markets have of course been prone to “panics, manias and crashes” for as long as they haveexisted. It would be naïve to think we can ever entirely prevent crises - and indeed it may beundesirable to attempt to do so. But it is realistic to think that the incidence and severity of crisis canbe mitigated through appropriate public policy actions. This is the grandly-titled “new internationalfinancial architecture” about which you have no doubt heard.I want to discuss some of the efforts of the official sector in redesigning the international architecture -achievements to date and, importantly, challenges for the future. While a lot has been achieved, muchremains to be done. I will also suggest where I think the official community’s future efforts might bestbe directed.
BIS Review 70/20006Dealing with financial crisisThe first priority of the official community must of course be crisis prevention. And on this front goodprogress has been made. For example, we now have a substantial array of codes and standards of bestpractice covering public policy issues: transparency in macroeconomic policies; core principles for thesupervision of banks, insurance companies and securities firms (including the changes to the BaselAccord which I have just discussed); principles for corporate governance, insolvency and marketintegrity; and standards for data, auditing and accounting. Implementation of these codes of bestpractice is now the key - ensuring that crisis-prevention principles are put firmly into practice, in bothdeveloped and emerging economies. The IMF has a key role to play in this implementation process,through their assessments of compliance with standards and transparency about these assessments.But even with preventative measures in place, liquidity crises will still occur from time to time.Creditors may sometimes choose to flee simply for fear of other creditors doing so before them. Acountry can face a liquidity “run” in much the same way as a bank. And these types of coordinationfailure are difficult to resolve with standard macroeconomic policy tools, like monetary policy.So what policy alternatives are available? One means of resolving this rush for the exits is for the IMFto provide emergency liquidity support in potentially unlimited amounts - a classic international lenderof last resort. But virtually no-one envisages the IMF (or anyone else) playing such a role. As apractical matter, the IMF simply lacks the resources. Its usable resources are currently less than$150 billion. The external debt of the developing countries is well over $2 trillion. So the IMF’sability to fill financing gaps is already heavily circumscribed and will become more so over time.Even with the resources, it is very doubtful whether unlimited IMF lending would be desirable. Morelikely, it would simply stoke-up moral hazard problems for the future, potentially increasing theincidence of crisis and the corresponding cost for taxpayers. So an international lender of last resortappears both impractical and undesirable.This recognition that it is neither practical nor desirable to see the IMF in a role of Lender of LastResort has prompted considerable thinking about the nature of private sector involvement in crisisresolution and the modalities of sovereign payments suspensions or standstills. Payments suspensionsare in some ways the obverse of recognising the limits on IMF lending. And, reflecting this, sovereignstandstills litter history over the last two centuries: in Latin America in the 1820s; among the US statesin the 1830s and 1840s; in Latin America again in the 1870s; among the majority of sovereign debtorsin the 1930s; and in Latin America once again in the 1980s.All too often in the past, however, sovereign standstills have also been a recipe for chaos andconfusion. The recent sovereign defaults in Russia, Indonesia and Ecuador are good cases in point. Butlooking back over history, it is clear that messy and protracted sovereign standstills are very much therule rather than the exception. Historical experience with sovereign standstills probably looks quite alot like corporate experience before insolvency rules were put in place, with the work-out processinefficient and inequitable. I will return to that corporate bankruptcy analogy later on.Against this backdrop, the key issues facing the official community seem to me to be twofold. First,how do we establish a more coherent framework for crisis management, that recognises and reconcilesthe countervailing forces of large and rising capital flows on the one hand, and small and limitedofficial lending on the other. Second, given these constraints, is it possible within that framework toestablish a role for standstills that are efficient, equitable and expeditious. I discuss each in turn.A framework for crisis managementThe Cologne Summit statement by G7 finance ministers and central banks in June 1999 was a steptowards establishing a framework for international crisis management. It listed the “principles” and“tools” underpinning this framework - if you like, the ingredients. It did not, however, provide a recipefor combining these ingredients. The official community’s framework for crisis management remainsa discretionary, “case-by-case” one.
7BIS Review 70/2000This approach has benefits. Crises clearly differ in form and severity, which calls for flexibility in theofficial sector’s approach to dealing with them. But discretion also carries some costs. For privatecreditors, it adds to uncertainty when framing their lending plans. The IMF’s latest Capital MarketsReport states that the private sector is “highly uncertain, if not outright confused about the officialcommunity’s approach to achieving its goals”.Discretion also has costs for the official community. It risks “gaming” by the private sector, with theofficial sector providing more money ex-post than would have been optimal ex-ante. By alteringofficial and private sector behaviour in this way, a discretionary approach to crisis managementpotentially increases both the cost and the incidence of crisis.Are there feasible, rules-based alternatives? One simple means of establishing an official“line-in-the-sand” would be to place an explicit cap on IMF lending. No rule is of course inviolable.But publicly-stated constraints are likely to have greater credibility. This would reduce uncertaintyamong private creditors. And it would drive home the point that “bail in” by private creditors wouldneed to be greater, the larger a country’s financing needs, which provides the right set of incentivesfrom a moral hazard perspective.Payments standstills as a crisis management toolThis limited pool of IMF lending would need to be complemented with other crisis management tools.Voluntary rollover agreements with creditors - the like of which were put in place in Korea and Brazilrecently - would be an important part of that crisis management toolkit. So too would voluntary bondrestructurings, as have recently been undertaken in Pakistan, Ukraine and Ecuador. An ongoingdialogue between country debtors and their private creditors - what the Institute for InternationalFinance call “Country Clubs” - would facilitate both of these voluntary tools for crisis resolution.Involuntary payments suspensions also deserve consideration as part of the official sector’s toolkit,however. As a crisis management tool, they may be beneficial in certain situations. Where a country isvulnerable to short-term capital movements, standstills could serve as a potentially importantcircuit-breaker. They might be an efficient means of forestalling “runs” on a country because theyprevent pessimistic creditor expectations becoming self-fulfilling. More generally, whether capital isshort-term or not, they could serve as an important incentive device. Having standstills as a crediblebackstop might in some circumstances increase incentives for debtors and creditors to seek voluntaryresolutions to crisis sooner.Through both of these mechanisms, standstills might help resolve coordination failures amongcreditors, and hence forestall liquidity crisis.How do we ensure that standstills are efficient and equitable? The decision to default must beprincipally for the debtor. But the official sector can alter debtor incentives in important ways. Oneincentive device would be for the IMF to support standstills by agreeing to lend through their duration- what the IMF call “lending-into-arrears” - provided the standstill process, once entered into, isorderly and speedy. If standstills were a structured part of the IMF’s ex-ante crisis managementframework, this would increase the chances of the standstill process itself proving ex-post efficient.There is also encouraging work being done by the private sector on drawing up best practiceguidelines for sovereign debt work-outs.Some have argued that articulating a clearer role for standstills may perversely alter debtor incentives,by weakening the presumption that debtors should pay their debts in full and on time. But an orderlystandstills process should support, not supplant, market forces and market disciplines. Corporatebankruptcy law grew up as it became clear that market forces delivered losers as well as winners andthat some orderly means was needed of dealing with the losers. In this way, bankruptcy law supportsthe market mechanism.The situation is no different in a sovereign context. A well-articulated framework for dealing withsovereign liquidity problems should reduce the inefficiencies and inequities of the current unstructuredapproach to standstills. It would support the international capital market mechanism. It would be no
BIS Review 70/20008more likely to induce debtors to default than bankruptcy law is to induce corporate debtors to default.In neither case is default a soft option. We would of course hope and expect sovereign standstills to bethe exception rather than the rule. But it is better to plan for all contingencies, and to articulate theseplans, than have international public policy made on the hoof. In this respect, crisis-fighting sharesmany similarities with fire-fighting. Fire-prevention is ideal, but will never entirely prevent firesoccurring. So it makes sense to have a fire-fighting plan, which everyone understands and abides by,to minimise the damage when fires do occur.Would standstills work?The issue of whether standstills should form a part of the official sector’s toolkit of responses remainsunder active debate. A number of arguments against the use of standstills have been made bypolicymakers, academics and the private sector. Let me try and articulate some of the concerns.First, would standstills risk cutting-off capital flows to the emerging markets - if you like, killing thegoose that lays the golden egg? History offers some clues here. For example, there appears to be noevidence from 1930s experience of defaulting countries having fared worse than non-defaultingcountries in terms of subsequent output growth. And looking across a broader sweep of history, someempirical evidence has failed to find any discernibly negative long term effect of a country’s priordebt-servicing record on the terms or volume of its borrowing.That is not to say that default is costless, certainly in the short to medium term. The loss of access tocapital markets and the time and effort involved with restoring credibility with creditors is, quitecorrectly, a strong deterrent for any country contemplating default.Historical evidence may in any case be uninformative about investor behaviour in the future under amore structured framework for international crisis resolution. If this framework helped resolve thecollective action problem among creditors, it ought to benefit creditors as well as debtors. Indeed, byreducing the risk to creditors in this way, standstills should be mutually beneficial to both parties. Ifthat is the case, there is no reason to believe that, in a world of structured standstills, there is much riskof the golden-egg-laying goose being cooked.Second, might the prospect of standstills prompt a pre-emptive rush for the exits? In a world ofstructured standstills, there is perhaps some risk of skittish investors rushing for the exits sooner.Indeed, these investors may choose not to enter emerging markets in the first place - standstills wouldpre-empt the inflow rather than precipitating the outflow. But the behaviour of longer-term investorsneeds also to be weighed. They would stand to gain from country runs being forestalled. Theirincentives to flee are thereby diminished. The net effect might be some change in the composition ofthe developing countries’ capital stock, with fewer fleet-of-foot, skittish investors and a greaternumber of longer-term, sticky investors. This change in capital stock ought to be advantageous fromthe welfare perspective.Third, might standstills worsen contagion between markets, the like of which we saw followingRussia’s debt moratorium in 1998? Contagion appears to be a fact of life in a world of cross-bordercapital flows. The question is: would articulating a role for structured standstills worsen contagion? Itis not clear that more coherent crisis-management framework would increase the incidence ofstandstills; it might reduce their cost. And to the extent that contagion is sourced in investoruncertainty, it might to some extent be mitigated by the proposals I have outlined.So, to summarise, there are good reasons to think that a world of structured standstills might alterinvestor behaviour and the international flows of funds. It is difficult, however, to believe that thesechanges would be damaging to the international capital market mechanism - indeed, some wouldclearly improve its functioning. Sovereign defaults will continue to occur periodically. But the officialsector could possibly mitigate their cost by establishing a coherent framework for crisis management,with payment suspensions as one of the tools.None of this is at all to suggest that the issue of standstills - in or outside the Bank of England - is fullyarticulated and concluded. It is a difficult area requiring contributions from all sides and the
9BIS Review 70/2000intellectual argument is ongoing. Finding the right balance between rules and discretion, in this area asin so many, remains a key issue for policymakers. There is work to be done on the modalities of howstandstills might operate in different crisis cases. What is the role of the IMF in the standstill process?Does the process need to be underpinned by statute or would non-statutory principles suffice? Andwhen might a standstill require capital controls to guard against leakage?The Bank is currently working on some of these issues, practical and conceptual. I would encouragethose among you with an interest in international public policy to help us in addressing them, joiningthe growing number of, in particular, US academics who are exploring this topic. It is very much a livedebate and I have no doubt these issue will be discussed at length, at and around the World Bank andIMF Annual Meetings in Prague later this month.ConclusionI have now talked myself - quite literally - to a standstill. I hope, in describing two current issues in thepolicy debate, I have been able to convey something of the Bank’s role in financial stability and theimportance of current work in this area. I am encouraged to see how many aspects of financial andmonetary stability are included in the programme for this conference. I wish you well with it and thefuture of the Centre itself and I hope the Centre and the Bank will maintain a close relationship.
1BIS Review 69/2000David Carse: The current state of banking reform in Hong KongSpeech by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at theluncheon of the Hong Kong Foreign Bank Representatives Association, held at the Hong Kong Club,on 5 September 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this lunch gathering of the Hong Kong Foreign BankRepresentatives Association. As an international financial centre, it is the essence of Hong Kong that itshould be a host to foreign banks. And as the banking regulator in Hong Kong, it is important that theHKMA should keep in close touch with foreign banks through events such as today’s lunch. Thisgives us a chance to explain aspects of our policies and how we see the current state of banking inHong Kong. It also gives you the opportunity to provide feedback to the HKMA on any issues ofcurrent concern to you. Hopefully, I will not have to address too many hostile questions.The 1998 Banking Sector Consultancy StudyI have chose to speak to you today on the subject of “The current state of banking reform in HongKong”. This seems a good time to undertake this stocktaking. It is over a year since we embarked onthe reform programme that we devised in response to the Banking Sector Consultancy Studyundertaken by KPMG and Barents in 1998. A number of the measures in the programme are directlyrelevant to foreign banks and you may therefore be interested to hear about what we have done so far,and what more we have in mind.The current state of the banking sectorThe Consultancy Study was conceived just before the outbreak of the Asian Crisis and took placeduring it. The Hong Kong banking sector has now come through the crisis, and can be said to haveclearly demonstrated its resilience and underlying strength. It is true that the number of foreign banksin Hong Kong has fallen sharply over the last two years. This reflects the fallout from the crisis thathas led to the demise of some banks and has required others to cut back on their overseas operationsand return to their home base. Hong Kong has certainly not been the only financial centre to witnessthis retreat.However, the important point is that the core of the Hong Kong banking system - represented by thelocal banks and the large foreign players - has remained intact. Although bad debts rose sharply duringthe crisis and a few banks lost money, the banks generally remained profitable and financially sound.The capital ratios of the local banks actually rose during the crisis period. No banks failed and nodepositors lost money. The Government was not called upon to provide financial support.The results of the banks for the first half of this year show that their recovery from the crisis is wellunderway. Profits rose sharply and bad debts were lower. This means that the clouds that have hungover the banking system for the last two years have now lifted. But it would be wrong to conclude thatlife for the banks will go on much the same way as it did before in the golden years before the crisis.The competitive environment for the banks is becoming increasingly intense. Of course, you can arguethat there is nothing new in this. The banking system in Hong Kong has always been competitive,which is one of the reasons it was able to cope with the Asian crisis. But competition in past years wastaking place in highly buoyant conditions and within defined limits, reflecting in part the influence ofthe interest rate rules of the Hong Kong Association of Banks.
BIS Review 69/20002The competitive environmentNow things are somewhat different. A number of major players in the market, including some foreignbanks, are competing even more intensely than they did before. Some of them have recently increasedtheir presence in Hong Kong or are planning to do so. In some cases, this presence may be in virtualform as banks increasingly offer their services in whole or in part over the internet. This is part of aworldwide trend towards greater competition. But it is happening in Hong Kong at a time whenlending growth has still not recovered along with the economy. Domestic loans showed no increase inthe first seven months of this year. The result is that loan to deposit ratios have fallen to their lowestlevels for many years - around 53% for the local banks as a group.The effect on loan margins has been quite dramatic. In particular, the margin on mortgage loans hasfallen from 1.25% over prime rate prior to the crisis to the current low of 2.25% below prime.The current situation may to some extent be temporary. It is difficult to believe that loan demand willnot pick up soon given the pace of economic recovery in Hong Kong. Sentiment in the propertymarket is now looking better and this may start to feed through into increased appetite for mortgageloans. But it seems unlikely that the boom conditions of the 1990s will return for the foreseeablefuture.The implication of this is that the banks in Hong Kong may have to cope in the future with anenvironment of more restrained loan growth and finer margins. This means that they will need to findalternative means to boost income. One option is to diversify into the sale of products like unit trusts,pensions and life insurance that offer the opportunity to earn fee income. Another is to focus onlending to sectors such as the SMEs that provide higher returns at the expense of higher risk. Acommon factor in such initiatives is the need to cope with greater complexity in business developmentand risk management. Technology can help to deal with these issues, but this creates its own set ofproblems. Banks need to be able to afford the necessary investment in technology and to develop orobtain the expertise to utilise technology properly.The objectives of our reform measuresThe KPMG/Barents Consultancy Study broadly anticipated these trends. The policy prescription wasthat we should not stand in the way of the forces of change, nor should we simply do nothing and seewhat happens. Rather, it was concluded that we should try to manage the process of change throughcareful reform. The underlying aim of our reform package therefore is to help to improve efficiencyand innovation in the banking sector through increased competition. Among other things, this mightprovide incentives for the local banks to think harder about merger and acquisition.If we had simply done nothing and left competitive barriers, like the interest rate rules, in place, thismight have sent misleading signals to the local banks, and prevented them from reacting quicklyenough to the changes taking place around them.A further objective of our reforms was to increase the attractiveness of Hong Kong as an internationalfinancial centre. Also, bearing in mind that increased competition can bring with it increased risk, wewere also conscious of the need to take steps to enhance the safety and stability of the banking system.I am not in this speech going to summarise all our reform measures, which are due to be implementedover the period to the end of 2001. Instead, I will describe what we have done so far, and the maintasks that remain to be done.The progress on competitive reformsSo far we have introduced three main changes that are intended to promote competition:• In September 1999, the one-building condition that applied to foreign banks licensed after1978 was relaxed to allow such banks to open branches in a maximum of three separate
3BIS Review 69/2000buildings. At the same time we eliminated any restriction on the number of regional andback offices that foreign banks can maintain.• In December 1999, we announced that agreement had been reached with the various partiesinvolved for restricted licence banks to join the RTGS interbank payment system. Thedetailed legal arrangements were finalised in May of this year and a formal invitation to jointhe system was issued to those RLBs with a clear business need to do so.• Finally, at the beginning of July of this year, we embarked on the first phase of deregulationof the remaining interest rate rules. This involved removal of the interest rate cap on timedeposits with a maturity of less than 7 days. Following this, all time deposits are nowcompletely deregulated.What has been the reaction to these changes? The answer is that not much has happened so far.Despite the fears of some of the local banks that they would have to cope with a flood of new foreignbank branches, no foreign banks have as yet taken the opportunity to establish additional branches. Ofcourse, many foreign banks are engaged in wholesale, corporate or private banking business in HongKong and do not require an extensive branch network. Moreover, a number of banks are stillrecovering from the Asian crisis or are in the process of merging, and are not in an expansion mode atpresent. As mentioned previously, however, there are some foreign banks that are enthusiastic aboutbuilding up their presence in Hong Kong. But perhaps for these, the organic route of establishing newbranches, and having these limited to three, is too slow and restrictive. Acquisition of an existingoperation is likely to be more attractive for such banks.We have already said that we will review the impact of the three building condition in the first quarterof 2001. If it appears that it is serving little useful purpose - because there is not in any case a hugedemand on the part of foreign banks for additional branches - we may simply dispense with thecondition altogether.Similarly, no RLB has yet applied to join the RTGS system. It is however early days for this, and weare aware that some of the more active RLBs are considering whether to apply. They will need toweigh the costs and benefits of direct membership compared with the existing practice of using asettlement bank. The important point is that the RLBs are now in a position to make that choice basedon their own business needs. If the RLBs feel that there are any remaining impediments to theirjoining the system we would be pleased to hear from them.Interest rate deregulationThe first phase of interest deregulation also produced a muted response. This is not unexpected nor isit unwelcome. We are trying to avoid “big bang” deregulation that might be disruptive. Some bankshave introduced new overnight deposit accounts, which pay interest above the savings account rate.But so far we have not seen any large-scale migration from savings accounts to 24-hour call accounts.This is perhaps not surprising given the ample liquidity in the banking system, which means that thebanks have a reduced incentive to bid actively for fresh deposits. This is reflected in the unusuallysmall differential between the interest rate on savings accounts and those on time deposits. Forexample, the gap between the savings account rate and the one-month time deposit rate was only about0.5% at the end of August. This reduces the incentive for depositors to forego the loss of liquidityinvolved in switching into time deposits.Of course, there could be a more significant impact in July 2001 when the process of deregulation isdue to be completed with the removal of the interest rate cap on savings accounts and of theprohibition of interest on current accounts. Based on self-assessments that we asked the banks toprepare earlier this year, there is a general view that competition in the banking sector will intensifyafter the final phase of deregulation and that there could be quite a significant impact on the netinterest margin.That was also the conclusion of the KPMG/Barents Consultancy Study. But the actual impact willobviously depend on the conditions at the time. If the supply of deposits remains ample in a year’s
BIS Review 69/20004time, banks will have less reason to bid aggressively for deposits. Despite this, many banks may usederegulation as an opportunity to try to gain market share and to attract new customers by offeringnew deposit products with an attractive interest rate. Innovation and competition of that kind is whatderegulation is intended to achieve. It should also encourage more efficiency in pricing and theelimination of cross-subsidisation. Expect therefore to see more transaction fees and charges torecover servicing costs, and use of differential pricing to encourage customers with low and volatilebalances to use less costly delivery channels such as the internet.The need for fairness and transparencyBanks are at liberty to impose such fees and charges, but it is essential that they should be fair andtransparent in doing so. This is particularly the case if the banks are intending to get more involved inconsumer and wealth management business where it is important to retain the trust of the customer.The banks cannot afford a bad image otherwise they may find their customers going elsewhere - forexample, to internet-based financial institutions.As we have seen from some recent incidents, the banks in Hong Kong have been lagging behind in theprovision of clear information to their customers about the cost of some financial products such ascredit card advances. Moreover, there has been recent controversy about the provisions in credit cardagreements that entitle the lenders to reclaim from debtors the full legal costs and expenses ofrecovering overdue debts. In a recent court case, the judge ruled that the relevant provisions wereunconscionable and therefore could not be enforced.We have written to authorised institutions to ask them to review their terms and conditions in the lightof the court’s ruling and to ensure that they are consistent with Hong Kong law. We have also initiateda review of the Code of Banking Practice with a view to strengthening the provisions on such issues astransparency in the provision of banking services and the proper and responsible use of debt collectionagents. These issues are already addressed in the Code to some extent, and perhaps if the spirit of theCode had been more closely adhered to, some of the recent bad publicity for the banks could havebeen avoided. However, it is evident that the Code needs to be made more specific in some areas, andthe issue of how to ensure compliance must also be addressed.The Code of Banking Practice is not part of our reform measures, but I have digressed to talk about itfor two reasons. First, as already indicated, it becomes all the more important in a deregulatedenvironment to ensure that there is a fair and balanced relationship between banks and their customers.Second, the fact that we are going to have to devote resources to this issue for the rest of this yearmeans that one of our reform measures, namely a review of the current three tier system ofauthorisation, will be postponed from this year to next. This will also allow us to take into account theresults of our forthcoming review of deposit protection arrangements, which may have a bearing onthe minimum size of deposits that authorised institutions which are not licensed banks should beallowed to take.Safety and soundness of the banking systemDeposit protection is part of what might be called the safety net arrangements for the banking system.As the name suggests the safety net is there to catch banks that are in trouble or, if not the banks, thenat least their depositors. This is part of the other aspect of our reform measures that are aimed atpromoting the safety and soundness of the banking system.One aspect of this is already in place in the form of a policy statement issued by the HKMA in June oflast year on its role as Lender of Last Resort to authorised institutions.The major safety and soundness issues however lie ahead. The first is whether we should introduce acommercial credit reference agency in Hong Kong which would gather and collate information fromparticipating institutions about the indebtedness and credit record of their corporate borrowers. Thiswould enable lenders to obtain a more complete picture of the financial position of their customers,and thus improve their credit assessment and perhaps make them willing to lend. That is the theory,
5BIS Review 69/2000which seems to be supported by both academic research and the experience of overseas countries. Weare currently nearing the end of a consultation period and will consider the way forward in the light ofthe comments received.As this consultation ends, we are about to embark on another that may be more contentious. I amreferring to the possible enhancement of the deposit protection arrangements in Hong Kong. In theirConsultancy Study, KPMG/Barents identified this as an important issue as the banking sector becomesmore competitive and the level of risk possibly increases. They also considered that the currentarrangements, which give priority to small depositors, did not appear to have sufficiently raised thecrisis of confidence threshold to avoid bank runs. They therefore recommended that the issue ofdeposit protection should be looked at again.This we have done in the form of a new consultancy study by Arthur Andersen that was completed inJuly of this year. This has looked at various options for deposit protection, including maintenance ofthe status quo at one extreme and the introduction of an explicit scheme for deposit insurance at theother. Such schemes are increasingly being introduced around the world and are advocated by anumber of international standard setting bodies. The drawbacks of deposit insurance are however wellknown, including the risk of increased systemic instability due to moral hazard. The costs of such ascheme would also need to be carefully considered.This is a controversial issue that will need to be fully debated. Subject to views of Exco, it is ourintention to undertake a consultation on the various options for deposit protection at the beginning ofOctober. If it is eventually decided to introduce one of these options, further consultation would thenbe required on the detailed arrangements.Risk-based supervisionOf course, the best thing would be for the safety net not to be actually used. In other words, we shouldbe trying to prevent banks getting into difficulties in the first place. This requires effectivemanagement by the banks themselves as well as careful monitoring by the banking supervisors. Thefirst of these we have tried to address through our recent Guideline on the Corporate Governance ofLocally Incorporated Authorised Institutions. This is intended to encourage high standards ofmanagement in such institutions and thus help them to deal with the challenges ahead.These challenges also require enhancements to our system of banking supervision. As recommendedby KPMG/Barents, we are introducing a more risk-based approach. This aims to be more forward-looking than the old style of supervision. It focuses more precisely on the various types of risk beingrun by individual banks, the quantity of such risks and the quality of the system used to manage them.If used properly, it should lead to a less intrusive and less burdensome supervisory approach towardswell-managed institutions.We have been developing this approach over the last year and have applied it to a number of the localbanks. We intend to roll it out to cover foreign banks next year. It is important that the whole processshould be transparent and to assist in this we intend to issue a framework document quite shortlywhich will outline the new approach. We are also engaged in a major rewrite of our supervisoryguidelines to make them more user-friendly and to put them into a common format. This is asubstantial project that will take about a year to complete. In the meantime, we shall be issuing newand revised supervisory guidelines in the new format as they come off the production line.ConclusionsTo sum up, our reform package is not intended to be revolutionary. The Hong Kong banking system isalready well-managed and competitive. But even good players need to improve their game asconditions become tougher. The main responsibility for doing this in the Hong Kong banking contextwill rest with the banks themselves. We in the HKMA are trying to do our bit by removing possiblebarriers to change in a cautious manner, and by making sure that our supervisory approach remainsappropriate to the changing market environment.
1BIS Review 68/2000S A Grenville: Notes on East Asian financial cooperationSpeech by Mr S A Grenville, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the AnuInternational Conference on Financial Markets and Policies in East Asia, held in Canberra, on4 September 2000.*      *      *In an increasingly globalised world, it is reasonable to ask why regional financial arrangements mightstill be important and worth striving for. Aren’t we all going to be ruled by Thomas Friedman’sGolden Straitjacket, under the gimlet-eyed surveillance of the Electronic Herd? What place, in thisseamlessly integrated world, for regional arrangements?The key point driving any regional arrangement is commonality of interests - even in a globalisedworld, we care more about what happens to our neighbours than we would about countries of equalsize but geographically remote. Just as there will be different levels of government (local, national)within a country, not all international issues will be best dealt with on a one-world universal basis.Perhaps the most positive specific element of regional arrangements is their great potential for fruitfulinteraction which will raise understanding, cooperation, coordination and technical standards allround. One specific economic aspect of this is the so-called “peer surveillance” which has emerged ina number of regional arrangements. But the much more informal exchanges between technicians willprobably be more important still - someone notices that one of their regional neighbours has a goodway of doing something, so they copy it.In large part as a consequence of this continuing interaction, another important benefit from regionalarrangements is their superior knowledge of what is happening in the region. I can recall that in July1997, when East Asian central bankers met in Shanghai, it was very obvious to everyone at thatmeeting that the Asian crisis was going to be very serious indeed. Four months later, the US Presidentwas still talking about the crisis as “a few glitches on the road” - no reflection on his own competencein an enormously complex world, but a reflection of the poor advice going into the USdecision-making process, which was reflected elsewhere, for instance in the lack of participation in theThai support program in August 1997.At the same time, it would have to be acknowledged that we were not able to use this betterknowledge to improve the decision-making process in the multilateral agencies (particularly the IMF).But this just says that we have to try harder in future, and turn potential into actual. We have to lookfor the opportunities to use these regional forums as a way of refining, concentrating and amplifyingour voice, so that the distilled wisdom of this interaction is heard more effectively in the multilateralforums. To provide a specific example: there can hardly be any doubt that the IMF Indonesianprogram would have been quite different if it had had an effective input from the region - the long-term desirability (but low priority) of doing something about the clove monopoly would have beenkept in better perspective against the pressingly urgent short-term crisis of massive capital outflow. Inmacro policy, the overly tight budgets of the IMF’s initial prescription might have been avoided.A strong regional representation could catalyse a better articulation of other aspects of our interests atthe multilateral level. There is a danger that, at the multilateral level, the United States will promotethe cause of those areas of principal interest to it (principally Latin America) and Europe will promotethe interests of its Eastern European neighbours (including Russia), but that the interests of thecountries of Asia may be without a big country champion and advocate at the multilateral debate. Wesee this danger in the Contingent Credit Line program being devised at the IMF, where countrieswhich receive a prior “seal of approval” will be able to draw on Fund support more or lessautomatically in time of need. There is a real danger that countries which get this seal of approval arelikely to be the countries of principal interest to the largest members of the IMF who dominate theBoard. We may be able to redress this balance if our regional voice is well coordinated.
BIS Review 68/20002A further factor in favour of regional arrangements is that, when it comes to collecting funds, aregional group can mobilise the strong forces of self-interest and immediate concern that are feltwithin a small, geographically contiguous group. The Thai support package - where the regionalcontribution was almost three times the size of the IMF’s contribution - illustrates that regionalarrangements can be effective when multilateral agencies are slow across the ground or hindered byimperfect assessments of the situation.The form of the arrangementsWhat form should these regional arrangements take?The point that should be made here is that a fair amount of overlap is inevitable, and no bad thing.Certainly, representational resources are a constraint, but within this broad constraint, we should notbe too fretted that a particular subject is discussed in more than one place. That said, there may beroom for pruning and specialisation in the quite wide variety of organisations which already existwithin the region.New developmentsPerhaps the most important and striking new development is the embryonic currency arrangementscoming out of ASEAN+3. The initial suggestion is one of foreign currency swaps, but there may besome implication that this could lead to various currency linkages, perhaps ultimately culminating insome form of currency union. There is a good debate already underway as to whether regionalcurrency baskets make sense (a debate carried on at this conference), and whether Asia seems asuitable case for a currency union. It is important for us, here in Australia, to make sure we do notconfuse the issue of evaluating these various proposals with the desirability of being present at thetable when these discussions take place. Whatever the merits of particular arrangements, thesediscussions are, in themselves, an important part of the process of swapping ideas and coming tounderstand each other better. So the case for Australia wanting to be there is a clear one, and weshould state this clearly (as we have done), without wishing to elbow our way into any arrangement inwhich we are not wanted. The critical thing, for Australia, is to be able to establish our goodwill andcompetence in such a way that the countries in this group will feel it to their own advantage to have uspresent. We are some distance away from this at the moment, but the starting point is to recognise thedesirability of being at the table. We might remember, too, that the Euro took 50 years to get off theground, and that at the start there must have been far more scepticism than support among countrieswhich had so recently been in mortal combat.The other idea, waiting offstage in the wings at the moment, is for an Asian Monetary Fund. Whenthis was first proposed during the Asian crisis, Australia had some reservations about the particularformat which had been proposed. But whatever the views at the time, we need to keep an open mind.Some of the initial opposition (particularly from the United States) may have its origins in viewing allof this through the IMF prism, and the advantages set out above for regional arrangements apply herealso - that smaller groups will often be more appropriate to particular problems and bring specialexpertise and focus.So a postscript can be added to these discussions. We should not see different groups as rivals: anysuch arrangements should be seen as complementary, not competing with multilateral arrangements.LeadershipOne serious issue for the future of regional arrangements in this region is the unresolved issues ofleadership. In terms of GDP and technological sophistication, the obvious regional leader is Japan.Partly for historical reasons, and partly because of its internal focus, Japan has not exercised the sort ofleadership which is commensurate with its economic clout. In terms of population and potentialeconomic size in the long run, China might claim the role. Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia have
3BIS Review 68/2000sophisticated financial markets, but each of these economies is relatively small. Within ASEAN, thedominant country (Indonesia) is, unfortunately, in no position, for the moment, to be a vigorous leaderof regional arrangements. So there is a major unresolved issue here.Where to from here?From the Australian viewpoint, this is in some ways a low point for regional arrangements. The realprogress which has been made in getting better representation in the multilateral forums fornon-European (and particularly Asian) voices is undisputed. G20 (the lineal successor to G22) nowhas the potential to become a premier group for discussing the critical issues of globalisation, with arepresentative audience no longer dominated by Europeans. The Financial Stability Forum has beenformed, again with good representation from the region, to hammer out the specifics of financial rulesand regulations. Membership of the Bank for International Settlements has been significantly openedup to non-European members. So there has been real progress at the multilateral level. But at theregional level, the Asian crisis has been an enormous distraction from the mundane task of buildingregional institutions, with the officials who had got to know each other well in such forums as EMEAPand the Manila Framework being very substantially weakened and dispersed in the aftermath of thecrisis. Peer surveillance has not taken the major role that it might have, lacking any clear functionalmodel or strong leadership. The current focus on the Chiang Mai swap proposals could be the basis ofsome important ties, but we should keep in mind that ASEAN has had such swap arrangements inplace for quite some time, and EMEAP had in place somewhat similar repo arrangements, which didnot provide much advantage in the Asian crisis in 1997. Such arrangements are valuable in that theyget people together and talking about other issues, but it would be a mistake to see them, taken bythemselves, as massive breakthroughs in regional cooperation.As for Australia’s role and links in all of this, it would have to be said that the present moment is arather disappointing one. A good case can be made that Australia served a useful role during the crisis,first of all as participant in the support packages (Japan was the only other country to contribute to allthree), but more importantly in its assessment of the crisis as it unfolded, and its attempts to point outdeficiencies in the multilateral approach, with the visit of our Foreign Minister and the RBA Governorto the United States in early 1998. However, it would have to be said that this voice was not heard, andvery little was achieved. Australia’s own performance during the Asian crisis might be a positiveexample and a reminder of the benefits of competent policies, but may well have been mistaken, byour Asian neighbours, as boastful blowing of our own trumpet during a time of their misfortune. Thesouring of our relationship with Indonesia over Timor has blocked off a potentially important entréeinto the ASEAN arrangements. Our best chance, now, is to build on the myriad spider-web ties whichbind all sorts of Australians - business people, academics and officials - to their counterparts in Asia,in the hope that this network proves a strong enough foundation for us to take a vigorous role inwhatever regional arrangements are formed in Asia.
1BIS Review 68/2000Joseph Yam: The WTO - China’s future and Hong Kong’s opportunitySpeech by Mr Joseph Yam, JP, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at aconference co-sponsored by the Cato Institute and the Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research on“Globalisation, the WTO, and Capital Flows - Hong Kong’s legacy, China’s future”, held inHong Kong, on 4 September 2000.*      *      *I feel honoured to be invited to deliver the keynote address at today’s conference on the implicationsof China’s prospective entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This is a timely conferencefor, although the arrangements for China’s entry into the WTO are not yet signed and sealed, it looksvery likely that they will be agreed soon. The Cato Institute takes a special interest in the relationshipbetween economic change and government policy throughout the world, and it is appropriate that itshould be following this historic event closely. The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research - now,I note, more than 20 years old - has established a solid reputation for independent research into publicpolicy and economic affairs: it is therefore well positioned to provide the Hong Kong and regionalperspective. It also seems right to me - despite the heavy rainfall we’ve been having this summer - thatHong Kong should be the venue for this conference. The reasons, I hope, will become clear in thisaddress. On behalf of the Hong Kong SAR Government, I extend a warm welcome to all of you whoare visiting Hong Kong from overseas, particularly those who are here for the first time: I hope thatthis will be an enjoyable and memorable stay.The broad implications of China’s accession to the WTOWhat will China’s accession to the WTO mean for China and the rest of the world? For China - whichis already the world’s ninth largest trading entity - it will mean more external trade, and external tradeof a better quality. There will be substantial tariff reductions among China’s existing trading partnersand there will be access to more trading partners for China. At the same time, China will be cutting itstariffs on a broad range of products, from agricultural to industrial. Tariff reductions allowcomparative advantage greater play. They will help eliminate trade distortions and facilitate moreefficient allocation of resources among the trading partners, thus further promoting economic growthglobally. The World Bank’s estimates give an indication of the growth potential of China’s trade on itsaccession to the WTO. China’s share in world exports will double in the space of five years: from thepresent 3.7% to around 7.3% by 2005. China’s share in world imports is expected to rise marginallyfaster than its share in exports: from the present 3.4% to 7.2% in five years’ time.This doubling in China’s share in the world’s external trade will be complemented by an opening tothe world of large sectors of the economy that have hitherto been closed to external investors: thetelecommunications, financial services and distribution industries, for example, and a variety oftechnical and professional services. These are all areas with enormous potential in China. They havealready, over the past decade, seen dramatic change and expansion through the - still raging -revolution in information technology. WTO entry will give them a further boost by breaking downrestrictive barriers and opening the channels for direct investment and technology transfer fromoutside. Increased foreign competition in these areas will force Chinese enterprises to speed up theirreforms to meet the challenges. From a larger and longer perspective, further economic liberalisationand integration into the global economy will undoubtedly be a stimulus to regulatory, institutional andcultural change within China: I note that this is an important theme in today’s conference, although itseems to be a matter of some considerable debate what path, or paths, that change will follow. Thegeneral view, nevertheless, is that WTO entry will mean growth, integration and globalisation for themainland’s economy.
BIS Review 68/20002The implications for Hong KongThe view on the implications for Hong Kong are, on the other hand, somewhat divided. At the extremeend of the spectrum there are those who believe that China’s WTO entry will be one more nail in thecoffin, one more noose around the neck, for Hong Kong: that the diversion of business that will resultfrom the now well-advanced infrastructural development in China’s coastal cities and the direct accessprovided through WTO membership heralds the demise of Hong Kong’s historical role asintermediary between China and the rest of the world. In support of this, the impressive physicaldevelopments in Shanghai, the readiness - and the skill - with which our colleagues on the mainlandare embracing the English language and the internet, the important regulatory reforms are all cited as ifit will only be a matter of a couple of years or so for all the business now going on in Hong Kong to belifted up and poured into the millions of square feet of gleaming new office space now waiting inPudong.The outlook is, I think, somewhat more complicated, and a great deal more positive, than this scenariosuggests. And it is worth adding that we have seen so many nails hammered into Hong Kong’s coffinthat the coffin is now more metal than wood. According to some, in the past few years alone HongKong has been diagnosed with a whole collection of terminal diseases brought by the handover in1997, the recent regional financial crisis, the “threat” not just from Shanghai but also from Seoul,Singapore and Sydney, the high cost of doing business, declining educational standards, worseningpollution and, believe it or not, too stable a currency as well, and a whole host of other factors. Theimpending “catastrophe” of China’s entry into the WTO is the latest spectre on the horizon, and nodoubt when that one passes without incident more demons will be conjured up. Yet, in this moribundstate, we are still managing to struggle along with GDP growth - projected for this year - of 8.5% andexport growth at double-digit rates in recent quarters.The World Bank projections on the effects of WTO entry - a doubling in the space of five years ofChina’s share in international trade (which is itself projected to grow at the rate of about 6% perannum) - suggests that the business “creation effect” stimulated by WTO accession will far outweighthe “diversion effect”. There should, in brief, be more than enough work to keep both Shanghai andHong Kong busy for a long time to come, and more than enough skill and enterprise available in bothcities to enable each to focus on the opportunities that WTO entry will bring. There will be somesimilarity in functions, but there will also be scope for each city to develop its own characteristics as afinancial centre. The logical trend in financial services, given the continuation of exchange controls onthe mainland, in contrast to the free flow of capital in and out of Hong Kong, as enshrined in the BasicLaw, seems to be for Shanghai to develop as China’s domestic financial centre and for Hong Kong todevelop as its international financial centre. But there is no reason why they should be deliberatelyconstrained to these roles. China has room for at least two global cities. Nor is there any reason why,in the event the mainland attains the financial and other freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong, Shanghaishould not have a go at the business of international finance, or why Hong Kong, with its highlysophisticated financial infrastructure, to facilitate efficient international as well as domestic financialintermediation, should not have a go at the RMB business. A little competition is no bad thing, as longas it is fair competition, and Hong Kong’s free enterprise is very good at it. The only residual worry isthat the playing field might be a tilted one, involving subsidies and other forms of support orprotection from the authorities. But WTO entry is thankfully conditional upon the removal of many ofthese obstacles to free and fair competition, to the advantage of those that are good at this game andare prepared to embrace it.The broad implications of China’s WTO entry for Hong Kong are perhaps best divided into the near-term impact and the longer-term impact. The near-term impact is, I think, unequivocally positive forHong Kong. For general trade our estimates within the HKMA suggest that, although our domesticexports to the mainland will be largely unaffected by the WTO terms, our re-export trade, involvingthe movement of goods to and from the mainland through Hong Kong, will be considerably boosted,and should raise our annual GDP growth rate by somewhere between 0.5% to 1%. In terms offinancial, technical and professional services, which are increasingly taking centre stage in HongKong’s economy, the near-term outlook is even more encouraging. These industries will beconsiderably boosted - and enriched - by the Chinese enterprises that are seeking to upgrade their
3BIS Review 68/2000capabilities and governance methods to handle increased business and meet foreign competition, andby overseas investors who need advice on how to make the best of the opportunities on the mainland.There are clear signs that this boost is already in progress, in anticipation of WTO accession.The longer-term impact (let’s say beyond the five-year horizon) is less clear. It is quite reasonable toexpect that Hong Kong’s intermediary role in many areas will be eroded, as traders on the mainlanddeal directly with the rest of the world. Yet, the view from the market seems to be that, while adeclining proportion (but not a declining amount) of China’s goods will physically pass through HongKong, Hong Kong companies will continue to play an important intermediary function in sourcing theproducts and identifying the markets. Beyond this, it is likely that Hong Kong’s role will graduallychange from one of intermediary into one of proprietor. The further liberalisation of China’s economyoffers immense opportunities for Hong Kong investors, who, apart from possessing the necessarywealth, have a number of distinct advantages. They have a common language and culture with theircounterparts on the mainland. They have an immense and very detailed knowledge of the mainlandbusiness landscape, and a great deal of practical experience. They also have proximity and well-established connections. This will no doubt be a profound change in role for Hong Kong. But I alsohave no doubt that Hong Kong will be able to cope well, just as it did over its history of economicdevelopment, from entrepot to manufacturing centre to international business centre.Those of you who speak with businessmen and women in Hong Kong - who are the backbone of oureconomy - will probably hear that many of them are already establishing or reinforcing their links, oropening branch offices across the border in anticipation of China’s WTO entry. This trend is alreadyquite evident in the larger companies. The Hong Kong-based company that operates our container portfacilities is expanding its operations into the newly modernising ports of the mainland. In new sectors,such as internet services, Hong Kong companies have been among the first to grasp the opportunitieson the mainland. The outlook for Hong Kong investment on the mainland is one of both sectoral andgeographical diversification: from the mainly manufacturing activities that grew up in the Pearl RiverDelta in the 1980s, to a variety of activities spread over a much larger region. And, like theestablishment of the Special Economic Zones close to Hong Kong nearly a quarter of a century ago,China’s entry into the WTO will underline the truism that the more China opens to the world, the moreHong Kong benefits.The implications for banking and financial servicePhysical trade and the less visible trade in services require a financial infrastructure in the same waythat new buildings need plumbing and electrical wiring. We expect that the “creation effect” of WTOentry will result in a surge in banking business on the mainland. There are two main elements in thisprocess. The first is the greater demand for banking services, resulting from the growth induced by theeffects of WTO accession. The second is the financial deepening, stimulated by more rapid financialliberalisation, greater banking competition, and product innovation induced by the terms of WTOaccession. These processes have positive implications for domestic banks incorporated in the mainlandand for foreign banks, including banks incorporated in Hong Kong.For the domestic banks, expanding business and the challenge of foreign competition provide animpetus for reform and innovation. The banking reforms currently in progress in China are proceedingwell. These include, among other things, the establishment of asset management companies to carveout the bad assets inherited from the days of policy lending. They also include the full introduction ofcommercial principles and market-based credit policies, and improvements in accounting standards.There will also be a profound impact on the governance and culture of the commercial banks, in termsof much better transparency and accountability, especially if these banks are to be floated as intended.To meet foreign competition, they will also put much more emphasis on recruiting good people,including those studying abroad, and giving them proper training. A good example is the recent jointventure between Qinghua University and Harvard Business School to provide extensive training forbank managers in the mainland. They will also need a much clearer business and IT strategy, whichcould include the need for consolidation. WTO entry will mean a phased opening of China’s bankingmarket to foreign banks. Restrictions on foreign banks’ operations, in terms of the scope of business,
BIS Review 68/20004clients and geographical coverage, will be gradually relaxed. There is therefore a strong need forChina’s banks to gear up and gird themselves for the challenges that will be posed by theirsophisticated foreign competitors.For foreign banks, the opportunities brought by financial liberalisation on the mainland, in the contextof WTO, are immense. In two years’ time, foreign banks will be able to conduct RMB business withChinese enterprises in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Dalian. Within five years, they will be able todeal with all Chinese enterprises without any geographical restriction. The obvious advantages forHong Kong’s banks in this process are the same advantages that have taken Hong Kong’s otherindustries into the mainland. Hong Kong’s banks were among the first to open branches on themainland, especially in the southern cities: they know China well, speak the language, have extensivebranch networks, and maintain strong relationships, some of which have grown up over more than ageneration. There are niches in which Hong Kong’s banks should maintain and extend theircompetitive advantage. For example, they should be able to continue to derive substantial businessfrom the extensive involvement of Hong Kong companies in the manufacturing and retail sectors inChina, in the form of private or joint venture enterprises. Given also that about 40% of the mainland’strade is routed through Hong Kong, Hong Kong’s banks will have an unrivalled advantage over otherbanks in capturing the increased demand for trade and related financing services. As the largest sourceof foreign direct investment in the mainland, and as China’s main financial conduit and fundingcentre, Hong Kong will stand to benefit considerably from the increased demand for banking servicesin China.There are, however, potential diversion effects that Hong Kong, and in particular Hong Kong’s banks,will have to consider and address if they wish to make the best out of their competitive advantages.Size will be an issue for banks wishing to enter the banking market on the mainland. Although size isnot necessary a good indication of quality, it is a convenient regulatory tool, and I do not see, at leastin the foreseeable future, any likelihood of relaxation in the size criterion of USD 20 billion. I havebeen in regular dialogue with the People’s Bank of China on this, and I can understand and appreciatethe constraints imposed by the terms of the WTO negotiations on any relaxation which may facilitatethe consideration of entrance by smaller Hong Kong incorporated banks, along with foreign banks ofsimilar size. So the question of consolidation - which already has other advantages to commend it -arises again. It is also quite natural that foreign banks will find it attractive to deal directly with themainland, rather than through Hong Kong. But there should still be factors that encourage them tocontinue to use Hong Kong as a base. For example, given economies of scale, it is much cheaper forforeign banks to cover their China operations through their Hong Kong offices, rather than incurringthe additional costs of setting up a new office in, say, Shanghai. Also, contrary to the establishedwisdom, the cost advantages are not always on Shanghai’s side: corporate tax, for example, is twicewhat it is in Hong Kong. Other positive inducements include the efficiency and sophistication of HongKong’s financial markets, and the critical mass that goes with being the world’s fourth largest bankingcentre and seventh largest foreign exchange centre.We have in Hong Kong a pool of professional expertise trained in all facets of international business: askilled local workforce, which is well educated, computer-literate, productive, disciplined and highlytrainable; in addition to a foreign expertise attracted by rich business opportunities and aninternational, cosmopolitan orientation, with English as the business language. Without wishing tolabour the elements that make up a free economy - which the Cato Institute has set out so well - I thinkit is worth highlighting the point that Hong Kong scores extremely high on all of them. It enjoys therule of law and the free movement of information, capital and human resources. It has efficient andclean government, a market-oriented economic policy, a non-intrusive but effective regulatory system,and a low and simple tax regime. It treats domestic and overseas companies on equal terms and has aliberal policy on employing foreigners with expertise. In short, Hong Kong possesses almost all of theconceivable favourable economic, legal and political attributes for attracting banks and otherorganisations to set up their regional headquarters here.Our estimate, within the HKMA, is that, for Hong Kong’s banking sector, as for trade generally, the“creation effect” of China’s entry into the WTO will significantly outweigh the “diversion effect”.Hong Kong’s banking sector stands to benefit substantially from the increased demand for banking
5BIS Review 68/2000services in China. This will have a boosting effect on Hong Kong’s lending business to China,provided that Hong Kong can continue to improve its infrastructural framework and its regulatoryregime so that the diversion effect is minimised. Developments in these areas, including the recentlyopened US dollar clearing system and the substantial regulatory reforms currently in progress, suggestthat we are on the right track.Monetary implicationsTurning to the implications for monetary policy, I am happy to observe that we have moved some waybeyond the misunderstandings that have often clouded the view from outside of Hong Kong’smonetary relationship with the mainland. The old myths that 1997 would mean that the renminbiwould replace the Hong Kong dollar or that Beijing would take control of Hong Kong’s extensiveforeign reserves are now dead and buried after three highly successful years of experience of “onecountry, two monetary systems”. More recently, the current issue of speculation surrounding therenminbi - and one which is far more grounded in reality - is the question of whether its exchange ratewill be given greater flexibility in the near future. This revives the old question of how far the HongKong dollar will be affected by movements in the renminbi, which has some connection with China’sprospective WTO accession, and it is therefore worth examining the rationale behind it, and theimplications.First, however, since there is some confusion on this point, it is helpful to clarify the differencebetween flexibility and convertibility. Convertibility means the ability of a currency to be freelyexchanged into foreign currencies, either for trade (current account convertibility) or for investment(capital account convertibility). The renminbi enjoys current account convertibility but is not freelyconvertible for capital account transactions. Flexibility means the degree to which the exchange rate isallowed to fluctuate before there is intervention by the central bank. At present, there is flexibility inthe exchange rate of the renminbi, in that the exchange rate is determined by “market” supply anddemand, although the central bank remains the ultimate banker in the market. The renminbi has indeedbeen trading within a very narrow band in the past few years. The narrowness I think reflects Chinahaving acted responsibly, against the background of financial turmoil in Asia, in not allowing greaterflexibility in the renminbi exchange rate to add destabilising volatility to Asian currencies. However, anumber of observers, including the IMF, now believe that there is scope for more flexibility. But,while most observers regard full convertibility as a desirable long-term goal, few believe that anysignificant moves will be made in that direction in the near term. This means that, even if the renminbiwere to be given more flexibility, it would probably still be subject to the existing exchange ratecontrols.The immediate consideration for policymakers on the mainland and markets is whether, with greaterflexibility, the renminbi would go up or down. China’s persistent current account surpluses suggestthat it should appreciate. But the market does not seem to feel this way. The non-deliverable forwardexchange rate for the purchase of US dollars is continuously at a significant premium. The differencein views may have two explanations. One is the large amount of negative errors and omissions in thebalance of payments, which many presume to indicate unidentified capital outflows. The second is theconcern that many have that WTO accession will precipitate, at least initially, a surge in imports that isgreater than the surge in exports.Why, then, should flexibility be a matter for consideration? There could be a number of advantagesfrom the perspective of the mainland. For example, allowing more interaction of supply and demandof foreign exchange for current account transactions may serve as a kind of market smoothingmechanism, especially as the short-term volatility of trade flows may increase with the WTOaccession. The renminbi exchange rate should also be able to respond more to the underlying trends inexternal trade. Greater flexibility may also permit exchange rate adjustments in pursuit of othermacroeconomic objectives. Should greater flexibility in renminbi be pursued, I believe that therewould be advantages, in the interests of transparency and market confidence, for the mainland to setout clearly what it expects to achieve by the measure, especially in the absence of any move towardsfuller convertibility. If the benefits are in doubt, or if the underlying motivation is misunderstood,
BIS Review 68/20006there could be an adverse impact on general sentiment, which would be manifested in the financialmarkets.We all know how sensitive financial markets can be, and this sensitivity somewhat blurs the HongKong response to the prospect of greater flexibility in the renminbi’s exchange rate, in particular itsimpact on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. Together with the confusion between theconvertibility of a currency and the flexibility in an exchange rate, this sensitivity perhaps explains therather excited off-the-cuff response given earlier this year by the group of Hong Kong businessmen toPremier Zhu Rongji when the subject was raised in a meeting among them. As a result, there was thismessage to me that we in the HKMA should examine the matter carefully. We have since done so andI have, in July, provided Premier Zhu with a response, through Governor Dai Xianglong of thePeople’s Bank of China. The gist of the response is that, on the basis of economic fundamentals, thereis no reason why the Hong Kong dollar should be impacted by changes in the renminbi exchange rate.But things get a little more complicated when market sentiment enters the picture. During the Asiancrisis, the market perceived a strong correlation between the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi. Thiswas partly attributable to misconceptions about the economic - and perhaps the political - relationshipbetween Hong Kong and the mainland, and partly due to the market’s practice of regarding the HongKong dollar as a proxy hedge for the renminbi. Over the past year or so, however, the renminbi andthe Hong Kong dollar have become substantially decoupled in the eyes of the market. This decouplingcan be most easily read by comparing the Hong Kong dollar forward spread and the renminbi’snon-deliverable forward exchange rate, which tracked each other very closely until the end of 1998,when they began to diverge. The decoupling suggests that the market has drawn the obviousconclusion from the fact that, since the linked exchange rate was introduced in 1983, the renminbi hasdepreciated by more than 70%, while, during the same period, the Hong Kong dollar has remainedrock solid. And this was confirmed by the calmness with which the market took the raising of thepossibility of greater flexibility for the renminbi exchange rate by Premier Zhu.Our own study further suggests that, contrary to popular intuition, a devaluation of the renminbi mightactually provide a stimulus to the Hong Kong economy: this is because the positive impact on demandarising from the complementarities between the two economies would outweigh the negative impactof any loss of competitiveness in those relatively few activities where the two economies remain incompetition with each other. Such complementarities are in part reflected in Hong Kong’s role as amajor entrepot for mainland exports. For any renminbi devaluation, while Hong Kong’s own directtrade balance with the mainland will deteriorate, our re-exports of mainland origin should rise. Indeed,with the surge in mainland re-exports activities since the early 1980s, the margins earned on suchre-exports are now larger than all other components of Hong Kong’s trade with the mainlandcombined.ConclusionI have suggested in this address that China’s accession to the WTO will bring benefits to Hong Kongon a number of fronts. WTO entry will see a vast and rapid increase in China’s external trade. Not allof this additional trade will go through Hong Kong, but nor will it all avoid Hong Kong. Moreimportant still, the stimulus to liberalisation, globalisation and better corporate governance will expandand deepen Hong Kong’s well-established role as a fund of professional expertise, a centre ofinternational experience and a source and channel of investment. Hong Kong’s banking sector, with itsstrong reputation and long involvement in mainland business, stands to benefit greatly from theliberalisation in this area, providing that it can position itself to make the best out of the opportunities.In the monetary sphere, the various predictions about the future development of the renminbi in thelight of WTO membership - which include the possibility of greater exchange rate flexibility - wouldmost likely have positive implications for Hong Kong’s economy as a whole, and should create nodifficulties for Hong Kong’s entirely separate and soundly based currency.The role for Hong Kong in the context of a WTO that includes China, would, I believe, give evenfuller scope for the qualities that, in the assessment of the Cato Institute, make Hong Kong the freesteconomy in the world. All of this therefore leaves a small question in my mind about the title of this
7BIS Review 68/2000conference, and I hope the organisers will forgive me for raising it. The phrase “Hong Kong’s Legacy,China’s Future” has a bit of a morbid ring about it. It suggests that we in Hong Kong are bequeathingsomething to China before we breathe our last, and that you are assembled here for a funeral, or atleast a deathbed scene. This cannot, surely, be the intention behind the conference. The programmesuggests otherwise, and I am confident that, as the day unfolds, you will be hearing plenty of evidenceto show that there is a great deal of life left in this city and in the people who inhabit it. Step outside ofthis building and you will see it for yourself. I have tried to suggest in this address that bothHong Kong and the mainland stand to gain much from China’s accession to the WTO. Like most newdevelopments on the mainland, WTO entry presents enormous opportunities for Hong Kong,providing that we prepare and position ourselves to make the best out of them.
1BIS Review 66/2000Lars Nyberg: Issues in supervision of banks - the European experienceSpeech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Association ofProfessional Bankers, Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 26 August 2000.*      *      *BackgroundFirst of all, I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to discuss with you some questionsconcerning the supervision of banks. The issue, I understand, is quite timely, since Sri Lanka hasembarked on an ambitious project of developing the financial sector, opening the banking system tointernational influence and modernising it accordingly.A sound and well functioning financial sector is a key to economic development. This statement maysound uncontroversial in your ears, but it is not always accepted by the general public and by thepoliticians. The contributions of the financial sector are sometimes hard to explain in simple terms andpeople tend to look at banks with suspicion. To create credibility and respect for the financial sector ingeneral and most importantly for banks, a proper and well-developed supervision is essential. Bank ofSri Lanka has realised this and initiated a comprehensive upgrading of bank supervision. In my viewthis is exactly the right point to start developing the financial sector.Supervision, however, is developing quickly. Supervising a traditional highly regulated bankingsystem is far different from supervising a deregulated system open to foreign competition.Furthermore, going from a state of strict regulations to one of deregulation implies risks forundermining banking stability. Many countries, not least my own, have had bitter and expensiveexperiences from this.Of course, all countries have specific national features in their banking systems. The main risks arecommon all over the world, however, and the same challenges to supervision seem to appeareverywhere. I will focus on some important issues seen from my perspective, which includes theexperiences we gained during the Swedish banking crisis in the early nineties.DeregulationWhy deregulate if the consequences may be so dangerous? The obvious answer is that regulations tendto create inefficiency and prevent the domestic banking system from developing in response tointernational competition. The long run cost to society of extensive regulations is a poorly functioningfinancial sector.While regulations are usually put in place to decrease systemic risk they may indeed in the long run doquite the opposite. Strong regulations mean that banks have low incentives to adopt good creditpolicies and risk management techniques. Supervision tends to be excessively formal, focusing onformalities rather than on actual risks. Nor are the regulations and techniques of supervision updatedoften enough to foster the development of new activities and management of risks. Regulations shelterthe domestic banking industry from outside influence, which slowly tends to decrease efficiency andincrease systemic risk.Furthermore, in a regulated environment the likelihood is large that some credits may be subsidised,perhaps even channelled to politically desirable rather than economically sound projects, leading tomisallocation of resources.Albeit many people today acknowledge that the traditional kind of regulations do not produce thedesired results, we tend to keep them too long. Let me give you an example. In Sweden, we hadforeign exchange controls in place until 1989. Even though it was obvious that the controls were easyto circumvent and quite inefficient, the authorities were worried by what might happen if they were
BIS Review 66/20002abolished. Perhaps there would be a huge capital drain? Hundreds of pages were written in attempts tomap the consequences, but no comfort was provided this way. Eventually the central bank decided togo ahead in spite of the remaining uncertainty. To some surprise and some disappointment, nothingparticular happened in the market. The move had been anticipated and the controls inefficient enoughto allow the capital flows to adjust prior to the move.Credit controls and interest rate regulation had been abolished in Sweden four years earlier, in 1985,again probably far too late. Some people argue that the banking crisis we had in the early ninetiesmight have been much less severe if the banking system had been forced into a competitiveenvironment by deregulation a decade earlier.Keeping regulations too long is a danger, getting rid of them too quickly is another. This may soundpeculiar, but let me again give you an illustration. When, in 1985, credit controls were abolished inSweden, they had been in operation for more than forty years. Since the authorities had decided onhow much each bank could increase its credit book every single month, there was really no need toappraise credit applications in a particularly serious manner. Mortgage credits took most of theavailable credit volume and the remainder was allocated to safe projects. Credit losses in the bankingsystem were only a fraction of a percentage point of the credit stock each year. As a consequence, theability to appraise credit risk had slowly dwindled out of the banks. So, unfortunately, was the case forthe supervisors.When credit controls were finally removed the volume of credit virtually exploded. All banks wantedto increase their market shares and there was plenty of pent-up demand. Many loans were given tocustomers who, as it appeared later, were far from creditworthy and should not have passed a propercredit appraisal. The regulations had been abolished at the wrong time and without realising what anextended period of regulation had done to the ability of banks and supervisors to handle credit risk.What can be learnt from this? Quite obviously, deregulating does not mean the abolishing of all rulesaccording to which banks should behave. There are good and well documented reasons for regulatingbanks. Deregulation means the adoption of a new legal structure that is consistent with a competitivemarket economy. The dilemma of regulation is to balance between having too little and too much. Toomuch will stifle the banks, too little will lead to unsound risk taking. The traditional form of regulationwas to set very strict rules or to forbid banks from conducting certain activities. The modern form is tobe more flexible. Regulations set the boundaries while allowing the banks to operate within theseboundaries if they can prove that they have the skills and resources to do it in a sound manner. Modernregulation puts much more responsibility on the banks themselves and their owners and management.In Sweden, the former Banking Act actually prohibited the banks to engage in any activity that wasnot explicitly permitted in the law. The new Banking Act starts at the other end, permitting the banksto do whatever they find suitable except for certain activities that are explicitly forbidden.Today’s financial institutions, instruments and markets are, of course, much more sophisticated thanearlier. There is also much broader diversity in the sector. For example, the needs of customers aresatisfied in many different ways and by many different actors, certainly not only by banks.As a consequence, modern regulation needs to be more flexible than in earlier days, when the marketwas more homogeneous. The regulation should encourage competition and innovation, but at the sametime discourage unsound risk taking and generally unbecoming or even illegal behaviour. Only whenthere are strong arguments should the regulator outright restrict or prohibit certain activities. Instead,regulations should provide incentives for banks and others to behave in a sound manner. For instance,capital requirements do not prohibit risky exposures, but they make them expensive to the bank.Before moving somewhat deeper into the questions of supervision, there are some things to say aboutrisk management.
3BIS Review 66/2000Risk managementRisk management systems are at the core of modern banks. Banks must have consistent systems foridentifying, monitoring, controlling and managing risks. These systems must be endorsed andunderstood not only by credit officers, but also by the board and the management.In a deregulated banking sector, the division of control and responsibilities in a bank is of particularimportance. Owners must take an active interest in the bank by setting broad strategic guidelines andpolicies for risk management and internal controls. Bank boards must have access to timely andadequate information and act on it when necessary. There must be a division of labour making it clearto all members of management and staff what specific responsibilities they have.From the Swedish banking crisis I would single out a few types of risk.Credit risk in general, linked to the issue of collateral, was - as should be expected - the main problem.It was our experience that banks coming from the sheltered world of strict regulation did not havegood and consistent systems for credit evaluation and documentation. Today, banks must have creditpolicies, stating what kind of credits they wish to grant. Usually, small and simple loans are providedat branch office level, but larger and complicated loans are provided at successively higher levels.Banks have also adopted internal risk evaluation systems in which the individual loans are gradedaccording to their risk. Loan documentation is improved to facilitate monitoring of the loan but also toensure that the bank can collect on the loan in the event of a judicial process.In Sweden, concentration of credit risk was a major problem during the crises. Some two thirds of thelosses were linked to the sharp price declines in real estate.A loan and its collateral must be evaluated separately, something that we had forgotten during themany years of regulation. If the expected returns from the investment made by the loan are uncertainor not adequate the loan should in most cases not be given, irrespective of the collateral. The reason isthat the collateral, in a crisis situation, often proves to be worth far less than expected. This isparticularly true when it is tied to the borrower - such as when a company has put up its own buildingas collateral.The linkage between credit risk and foreign exchange risk was large during the Swedish bankingcrises. This was seen also in the Asian crises in 1998. For example: Swedish borrowers wanted loansin yen and German marks because the interest rates in these currencies were low. When the Swedishcurrency depreciated, the borrowers could not repay the higher loan values because their revenuestream was in local currency. The banks believed themselves to be hedged against the foreignexchange risk since they were funded in the currency of the loans given, but they failed to see thecorresponding increased credit risk.Other risks were less prominent in the Swedish crisis but, in my opinion, will be of increasingimportance to banks all over the world. Among those are operational risks. Several recent financialdebacles, such as the Baring crisis, were due to operational risk. Even though the Y2K problem wassuccessfully managed, the huge computer systems of banks could cause large losses if technical orother failures occur.Another risk, which in my mind will become increasingly important, may be called “strategic risk”.The financial market in most countries is highly competitive. In order to survive and prosper, banksmust take bold decisions on new activities, new establishments, mergers, technological investmentsand so on. Decisions like these have to be taken, but should they go wrong, banks may suffer largelosses and may even go bankrupt.To handle these and other risks, internal controls and internal audit systems are becoming increasinglyimportant. The huge mass of information in modern banking makes it impossible for supervisors tomonitor individual transactions. They must rely on banks to maintain reliable internal controlfunctions, which not only verify the accuracy of transactions and operations but also take a broaderview of the bank’s compliance with its own rules and policies as well as with external rules andpolicies.
BIS Review 66/20004SupervisionTraditional supervision was of the type, which you may call “checking the ledger”, that is verifyingthat all transactions are properly recorded and formally correct. To some extent this must remain, butthe supervisor’s efforts in this sense can be reduced by applying modern statistical methods, eg forsampling, and by making sure that banks have adequate internal control systems.Instead, supervision should be risk-oriented and focus on those activities, which pose significant risksto the individual bank (differing from bank to bank). Risk-oriented supervision also implies strictersupervision for large banks and for banks taking larger risks than others. Supervisors should focus onevaluating and monitoring risk management systems, internal controls, corporate governance, andinformation systems. This calls for large supervisory resources and for more sophisticated skills:lawyers, but also economists, financial analysts, statisticians, mathematicians and accountants. If thelaw permits, which indeed it should, the supervisor could call on outside experts to assist.In order to be effective, supervision must in most cases be conducted on a consolidated basis, toinclude all parts of a financial conglomerate and even its non-financial affiliates. The increasingblurring of boundaries between different financial activities and the building up of large financialconglomerates make consolidated supervision crucial. Consolidation includes financial as well asnon-financial entities within a country, but also world-wide. The cooperation and exchange ofinformation between supervisors for different financial activities (banking, securities trading andinsurance) is important, domestically as well as globally. Informal or formal agreements must beconcluded to facilitate such cooperation. Supervisors should not license banks, or their affiliates, iftheir organisational structures prevent effective supervision. In the same vein, home supervisorsshould not allow their banks to establish affiliates abroad, if the host authorities are not willing toexchange important information regarding developments affecting this affiliate.Transparency is key. Banks should be induced, by force and voluntarily, to properly discloseinformation of their activities to the general public. Information must also be timely, relevant andaccurate. In this way, there is daily “supervision” of the bank by market analysts, depositors andothers. It is understood that some bank activities are to be considered as strategic secrets which cannotbe divulged, but in my view these are fewer than we tend to think.Hence, a related subject of great importance is the issue of accounting. To create transparency,accounting rules, including valuation rules, must provide a clear picture and reflect the true situation ofa bank. Let me give you an example. A lingering problem in many countries is that banks hold largeamounts of non-performing loans to companies, even those that are state-owned or formerlystate-owned. The loans are usually not valued according to their realistic, low, values. In my view, thisis not helpful even if it seems to improve the financial statements of the banks. Nobody is fooled aboutthe actual situation because these bad loans are well known in the market. The loans should preferablybe transferred out of the books to some asset management company - priced at a realistic market value,of course.Under all circumstances, supervisors should require that banks have consistent and true systems forthe valuation of loans, performing and non-performing, with or without collateral. These systemsshould also take into account the setting aside of adequate provisions for weak loans. These provisionsshould reflect the expected losses to the bank. In calculating these losses, collateral may be taken intoaccount, but as earlier mentioned, it is important that the collateral is conservatively valued because itsvalue tends to decline sharply in a default situation.For any country aiming for a credible financial system, auditing standards must be high andapproaching the best international practices. Furthermore, the supervisors should maintain close andregular contacts with the major accounting and auditing firms in their country. This serves to provideand receive information on individual banks, but also to explain and to get feedback on thedevelopment of new rules and regulations and how they are implemented in the market.
5BIS Review 66/2000Asset management companiesBefore proceeding, I would like to make a few points concerning the asset management companies(AMC’s) touched upon above, since these seem to be controversial in many countries. They certainlywere in Sweden during the peak of the crisis.Asset management companies are simply companies to which a major part of the non-performingassets of a bank can be transferred, given that these loans for some historic reason have grown tobecome a considerable part of the bank’s balance sheet. The purpose of the asset managementcompany is to dispose of the assets as quickly and profitably as possible and then close down.As I see it, there may be two main causes for such a transfer of assets. First, experience shows thatbankers are not best equipped to handle the restructuring and work out of collateral taken in by thebank as a consequence of failing loans. Bankers may possibly be good at lending money and handlingminor non-performing loans, but they usually have little experience in reorganising industrial activitiesand managing real estate companies to the extent required in an AMC. These activities require adifferent competence.The trouble is that bankers often fail to see this, in particular if they have been heavily involved inhandling the failing credits. They talk about long term relations with the customer. They argue that theloans could be kept in the book of the bank and that relevant competence could be hired. I stronglybelieve that this is not true. If a proper restructuring is to be done, professional restructuring peoplewithout historical relations to the customer should do it. Whenever I have been persuaded otherwise Ihave later been proved wrong.The second argument for transferring the non-performing assets is related to this. When themanagement of a bank has a large number of bad credits to take care of, that is exactly what they do.All their capacity is used up taking care of problems and there is no time - and no money - to thinkabout the future. This is disastrous for the whole organisation, which tends to become backwardlooking and defensive instead of forward looking and offensive. Only when the bad assets are out ofthe books of the bank, the minds of the management and thus of the employees can become aimedtowards the future.Having decided to transfer the bad assets, the next obstacle will be to decide on the prices. The bankusually considers the non-performing assets to be quite valuable, at least in the long run. Selling atwhat might be considered present market prices will create too big a hole in the balance sheet to makemanagement comfortable. The management of the new AMC quite naturally has a different view. Ithas no wish to get assets into its balance sheet at values that later turn out to be excessively high.According to my experience, it is important to listen to the AMC rather than to the bank if the purposeis to get the restructuring done. If the management and board of the AMC can make reasonable profitsby selling its assets, which indeed is the purpose, this is what they will do. However, if they haveacquired the assets at too high prices, every sale will show a loss and they may even have to approachthe owners to get more capital. The owners will not like this, whether the company is owned by thebank which delivered the assets or some external financial investors. Hence the board will avoidshowing losses and consequently little restructuring will be done.Thus transferring assets at market prices is essential if the restructuring process is to work. The troubleis that by doing this you may be forced to write down the assets in the books of the bank, since theyhave not been valued correctly. This in turn will uncover the hole in the balance sheet and may requirea capital injection. And putting more capital into the bank may not be feasible at the time, for politicalor for other reasons. At this point, you can always start a discussion of what market prices really are.This happened in Sweden and it has happened elsewhere. But a hole in the balance sheet is always ahole, whether you decide to see it or not. Either new capital must be put into the bank before thetransfer of assets or it must be injected into the AMC when the real value of its assets becomesobvious to everyone. Putting the money straight into the bank speeds up the restructuring process.
BIS Review 66/20006Consolidated supervisory authoritiesI mentioned that supervision should be conducted on a consolidated basis, covering activities indifferent financial and non-financial sectors. Should also the organisation of the supervisory authoritybe “consolidated”? Several countries, including the UK, Korea, Australia and others have recentlymoved in the direction of creating an “FSA” which is responsible for the supervision of banks,securities markets and insurance. In Sweden, we have had an FSA since 1990.Is such a consolidation necessary and useful in all countries? In my view, the optimal structure of thesupervisory authority depends on the structure of the individual country. In many countries, banksconduct the most important financial activities while securities markets are less important. Here atleast bank supervision must be independent, have adequate resources and skilled staff. This is crucial.In many countries, bank supervision is a part of the central bank. This has benefited bank supervisionbecause the central bank usually has legal independence, adequate resources and can attract qualifiedstaff. Combining bank supervision with securities and insurance supervision will probably imply thatsupervision will move outside the central bank, since securities and insurance supervision is notnormally a task of central banks. In this sense, bank supervision may become weaker. In my view, inmarkets where banks are dominating the financial sector and where the integration with securities andinsurance markets are less pronounced, keeping the supervision separate and within the central bankmakes good sense.Having said this, I acknowledge that the present tendencies are for banks to merge with other financialinstitutions, and for financial instruments to look increasingly alike whether they are created in banksor in other institutions. These tendencies would indicate a corresponding need for supervision ofdifferent financial sectors to cooperate closer and closer and, perhaps, finally to merge. The trend isclearly seen in Europe, reinforced by the common currency, but is gradually developing also in othercountries. As mentioned above, this is the way we have organised supervision in Sweden. But I do notsee a need to consolidate the supervisory authorities in a specific country until the structure of itsfinancial markets so requires. As an intermediate step, cooperation agreements between thesupervisory authorities should be encouraged.A strong rationale for locating bank supervision in a central bank is that bank stability is of crucialimportance for the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, a central bank has the powers to provideliquidity - under normal as well as exceptional circumstances - to banks, for instance as a lender of lastresort. To do this, it is obvious that the central bank must have full knowledge about the financialsituation of a bank.However, there are also good arguments for keeping supervision separate from the central bank. Theremay be a conflict between the role as supervisor and the role of being a lender of last resort. If a bankwould fail, being supervised by the central bank, the central bank may feel more inclined to provideliquidity support than is economically defendable. Bankers may know this and the case for moralhazard may therefore be stronger than with a separate supervisor. Rules for public administration oftroubled banks outside the central bank may give some help in this respect.There may also be a conflict of interest relating to monetary policy. If a bank fails while beingsupervised by the central bank, this may affect the central bank’s reputation and credibility. In myview, these are important arguments, because credibility of the central bank is basic not only tosystemic stability but also to the conduct of monetary policy.What is the role of the central bank in relation to financial stability when there is an independentsupervisory authority? There are still remaining the increasingly important questions concerning themacroeconomic “oversight” or macro prudential supervision of the financial system. As a matter offact, these questions often tend to be neglected when the ordinary supervision remains within thecentral bank, because they are in many ways different in character from the day to day supervision.To effectuate its responsibilities of conducting monetary policy and ensuring a stable payment system,a central bank must monitor the risks in the financial sector. In this capacity, the central bank is mainlyinterested in systemic risks, not in the potential problems of individual banks unless these are largeenough to affect the whole system. The macro prudential analysis aims at identifying risks which are
7BIS Review 66/2000common to a number of banks and other financial institutions or markets, including payment systems.Such risks often stem from the development of the macro economy. Volatile inflation developments orexchange rate fluctuations could lead to problems for a number of banks. Asset price “bubbles”,excessive loan concentrations or excessive leverage ratios for borrowers might do the same. It isnatural for the central bank to closely monitor such developments and take prompt action if it findsthat financial stability is endangered. In some cases it may not have the powers to take direct actionitself, but it may inform other parties, such as the political authorities or the supervisors, urging themto apply necessary measures.I would like to emphasise that macro prudential analysis does not mean that the central bank isduplicating the work of the supervisory authority. We do not examine and audit the individualfinancial institutions, this is clearly the task of the supervisors. Most of our information is gatheredfrom other sources, including from the supervisory authority itself.An increasing number of central banks, eg those in England, Canada and Sweden have established astructured procedure to macro prudential analyses. In Sweden, our conclusions are published in asemi-annual Stability Report, where we analyse the development of risks in the banking system andwhere we state our overall view on systemic stability. The reports have increased the generalknowledge about the stability situation of the Swedish financial sector and they constitute the basis fordiscussions with the financial institutions and with other authorities. Whether they will help us avoidthe next financial crisis is still to be seen.International standardsFinancial systems and markets are increasingly interlinked across the country borders. In order toavoid international financial disturbances all countries that wishes to participate in cross-bordertransactions must adhere to a set of minimum rules for regulation. Also supervision must reachadequate levels in all countries, including cooperation and exchange of information betweensupervisors in different countries.In 1997, the Basel Committee took the initiative of writing the Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision. Complying with the Principles constitutes a minimum platform for any country thatstrives to have basically sound regulation and supervision of banks. If I may say so, there is nothingradically new with the Core Principles - all the underlying standards that countries are asked to fulfilare well established and internationally recognised. The main use of the principles is rather as ayardstick, whereby a country can evaluate itself in order to identify weaknesses in its presentregulations and supervision and to take remedial measures to improve. There are national andinternational arguments for a country to adhere to the Core Principles.The domestic argument is the one of avoiding or reducing the impact of bank problems, not leastbecause they are costly to the macro economy. While the Principles are not intended to prevent singlebanks from failures, effective regulation and supervision should reduce potential risks and make themeasier to identify at an early stage. The international argument for compliance is that other countrieswill require this before they open their financial markets. The fear of contagion, implying thatproblems of one country spread into others, remains strong.Conducting an evaluation of compliance towards the Core Principles is especially helpful when acountry is in a stage of modernising its financial sector, such as Sri Lanka. The result of the evaluationwill identify weaknesses and can serve as a guide to reform measures. It is also the experience of othercountries that the result of the evaluation may be a useful tool for the supervisory authority inconvincing the politicians of needed legal and regulatory amendments.ConclusionsI have touched upon a number of aspects of supervision, all in one way or another related to lessonslearned during the last ten years. I shall make no attempt to summarise, just return to my first pointthat a high quality, risk-oriented and flexible supervision will create credibility for the financial sector
BIS Review 66/20008and make it prosper. Inadequate and old-fashioned supervision based on rigid regulations will do rightthe opposite. And supervision is a dynamic concept. The tools and art of supervision must, in allcountries, continuously improve along with the development of markets and market technology.
1BIS Review 66/2000The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE: Towards a safer banking systemSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE, Governor of the Bank of England, to the Associationof Professional Bankers Sri Lanka 12th Anniversary Convention, on 27 August 2000.*      *      *Mr Governor, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is an immense pleasure, and a very great honour, to have been invited to address this AnnualConvention.The theme of the convention is “Towards a safer banking system”. It is a theme which gladdens myheart. The safety of the banking system is fundamental to financial stability in a broader sense. It isvitally important, of course, to you - as professional commercial bankers. But it is vitally important,too, to us, central bankers, because you simply cannot have monetary or broader economic stability,which is a key part of our responsibilities, without stability of the financial system - they go togetherlike love and marriage! And monetary and financial stability are vitally important, too, to our societiesat large and to the individuals that make up our societies - they are absolutely necessary, if not inthemselves sufficient, conditions for the economic prosperity to which we all aspire.The question is what can we do - working together - to improve the safety of our banking systems.And you will notice that I emphasise “working together”, because while we all clearly have a commoninterest in that objective, we all - commercial bankers, banking supervisors, central banks andgovernments - have distinct responsibilities and distinct contributions to make towards bringing itabout. And we will not succeed unless we all play our respective parts.From the programme for your convention I see that most of your working sessions have beenconcerned with the steps that commercial banks can take to protect themselves against risk in a rapidlychanging financial environment and the role of banking supervisors. I should like to start from theother end, as it were, and talk about the role of the authorities more broadly.I suppose that the most frequent cause of financial instability is macro-economic shocks of one kind oranother. Certainly major disturbances can originate within the financial system itself - and that ofcourse in turn can generate macro-economic instability. But my observation is that the causality moreoften than not runs the other way. From our own experience in the UK, the exaggerated economicboom and bust cycles of the past - at least I hope they are in the past - and fed in some instances byabrupt financial deregulation - have led to a sharp expansion of bank lending in the upswings, thevalue of which became impaired, amidst a great deal of social as well as economic distress, in thedownturns. Consistent macro-economic stability is perhaps the greatest contribution that theauthorities everywhere can make to financial stability.Of course that is easier said than done. While it is true that sharp changes in economic conditions, andasset prices, may be home-grown - often as a result of allowing domestic demand to outstrip thesupply-side capacity of the economy to meet that demand, it is also true as we saw very dramaticallytwo or three years ago that instability can be internationally contagious - especially in today’s world offinancial globalisation.A great deal of work has gone on internationally over the past few years to improve our understandingof how national authorities can better protect their economies against shocks of this kind. It hasresulted in a plethora of internationally agreed standards and codes of best practice ranging fromtransparency in the conduct of monetary, financial and fiscal policies, through financial regulation andthe collection and dissemination of statistics, to various aspects of the financial infrastructure,including the legal and accounting framework, corporate governance arrangements, payments systemsand so on. The emphasis now is on implementation and the IMF has the task of encouraging andassisting all of its members to step up their efforts, as best they can given their particular
BIS Review 66/20002circumstances, in all of these respects. This is in the member countries’ own individual interests, but itis equally in the interest of greater stability of the global economy.In relation to international capital flows in particular, the answer is not at all to encourage countries tocut themselves off from international finance through the maintenance or imposition of capitalcontrols - though that is not totally excluded. On the contrary the very positive contribution thatprivate capital has made in recent years to the development of many of the emerging market countriesis clearly acknowledged, and the objective of orderly and properly sequenced dismantlement ofremaining capital controls is generally maintained. The purpose is rather to help to ensure, throughgreater transparency and improvements to the financial infrastructure, that capital flows to where it canbe most productively invested. That should, in turn, help to reduce capital account volatility. At thesame time much more attention is being paid to the importance of the maturity and currencycomposition of national balance sheets, including particularly the maturity and currency compositionof the assets and explicit or implied liabilities of the public sector, and also of the banking sector,which can be relatively easily monitored through the supervisory process. I recognise that thisemphasis on balance sheet management - which is especially important where a country is seekingactively to manage its exchange rate - may raise the cost of short-term capital inflows; but that seemsto me to be a price worth paying for greater protection against sudden capital outflows if confidencedeclines. Finally borrowing countries are being increasingly encouraged to develop, in the current lessfebrile environment, an ongoing dialogue with their major external creditors in the expectation thatthis would help to identify emerging concerns and possible responses at an earlier stage and topromote a more constructive reaction on the part of those creditors when storms begin to gather.Now, all of these steps are steps which countries themselves can take to reduce the risks of domesticor external macro-economic shocks leading to financial instability, which in turn would be likely toamplify the effects of the initial shock. But with the best will in the world such shocks will no doubtcontinue to occur. And alongside all this work on what countries can do to help protect themselves, amajor review of the terms and conditions of the IMF facilities is taking place, designed to increase theeffectiveness of the financial help that the IMF can give to its member countries when they do run intodifficulties. This is not an easy issue on which, I know, people hold strong views. We have to try tostrike a sensible balance between excessively onerous and excessively liberal conditions attaching toIMF support. On the one hand, if IMF conditions - whether preconditions attaching to quasi-automaticsupport in the event of sudden capital outflows or adjustment conditions attaching to the Fund’s moretraditional facilities - if in either case the conditions were too demanding, countries may be deterredfrom seeking the Fund’s help. That in turn could result in unnecessary economic and financialinstability. If, on the other hand, IMF assistance were too readily forthcoming, both the membercountries, and their creditors, might be encouraged to take excessive risks in the belief that the IMFwould in the end bail them out. This is a particular form of the familiar problem of moral hazard. It,too, could result in unnecessary economic and financial instability.What does seem clear is that, given the scale of private international capital flows today, the IMF’sresources are certain to be limited in relation to the problems that could emerge. At some pointtherefore - depending on just where the balance is struck - the onus for resolving the situation has tofall back on the borrowing country and on its creditors, who cannot avoid taking ultimateresponsibility for their own lending decisions.So there is a link between the review of the IMF’s facilities and what has come to be called - in thejargon - PSI, or private sector involvement in crisis resolution. And that link remains to be clarified.Just how these issues are resolved will have an important bearing upon global economic and financialstability, and in turn, upon the safety of our national banking systems.Somewhat similar considerations apply in the narrower national context. Where, for whatever reason- which may be a result of macro-economic mismanagement by the authorities themselves or a resultof mismanagement by banks or other financial institutions - there is a threat to the stability of asizeable part of the financial system as a whole, it is the national authorities ultimately that have todeal with it.
3BIS Review 66/2000They can seek to reduce the risks of systemic problems originating in the financial sector in particularin a number of ways.Firstly, there is regulation or supervision of individual financial intermediaries which may, as here inSri Lanka be undertaken by the central bank itself or by a separate financial supervisory agency asnow in the UK. Financial supervision - including banking supervision - is a powerful instrument forpreventing systemic financial disturbance, even when - as in the UK - the primary objective is toprovide a degree of protection to the investors or depositors in individual financial intermediariesrather than to protect the system as a whole. But it necessarily has its limitations. The job of thesupervisor in this context is essentially to set appropriate minimum standards for the authorisation andprudential conduct of financial institutions and to satisfy himself (or herself!) as far as possible thatthese standards are being observed. It is not the job of the supervisor actually to micro-manage theinstitution or the particular risks that it takes. That has to be the job of the management of theinstitution - indeed the taking and management of financial risk is the essence of their contribution tosociety; it’s what they are paid for! Nor is it the job of the supervisor to prevent each and every bankfailure. Indeed, if the supervisor were to attempt to do so, it would inevitably involve such rigorousprudential standards and enforcement that it would effectively stifle innovation and competition, at thecost of reducing the efficiency of the financial system in meeting the needs of the wider economy, butultimately also of weakening its structure - reducing rather than increasing the safety of the system. Soeffective supervision is a vitally important part of the answer to improving the safety of the bankingsystem but it is not a complete answer.Secondly, national authorities can introduce deposit protection arrangements which can reduce therisks of the panic withdrawal of deposits or some other forms of investments - though here too abalance needs to be struck. Overly generous deposit protection carries the danger that it will damagemarket discipline, by making the depositor indifferent to where he places his deposit, encouraging himsimply to look for the marginally higher return.Thirdly, as I noted earlier, national authorities can do a good deal to strengthen the legal andaccounting as well as the corporate governance infrastructure as it applies to the financial system.They can insist upon higher standards of financial reporting and transparency, facilitating better riskassessment of the counterparties and borrowers. And, on the more technical level, they can also ensurethat the risks arising from the payments system infrastructure - especially the wholesale paymentssystem - are minimised, reducing the danger that a failure of one institution will set off a chainreaction among other financial institutions that are its direct creditors.The importance of strengthening our defences in all these various ways against systemic financialdisturbances can hardly be over-emphasised. Over the past 15 years something like 150 of the 180 orso member countries of the IMF have experienced significant banking sector distress, in many casesamounting to full-blown crises. Some Bank of England estimates of the costs of financial instabilitysuggest that banking crises have over the past 25 years caused a cumulative loss of output of as muchas 15-20% of GDP in the countries concerned.But finance is, as I say, inherently a risk business. And however much effort we put in to accidentprevention - however vigilant we are - we have to recognise that accidents will occur. So we have tobe prepared to limit the damage that they may cause. While it may be possible for the authorities inmany instances to bring about stabilisation by catalysing action within the private sector - and the wayin which the Federal Reserve handled the problems in Long Term Capital Management a couple ofyears ago is an outstanding example of that - the monetary authorities’ ultimate instrument is theircapacity, typically exercised by the central bank, to intervene directly - within limits agreed bygovernment since public money is involved - themselves.As in the case of IMF lending to member countries in difficulties, this “safety net” or Lender of LastResort (LOLR) capacity needs to be used with great discretion if it is not to give rise to a similar kindof moral hazard - encouraging banks and their creditors to take excessive risks. It is only to be usedwhere there is a genuine risk of systemic financial disturbance - where other banks are liable to beaffected by contagion either as a result of their direct exposure to a failing institution or because theyare likely to be seen themselves to be exposed to the same sort of pressures that affected the failing
BIS Review 66/20004institution, and therefore likely to be similarly vulnerable and subject to loss of confidence. It is onlyin those circumstances - which I agree are difficult to recognise with total confidence - that officialintervention can be justified. The safety net is not there to protect every individual institution that getsinto trouble as a result of its own failings.Even where it is judged that there is a systemic threat - and a public interest in containing it - ajudgement that will properly need to be openly justified at the appropriate time - last resort assistance -like IMF assistance to its member countries - has to come with conditions. The purpose of last resortassistance is not to protect either the shareholders or the management of an illiquid, even less aninsolvent institution, and the appropriate outcome may well be an orderly run-down or sale of thebusiness. That may sound severe - even threatening to commercial bankers. But it is necessary both toensure that moral hazard does not undermine the safety and soundness of the banking system and tomaintain its competitive efficiency.Pulling all this together the “authorities” - governments, financial supervisors and regulators, andcentral banks - have a vital role in creating and sustaining a safer, sounder, banking system. But in theend it depends critically on you - the professional, commercial, bankers. Yours is a tough job at thebest of times. It is especially challenging in today’s environment of rapid financial change as a resultin particular of the inter-action between deregulation and increasing competition, globalisation and therevolution in information technology, which are constantly bringing new dimensions to yourunenviable task of risk management. Your own survival and prosperity - and that of the institutionsthat you manage - depend ultimately upon your abilities as risk managers. But to the extent that eachof you individually succeeds in your own business, you also make a vital contribution to the safety andsoundness of the banking system as a whole. As a central banker, I can only wish you well!
1BIS Review 65/2000Alan Greenspan: Global economic integration - opportunities and challengesSpeech by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, on25 August 2000.*      *      *Globalization as most economists understand it involves the increasing interaction of nationaleconomic systems. Of necessity, these systems are reasonably compatible and, in at least someimportant respects, market oriented. Certainly, market-directed capitalism has become the paradigmfor most of the world, as central-planning regimes have fallen into disfavor since their undisputedfailures around the world in the four decades following World War II. But there remains an activeintellectual debate over the elements of capitalism that are perceived as most essential for a productiveand civil society.The practical manifestation of that debate can be seen in the stresses on our various political and legalsystems. Opposing forces sometimes reflect significantly different underlying views of how societalvalues should be traded off, but more deeply, they often demonstrate different understandings of theway economies work.Earlier in the postwar period, even we in the West believed that market failure was a commonoccurrence. To some, this belief justified significant state controls and frequent intervention on themicroeconomic level to improve, as they saw it, the functioning of markets and to maintain economicstability and growth. At the macroeconomic level, an exploitable tradeoff between unemployment andinflation was widely believed to exist, and a little inflation was perceived as useful to prime the pumpof prosperity.Remnants of those views, of course, remain. But it is remarkable how far economic opinions and“conventional wisdom” have shifted since the 1970s. At the risk of some oversimplification, there hasbeen a noticeable reversion in thinking toward 19th-century liberalism, with the consequence thatderegulation and privatization have become policies central to much governmental reform.To a marked degree, this shift in policy orientation reflects a response to technologically drivenglobalization. By lowering the costs of transactions and information, technology has reduced marketfrictions and provided significant impetus to the process of broadening world markets. Expandingmarkets, in turn, have both increased competition and rendered many forms of intervention eitherineffective or perverse.The recognition of this prosperity-enhancing sea-change in world markets and, in that context, of thecounterproductive consequences of pervasive intervention has led many governments to reduce tariffsand trade barriers and, where necessary, to deregulate markets. These actions themselves have furtherpromoted the very globalization that, interacting with advancing technology, spurred the deregulatoryinitiatives in the first place. The result of this process has been an advance and diffusion of technicalchange that has raised living standards in much of the world.The conceptual battleground has moved far from the stark terms of the earlier capitalist-socialistconfrontations. The failed experiment in central planning in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union afterWorld War II has largely muted the arguments of most ardent socialist planners. The debate has nowshifted to the nature and extent of actions appropriate for governments to take in order to amelioratesome of the less desirable characteristics that are perceived to accompany unfettered competition. Butunlike in much of the nineteenth century, little unfettered competition is actually practiced in today’sworld. In large part, driven by the value standards of our societies that developed out of the GreatDepression, some government regulation is practiced virtually everywhere.Nonetheless, it has become generally understood that governmental actions often hinder incentives toinvestment by increasing uncertainties, boosting risk premiums, and raising costs. Even among those
BIS Review 65/20002who deride the more unbridled forms of capitalism, there is a growing awareness that many attemptsto tame such regimes are not without cost in terms of economic growth and the average livingstandards of a nation.A recent manifestation of these costs can be seen in the lower level of high-tech capital investment incontinental Europe, on average, and in Japan, relative to that in the United States. Arguably, thisoutcome has resulted to an important degree from the particular legal structures and customs thatgovern labor relations in much of Europe and Asia. By choice over the decades, Europe, for example,has endeavored to protect its workers from some of the presumed harsher aspects of free-marketcompetition. To discourage layoffs, discharging employees was made a difficult and costly process incomparison with that in the United States. By law and by custom, American employers have facedmany fewer impediments in recent years to releasing employees.This difference is important in our new high-tech world because much, if not most, of the rate ofreturn from the newer technologies results from cost reduction, which on a consolidated basis largelymeans the reduction of labor costs. Consequently, legal restraints on the ability of firms to readilyimplement such cost reductions lower the prospective rates of return on the newer technologies and,thus, the incentives to apply them. As a result, even though these technologies are available to all, theintensity of their application and the accompanying elevation in the growth of productivity are moreclearly evident in the United States and other countries with fewer impediments to implementation.Parenthetically and counterintuitively, the increased ease of layoffs in the United States, by reducingthe risks of hiring by American employers, has contributed to a higher rate of employment in theUnited States compared with the vast majority of our major trading partners.A particular irony in all this is that Europeans have been finding investments in the United Statesincreasingly attractive and have accounted for an increasing share of the expanding total of foreigninvestment in U.S. direct and portfolio assets. In an effort to raise returns on domestic assets, manygovernments, European and others, are being led away from former dirigiste regimes to place greaterreliance on markets. These governments see such a direction as necessary in order to enable their firmsand workers to achieve the efficiencies required to meet the rigors of international competition. Recentplans for tax reforms, significant initiatives to create more flexible labor markets, and ongoing stepstoward greater privatization in Europe and elsewhere underscore the extent to which views havechanged in recent years.But it is clearly pragmatism, not ideology, that is the main driving force in these evolving views. Thestructural policy adjustments in Western Europe and Japan, not to mention the efforts in China andRussia to move toward market capitalism, are being motivated, for the most part, by the evident abilityof market competition to elevate living standards.Thus, despite the meaningfully different views initially held of the way the world does, and should,work, powerful global competitive forces appear for now to be driving the economic and legalparadigms of many nations into closer alignment around a more competitive market capitalism.It is by no means self-evident, however, that these trends will eventually lead to world convergence ofeconomic regimes and to agreement about the conceptual framework that such a convergence wouldlikely require. Certainly, the demonstrated ability of relatively unfettered markets to raise livingstandards over time creates considerable incentive for movement in that direction. But the speed ofthat movement - indeed, its very persistence over time - is far less clear. Even among liberaldemocracies, one can still find deep-seated antipathy toward free-market competition and its partner,creative destruction, to use Joseph Schumpeter’s now famous insight. While recognizing the efficacyof capitalism to produce wealth, there remains considerable unease among some segments about theway markets distribute that wealth and about the effects of raw competition on the civility of society.Thus, should recent positive trends in economic growth falter, it is quite imaginable that support formarket-oriented resource allocation will wane and the latent forces of protectionism and stateintervention will begin to reassert themselves in many countries, including the United States.For now, the process of globalization is being aided by strengthening economic growth, which isclearly being driven by an accelerating application of new insights. Technological innovation,
3BIS Review 65/2000however, arguably comes in bunches as new discoveries feed on one another to push forwardinnovation until the effects of the initial impetus finally peter out. The vast electrification of oursocieties and, before that, the spread of the railroads helped elevate economic growth for aconsiderable period of time. But the pace of growth eventually slowed when full, or near-full,exploitation of the newer technologies was achieved.The most recent wave of technology has engendered a pronounced rise in American rates of return onhigh-tech investments, which has led to a stepped-up pace of capital deepening and increasedproductivity growth. Indeed, it is still difficult to find credible evidence in the United States that therate of structural productivity growth has stopped increasing. That is, even after stripping out thesignificant impact on productivity acceleration of the recent shape of the business cycle, the secondderivative of output per hour still appears to be positive.If we knew at what stage of the current technological wave we were in, we could, I assume,confidently project when these elevated rates of change in long-term earnings expectations,productivity growth, and, hence, wealth creation would return to a more historically average pace.For it seems evident that once such a wave begins to crest, much of the self-reinforcing virtuous cyclepresumably fades, as it has in the past. In such a scenario, full development of available technologicalsynergies and their competitive deployment would damp the historically high prospective rates ofreturn on capital investment and slow the pace of capital deepening. The level of structuralproductivity does not recede, of course, since once gained new technological insights are never lost,but its rate of increase would slow, and projections of long-term profits growth presumably regressback to earlier magnitudes.From any perspective, of course, a tapering-off in productivity acceleration is inevitable at some pointin the future. In the past few hundred years for which we have some rough productivityapproximations, human ingenuity, even at its best, appears to have rarely produced annual productivitygrowth approaching double-digit rates for any protracted period of time.Any notable shortfall in economic performance from the standard set in recent years, as I indicatedearlier, runs the risk of reviving sentiment against market-oriented systems even among someconventional establishment policymakers. At present, such a shortfall is not anticipated, and suchviews are not widespread. But they resonate in some of the arguments against the global tradingsystem that emerged in Washington, DC, and Seattle over the past year. Although most of thesearguments may be easy to reject, those of us who support continued endeavors to extendmarket-driven globalization need to understand and, if possible, address the concerns that give rise tothe desire to roll back globalization.How the convergence of economic systems toward the most market-oriented capitalist structures willfare if world long-term economic growth trends revert to historic norms is an intriguing question. Inthe meantime, this extraordinary period of technological advance continues to exhibit great vitality,bringing with it the prospect of further globalization, greater competition, and the resultingimprovements in the economic welfare of most of the world’s citizens. It is almost surely the case that,the longer the process of globalization of economic activity continues, the more firmly entrenched willbe the gains we are beginning to realize.But our past endeavors at long-term forecasting afford us little confidence in being able to anticipateseminal changes in global economics and finance. We cannot, however, refrain from reflection. That iswhat this conference is all about.
1BIS Review 64/2000Bank of Japan’s August report ofrecent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 15 August 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy is recovering gradually, with corporate profits and business fixed investmentcontinuing to increase.With regard to exogenous demand, net exports (real exports minus real imports) continue to follow amoderate upward trend due to steady developments in overseas economies, and public investmentremains at a high level reflecting the progress in the implementation of the supplementary budget forfiscal 1999. As regards domestic private demand, business fixed investment is increasing. Therecovery in private consumption continues to be weak as a whole through lack of notableimprovements in employment and income conditions, although there are somewhat positive signs insome indicators. Housing investment is mostly unchanged.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production is increasing. Corporate profitsand sentiment continue to improve, and the number of firms that take positive action, such asincreasing the amount of fixed investment, is increasing, especially in high-growth sectors. Incomeconditions of households still remain severe, but regular and overtime payments as well as new joboffers continue to increase in line with the recovery in corporate activities, and compensation ofemployees has stopped decreasing.As for the outlook, public investment is likely to start decreasing in the near future, but net exports areexpected to continue increasing gradually, reflecting the expansion in overseas economies. In thecorporate sector, firms still strongly feel that they have excess equipment and that they should reducetheir debts to restore financial soundness. However, it is very likely that fixed investment in high-growth sectors, including those related with information technology services, will increase ascorporate profits continue to recover. Moreover, an improvement in corporate profits will increasehousehold income and this in turn is expected to boost private consumption. However, the pace ofrecovery in household income will be modest for the time being, since firms’ perceptions of excessemployment still persist, and thus significant changes have not been observed in their efforts to reducepersonnel expenses. Overall, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led mainly by business fixedinvestment, unless there are major adverse external shocks. In addition, the favorable financialenvironment created partly by the Bank’s sustaining easy monetary stance is expected to continueunderpinning the economy.With regard to prices, import prices are rising, reflecting an increase in international commodity pricessuch as crude oil prices since April. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstanding the rise in prices ofpetroleum products reflecting the increase in crude oil prices, are mostly unchanged mainly due to thedecrease in prices of electric machinery. Meanwhile, consumer prices continue to be somewhat weakowing to the slight decrease in the prices of private-sector services and the decline in prices ofimported products reflecting the past appreciation of the yen. Corporate service prices are still fallingslowly.1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on 11 August 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on 11 August 2000 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 64/20002As for the outlook on prices, downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand is decliningsignificantly while an economic recovery is expected to continue moderately. Upward pressure onprices is likely to arise temporarily from the increase in crude oil prices. On the other hand, in additionto the declining trend of machinery prices due to technological innovations, the decline in prices ofconsumer goods arising from the past appreciation of the yen and the streamlining of distributionchannels will exert downward pressure on prices. Thus, prices overall are expected to be stable orweak somewhat.In the financial market, the overnight call rate has generally stayed near zero, and financial institutionshave been confident about the availability of overnight funds. The amount of funds outstanding in thecall money market has decreased slightly.Interest rates on term instruments once declined from mid-July, but have recently increased againreflecting the change in expectations that the zero interest rate policy would be terminated. The Japanpremium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds recently increased somewhat, and has been around 1.75percent. The yield spread between private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) andgovernment bonds remains mostly unchanged as a whole.Stock prices fell from mid-July mainly due to the filing of reconstruction proceedings by a majorretailer and the decline in U.S. stock prices.In the foreign exchange market, the yen fell moderately towards the end of July and the yen-dollarexchange rate temporarily rose to around 110 yen. The yen is currently being traded in the range of107-109 yen to the U.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks have basically retained their cautious lending attitude.However, constraint that had been caused by severe fund-raising conditions and insufficient capitalbase has eased considerably. Given this, major banks continue to be more active in extending loans,while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is increasing in parallel with a recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result, creditdemand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish. Issuance of corporatebonds and CPs has been steady.Money stock (M2 + CDs) grew faster in July compared with the previous month on a year-on-yearbasis.In this financial environment, the lending attitude of financial institutions is perceived by firms as lesssevere, and corporate financing conditions are easing.
1BIS Review 64/2000I J Macfarlane: A medium-term perspective on monetary policySpeech by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Queensland University ofTechnology Business Leaders’ Forum, held in Brisbane, on 10 August 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be here in Brisbane to address the Leaders’ Forum Luncheon. I am not sure that Iwill have much to say about leadership, but I hope that my comments will be of interest and relevanceto those attending today. I would also like to thank the Queensland University of Technology, which isto be congratulated for running this excellent series of lectures.I would like to take the opportunity today to restate the underlying logic behind our approach tomonetary policy. My reason for doing so is not that it is intrinsically difficult, and therefore in need ofrepetition in order to aid understanding. It is because the logic is essentially medium to long-term innature, and hence tends to get lost in the day-to-day welter of economic statistics and associatedcommentary. For those whose interest is in the details of the current economic statistics, we will bepublishing our quarterly review, The Economy and Financial Markets next week.Our approach to monetary policy, like that of a number of other countries in similar positions, is basedon the achievement of an inflation target. This says that over the medium term, inflation shouldaverage somewhere between 2 and 3%. We recognise that it will not always stay in this range - that iswhy it is expressed as an average over the medium term. The actual adjustment of interest rates, ofcourse, is done on the basis of our assessment of the outlook for inflation, including a central forecastand a judgment about the balance of risks. But if we have done the job well, we should be able to lookback and see that over a reasonable run of years inflation has averaged 2 point something per cent perannum.So far in stating our approach I have not mentioned economic growth or employment, but there is areason for approaching things in this order. It is not because we downplay the importance of growthand employment - we certainly do not, and in any case our Act makes it clear that to do so would becontrary to our mandate. We approach monetary policy in this order because there is overwhelmingevidence to suggest that countries can only have sustained expansions if they are accompanied by lowinflation. It is the sustainability of the expansion which is the key to maximising economic growth andemployment. Thus, another way of expressing the aims of a monetary policy based on inflation-targeting is to say that its aim is to maximise the length of the economic expansion.A cynical observer might say that it is all very well to emphasise the length of the expansion as thecrucial test now that we all know that the current expansion has been a long one. But this is anapproach which we have had for quite a long time. I remember explaining it to a ParliamentaryCommittee in early September 1996 immediately before I took up my present position.

The most persuasive argument in itsfavour is that the results achieved so far have been very good. For example:• The current economic expansion, which started in the September quarter of 1991, hasalready lasted longer than its two predecessors and, on current indications, still has a fair wayto go. The accompanying graph shows the expansions which started in the 1970s, 1980s and1990s. For the current expansion, the figures only go up to the March quarter 2000.Incidentally, the length of our expansion is very similar to the much better known USexpansion - ours has lasted for 36 completed quarters (including June 2000), theirs has lastedfor 37 completed quarters.• During this time, economic growth has averaged 4.1% per annum, with inflation averagingin the low two’s. So the good result on inflation was not achieved by sacrificing our growthperformance.• While a lot of countries have done well over the past decade, the Australian performancestands out. We have grown faster than other comparable countries (including the UnitedStates) and our inflation rate puts us in the middle of the field. The table below shows thatonly Ireland, which had very special circumstances, grew faster than Australia.In short, the results suggest that the inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy has beensuccessful in achieving its aim. Also, the fact that Australia has been virtually at the top of theinternational growth league, while achieving a respectable middle order ranking on inflation, showsthat we have not over-emphasised inflation control at the expense of economic growth.While I think there is now a consensus that the inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy makessense, there is always room for disagreement about how it is applied in practice. Such differences ofview are part and parcel of the normal policy debate, and we of course participate in it and listen toother views. In passing, I should say that I think the debate is carried out in a much more civilised waythese days, compared with a number of earlier periods I can remember. I attribute this improvement tothe fact that there is now wider agreement on the underlying model than in earlier periods.

How important is any particularstatistic? Is it indicating strength or weakness? Are there special factors that have to be taken intoaccount before it can be interpreted? Does it have any implications for monetary policy? This “bottom-up” approach is widely used and it means that there is almost daily discussion in the media andelsewhere of the current and future strength of the economy.My observation over the past four years is that the bulk of people expressing a view on this subjectinvariably argue that the economy is weaker than the Reserve Bank judges it to be. There are very fewon the other side to act as a balance. The majority of people who present a view think that the ReserveBank has a recurring tendency to over-estimate the strength of the economy.This view is quite wrong: the fact is that we have consistently under-estimated its strength. You onlyhave to consult my half-yearly appearances before the Parliamentary Committee to see that on everyoccasion I have had to explain to them why the modest slowdown in growth that we forecast did notarrive. The correct way of summarising the various views is to say that the Reserve Bank has under-estimated the strength of the Australian economy, while its critics have under-estimated by a largermargin.
BIS Review 64/20004This is not unusual. There is a tendency during the expansionary phase of the business cycle to beunduly influenced by the inevitable signs of weakness in some of the individual indicators and henceto lose sight of its underlying strength. There is a tendency for people to not be able to see the woodfor the trees. This is true of most economists, bureaucrats, politicians, the press and, as I pointed outabove, central bankers are not immune from it. It is one of the reasons why historically there has beena tendency to leave the tightening of monetary policy till too late in the cycle. By then, variousimbalances - particularly, but not only, inflation - have become established and policy has had to betightened by a larger amount than if it had been done in a more timely manner. This has been animportant contributor in many countries to shortening the expansion phase or to making thecontraction deeper and so producing a boom-bust cycle.That is why if the central bank wants to have any hope of getting its timing right it has to move aheadof public opinion. This will mean that the tightening phase will inevitably attract criticism fromvarious quarters and will be labelled by some as unnecessary or, at least, premature. That is whygovernments have entrusted monetary policy to independent central banks - in order to ensure thatmonetary policy is insulated from day-to-day political pressures, and to make it clear to the public thatthis is the case.A second area where differences of opinion are often expressed is on how to reduce the level ofunemployment. Now, in my opinion, there are a lot of policies that have a role to play in this task, oneof which is monetary policy. There was a time not so long ago when economic purists, including somecentral bankers, often denied that monetary policy could affect unemployment - in their view,monetary policy only affected inflation. You will be pleased to know that I am not a member of thatschool. Bad monetary policy can certainly make unemployment worse, so it follows that goodmonetary policy can make it better than it would otherwise have been.What is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to lowering unemployment? My answeris that the best thing it can do in the long run is to provide the conditions which maximise the length ofeconomic expansions. We do not want a seven or eight-year expansion followed by a serious recessionas we have had in the past. The damage to unemployment occurs during recessions. The significantrise in unemployment that occurred in Australia from the early 1970s to the early 1990s was not due toa prolonged period of weak economic growth, it was due to the fact that we had three relatively shortperiods of recession, each of which resulted in a big lift in the unemployment rate.Diagram 202468100246810200019951990198519801975Unemployment rate%%1970To repeat, it is not the insufficiency of growth during the expansions which accounts for Australia’scurrent rate of unemployment - it is due to the sharp rises that occurred during the recessions. Toillustrate by reference to the US again:
5BIS Review 64/2000• during our current expansion GDP has grown at a rate of 4.1% per annum in Australia,compared with 3.7% in the US;• over the same period, we have reduced our unemployment rate from its peak by 4.6percentage points compared with 3.8 percentage points for the US. The fact that their rate at4.0% is lower than ours at 6.6% is entirely due to their lower starting point, which was due tothe relatively mild nature of their early 1990s recession.In short, it is clear that the best thing that monetary policy can do to reduce unemployment is toprolong the expansion and delay and reduce the size of any subsequent recession. On occasion, thatmeans tightening monetary policy early to forestall inflationary pressures, as an alternative to morevigorous application of the brakes when inflation has built more momentum.A third question which could be asked about our approach concerns Australia’s potential growth rate.We are, I think, rightly proud of our growth performance during the current expansion, especially ofour average of 4½% per annum since mid-1997 when we were hit by the Asian crisis. But some mayask why we think 4½% is a good result - maybe the economy was capable of growing a good dealfaster without pushing up inflation by much. We have all heard of Australia’s improved productivityperformance in the 1990s, so why can’t this allow us even more growth?There are two answers to these questions - a mechanical one and a policy one:• The mechanical one is that the potential growth rate is determined on the supply side of theeconomy by the growth of the labour force and the rate of labour productivity. While thesecond of these is now about 1½% per annum higher than in the eighties, the first - thegrowth of the labour force - is 1¼% per annum lower. This is largely due to lower growth inthe working-age population, and a much smaller rise in the participation rate as the femaleparticipation rate is now already quite high and the male participation rate is declining. Sothe improved productivity trend has contributed to higher living standards, but its effect ontotal GDP growth has not been as marked.• The more important answer is the policy response; it is one that I gave three years ago at atime when a number of critics were claiming that the RBA would not permit the Australianeconomy to grow by more than 3½% per annum. The answer then, as it is now, is that we donot have firm views about a speed limit. Our tightenings or loosenings of monetary policyare determined by the inflation outlook. If the economy wants to grow faster than it currentlyis, and inflation is not showing any tendency to rise to the point where it could threaten ourmedium-term objective, then we would not restrict the economy’s growth. That was truethree years ago, and it is still true: the difference is that now inflation has moved up, whereasthree years ago it was moving down.The rise in inflation over the past year, though a little larger than forecasters had expected, is not analarming event. But it is a reminder to us that it would have been unwise to continue with the stance ofmonetary policy we had in mid-1999. Monetary policy at that time was at its “maximum-expansionary” setting for the decade, and in our view some degree of tightening was going to beneeded if we were to successfully manage further progress in the expansion. A number of othercountries reached a similar conclusion over the past 18 months for reasons not very different to theones I have outlined above.ConclusionI have tried to give an outline of how the inflation-targeting approach operates and how it contributesto improved performance, not only on inflation, but also on output and employment growth. Theoutline is necessarily broad and I am afraid it will disappoint those who wish to have answers tospecific questions such as why did we raise rates in one month rather than the next? - or why did weraise rates by 50 basis points rather than 25? Inevitably, the answers to these questions involve anelement of judgment. But the truth is that the answers are not very important in the medium term.
BIS Review 64/20006Rather, it is the average level of interest rates that matters. Have we allowed them to stay too low andso encouraged the build-up of an inflationary process, or have we raised them too high and so set intrain a contractionary or deflationary process? These are the important questions, and any judgment onthem must be based on the medium-term performance of the Australian economy. This may not be asimple task, but I would suggest that a favourable judgment would require that the macro-economicperformance of the Australian economy be better than in earlier decades, and that it stand up well incomparisons with the experience of other countries over the same period.
1BIS Review 79/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The role of the ECB at the international levelSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Annual Meetingof the Institute of International Finance, Inc (IIF), held in Prague, on 23 September 2000.*      *      *IntroductionFirst of all, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address such a distinguishedaudience. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) is the leading professional association of privatesector financial institutions acting at the global level. As such, the IIF serves as a prominent forum forfostering a dialogue between the private financial community and policymakers on key issues, such asthe prevention of financial crises and the architecture of the international monetary system. Thisexplains why the European Central Bank (ECB) follows the IIF’s initiatives with great interest andwhy, this evening, I am pleased to be able to share some thoughts with you. Given the global nature ofthe IIF’s activities and the concomitance of its Annual Meeting with the Annual Meetings of the IMFand the World Bank, I shall focus on the international dimension of the ECB’s activities.Let me start by recalling that, on 1 January 1999, the 11 Member States of what is now the euro areatransferred their monetary sovereignty to a new supranational institution, the ECB. Since then, theGoverning Council of the ECB has been solely responsible for deciding the euro area’s monetarypolicy. The Executive Board of the ECB has been implementing the Council’s decisions mainlythrough the national central banks (NCBs) of the countries which have adopted the euro. The ECB andthe NCBs together form the “Eurosystem”. Accordingly, the Eurosystem is the central bank of theeuro area, although it does not have a legal personality; this is only conferred upon the ECB and theNCBs. On 1 January 2001 the euro area will welcome a new Member State, Greece. Moreover, in fivedays - on 28 September 2000 - the Danish citizens will decide in a referendum whether their countryshall also adopt the euro.The Eurosystem enjoys full independence in pursuing its statutory mandate to ensure and maintainprice stability. “Independence”, however, does not mean “isolation”. The Eurosystem, in other words,cannot perform its tasks without establishing appropriate external relations with both marketparticipants and other policymakers.This evening I shall focus on the multilateral relations which the ECB - and more generally, theEurosystem - maintains with other policymakers at the international (ie neither euro area norEuropean Union) level. These relations are promoted within organisations such as the IMF, the OECDand the BIS, as well as in fora such as the G7 and the G20. I shall first provide a brief overview of thecurrent relations of the ECB and the Eurosystem, both from an institutional angle and from the pointof view of their rationale. Without wanting to be exhaustive, I shall then highlight a few challengeswhich the ECB - and, more generally, the international official community - may be confronted with.In this context, I shall outline the ECB’s assessment of a more specific issue, namely the issue ofprivate sector involvement in the resolution of financial crises.1.The ECB and the process of international cooperationInstitutional frameworkThe Treaty establishing the European Community (the “Treaty”) stipulates which Europeaninstitutions are allowed either to speak or to act on behalf of the euro area at the international level.The euro area, like the Eurosystem, has no legal personality. This implies that the euro area cannotnegotiate and conclude public international law agreements or become a member of internationalorganisations. This also implies that the euro area has to be represented externally by Communityinstitutions or bodies which have a legal personality; this means: (1) the Council of the Ministers of
BIS Review 79/20002Finance and Economy of the EU (“ECOFIN Council”); and (2) the ECB and, in accordance with anECB decision, one or more NCBs. While the Treaty provides for interaction between the ECOFINCouncil and the ECB in a number of cases, these entities have well-defined responsibilities.This legal framework provides guidelines to give the euro area a voice at the international level. Inparticular, when the external representation of the euro area in the field of international cooperationinvolves the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem, decisions are centralised in the hands of the GoverningCouncil of the ECB. This facilitates the decision-making process with regard to externalrepresentation. While NCBs may participate in international fora depending on their respectivememberships (eg G7, G10, G20), the participation of the ECB in all relevant fora gives continuity andvisibility to the external representation of the euro area.The roles the ECB plays in the international community differ depending on the Eurosystem tasksinvolved in international relations. In particular, the ECB can play three different roles. First, the ECBis a primary and autonomous counterpart whenever the Eurosystem’s exclusive competencies- ie monetary policy and related central banking tasks - are involved in international relations. Second,with regard to issues related to the exchange rate of the euro, the ECB shares with the ECOFINCouncil the responsibility for both consultations with third parties - for example at G7 level - andcommunication to the general public. However, the ECB is solely responsible for deciding foreignexchange operations. Third, within the limits of the Eurosystem’s field of competence, the ECB canadvise other euro area policymakers on international issues. In specific circumstances the ECB mayalso act as a “catalyst for cooperation”. This may happen when the Eurosystem develops commonviews on issues which fall within the competence of other euro area authorities (mainly nationalgovernments), but in which the Eurosystem has a strong institutional interest, in accordance with itsstatute. This applies, for instance, to issues related to the stability of the global financial markets andthe architecture of the international monetary system. In dealing with these issues, the ECB mayprovide value added to the development of common euro area positions to be taken at the internationallevel.Rationale for cooperationThe relations of the ECB with other policymakers at the international level involve a number ofcooperation activities designed to increase the “joint welfare” resulting from their policies.Generally speaking, “international cooperation” takes place within the relevant organisations (eg IMF)and fora (eg G7), between the competent authorities of different countries for either a given policy(eg monetary policy) or a set of policies (eg macroeconomic policies). In this context, the term“country” should be understood to include monetary unions such as the euro area. In principle,cooperation can include a wide spectrum of activities, namely:• Consultation, which simply consists of a mutual exchange of information and views;• Surveillance, ie the systematic monitoring and assessment, by an independent organisation,of the economic policies of its members. Within this context, the international communitymay also develop “standards” and “codes”, which constitute a form of multilateralrule-making to be implemented on a voluntary basis; and• Coordination, ie the agreement between separate policymakers to take and implement jointdecisions.As I shall discuss, the Eurosystem is directly involved in most, although not all, of these activities.The economic rationale for the ECB’s involvement in international cooperation activities rests on theinternational externalities of domestic policies, ie spillover effects which policies in one economy canproduce on other economies via, for instance, interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices. The euroarea, however, is a large and relatively closed economy. The degree of trade openness of the euro areais much smaller than that of its constituent countries. Measured by the average of exports and importsas a share of euro area GDP, the degree of openness is 16% in the euro area. By contrast, prior toMonetary Union, the average export ratio of individual Member States stood at around 35% in 1997.
3BIS Review 79/2000This helps to understand both why the euro area is not affected by spillover effects to the same extentas small open economies, and why the Eurosystem is in a position to pursue its primary objective- maintaining domestic price stability - in the most effective way.This does not mean, however, that the ECB neglects external economic developments whenestablishing the euro area monetary policy. On the contrary, the ECB takes these developments intodue account as they may have an impact on domestic economic developments, and thus on pricestability.The ECB’s approach to external economic developments has three implications for the participation ofthe Eurosystem in the process of international cooperation in the area of macroeconomic policies.First, a substantial component of the ECB’s cooperation is the reciprocal exchange of information andviews within international organisations and fora. Regular consultation on external economicdevelopments enhances the ECB’s ability to analyse the outlook for price developments in the euroarea. By taking into account possible spillover effects from third countries’ policy actions,consultation plays a part in reducing the likelihood of misinterpreting the impact of externaldevelopments on domestic variables. Given its voluntary nature, consultation does not impinge on theECB’s independence.Second, consultation is supplemented by international surveillance. In this case, a third andindependent party, such as the IMF or OECD, regularly monitors and assesses the economic policiesof its members. In this regard, whenever the euro area monetary policy is under surveillance, the ECBis solely responsible for interaction with the IMF and OECD. International surveillance adds to theECB’s transparency as both the IMF and the OECD make their assessments of euro area economicpolicies available to the public. In the context of surveillance, the international community is alsodeveloping common understandings on a number of “rules of the game” to be implemented in eachindividual country on a voluntary basis. An example is given by the IMF Code of Good Practices onTransparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The selection of best practices and rules enhancescompetition and transparency among policymakers, thus making the idea of good public governance acentral component of international cooperation.Third, consultation and surveillance are the forms of international cooperation which are relevant tothe ECB in the area of macroeconomic policies. Any form of ex ante international coordination ofmonetary policy with other macroeconomic policies could easily be incompatible with theEurosystem’s mandate and independence. Attempts to coordinate ex ante would not only blur thespecific responsibilities of individual policymakers, but also reduce their accountability. Indetermining its monetary policy stance, the ECB should and does take into account all relevantinformation. It cannot let its policy be determined solely by the current and future course of otherpolicies. This could easily compromise the maintenance of price stability. The inappropriateness of exante policy coordination also applies to the more specific option of exchange rate coordinationbetween large economic areas, for instance by setting ranges for the fluctuation of the majorcurrencies. In this regard, I should like to take the opportunity to reaffirm that the ECB does notpursue any exchange rate target. Our objective is to maintain stable prices in the euro area and not aspecific level of the euro’s exchange rate.Last but not least, the Eurosystem takes part in the process of international cooperation not only in itsrole as a “primary player” - ie when euro area monetary and exchange rate policies are involved - butalso in its roles as advisor to other euro area authorities on international issues and “catalyst forcooperation”. In this case, international cooperation is mainly designed to ensure global financialstability and enhance the architecture of the international monetary system. The economic rationale forthis kind of cooperation can be summarised as follows. First, financial instability can materialise evenwith sound macroeconomic policies, as a result of factors such as inadequate supervision in emergingmarket economies and so-called “contagion”, ie the international transmission of instability. Second, aworld divided into sovereign states has inevitably moved more rapidly towards full capital mobilitythan towards common rules. The asymmetry between the free movement of capital, which takes placeon a global scale, and policymaking, which remains mainly in the national domain, can haveimplications for financial stability and calls for enhanced international cooperation.
BIS Review 79/200042.The challenges aheadLet me now turn to the challenges ahead. I shall distinguish between challenges related to theinstitutional framework for international cooperation and challenges pertaining to the specific contentsof international cooperation.Institutional challengesOver the past two years, the representation of the euro area in international organisations and fora hasbeen decided in accordance with the aforementioned guidelines laid down in the Treaty. Theseguidelines and decisions, however, have no direct legal bearing on the statutes and/or internal rulesgoverning international organisations and fora. This implies a need for the gradual adaptation of thetraditional institutional framework for international relations. That framework was not tailored to theinvolvement of monetary unions as such, nor to the advent of the Eurosystem - and, more generally,the euro area - as a new actor in international relations. Until now, this process of adaptation has beenconducted to a large extent on the basis of ad hoc solutions. In the longer run, however, a morefundamental approach may be needed.A first challenge arises from the fact that the international intergovernmental organisations - the IMFand the OECD - were created at a time when only national states were responsible for domesticpolicymaking. As a result, only individual countries - and not the ECB and other representatives of theeuro area as such - are members of the IMF and the OECD, even if these organisations deal, amongother things, with the euro area monetary and exchange rate policy. Both the IMF and the OECD haveadjusted their internal rules to reflect the new context. In particular, the Executive Board of the IMFhas granted permanent observer status to the ECB, and the OECD has allowed the ECB to participatein the work of its relevant committees and working groups as a separate member of the EuropeanCommunity delegation alongside the Commission.A second challenge is the definition of an adequate representation of the euro area in thoseinternational fora where both ministers and central bank governors are represented (eg G7 and G20).Here the problem raised by the creation of the euro area was its capability to speak - if and whenappropriate - “with one voice”. Specific arrangements between the euro area and its counterparts in thevarious fora have dealt with this problem. These arrangements, however, may still call for someimprovement. For instance, it is true that issues such as the architecture of the international monetarysystem fall primarily under the competence of individual euro area countries. The ECOFIN Council,however, needs to gain an increasingly higher profile when these issues are discussed in the competentfora (eg G7). This would strengthen the European stance and simplify the process for decision-makingat the international level. In this respect, the Eurosystem may provide - as I will discuss afterwards- significant value added to euro area governments. More generally speaking, the ECB would welcomeany initiative of euro area governments designed to enhance - in compliance with the respectivecompetencies of the ECOFIN Council and the Eurosystem - the credibility and clout of the euro areain the international community.The content of cooperation: the ECB’s assessment of “private sector involvement”The other major challenge for the ECB and the Eurosystem in the years to come will be to becomemore directly involved in the process of international cooperation beyond the area of macroeconomiccooperation. This relates, in particular, to current work being done to strengthen the internationalfinancial architecture, which is close to the area of traditional competence and expertise of the centralbanking community. The Eurosystem supports this process for two reasons. First, because theachievement of its primary objective of safeguarding price stability in the euro area would befacilitated by a safer and more resilient international financial system. Second, because the statute ofthe Eurosystem establishes that the Eurosystem shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policiesrelating to the stability of the financial system.
5BIS Review 79/2000A wide range of topics could be discussed here. However, the interest that the IIF has shown in therecent past in the issue of “private sector involvement” leads me to focus on the ECB’s assessment ofongoing discussions.Owing to changes in the magnitude and composition of capital flows, the private sector is playing anincreasingly important role in the financing of emerging market economies. According to recent IIFestimates, in the 1990s 85% of total net inflows of capital to the major borrowing countries came fromthe private sector. Such inflows averaged USD 170 billion per annum, compared with USD 35 billionper annum in the 1980s. By contrast, net official flows averaged USD 30 billion per annum throughoutthe 1990s and reached only USD 5 billion in 1999, their lowest level for over 20 years.Despite these developments, however, in times of financial distress the role of the official sectorremains crucial in providing financial assistance to emerging market economies. It is true that informalarrangements are in force in order to facilitate negotiations with the main creditors of the privatesector. The so-called “London Club” has become a kind of permanent institution, like the Paris Clubfor obligations vis-à-vis official creditors. However, the development of new instruments for lendingto emerging market economies and the increasing diversification of the creditor base, while facilitatingthe financing of the countries concerned, render negotiations between debtor countries and theirprivate sector creditors more difficult in the event of a crisis. This explains why, so far, only ad hocmeasures have been developed in order to involve private sector creditors - on a case-by-case basis - inthe resolution of financial crises.In addition to enhanced efforts to improve the communication channels between debtor countries andtheir creditors, which would also enhance crisis prevention, the ECB would support a move tostrengthen the existing framework for the management of financial crises. Three fundamentalprinciples may be helpful to this aim.First, the framework should rely more on rules and less on discretion than was the case in the secondhalf of the 1990s. A case-by-case approach, lacking clear “rules of the game” on the respective roles ofprivate and official sectors in times of distress, runs the risk of creating the perception that officialresources would provide a “safety net” if need be. Such a perception is likely to distort debtmanagement on the borrowers’ side and risk assessment on the creditors’ side, thus engenderingproblems of moral hazard on both sides.Second, the IMF cannot - owing to its limited resources which do not match private capital outflows- and should not - owing to moral hazard problems mentioned above - act as an international lender oflast resort. IMF financial assistance can neither be unlimited nor cover all the financing needs of acountry. The IMF should rather play a catalytic role. IMF conditionality in the form of adjustmentprogrammes should, in conjunction with IMF financing, be instrumental in improving the externalposition of member countries and quickly restoring market confidence. Actual ceilings on access toIMF financing facilities should also be established.Third, as a logical consequence of limited official financing, the private sector should be involved inthe resolution of financial crises. It is a matter of fact that a country running into financial difficultieswill need to involve its creditors in one way or another. In this context, the crucial question is how“orderly” such an involvement should be. In their efforts to secure adequate private sectorinvolvement, debtor countries should try to reach market-based and cooperative solutions with allclasses of creditors, respecting comparable treatment among and within different classes.We are convinced that a strengthened framework based on these principles would create the rightexpectations in both the private sector and the official sector. It would also allow for sufficientflexibility to address specific cases in the course of a crisis.ConclusionsI shall bring this talk to a close by drawing a few basic conclusions.In principle, the introduction of the euro should simplify international cooperation by reducing thenumber of key players in the international arena.
BIS Review 79/20006In this new streamlined international setting, the euro area can be expected to play a greater role and togain a higher profile.In this respect, the ECB is already a potentially influential participant in the process of internationalcooperation. At the same time, the ECB is a new player in this process, and its role will thereforeevolve over time.
1BIS Review 78/2000Svein Gjedrem: Developments in the Nordic financial industry -a central banker’s perspectiveAddress by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, at the Nordic Financial ServicesConference, held in Stockholm, on 18 September 2000.*      *      *1.IntroductionWhat is the future of the Nordic financial services industry? Who are the winners in the consolidationprocess? What is the potential of e-business and the Internet?This is just a sample of the important and challenging questions that will be discussed at thisconference. Fortunately, it is the task of my fellow speakers - and not mine - to try to answer them.Given their background as significant market participants, I am sure that they will provide us withsome valuable insights.Today, most central banks follow structural developments in the financial sector from the sidelines.This has not always been the case. The post-war period was characterised by heavy regulation. Thedomestic authorities controlled market prices, financial flows and the structure of the financial sector.There was little foreign influence. Gradually, markets were deregulated and became moreinternationally integrated. The central banks’ main instrument is now the setting of interest rates. Themain objectives of central banks have stayed the same: monetary and financial stability.Although deregulation is now completed in the industrialised countries, its full impact on the financialstructure remains to be seen. In addition, technological developments, internationalisation andincreased focus on shareholder value are creating pressures for structural change.Together, these forces are reducing the cost of providing traditional financial services and are pavingthe way for new ways to channel savings and manage risks.Structural developments in the financial sector can be important for monetary and financial stability.Central bankers thus follow developments with great interest. Today I will examine some aspects ofthe changes taking place and their potential consequences for monetary and financial stability.Let me run through the structure of my speech. First, I’d like to touch upon some characteristics of theNordic economies as a background to the financial sector issues I will discuss later. Second, I willdefine the two stability terms that I have just introduced. Third, I will discuss the growing importanceof securities markets. I will then reflect upon cross-border integration in the banking sector andconsequences of the Internet. Finally, I will take a quick look at what challenges structural changesmay pose to the authorities, and then conclude.2.Some characteristics of the Nordic economiesThe economies of the four largest Nordic countries have some well-known features that distinguishthem from most other developed countries.
BIS Review 78/20002For a start, they all have fairly large public sectors, as illustrated by the level of public sectoremployment. Compared with Anglo-Saxon countries, the differences are striking. The large publicsectors are the result of a deliberate choice to ensure equal access to certain services like health care.The emphasis on equality and social security also underlies the “cradle to grave” public welfaresystems in the Nordic countries. These systems require large public transfers.Both the large public sectors and the high level of transfers necessitate a high level of taxes. Inaddition, the tax systems have been focused on redistributing income.Another Nordic feature is the high share of labour union membership. Wage negotiations havetraditionally been rather centralised and income is fairly equally distributed.
3BIS Review 78/2000There is a risk that these features of the Nordic societies weaken both incentives and competition. Inthat sense, the Nordic countries clash with the “Anglo-Saxon model”. However, both the standard ofliving and other general indicators of well-being are at the top internationally. Hence these countriesmust also possess growth-enhancing characteristics. The most important is probably their opennessboth to trade and the exchange of know-how. We also like to think that the traditional working ethic ofthe Nordic people is still in place and plays an important role. Nordic enterprises have shownflexibility in adapting to a changing market and technological conditions. The restructuring of thefinancial industry is a relevant example.There are also differences between the Nordic economies. One such area is industry structure.Sweden and Finland both have relatively large manufacturing sectors. They have some majorindustrial and technological “locomotives”, in addition to a pool of small companies. Several of theseare suppliers to the larger companies.Denmark has many small and medium-sized enterprises. Perhaps due to location and transport links,Denmark is a centre for trade and the location for the Nordic headquarters of a number of internationalcompanies. The Norwegian enterprise sector, on the other hand, is heavily influenced by our naturalresources.
BIS Review 78/200043.Monetary and financial stabilityI would now like to address the key objectives of most central banks: monetary and financial stability.What do these two terms mean?Monetary stability is interpreted somewhat differently in various countries. The most commondefinition is price stability - that is to say the stability of the internal value of money. Sometimes it isinterpreted as exchange rate stability - in other words the stability of the external value of domesticmoney.Finland, Sweden and Norway all experienced severe banking crises in the early 1990s. Most people inthese countries have a clear idea of what a financial crisis is. In a sense, financial stability is theabsence of financial crises. A robust financial system has solid cushions that reduce the risk ofproblems spreading from one institution or market to other institutions or markets, or across borders.This risk constitutes a systemic risk, which is the risk of failure of the financial system.Disturbances that might develop into a systemic risk can be transmitted through financial institutionsand financial markets. Robust institutions and stable markets are thus important. Robust institutionsare solid institutions that enjoy general confidence. Stable markets are markets where there are no“excessive” price variations.Banks are in a special position. They transform short-term deposits into long-term loans. They areresponsible for payment settlements, and bank deposits serve as a means of payment. The volume ofamounts outstanding in the interbank market is sizeable. As a result, problems in one bank may rapidlyspread to other banks. The financial strength of banks is thus important for financial stability, evenmore so in countries where banks are the main financial intermediaries.Long-term profitability has a decisive influence on financial strength. Obviously, there are manyfactors that can influence the future profitability of banks. The topics you will discuss during these twodays are of great importance.Financial unrest spreads through payment and settlement systems. These systems can also be a sourceof risk. This occurs when banks credit customers before they have received settlement from the payerbank. Payment and settlement systems must thus be designed to reduce settlement risk. This is an issuehigh on the agenda of most central banks.Interdependence of monetary and financial stabilityThe objectives of monetary stability and financial stability are interdependent. High - and thereby inpractice varying - inflation and unstable exchange rates can threaten financial stability through severalchannels.First, it is more difficult to assess the risk of an investment project. Inflation makes it difficult todifferentiate between a change in prices for goods or service and a change in the overall price level. Itmakes it more difficult to determine the discount rate to be applied.Second, fluctuations in the inflation rate are often accompanied by interest rate variations. A sharp risein interest rates can also result in substantial losses on financial assets such as bonds and equities.Loans that have been granted against collateral in the form of such assets are even more exposed tolosses.When rising inflation and inflation expectations necessitate a substantial tightening of monetarypolicy, a crisis may ensue. In several countries the financial system has been on the verge of collapseduring such a period of adjustment. This was the case in the US in the early 1980s and in the Nordiccountries around 1990.Interest rates are the central banks’ most “direct” tool for contributing to both monetary and financialstability. Financial stability primarily contributes to price and exchange rate stability by facilitating theuse of policy instruments for monetary stability purposes. Unstable institutions and markets constrainthe use of interest rates. Tighter liquidity and higher interest rates may increase the uncertaintyconcerning the stability of the financial system.
5BIS Review 78/2000This suggests that situations may occur where there is a conflict between the two objectives. Assetprices are an important link between monetary and financial stability. For example, a surge in propertyprices, with a risk of a subsequent fall, may threaten to undermine banks’ collateral and increase loanlosses. This can put financial stability at risk. A surge in asset prices without accompanying pressureson prices for goods and services raises a dilemma for central banks. There is no consensus on how tohandle this dilemma. Central banks have avoided targeting specific asset price levels. Nevertheless,history provides some examples of when more emphasis might have been placed on asset pricedevelopments in the formulation of monetary policy.1Structural changes in the financial sector have the strongest impact on monetary stability through theway it may alter the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. For example, if structural changesincrease competition in the banking sector, banks may adjust their retail interest rates more rapidly inresponse to changes in central bank and money market rates. This means that monetary policy mayinfluence savings and investment decisions more quickly.The four largest Nordic countries have chosen different monetary policy regimes:• Finland is part of the euro area;• Denmark is a member of ERM II;• Sveriges Riksbank targets inflation;• whereas Norges Bank focuses on long-term exchange rate stability.I want to emphasise that the objectives of monetary and financial stability can be achieved by differentregimes, including the ones chosen by the Nordic countries. Denmark has for several years run asuccessful fixed exchange rate regime. Denmark’s success must be seen in the light of a combinationof factors. First, ERM membership and Denmark’s long-term commitment to a stable exchange ratehave enhanced confidence in the current regime. Second, fiscal policy has successfully supported thefixed exchange rate. For many other countries with less economic policy discipline, traditional fixedexchange rate regimes have proved fatal. Internationally, there is a tendency of a shift away from thetraditional fixed exchange rate regime. Countries that place overriding emphasis on exchange ratestability must bind themselves more firmly to the mast either by establishing a currency board or byabandoning their national currency. Other countries allow their currency to float and establish anominal anchor such as an inflation target.4.The growing importance of securities marketsLet me now turn to an important structural development in the financial sector: the growingimportance of securities markets.1Japan in the late 1980s has been mentioned as one example. Cf. Bernanke, Ben and Mark Gertler: Monetary policy andasset price volatility, and Yamaguchi, Yutaka: Asset price and monetary policy: Japan’s experience, in New challengesfor monetary policy, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (1999).
BIS Review 78/20006Chart 5 Swedish households’ grossfinancial assets by instrument. Per centIn most developed countries, securities markets are growing at the expense of financial intermediation.In the Nordic countries, this trend is most obvious in the savings market. Sweden is an example.Deposit savings have been reduced, whereas savings directly or indirectly in securities markets haveincreased. This affects banks’ earnings and funding structure. The trend is similar in Norway.In the euro area, there has been a sharp growth in issues of private securities after the introduction ofthe single currency. This growth was to some extent expected, as the common currency creates a hugeinvestor base for security lending. One particular factor that contributed to the strong growth was theconsiderable number of business takeovers and mergers in 1999, perhaps influenced by the euro.Securities are a common form of financing such operations. A growing number of small, higher riskcompanies could also make use of this market.In general, the euro is having a considerable influence on the development of securities markets inEurope. A number of factors are improving market liquidity and efficiency, for example theelimination of exchange rate risk, greater price transparency, harmonisation of market practices andchanges in market infrastructure.
7BIS Review 78/2000In most European countries, credit has traditionally been channelled through financial intermediariessuch as banks. The structure is different in the US, where the securities markets are larger and thebanking sector is smaller.Among the Nordic countries, Finland has the largest stock market capitalisation relative to GDP. Thisis mainly due to one company, Nokia. Sweden also has a comparatively large stock market. This canperhaps be seen in connection with the structure of the enterprise sector in Sweden, which has beendominated by some very large, export-oriented companies. This economic structure might also havecontributed to the development of Sweden’s relatively large and internationally active banks. Denmarkand Sweden have relatively large debt securities markets. This is mainly related to house financing.Larger and more efficient securities markets - both in equities and debt instruments - provide morefinancing alternatives for companies and investment alternatives for savers. Companies financed in thesecurities markets are continuously monitored through a transparent process. Well-functioningsecurities markets may thus increase the profitability of capital and hence economic growth, bymaking sure that capital is allocated to the best new investment projects and by facilitating therestructuring of existing companies. In other words: competition for capital contributes to creativedestruction.In my opinion, larger and more efficient securities markets will also reduce the risk of financialinstability. Let me give you a recent example. The Long Term Capital Management crisis in 1998showed that banks and securities markets can complement one another in crisis situations. During thecrisis, the market for securities with credit risk dried up for a short period. Banks then increased theirlending, and thereby averted a more extensive shortage of credit. More frequently, financing throughsecurities markets has been used as a substitute for bank loans in the event of banking problems. Thegoal of financial stability thus implies both well-functioning banks and securities markets. The optimalbalance between the two is difficult to define, but in most countries - including the Nordic countries -the financial system would be more robust with larger, more developed securities markets than is thecase today. This could also enhance the growth prospects of the respective economies.5.Developments in the banking sectorHaving discussed the relationship between banks and securities markets, I would now like to turn todevelopments within the banking sector.Competition in the banking markets is increasing. Banks face competition from other banks andfinancial institutions. As mentioned, there is also increasing competition from securities markets onboth sides of the balance sheet. In addition, new operators are entering the market, either on their own
BIS Review 78/20008or in cooperation with existing market operators. Distribution of financial services on the Internet isone example. Joint ventures between supermarkets and banks is another.Unless the banks adapt to this new environment, their long-term profitability might suffer. Therestructuring of the banking industry can be viewed as an attempt to respond to these competitivepressures.5.1Cross-border integrationIn the last few years we have experienced a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the financial industry.Internationally, consolidation within countries has been predominant. This indicates that reducingcosts and strengthening market position are often the preferred strategies. However, the developmentof “national champions” might be a run-up to increased cross-border activity.The Nordic and Benelux countries are important exceptions to this international trend. The five largestNordic banking groups - MeritaNordbanken and Unibank - which are now part of Nordic BalticHolding - Handelsbanken, FöreningsSparbanken, Den Danske Bank and SEB - all define the Nordicregion as their home market. They have established branches, cooperations and merged with oracquired institutions in other Nordic countries. Some of them also focus on other countries in NorthernEurope, such as the Baltic states, Poland and Germany. However, their business strategies varysomewhat.What is the reason behind this Nordic expansion? It is easy to point to integrated markets, throughtrade and direct investment. However, this cannot be the only explanation as there are also otherneighbouring countries in Europe that are closely integrated. A common history, small culturaldifferences and similar languages - at least within the Scandinavian countries - are probably ofparticular importance to Nordic integration.There are also more industry-specific explanations. Strategic positioning - perhaps as a defensivemeasure against competition from non-Nordic institutions - is one explanation. It could also be thatNordic expansion is just a first step towards further international expansion, perhaps in selectedmarket segments. I’m sure there are people in the audience who are better qualified to predict futuredevelopments than I am. I will instead focus on another important issue: production costs and the sizeof markets.Geographic expansion gives institutions an opportunity to sell existing products to new customers innew markets. As a result, the institutions can spread their costs over a larger customer base. However,one may question whether regional or national markets or even the Nordic market - at least in someproduct segments - are large enough to give the institutions’ production activity the necessary size.
9BIS Review 78/2000This raises the question of whether to separate production and distribution. Many institutions,particularly smaller ones, may find it beneficial to distribute other companies’ products. Differentcooperation agreements make it possible for small players to offer a broader product range than theywould have been able to on their own. We have seen several examples of this in Norway, particularlyamong savings banks. At the same time, some larger institutions may benefit from offering theirproducts for distribution through other institutions.This may contribute to keeping Nordic banks - both large and small - competitive in the retail market.In the segment of large enterprises, however, production and distribution are perhaps more difficult toseparate. This may imply that many Nordic banks are too small to compete for the business of largeand advanced customers. Competition in this segment is perhaps more international than Nordic.How does cross-border integration change the risk outlook for the financial system? If it improves thelong-term profitability, and thus the robustness of institutions, it is clearly advantageous. Spreadingproduction costs over a larger customer base may improve profits. In addition, cross-bordercompetition might lead to efficiency gains and a spillover of best practices. However, there are alsocounter-arguments. For example, increasing the size of operations may reduce management focus.In general, more integrated financial markets can spread financial unrest between countries moreeasily. This could have a negative effect on financial stability. On the other hand, banks with activitiesin several countries should be in a stronger position to cope with a recession or a crisis situation in agiven country than banks whose activity is confined to one single country. This is positive from afinancial stability point of view.5.2The Internet as a distribution channel for financial servicesLet me now turn to the impact of the Internet on the banking and financial services industry.The Internet creates new opportunities for traditional banks. For example, banks should be wellpositioned to become key operators in trading on the Internet. They have a large customer base andstrong brand names, and can offer payment transmission services, advertising space and links on theirhome pages. Internationally, many banks have agreements with Internet or telecommunicationcompanies for the development of Internet banking and marketplaces on the Internet. This is probablyjust the beginning of a trend towards increased cooperation across industry boundaries.The Internet poses great challenges as well. It is clearly intensifying competition in the industry. Thisis partly because it is easier for customers to compare prices and terms and partly because it is simplerfor new operators to penetrate the market. The Internet may also change the relative positions ofexisting market participants.Many Nordic banks have established some form of Internet banking. So far, most services offered onthe Internet are relatively simple, for example loan applications, bill payments and account transfers.These are probably the most important services for the majority of customers. Several banks also offertrading in shares and fund units on the Internet. The product range and user-friendliness can beexpected to increase in the period ahead. I’m sure discussions during this conference will give you anindication of future product developments.
BIS Review 78/200010Nordic countries rank at the top globally in terms of access to the Internet. Nordic banks thus have aunique opportunity to serve a substantial share of customers via the Internet. This also has relevance tocross-border integration. Banks that focus on Internet distribution are perhaps particularly interested inmarkets where there are many Internet users.Although estimates vary, it is safe to say that the Internet will significantly reduce the banks’ variablecosts. However, substantial IT investments may be necessary to keep pace with technological andmarket developments. In isolation, this may contribute to increasing banks’ fixed costs.As a result, the competitive environment may change. There is a danger of over-investment. Sunkcosts account for a large share of overall costs. This may lead to marginal pricing as the fight forvolume intensifies. This could have a negative effect on bank profitability.Many Nordic banks have a smaller customer base for distributing fixed costs than large foreigncompetitors. As mentioned, some banks have tried to compensate by entering into cooperationagreements. However, it might be difficult to reduce total costs without a substantial reduction in thecosts of more traditional distribution. Banks are thus facing a challenge with regard to a further scalingback of the physical distribution network.In general, financial institutions are facing considerable challenges in adapting to new technologies,intensified competition and globalisation. Substantial investments will probably be required to keepthem competitive. Both management and employees will have to devote considerable attention tothese aspects. The wrong solution or approach could weaken banks’ competitive position, profitabilityand financial strength. This may also have negative implications for financial stability. However, Idon’t want to give you the impression it’s all doom and gloom. New technologies offer greatopportunities for streamlining operations and improving efficiency. There should also be new businessopportunities. Although the financial sector is undergoing fundamental changes, competent marketparticipants should have every opportunity to thrive in a changing environment.6.Consequences for the authoritiesDevelopments in the financial sector also pose challenges for the authorities. Let me give you a fewexamples.The growth of complex financial conglomerates represents considerable challenges for supervisionand crisis resolution. The international trend towards one national supervisory authority is probablyadvantageous in this respect. The Nordic countries have led the way here.The growth of institutions with a significant presence in several countries has increased the need forcooperation between the authorities of different countries. Bilateral and multilateral memorandums of
11BIS Review 78/2000understanding are an important tool in this respect. The Nordic supervisory authorities have recentlysigned a joint memorandum of understanding.The activities of central banks are also influenced. If systemically important domestic institutionsexpand abroad, central banks - with responsibility for financial stability - will have to assess the risksinvolved. In addition, structural changes also influence central banks’ role as “lender of last resort”.Although structural changes alter the risk profile of the financial system, they shouldn’t be viewed asnegative. On the contrary, these changes may be necessary to reap the benefits of more efficientintermediation of savings and better risk management. Changes are thus something the authoritiesshould facilitate and adapt to - through high quality supervision and surveillance and throughregulatory changes if necessary. Currently a variety of regulatory initiatives are being discussed.Important examples are the EU Financial Services Action Plan, the revision of the Basel CapitalAccord, and the different initiatives gathered under the heading of “New Financial Architecture”.However, as the current wave of consolidation progresses, the authorities must take the necessarysteps to ensure an adequate level of competition. While executing this task, the authorities shouldrecognise that the competitive environment of the financial sector has changed and will continue to doso.Furthermore, it is important that the market surveillance function is improved. Increased transparencyand harmonisation of regulation and industry practices are particularly important in this respect.However, enhanced supervision, international cooperation and regulatory changes are not enough.Improving institutions’ own risk management systems is a key challenge. It is vital that these systemsdevelop as the structure and activities of institutions change.7.ConclusionFinally, I would like to make a few concluding remarks. Finland, Sweden and Norway all experienceda severe banking crisis in the early 1990s. That taught us how costly financial crises can be, and howimportant it is to prevent their recurrence.In the last 20 years three-quarters of IMF member countries have experienced a banking crisis. Noteven a perfectly healthy macroeconomic policy and an effective supervisory system constitute aguarantee against crises if participants in the financial sector behave imprudently. The most importantpreventive measure is thus to promote prudent behaviour. The authorities will contribute to this end.However, I would like to emphasise that responsibility for sound practices primarily rests with marketparticipants themselves.Banks are at the core of the financial system, and will probably remain so in the foreseeable future.However, they face increasing competition from several quarters. Unless banks adapt to this newenvironment, their profitability and financial strength might suffer and they may be tempted to engagein unhealthy risk taking. The authorities should look at the restructuring of the banking industry withan open mind. Structural changes may be necessary to reap the benefits of factors such as newtechnology and globalisation.
1BIS Review 77/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The euro as a catalyst for legal convergence in EuropeSpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of theAnnual Conference of the International Bar Association, held in Amsterdam, on 17 September 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,It is a great pleasure to deliver today the opening speech of the Annual Conference of the InternationalBar Association here in Amsterdam. The Netherlands is, of course, well-known for its nationalfolklore of which you just witnessed an example. However, in legal circles this country is also knownas the birthplace, in the year 1583, of the founding father of the modern law of nations and a trulyEuropean citizen: Hugo de Groot or, by his Latin name, Grotius. Interestingly, Grotius already dealt inhis days with the challenging question as to where, on the one hand, unification of law across bordersis desirable and where, on the other hand, national differences, often based on cultural diversity, standin the way of such unification. Nowadays, this is still one of the core questions in the creation andfurther elaboration of a new corpus iuris monetae for the euro. I shall enter into the details of this newbody of monetary and financial law later. Let me first highlight some historic events for those of youwho have come from afar and may, thus, be less acquainted with the main features of Economic andMonetary Union.As a crown on the internal market of the European Union (EU), the euro came into existence on1 January 1999. This occurred through the irrevocable fixing of the exchange rates of the currencies ofthose 11 EU Member States which qualified not only economically, but also legally, for the adoptionof the euro. These Member States are: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Greece will adopt the euro as from 1 January 2001,while Denmark will hold a referendum on the adoption of the euro on 28 September 2000. Swedenand the United Kingdom did not introduce the euro in their respective countries, but this may change,of course, in the future.The birth of the euro was preceded, on 1 June 1998, by the establishment of the ECB, the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Eurosystem. The ESCB is composed of the ECB and the15 national central banks (NCBs) of all EU Member States. The Eurosystem is composed of the ECBand the 11 NCBs of those Member States which have adopted the euro. The six members of the ECB’sExecutive Board and the Governors of these 11 NCBs together form the Governing Council. This isthe Eurosystem’s highest decision-making body, which, among other things, has adopted theEurosystem’s regulatory framework.In my speech today, I will elaborate upon how the ECB, but also the Community legislator, nationallegislators and market participants have struggled with the same question which Hugo de Grootalready addressed in his days in another context: in view of the introduction of the euro, where is, onthe one hand, unification of law desirable and where may, on the other hand, national differencescontinue to exist? Or, to remain closer to the title of my speech: where, and to what extent, has theeuro acted as a catalyst for legal convergence, and where is further convergence appropriate?As a preliminary remark, the introduction of the euro and the globalisation of the world’s financialmarkets are clear incentives for a development towards “one market, one currency, one law”. Thereare, however, at least two important impediments for such law to emerge in the near future.First, there are the Community law principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Subsidiarity requiresthat the Community legislator only adopts legislation if this is necessary to achieve the Community’sobjectives. Proportionality requires that the type of legal act to be adopted be proportionate, ie not tooheavy, in relation to the objectives to be achieved.Second, the EU consists of as many different legal systems as there are Member States, although thereare, of course, similar types of legal systems of common orientation (Roman law, Anglo-Saxon law or
BIS Review 77/20002the Scandinavian systems). Recognition of the peculiarities of such legal systems in accordance withthe principles of subsidiarity and proportionality leads automatically to legal diversity.In addition, for the Eurosystem it is also important to mention that system-related tasks are executed ina decentralised fashion through the NCBs in their respective jurisdictions. For example, with regard tothe Eurosystem’s single monetary policy, the ECB’s decision-making bodies decide on such policy,but the NCBs execute monetary policy operations in their respective jurisdictions.All in all, a system of Community law has evolved, also for the euro, which is dominated, in aspectrum from high to low legislative influence, by notions such as unification, harmonisation,approximation, implementation and self-regulation. The road towards unification, if achievable at all,is of an evolutionary nature, where each legal action is determined on a case-by-case basis. This is nota bad development. After all, unification is not a goal in itself. Legal action should have awell-balanced relation to the objectives to be achieved. Particularly in the area of monetary andfinancial law, we have created such a well-balanced legal structure which ensures the fulfilment of theMonetary Union’s objectives at present.Let me, without the pretension of being exhaustive, briefly touch on several aspects of this new corpusiuris monetae and explain how we, at a Community level, have tried to strike a balance betweenunification on the one hand, and differentiation on the other.Institutionally, legal convergence has taken place with regard to the statutes of the EU NCBs. The EUTreaty prescribes that the ESCB NCBs are independent and that the Eurosystem NCBs are fullyintegrated into the Eurosystem. This requires the adaptation of statutes of NCBs. However, the legalrequirements for central bank independence and integration in the Eurosystem are not preciselydefined in the Treaty. Therefore, the ECB and its predecessor, the European Monetary Institute, havedone so themselves in their so-called Convergence Reports. These Reports assess whether a MemberState qualifies for the introduction of the euro and they also contain a chapter on legal convergence.They develop features of institutional, personal and financial independence. In addition, they identifyareas in which statutes of NCBs are likely to require adaptation in view of the integration of NCBs inthe Eurosystem. These Reports thus gave guidance to national legislators in the process of adaptingsuch statutes. As a result, new statutes of NCBs have come into existence, which, as far asEurosystem-related tasks are concerned, often contain very similar provisions. Yet, the Treaty does notprescribe harmonisation of statutes and NCBs may perform own, non-Eurosystem related tasks, aslong as such tasks do not interfere with the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem. Overall, statutes ofNCBs therefore still differ considerably from one another. In conclusion, there has not beenharmonisation, but rather an approximation of law in this area.Operationally, legal convergence has taken place as a result of the adoption of the ESCB’s regulatoryframework. This framework was prepared by the EMI and adopted by the Governing Council of theECB shortly before the introduction of the euro.The ESCB’s regulatory framework consists of a variety of legal acts. One part is intended to begenerally applicable and binding on market participants across the euro area. Another part is intendedto govern the internal relationships between the components of the Eurosystem or the ESCB, as thecase may be. An example of the former are ECB Regulations on minimum reserves, statisticalinformation and ECB sanctions. They apply to all parties concerned across the euro area. An exampleof the latter are ECB Guidelines. These are addressed to, and binding on, Eurosystem NCBs. Usuallythey require implementation in those legal acts which such NCBs apply to govern the legalrelationship with their counterparties. These acts implementing the ECB’s legal acts may be of aregulatory or a contractual nature or a mixture thereof. This depends on the legal traditions of thejurisdictions in which they are adopted. In the former acts, the ECB Regulations, the point of gravitywith regard to their application lies clearly with the ECB. In the latter, the acts implementing theECB’s rules, it lies clearly with the NCBs. In other words, in the first case there is unification of law,in the latter approximation.The justification for this balanced approach is the following. Obviously, implementation of a singlemonetary policy for the euro area requires, on the one hand, a single set of rules established at, andapplied by, the centre, the ECB. On the other hand, in view of the decentralised execution of such
3BIS Review 77/2000policy, there is a need for rules, which are tailored towards each specific jurisdiction in which theactual operations with counterparties take place. Of course, the Eurosystem has establishedmechanisms to ensure that a level playing-field across the system for system-related tasks ismaintained in order to avoid regional distortions in the implementation of the single monetary policy.Clearly, the ECB is not the only party steering towards a level of legal convergence which is needed toreap the benefits of the introduction of the euro. The Community legislator, and in particular the EUCouncil, has also passed legislation in a variety of areas relating to the euro.For example, two Council Regulations have been adopted on the introduction of the euro. TheseCouncil Regulations cover topics which, in view of the introduction of the single currency, need to bedealt with in a uniform manner. They cover issues such as the continuity of contracts, conversionrates, rounding, the substitution of the euro for the currencies of the participating Member States,transitional provisions and the introduction of euro banknotes and coins as from 1 January 2002. Sincethese Council Regulations are generally applicable, they are an example of a unification of law. Theydo not preclude, however, the adoption of auxiliary legislation at a national level.In addition, the Community legislator has adopted Directives, in the area of payment and securitiessettlement systems for example, which apply to scriptural payments in euro. Since such Directivesrequire implementation, this may be regarded as an example of an approximation of law.Finally, the Community legislator has issued several Recommendations on topics such as bankingcharges for the conversion to the euro, dual display of prices and other monetary amounts, andcollector coins, medals and tokens. Since such Recommendations are non-binding, they may beconsidered as an incentive for self-regulation, either by national legislators or market participants.Legal convergence is not the monopoly of legislators. Market participants may contribute as well. Inan increasingly globalised financial world, they do fortunately make a considerable contribution.There are various representative organisations of market participants which, in view of theintroduction of the euro and the resulting integration of financial markets, have adopted, or are in theprocess of adopting, standard market documentation for their transactions. A good example is theEuropean Master Agreement (EMA) of the European Banking Federation. The EMA aims toconsolidate into a harmonised standard various master agreements used within the euro area andseveral neighbouring countries, in particular for repurchase transactions and securities lending. At thesame time, it allows that the parties’ preferences with regard to the applicable law, jurisdiction,contractual language and specific national legal requirements may be taken into account. The ECBwelcomes such market initiatives of legal convergence.Legal convergence is spreading throughout Europe, crossing the borders of the EU as they stand atpresent. Thirteen central and eastern European countries have applied for membership of the EU. Theyrange, geographically, from the Baltic States in the north to Turkey in the south. A precondition ofmembership is that the accession countries implement the so-called acquis communautaire, ie thearound 80,000 pages of Community law provisions which, among many other areas, includelegislation on the euro as well. It will be interesting to see how the accession countries enrich Europe’slegal landscape. When implementing the Community’s acquis they may, on the one hand, profit fromalready well established structures, which could lead to a fairly high level of harmonisation. However,taking into account the cultural diversity of the countries concerned, considerable legal differencesmay, perhaps, not be ruled out.In any case, the accession countries will have to make their NCBs independent and accommodate theintegration of their NCBs in the Eurosystem. It is important to note that accession to the EU and theintroduction of the euro will, in all likelihood, not coincide.From the ECB’s perspective, it is furthermore important that the legislation of the accession countriesin the areas of banking, securities markets, payment and settlement systems and collateral is madecompatible with EU standards. After all, under the rules of the single financial passport, membershipof the EU implies for financial institutions in the accession countries that they may obtain access toEurosystem facilities such as monetary policy operations and payment systems.
BIS Review 77/20004This is a daunting task for the accession countries and the ECB stands ready to assist them, in closecooperation of course with all the other EU authorities involved and in particular with theCommission. Indeed, the ECB has built up extensive experience in delivering opinions on draftlegislation in its field of competence where the Community and national legislators have to consult theECB. It goes without saying that the accession countries may profit from the ECB’s experience in thisfield.All in all, the birth of the euro has triggered tremendous legal activity, not only for legislatorsspecifically, but also for market participants generally. I am happy, and frankly also proud, that suchactivity has been successful. The ESCB’s regulatory framework is an important step towards legalconvergence in Europe and has proved to function well. Moreover, I am not aware of any legalderailments resulting from the introduction of the euro. An interesting example of the lack of legalproblems is the continuity of those contracts in which monetary obligations are denominated incurrencies which are now sub-units of the euro. The continuity of such contracts after the introductionof the euro inside and outside the EU was the subject of extensive legal studies. However, in the end,and perhaps also as a result of a provision in the EU Council’s euro Regulation, legal problems did notarise in this area.This does not mean that there is no need for further legal convergence. On the contrary, having built asolid house for the euro, refinements in its furbishment remain, of course, a matter for attention. Suchrefinements will no doubt follow the evolutionary path as described earlier, with attempts being madeto strike a balance between the need for unification and the wish to maintain national differences.As far as the statutes of NCBs are concerned, they may perhaps continue to converge over time, butthere is no urgent need for further adaptations of the statutes of EU NCBs at present. The situation is,of course, different for those NCBs which are not yet members of the Eurosystem and the NCBs of theaccession countries.As far as the ESCB’s regulatory framework is concerned, this will be subject to legal fine-tuning asand when the need arises. Since Guidelines are the backbone of the Eurosystem and may be changedovernight without difficulty, such fine-tuning - should it be necessary - will be relatively straightforward. Their implementation at a national level may, however, take more time dependent on thenational practice of each NCB.However, in a broader context there is still a lot of legal activity to be accomplished, particularly as faras the further integration of the financial markets is concerned. In this context, two initiatives merit aspecific mention.First, the EU Council has adopted a Financial Services Action Plan. This Plan provides for anambitious legislative programme, which is envisaged to be completed by the year 2005.Second, a Group of Seven Wise Men has been established which, under the chairmanship of mypredecessor at the EMI, Alexandre Lamfalussy, has been mandated to develop recommendations onmeasures, including legal measures, to foster the further integration of the EU securities markets. Asyou can read in the newspapers on an almost daily basis, consolidation of the securities industry givesrise to a host of challenging questions. In the legal field, it will be particularly interesting to see wherethe Lamfalussy Group will recommend legislative action and where it will consider self-regulation bythe securities industry to be an appropriate way forward.The ECB welcomes such initiatives to take full advantage of the introduction of the euro.Generally, the opportunities created by the euro in combination with technical developments such ase-banking and e-commerce will continue to change the landscape of the financial markets inside andoutside the EU and create an incentive for further legal convergence.Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, as an economist I am happy to see that the introduction of the eurohas acted as a catalyst for legal convergence inside and outside the EU, since legal convergencecontributes to the smooth and efficient functioning of financial markets. I acknowledge, on the onehand, that national differences, based on cultural diversity, will continue to exist. However, there is nodoubt in my mind that the introduction of the euro, the development of new technologies and natural
5BIS Review 77/2000tendencies in market behaviour will continue to be important incentives for further legal convergence.In my view, the IBA is an excellent forum to contribute to the establishment of the appropriate legalstructures, and I welcome the attention which several IBA Committees pay to this topic. To end with ametaphor on the waterworks for which your host country is so well-known: water will find its waynaturally through paths with the fewest obstacles, but man-made dykes may channel this to the benefitof mankind.
1BIS Review 76/2000Andrew Crockett: Marrying the micro- and macro-prudentialdimensions of financial stabilityRemarks by Mr Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements andChairman of the Financial Stability Forum, before the Eleventh International Conference of BankingSupervisors, held in Basel, 20-21 September 2000.*      *      *This biennial event, which on this occasion the BIS has the honour of co-hosting, bears witness to theremarkable progress made by the supervisory profession over the last quarter of a century. Unforeseenby most, except perhaps the visionary, the failure in 1974 of a little-known medium-sized bank,Bankhaus Herstatt, was to mark the beginning of a long journey in the field of internationalco-operation among banking supervisory authorities. The Basel Concordat, the original CapitalAccord and the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision are but a few of the landmarks thathave set an example for regulators in the rest of the financial sector.From its early beginnings in the Basel Committee, this process has progressively extended itsgeographical and institutional scope, embracing an increasing number of banking supervisors aroundthe globe and, slowly but surely, involving securities and insurance supervisors as well. More recently,reflecting the growing prominence of financial stability objectives in the international policy agenda,banking regulation and supervision have become a core component of the reform of what has beensomewhat grandiosely called the “international financial architecture”.And yet, impressive as the road travelled is, the journey has probably just begun. The task ofaddressing financial instability is far from over. It is widely recognised that further progress is calledfor in the design and implementation of policies. The current efforts to revise the Capital Accord so asto heighten its sensitivity to risk and those to strengthen the geographical reach in implementing theCore Principles are vivid illustrations of this awareness. Moreover, the goalposts never stay still.Where will the journey take us? In sketching the challenges ahead in the 21st century, as befits today’stheme, I would like to share with you some personal reflections on a possible future direction. I shallargue that in order to build most productively on past achievements in the pursuit of financial stability,we should strive for a better marriage between the micro-prudential and macro-prudential dimensionsof the task. We should, in other words, consolidate a shift in perspective that is already taking place,complementing the micro-prudential perspective with increased awareness of, and attention to, themacro-prudential facet.Banking supervisors have a key role to play in this endeavour, and, indeed, have already taken anactive part in its early stages. But other authorities are inevitably involved. Consolidating the shiftimplies a greater consensus on diagnosis, remedies and allocation of responsibilities than exists atpresent. My remarks are intended simply as a small contribution to the building of that consensus. Thechanges in regulatory perspective I will discuss parallel to those in the evolution of economic thinkingin the 20th century, which saw the emergence of macroeconomics as a separate discipline and,subsequently, a movement towards a longer-term horizon in policy making.In what follows, I will first try and be very precise in defining the micro- and macro-prudentialdimensions of financial stability, terms which are increasingly used but have eluded a clearcategorisation. I will then elaborate on the reasons why a further shift is in my view justified in thelight of the nature and costs of financial instability. After tracing the implications for regulatory andsupervisory policy, I will conclude by identifying broader policy co-ordination issues. You will excuseme if I am deliberately provocative, in the interest of sharpening the issues and encouraging a broaderdebate.
BIS Review 76/20002I.The micro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stabilityPromising discussions are often derailed by lack of precision in the definition of terms, wheninterlocutors think they share the same understanding but, in fact, do not. Arguably, the debate on themicro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stability is one such example.For the sake of clarity, therefore, I will put forward two intentionally stylised definitions of the termsso as to highlight their differences. As I will portray them, they sketch the extremes of a conceptualspectrum along which the perspectives of supervisors and other authorities can then be located. Whileit is common to associate supervisors with the micro-prudential dimension, it will become apparentthat, according to my definition, supervisory perspectives inevitably include elements of both, and thatthe macro-prudential element has been gaining ground in their thinking in recent years. Indeed, themix differs within the supervisory profession and may even vary with the context of the discussion.The distinction between the micro- and macro-prudential dimensions of financial stability is bestdrawn in terms of the objective of the tasks and of the conception of the mechanisms influencingeconomic outcomes. It has less to do with the instruments used in the pursuit of those objectives. Letme elaborate.The macro-prudential objective can be defined as limiting the costs to the economy from financialdistress, including those that arise from any moral hazard induced by the policies pursued. One couldthink of this objective as limiting the likelihood of the failure, and corresponding costs, of significantportions of the financial system. This is often loosely referred to as limiting “systemic risk”.In contrast, the micro-prudential objective can be seen as limiting the likelihood of failure ofindividual institutions. Again, loosely put, this means limiting “idiosyncratic risk”. So defined, thisobjective is in turn probably best rationalised as a means of protecting depositors.An obvious implication is that the macro-prudential dimension focuses on the risk of correlatedfailures, pays great attention to those characteristics of an institution, such as size, that determine itssignificance for the economy, and regards peer-group analysis as less relevant, or potentiallymisleading, unless tied to an institution’s systemic role. After all, deviations from average behaviourassume that the average is correct. The micro-prudential dimension, by contrast, considers eachinstitution in its own right, is thus not concerned with correlations per se and views peer-groupanalysis as a natural monitoring tool.To bring out the contrast, think of the financial system as a portfolio of securities, ie the individualinstitutions. The macro-prudential perspective would focus on the overall performance of theportfolio; the micro-prudential vision would give equal and separate weight to the performance ofeach of its constituent securities.Compare, for instance, the solvency standard that might be appropriate from a macro-prudentialperspective with that which would be consistent with the micro-prudential objective I have sketched.By solvency standard I mean, for simplicity, a target probability of insolvency.First, the macro-prudential solvency standard for individual institutions would be calibrated withreference to their systemic significance; its micro-prudential counterpart would be uniform for all.Second, the macro-prudential standard for the system as a whole would be derived from a top-downapproach, based on a view of the likelihood and costs of a systemic crisis. This, in turn, wouldinevitably imply a judgement about the possible correlation of financial difficulties among institutions.The corresponding micro-prudential standard would be derived from a bottom-up approach, from theaggregation of the uniform solvency standard that would apply to a “representative” institution.As a corollary, the acceptable probability of a systemic crisis implicit in a macro-prudential standardwould be lower than the acceptable probability of distress for any individual institution, because of thehigher costs in terms of output. On the other hand, the overall level of capital in the system could beeither higher or lower, depending on the size of the institutions and the correlation of exposures, whichdetermine the effective degree of diversification in the system.
3BIS Review 76/2000In terms of conceptions of the functioning of the economy, the macro-prudential dimension can bedefined as viewing system outcomes as critically determined by the collective behaviour of individualinstitutions; in economic jargon, as “endogenous”. Correspondingly, the micro-prudential dimensioncan be seen as regarding those outcomes as “exogenous” or given to the individual firms. As acorollary, so defined it also disregards any feedback of collective actions on the condition ofindividual institutions.It follows that the macro-prudential paradigm stresses the possibility that actions that may seemdesirable or reasonable from the perspective of individual institutions may result in unwelcome systemoutcomes. This is a logical contradiction in the micro-prudential vision as defined here.Illustrations of such fallacies of composition are not hard to find. For instance, for a single bank it isonly natural to tighten lending standards in a recession, but if all banks do the same the resultingimpact on economic activity can lead to a further deterioration in the credit quality of its portfolio. Themirror image during the upswing could generate an unsustainable lending boom, sowing the seeds ofsubsequent financial instability. Likewise, cutting exposures as market prices fall can deepen thedecline in those prices, leading to a drying up of liquidity and exacerbating financial distress. Andsimilar mechanisms explain why the aggregation of short-maturity credits on a single counterpartymight actually increase the risk profile of the individual exposures compared with portfolios with alonger maturity.The quintessential micro-prudential dictum is that “financial stability is ensured as long as each andevery institution is sound”. From a macro-prudential perspective, two objections can be levied againstthis, on the surface, compelling statement. First, it may strive for too much; second, it may deliver toolittle.It may strive for too much, because the occasional failure of individual institutions is not the problem.Trying to avoid such outcomes risks providing excessive protection, with the result that marketdisciplinary and allocative mechanisms are weakened.The statement may deliver too little, because while at one level it is a truism, how the soundness ofeach individual institution is pursued is crucial. Unless the authorities take into account the impact ofthe collective behaviour of institutions on economic outcomes, they may fail to monitor risks and takeremedial action appropriately.Where does the perspective of supervisors fit along this intentionally stylised micro-/macro-prudentialspectrum? In principle, it could be located anywhere. In practice, I suspect that the micro-prudentialelements still predominate.To be sure, an increasing number of supervisors would feel quite comfortable with being associatedwith the task of limiting systemic risk. Certainly, references to the systemic costs of failures in therationalisation of policies are common. And, as I will argue later, the macro-prudential facet of thesupervisors’ task has indeed been receiving greater attention in recent years, especially in themonitoring of potential vulnerabilities in the financial system and in the calibration of the supervisoryreview process to the nature of institutions.Nevertheless, the use of the instruments at their disposal and the conception of the mechanismsunderlying economic outcomes arguably reveal a greater degree of comfort with the micro-prudentialperspective. For given risks, minimum capital standards do not differentiate among banks according totheir significance for the economy. And a supervisor would hardly recommend not to tighten lendingstandards at an individual bank for fear that the end-result at system level would be a furtherdeterioration in the credit quality of portfolios.Most likely, the comparatively greater micro-prudential focus of supervisors reflects in no smallmeasure depositor (“consumer”) protection objectives. Indeed, it is common for this objective to beenshrined in their statutes. In addition, it may result in part from an understandable tendency to maptools, which necessarily operate on individual institutions, into goals. But, as I shall argue shortly,neither of these two conclusions is inevitable. Consumer protection objectives could be pursuedthrough other means and even by other authorities, while supervisory tools can also be orientedtowards macro-prudential objectives.
BIS Review 76/20004II.The costs and nature of financial instabilityStrengthening the macro-prudential orientation of the regulatory and supervisory framework isimportant because of the costs and nature of financial instability. The main costs take the form ofoutput losses. The nature of the processes generating instability puts a premium on a macro-prudentialconception of economic behaviour. Let me expand briefly on each of these points.We care about financial instability because it is wasteful. The asset price misalignments that typicallyprecede and accompany financial instability can profoundly affect consumption and investmentdecisions, misallocating resources across sectors and over time. Distress in financial institutions andmarkets severely impairs the channelling of funds from savers to ultimate users and can destroy thecapacity of the financial sector to generate credit. The resulting impact on economic activity can besevere and long lasting, and undermine the effectiveness of traditional macroeconomic policy toolssuch as monetary and fiscal levers.The direct costs of banking crises are high: above 10% of GDP in more than a dozen cases in the past15 years, according to IMF estimates. The indirect costs, including the impact on economic activityover time, would obviously be higher. The recent experience in Japan bears witness to the power ofthe forces at work, capable of hobbling even the largest and most mature industrial countries.In a narrow sense, depositors may have been paid back. But, wearing a different hat, they hardlyescaped the much more insidious and higher price tag of financial distress.A macro-prudential conception of economic processes is essential to understand the nature of financialinstability, and hence to monitor and address it. Of course, the episodes of financial distress that implysignificant costs to society can result from the knock-on effects of the failure of a single institution duepurely to firm-specific factors. However, more often than not, they arise from the exposure of groupsof institutions to common risk factors. In turn, these common factors may sometimes be exogenous tofinancial processes (eg, a sudden supply-induced change in the price of oil). But they are typically theconsequence of endogenous forces within the financial system that tend to amplify the economiccycle.A review of the instances of financial instability would reveal some shared stylised elements. There isfirst an over-extension phase during which financial imbalances build up, accompanied by benigneconomic conditions. In this phase, asset prices are buoyant and their surge tends to feed, and be fedby, rapid credit expansion, domestically or internationally. Leverage, in overt or hidden forms,accumulates in balance sheets, masked in part by the favourable asset price developments. The triggerfor a reversal is essentially unpredictable. It can originate either in the financial sphere (eg, an assetprice correction) or in the real economy (eg a spontaneous unwinding of an investment boom). Theprocess then moves into reverse. Ex post, a financial cycle is evident.Behind this recurrent pattern are serious difficulties in measuring underlying risk, and a structure ofincentives that hinders an appropriate behavioural response to changes in risk, even when these arecorrectly identified. Indicators of risk tend to be at their lowest at or close to the peak of the financialcycle, ie just at the point where, with hindsight, we can see that risk was greatest. Asset prices arebuoyant, credit spreads are narrow and loan loss provisions low.The tension between the micro- and macro-prudential perspectives is obvious both with respect to themeasurement of risk and the behavioural response to it.As regards measurement, economic agents and markets appear reasonably good at assessing therelative risk of instruments, debtors and counterparties. They seem to find it considerably harder toevaluate the absolute, undiversifiable risk associated with the financial cycle. This requires a moresophisticated understanding of correlations and their evolution through time. In turn, a properevaluation of the robustness of any historical relationship can only be based on some theory about theforces driving the economy and the interaction between the financial and real sectors. And such atheory would need to recognise the impact of the collective behaviour of institutions on financialdistress.
5BIS Review 76/2000The contrast between this perspective and current methodologies for assessing market and credit riskis striking. Typically, current approaches are based on some form of short-term extrapolation or, atbest, time-invariant historical averages. Consider, for instance, the mechanical inputs used incalculating VaR for market risk. At bottom, approaches to measuring credit risk are not very different.This view has important implications for how we think of risk evolving through time. The receivedwisdom is that risk increases in recessions and falls in booms. In contrast, it may be more helpful tothink of risk as increasing during upswings, as financial imbalances build up, and materialising inrecessions. The length of the horizon here is crucial. I will return to this point in a moment.As regards behavioural responses, incentive structures in financial markets can compound theproblems arising from difficulties in measuring risk. Diversified shareholders with comparatively shortinvestment horizons can demand overly ambitious returns. Competitive pressures encourage risktaking. The typical features of contracts and remuneration schedules for traders and money managerscan have a similar effect. The same is true of “herd instinct”, namely the tendency to conformbehaviour to the norm, or to the presumed better informed, for fear of being left behind and in thehope of limiting blame in the event of failure. And perceptions of official “safety nets” can play asimilar role.In different ways and to varying degrees, all of these forms of behaviour share a commoncharacteristic: they may seem reasonable, even compelling, when considered in isolation, but they canresult in undesirable outcomes once the system-wide impact of collective action is taken into account.III.Implications for regulatory and supervisory policyA strengthening of the macro-prudential orientation in the regulatory and supervisory frameworkwould have implications for the relative weight assigned to different objectives, for the treatment ofdifferent institutions at a point in time, and for the assessment and mitigation of risk over time.Consider each of these in turn.In terms of objectives, a strengthening of the macro-prudential orientation would call for a furtherbroadening of focus away from narrow depositor protection and towards systemic concerns. Its mainbenefit would be to permit a better balance between official intervention and market discipline. In turn,this could be conducive to sounder individual institutions too. At least in the public’s eye, the failureof individual institutions tends to be identified with the failure of supervisors to perform their duties.This considerably complicates their task, encouraging forbearance rather than orderly exit.Implementing the shift requires that specific means be in place to protect depositors in the event offailure, relieving public pressure to forbear and adding to the credibility of the exit threat. Targeteddeposit insurance schemes can play a useful role in this context.In terms of the treatment of different institutions at a point in time, the shift in focus would imply thecalibration of regulatory and supervisory arrangements to the institutions’ systemic significance.Higher costs of failure for the system call for a higher degree of comfort in the soundness of theinstitutions that generate them. The greater difficulties in ensuring ex post their orderly exit furthersupports this view.One way of implementing a calibrated approach would be through the supervisory review process. Infact, in several supervisory jurisdictions the authorities are already paying particular attention to thelarger and more complex institutions, a step consistent with the shift suggested here. The plannedstrengthening of Pillar II can be a powerful instrument in this connection. A second, no doubt morecomplicated and controversial, possibility would be to consider extending the calibration to regulatorycapital and other tools as well. Obvious concerns about level playing fields would need to beaddressed in the process.In terms of the measurement and mitigation of risk over time, the key challenge is to take betteraccount of the financial cycle that underlies financial instability. If risk increases in upswings andmaterialises in recessions, it stands to reason that defences should be built up in upswings so as to berelied upon when the rough times arrive. This would strengthen institutions’ ability to weather
BIS Review 76/20006deteriorating economic conditions, when access to external financing becomes more costly andconstrained. Moreover, by leaning against the wind, it could reduce the amplitude of the financialcycle, thereby limiting the risk of financial distress in the first place.The reasoning is very familiar to macro-economists. It underlies, for instance, the operation of built-infiscal stabilisers: tax revenue automatically rises as income increases and falls as income declines,dampening expenditures in booms and encouraging them in recessions. But it can equally apply tofinancial stability objectives, whether couched in terms of individual institutions or the system as awhole.A crucial element of this perspective is the length of the horizon over which risk is measured andmanaged. The horizon is clearly longer than one year, a common yardstick for current bankingpractices in the area of credit risk, in line with the calendar rhythm for accounts and taxes.Conceptually, it should span whatever time is needed for a cycle to unfold. And because the timing ofdownswings is exceedingly hard to predict, the approach implies a focus on measuring thevulnerabilities that build up in the upswing and on the more recurrent features of cycles. We may notknow exactly when the rainy day will come, but we can be pretty sure that it will. It is not wise todecide on policies or business strategies on the assumption that it will not, or that we can predict itstiming with sufficient foresight.Translating the basic logic of the argument into a set of practical arrangements raises a host of difficultissues. What instruments could be employed? The range is potentially quite large, includingprovisioning rules, regulatory capital, loan-to-value ratios and, more generally, other tools that caninfluence risk and pricing practices through the supervisory review process or, perhaps, disclosurestandards. On what basis would those tools be adjusted? Issues such as the relevant aspects of thefinancial cycle to focus upon, the role of stress testing and the balance between rules and discretioncome to mind here. More generally, any specific proposal would need to be assessed on its ownmerits, including an evaluation of any unintended side effects, such as its impact on regulatoryarbitrage and competitive conditions.These issues, however, are no different from those that pertain to any modification in regulatory andsupervisory arrangements. In fact, in some supervisory jurisdictions changes in provisioning practicesmore in line with the logic outlined here either have been implemented or are being given seriousconsideration. Likewise, the increasing use of stress testing and current efforts devoted to thedevelopment of macro-prudential indicators are conceptually consistent with the same approach. Agreater awareness of the significance of the questions raised here is gradually emerging.IV.Policy co-ordinationA strengthening of the macro-prudential orientation of the regulatory and supervisory frameworkwould also highlight a number of policy co-ordination issues. As the previous analysis makes clear,and supervisors are well aware, addressing financial stability is a multifaceted task. It involves anumber of authorities with different perspectives and responsibilities. Indeed, some of the policylevers lie in the hands of authorities whose main task is not to address financial stability at all, eventhough their tools and decisions can have a significant impact on the process. The risk is that, in theabsence of a consensus on diagnosis, remedies and allocation of responsibilities, certain potentialweaknesses in our defences might remain unaddressed. Let me elaborate on these points with twoillustrations: safety nets and the financial cycle.I mentioned earlier that one potential source of distorted incentives for market participants are ill-designed safety nets, defined here to encompass those mechanisms aimed at containing the disruptiveconsequences of financial distress once it arises, thereby also instilling confidence in the financialsystem. Typical building blocks of safety nets include emergency liquidity assistance, depositprotection schemes and exit policies. As highlighted by experience over the last twenty years or so, ill-designed safety nets can be a significant cause of financial instability if they fail adequately tocounteract the loss of market discipline that they induce (the “moral hazard” problem).
7BIS Review 76/2000A macro-prudential orientation in financial stability policies requires safety nets whose structure andfunctioning address systemic risk. The role of targeted deposit insurance schemes in permittingsupervisors credibly to focus on systemic risks is just one example; all aspects of exit strategies andassistance to institutions in distress play a part. Given the close interrelationship between the variouscomponents of a safety net, agreement is necessary on the basic objectives, characteristics andoperation of its building blocks among a broad spectrum of official authorities. At a minimum, thiswould include supervisors, central banks and ministries of finance. Those countries experiencingwidespread financial difficulties have typically followed this approach under pressure from events.Ideally, a more far-sighted decision making process would be desirable.Likewise, most of the steps needed to address the risks associated with the financial cycle wouldrequire a dialogue with, and often the approval of, authorities with different perspectives. Changingprovisioning practices, for instance, can raise eyebrows with tax authorities, the accounting professionand even securities regulators. More generally, discretion to alter valuation methods is generally not inthe hands of supervisors. And a potentially powerful instrument to influence the financial cycle,interest rates, is controlled by central bankers. After all, credit expansion is the life-blood of the buildup of financial imbalances.ConclusionTo conclude, supervisors and other authorities are still facing major challenges in coming to grips withfinancial instability. To my mind, part of the solution to our shared concerns is a strengthening of themacro-prudential orientation in supervisory and regulatory arrangements. But that shift will need to besupported and complemented by consistent policies on the part of other authorities as well. We need tobuild a clearer consensus on diagnosis, remedies and allocation of responsibilities.In some respects, the proposed shift in perspective parallels the evolution of economics thinking in the20th century. Economists, too, had initially developed a view of the world in which the processesdriving the economy as a whole were simply a replication of those in individual markets, as if thesame image was blown up in scale. It was only in the 1930s, not least due to the writings of Keynes,that they clearly understood that the laws for the economy as a whole did not necessarily coincide withthose for its individual components. Macroeconomics was born as a discipline in its own right, and hassurvived until the present day. It took a major world depression, in which incidentally financial crisesplayed a prominent role, to spur that kind of thinking.Likewise, after the failure of overly ambitious policies in the 1960s and 1970s, aimed at controllingshort-term movements in output, we learnt the value of long-term horizons in policy making.Excessive focus on forecasts in economic variables over short horizons can, and often do, lead theirusers astray. We are simply not very good at forecasting the timing of peaks and troughs and have toolittle knowledge about the time pattern of the influence of our instruments on economic activity.Intended stabilisation may result in unintended destabilisation.While the context and details are different, the basic lessons of this evolution in economic thinking canbe of help to those whose task is to measure and manage risk. This includes not just official agenciesbut, crucially, market participants themselves, as the regulatory framework is gearing itself to relyincreasingly on their own risk assessments. After all, anchors are no better than the soil in which theyare planted. And that soil could, at worst, turn out to be quicksand, if it consists of inadequate riskperceptions and inflated asset values.My remarks today are intended simply as a small awareness-raising step in what, if pursued, is likelyto be a long road. In making them, I am encouraged by the fact that the proposed shift is by no meansa new departure. Rather, it represents a strengthening of a process that has already begun. I also drawcomfort from the remarkable achievements of supervisors over the last quarter of a century. I havelittle doubt that you will be building on those successes in the future with the same energy anddetermination with which you tackled the initial challenges. In doing so, you have provided anexcellent example to the rest of the official community.
1BIS Review 75/2000Kurt Hauri: Transnational commercial bribery and corruption:a challenge for the financial industry, regulators and supervisorsRemarks by Mr Kurt Hauri, Chairman of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, before the EleventhInternational Conference of Banking Supervisors, held in Basel, 20-21 September 2000.*      *      *General remarksDear colleaguesIt is a great honor for the Swiss Federal Banking Commission and for myself as its chairman to co-host the ICBS in Switzerland and to welcome such a great number of distinguished experts in the fieldof banking supervision. I know that already 6 heavily digestible topics are on the agenda of thisworkshop day. Therefore, it is not without a certain degree of unease that I am going to addressanother rather delicate issue instead of just making some easygoing hints about the beautiful Swissnature scenery or jokes about our common job as supervisors and regulators. I am afraid the followingremarks will not deliver this, they will not be humorous but at least, I hope, they will be within thetime limit given to me.The Swiss Federal Banking Commission was founded 65 years ago as an answer to Switzerland andits banks suffering from a deep economic crisis. Since that time it has been the task of the SwissFederal Banking Commission to prevent bank failures and, thereby, to avoid distress of banks’creditors and the Swiss economy as a whole. However, since the beginning of the 1980s an additionaltarget came into the focus of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission adding another dimension to thetraditional goal of protecting the public from financial losses and to prevent systemic risk. Since thattime the Commission has regularly been addressing the issue of preventing the financial industry frombeing abused for criminal purposes.During this period a proliferation of international minimum standards for ethical behavior of all kindhas occurred. Many different international for a have been involved and the standards are coveringvarious and sometimes overlapping areas. But if one looks at all these initiatives from a little distance,a common driving idea can be identified: the financial industry (as other industries as well) has torespect increasingly higher standards for ethical behavior, and more and more banks have to assumeresponsibility not only for their own correct business conduct, but also for that of their customers.There has been a significant regulatory trend towards higher ethical standards and – at least this is myassessment – this trend will persist in the 21st century. From this background I would like to addressone particular aspect of unethical or even illegal behavior, namely the misuse of internationalfinancial centers in transnational commercial bribery and corruption. By using the term“transnational commercial bribery and corruption” I intend to show that the focus is not “pettycorruption” meaning small cash payments to subordinate government officials. Our concern is “grandcorruption” involving substantial international money flows being wire-transferred across allinternational financial centers.Key steps in the Swiss supervisory practiceBefore I do what this public coming from all over the world is expecting me to do, that is to addressthe topic with a more international view, please let me summarize a few key steps that the SwissFederal Banking Commission has taken in developing the present supervisory framework in this field:• During the 1980’s the Swiss Federal Banking Commission started to oversee more closelythe implementation of the banking industry’s self regulatory rules on customer identification,including the duty to know the identity of beneficial owners hiding behind straw-men or off-shore domicile companies with no commercial activity.
BIS Review 75/20002• During the same time, standards were developed on a case-by-case-basis requiring thefinancial institutions to pay special attention to all complex or unusual transactions with noapparent economic or visible lawful purpose.• In 1985, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court upheld a decision of the Federal BankingCommission formally prohibiting a back-to-back loan with the only purpose to deceive aforeign authority.• In 1991, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission devised rules requiring the supervisedinstitutions to establish the names of beneficial owners represented by financial lawyers.• In 1987, following the decision of the Swiss government and the Banking Commission tofreeze the assets of the Marcos Clan in spring 1986, the Swiss Federal Banking Commissiondeveloped a practice requiring that the decision to enter into a business relationship withhigh-ranking public officials, such as heads of states or members of a government, be takenon the financial institution’s highest management level.• In 1993, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission declared that it would no longer considerthe management of a supervised institution to be “fit and proper” if the institution acceptedcorruption proceeds for deposit.• In 1998, the preceding two measures were codified in the Banking Commission’s guidelinesagainst money-laundering.• In 1998, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission issued an industry ban against the chairmanof the board and a director of a supervised institution on the ground that they had acceptedroughly 300 Mio Deutschmark to be paid as commission (“provision”) on an accountbelonging to the son of the former President of Nigeria Abacha.• Finally, in September 2000, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission published the results ofan investigation at 19 banks being involved in accepting in total about 600 Mio US Dollarson behalf of the entourage of Nigeria’s former president Abacha. All funds had beenreported by the banks to the Swiss money laundering reporting office and frozen by Swisslaw enforcement authorities. The Swiss Federal Banking Commission publicly blamed 6banks for not handling the customer relationship with the necessary diligence. So far, it hasissued no industry bans since none of the responsible individuals are any longer beingemployed at a senior level in the financial industry.• This year the Swiss Federal Banking Commission will be further amending its guidelinesagainst money laundering to take into account the lessons drawn from the Abacha-case aswell as recent legislative changes, which declare bribery of domestic or foreign officials apredicate offense for money laundering in Switzerland.The result of this long way is a policy of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission which could besummarized in five points:1. Whenever a supervised institution is not observing anti-money laundering provisions,including “know your customer rules”, prohibitions of the acceptance of corruption proceedsor rules on persons with public functions, this is clearly a supervisory issue that is nottolerated by the supervisor.2. Every single case of a serious offense against an important rule is investigated independentlyand as quickly as possible by the supervisor, even if other law enforcement agencies areinvestigating at the same time.3. All persons responsible for breach of rules or for organizational failures at management levelrisk an industry ban issued by the supervisor.4. The supervised institutions have to address deficiencies in systems and controls with regardto legal and compliance efficiently, thoroughly and speedily and under tight supervisorycontrol.
3BIS Review 75/20005. Supervised institutions unwilling or unable to bring their compliance systems to asatisfactory standard take the risk of their license being withdrawn.International contextAs promised, let me come to the international context. As the Abacha-investigation of the SwissFederal Banking Commission clearly showed, very substantial amounts of money have been wire-transferred to and from Switzerland, from and to banks in various respectable financial centers. As analways increasing number of financial institutions are acting globally they become a global target forabuse. No doubt that this is a very demanding challenge for international banks, for internationalregulatory bodies as well as supervisors in all countries.International banks have to make sure that their compliance standards are on the highest levelworldwide. Otherwise they may not effectively monitor and manage their reputational, operational andlegal risks. The banks are well advised if they address in these compliance standards also the issue ofproceeds from corruption even though not all jurisdictions where the international bank is carrying outits business have identical, or even comparable, standards. To avoid regulatory arbitrage it would behighly desirable if the major international players in private banking could agree upon a common setof rules to be complied with on a worldwide basisInternational regulators become more and more aware that they cannot limit their focus on tracingand chasing proceeds of drug-trafficking. Over the last ten years the international regulatorycommunity has made considerable progress in developing instruments to reduce internationalcommercial corruption. The newly developed policies by the International Financial institutions, suchas the World Bank and the IMF, new recommendations, resolutions and conventions of internationalorganizations like the OECD, and the work done by private non governmental organizations likeTransparency International have put the issue of corruption on the political agendas of all relevantinternational bodies. Still, it seems to me that on a international level, there is a need to addressadequately various issues related to the abuse of the financial sector by corrupt politicians andgovernment officials. The “potentate risk” is truly global. One of the objectives would be aninternationally coordinated understanding that banks should not accept proceeds from corruption. Sofar, rules on how financial institutions should handle business relations with politically exposedpersons are lacking on the international level. “Know your customer” rules need to be harmonized toavoid regulatory arbitrage. Difficult questions would have to be addressed, for instance: should fundsstemming from corruption be frozen? Who should be entitled to request such freezes on aninternational level? Another question is whether and how and to whom these funds may be restituted.All this work is extremely difficult for legal, cultural and political reasons. In spite of these difficultiesI believe that this work should be undertaken and coordinated internationally.And although all these issues go far beyond our normal tasks as financial supervisors I believe that wewill probably be asked to contribute in this process. I am quite sure that financial supervisors will beasked to contribute in this field, which is at best loosely connected with our primary objectives. Thereis little hope that this won’t happen as supervisors are traditionally suffering from a "Christmas tree"effect, in which government offices are gradually divesting themselves by adding new decorative tasksto our already widespread functions.
1BIS Review 74/2000European Central Bank: Press Conference - introductory statementsIntroductory statements by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, andMr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Press Conference, held inFrankfurt, on 14 September 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today’s meetingsof the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB.The Governing Council of the ECB today conducted its regular examination of recent monetary andeconomic developments and their implications for the risks to future price stability in the euro area.Subsequently, it decided to keep the interest rates on the Eurosystem’s monetary policy instrumentsunchanged. Thus, the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem was leftat 4.50%, and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were kept at5.50% and 3.50%, respectively.Allow me to give you an overview of the main elements of our assessment of the latest information onmonetary, financial market and other economic developments.As regards the developments in the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of theECB, no new monetary data have become available since our decision taken on 31 August 2000 toraise the main ECB interest rates. After having increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter of2000, M3 growth has been showing some signs of moderation over recent months. This moderationhas mainly been a consequence of lower growth in the most liquid components of M3, which bearlittle or no remuneration, indicating that the monetary policy measures taken since November 1999 aregradually feeding their way through. At the same time, the average of annual M3 growth rates for theperiod from May to July 2000, at 5.5%, continued to deviate on the upside from the reference value of4½%. The pronounced expansion of credit to the private sector up to July also suggested thathouseholds and firms continued to regard financing conditions in the euro area as favourable. In thecontext of the robust expansion of economic activity, continued ample liquidity conditions wouldconstitute a risk to price stability.Turning to the second pillar, real GDP growth in the euro area, according to first estimates publishedby Eurostat today, reached 3¾% (on an annualised basis) in the first half of 2000. Currently availableforecasts predict that growth will remain above 3% next year. The strength of the euro area’seconomic expansion in the past few months is in line with these forecasts. In fact, recent indicatorssuggest that, following the period of acceleration, the economic expansion may now have settled at ahigh rate of growth. The overall level of confidence has remained at, or close to, record highs in recentmonths. Moreover, employment continued to grow strongly in the first half of this year and the rate ofcapacity utilisation has risen further. Taken together, these factors should underpin the growth ofprivate consumption and investment, and thus that of domestic demand.The positive outlook for the euro area is also supported by external developments. The outlook forgrowth of the world economy, and thus for growth of euro area exports, has remained favourable.Forecasts of world growth have consistently been revised upwards over the past few months.Expectations of a period of sustained economic growth in the euro area can also be found in euro areabond markets. Overall, longer-term bond yields in the euro area have shown a very high level ofstability in the course of this year, with fluctuations being contained within a relatively narrow range.The annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) was 2.4% inJuly 2000. Recent consumer price developments in the euro area have been very much influenced bythe strong rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro.
BIS Review 74/20002While monetary policy cannot address short-term developments in prices, it is imperative for monetarypolicy that medium-term upward pressure on prices be contained. The risk that the current pressure onthe HICP might spill over onto costs and prices determined in the domestic economy must be takenseriously. This holds true in particular in the context of the favourable prospects for economic growth.The Governing Council reacted to this picture by raising the main ECB interest rates at its meeting on31 August 2000. This step followed a series of interest rate increases implemented sinceNovember 1999. The Governing Council will continue to remain alert to emerging risks to pricestability.It is a matter of fact that recent oil price increases have caused the terms of trade of the euro area todeteriorate, and thus have also reduced real income. This loss of real income cannot be avoided for theeconomy as a whole. Attempts to shift the burden of this loss within the economy will riskendangering the continuation of a non-inflationary growth process.For the maintenance of price stability, it will be particularly important, in the current phase ofstrengthening economic growth, that wages continue, on average, to grow at rates compatible with theobjective of price stability. Any attempt for wages to catch up in reaction to recent oil price increaseswould be highly detrimental to the current favourable growth prospects, since monetary policy wouldneed to react to the resulting upward pressure on prices.Governments also have to play a role in order not to convey the false impression that the costsstemming from the increase in oil prices could be avoided by relaxing budgetary policies. This wouldnot be in line with the needs of establishing budget positions in balance or in surplus and wouldcomplicate the fostering of tax reforms conducive to a stronger growth potential of the euro area.I should also like to reiterate that the prospects for a stronger potential for growth in the euro area willdepend very much on progress made in enhancing the flexibility of labour and goods markets in theeuro area. Although reform efforts in several countries have been heading in the right direction, thereis still much to be done when looking at the area as a whole.Finally, let me also say a few words about recent exchange rate developments. I noted earlier that,from a monetary policy point of view, these developments are a cause for concern as they add to theupward pressure on consumer prices in the euro area.These concerns are compounded by the fact that the exchange rate of the euro does not appearappropriate when looking at economic fundamentals. As you are aware, we have been expressing thisconcern for some time. In the meantime, we have witnessed a considerable improvement in theeconomic growth prospects for the euro area. At the same time, owing to measures taken by theGoverning Council, the outlook for price stability in the medium term in the euro area has remainedintact. At present, inflation in the euro area is among the lowest in the world. The fact that the euro hascontinued to depreciate over recent months is not in line with these strong economic fundamentals inthe euro area. Recent global exchange rate developments are also not in line with international balanceof payments positions. Our concerns on this issue remain serious and we shall monitor developmentsclosely.Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to say a few words about other issues discussed bythe Governing Council.First, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has agreed on a TARGETreimbursement scheme for the benefit of TARGET participants in the event of malfunctioning inTARGET. The scheme will apply whenever the same-day processing of payment orders withinTARGET cannot be completed. The reimbursement scheme is intended to compensate participants forcertain higher costs they incur in having recourse to the standing facilities of the Eurosystem as aresult of a malfunctioning. In order to ensure a level playing field, the scheme also applies toparticipants in euro real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems of non-participating national centralbanks. The legal framework for this reimbursement scheme is reflected in an amended “TARGETGuideline” which, in line with the ECB’s policy of enhanced transparency, will be published in theOfficial Journal of the European Communities and made available on the ECB’s website shortly.
3BIS Review 74/2000Second, the Governing Council addressed issues relating to cross-border retail payment services,which are of particular interest for euro area consumers. You may recall that the ECB published areport on this subject a year ago, calling on the banking industry to improve the unsatisfactory servicelevel for cross-border credit transfers before January 2002. Today, on the basis of a Progress Report,we have reviewed the advances of the banking industry against the objectives set by the Eurosystemand we have identified the outstanding issues that need quickly to be addressed. A press release on thistopic will be issued later on today. The Progress Report will be available on the ECB’s websiteshortly.
1BIS Review 74/2000A H E M Wellink: Heterogeneity in Europe and the role of monetary policyOpening address by Dr A H E M Wellink, President of the Nederlandsche Bank, at theCEPR/European Summer Institute conference, held in Amsterdam, on 15 September 2000.*      *      *IntroductionIt is a pleasure to be here to give the opening address to this conference and to welcome you toAmsterdam. After only a couple of years, this annual conference has established a reputation forstimulating discussion on economic policy issues in Europe. This year’s programme looks set tofurther enhance your reputation.Issues of heterogeneity were the subject of much debate and analysis in the run-up to the introductionof the euro. The debate has continued since then, too, and this conference will no doubt provide freshinsights into the issue. Enlargement is also on the conference agenda. Obviously enlargement willhave implications for current EU members, as well as for accession countries. Further, there are linksbetween enlargement and heterogeneity.This afternoon I would like to talk a little about heterogeneity in the euro area, and its implications forpolicymakers. I would also like to look forward and discuss these issues in the context of EU andEMU enlargement.HeterogeneityFirst, some thoughts about heterogeneity. We are used to thinking about heterogeneity mainly in termsof nation states. We focus on differences between countries. Of course, it is not only when discussingeconomic policies that we think about national differences. We also highlight differences in otherareas – the Netherlands was a mass of colour from supporters of different countries earlier thissummer during the European soccer championships. And, the Sydney Olympics provide anopportunity to celebrate national achievement, as well as individual sporting excellence.Traditionally, monetary policy has also been conducted on a national basis, although Europeanmonetary policy did become more coordinated in the run-up to the introduction of the euro. Othereconomic policies have generally continued to be set on a national basis, although EU membershipdoes impose some degree of consistency. Heterogeneity also occurs on other dimensions, such asbetween sectors of the economy. I will return to that point in a minute, but first want to make a coupleof comments about country differences.There have been many studies in recent years focussing on differences between euro area countries.And, while a few studies find evidence to the contrary, there appears to be a general consensus thatbusiness cycles have converged to some extent over the past decade or two. As a central banker, I amnaturally interested in inflation differentials, and these are certainly lower now than they were10 or 20 years ago. For example, inflation rates among current euro area members ranged from 21% inItaly to 5% in Germany in the last quarter of 1980. By the second quarter of this year the range wasonly 3½ percentage points.Naturally, divergences do remain, and these reflect a number of factors. Some divergence is due to aprocess of convergence as countries catch up to euro area averages, the well-knownBalassa-Samuelson effect. This effect explains how productivity growth during a catch-up process canresult in higher inflation without undermining competitiveness. Country-specific policies, includingfiscal policy and regulation, also result in divergences. Finally, countries have different industrial orsectoral concentrations. Differences in the economic performance of various sectors will therefore bereflected in cross-country divergences.
BIS Review 74/20002These factors are not going to disappear immediately, but may diminish as price and income levelsconverge and through continued deepening of the internal market. However, we cannot be sure howrapidly they will diminish, nor can we be certain what level of divergence will be normal in the longrun. In addition, the process of convergence will not necessarily be continuous. For example, inflationdifferentials have widened a little over the last year or two, although they remain much smaller thanthey were a decade ago.For small areas within a monetary union, a common monetary policy does have some specificimplications. Small countries have little influence on the euro area inflation rate, which is a weightedaverage of national inflation rates. If inflation rates in those small countries diverge from the euro areaaverage, that has relatively little impact on the overall monetary policy stance for the euro area.Consequently, it is possible for smaller countries to temporarily have growth rates and inflation ratesthat differ from those that would result from a national monetary policy aimed at maintaining pricestability at the country level. Large countries could also be in this position. If inflation is well abovethe euro area average in one country, but below it in another, monetary policy may not contribute tonarrowing the divergences. Where such divergences are not the result of catching-up processes,national economic cycles could potentially become more pronounced. Some euro area countries arearguably in this position now, or heading towards it. The Netherlands is one of those countries. Ofcourse, such a deviation can also occur in the other direction, with inflation and output growth ratesremaining lower for longer than would occur with a national monetary policy. This can lead tolong-lasting social and economic costs if there are factors inhibiting a smooth adjustment process. Iwill return to this issue shortly.As I mentioned earlier, heterogeneity occurs across several dimensions. In addition to countrydifferences, there are also differences in economic performance between sectors in the economy. Asthe internal market continues to deepen, there may be fewer regulatory differences between countriesand the Stability and Growth Pact constrains national fiscal policy. It seems likely that cross-countrydivergences will increasingly reflect exposures that countries have to various sectors. Thinking aboutheterogeneity at a sectoral level might therefore be more insightful for the euro area than focussingsolely on cross-country comparisons.Consider trends in inflation. The Eurosystem has defined price stability as a positive inflation ratebelow 2% over the medium term. The definition recognises the fact that at times inflation maytemporarily move outside that target range. That is currently occurring as a result of higher oil prices -which are a kind of sectoral shock. The weak exchange rate is also contributing to higher prices. Themost recent HICP inflation rate shows that euro area consumer prices increased by 2.4% in the year toJuly. Almost half of that increase is due to higher energy prices. Naturally, cross-country inflationdifferences remain, and are relevant. However, these cross-country differences are themselves affectedby higher oil prices, reflecting the fact that energy intensity and energy taxation vary betweencountries. In the current circumstances, analysing relative price trends can help in assessing whetherinflation is confined to specific sectors, or whether it is leading to more generalised inflation.Implications for policySo we have heterogeneity across several dimensions. What does that mean for policy, and why shouldpolicy makers be concerned about divergences? Let me focus on price divergences. In a marketeconomy, relative prices play an important role. And, relative prices include not only the prices ofdifferent goods and services within a country, but also the prices of the same goods and services indifferent countries. These relative price changes provide the signals to ensure that changes inpreferences or technology flow through to changes in resource allocation. In theory, therefore, relativeprice movements are welfare enhancing and not something that we should be concerned about. Inpractice, the world is not so simple and markets are not perfectly competitive. Relative pricemovements do not always occur freely, and adjustments to changes in preferences or technology canbe costly.Monetary policy cannot and should not influence relative prices within the euro area to offsetdivergences between sectors or countries. Those relative prices are determined by real factors. Instead,
3BIS Review 74/2000the best contribution that monetary policy can make to society’s welfare is to stabilise the general euroarea price level. That reduces the noise in relative price changes, and therefore improves the workingsof the price mechanism.Nonetheless, central bankers do monitor divergences. Why do we monitor divergences if there isnothing we can do about them? First, our knowledge of the monetary transmission mechanism isincomplete. Information about the various parts of the economy, including divergences, adds to ourknowledge of the economy as a whole. We are particularly conscious of this in the euro area where weare still in the process of developing and enhancing indicators for the euro area as a whole. The secondreason for our interest is that regional or sectoral differences in economic performance can provideearly signals of area-wide developments, as US experience has shown.If monetary policy cannot and should not react to divergences, what about other policy areas? As Imentioned earlier, allowing relative price changes to occur is often the best approach, so that resourcesare allocated to their most effective uses. Accordingly, structural reforms that allow the relative pricemechanism to operate are generally sensible. And, hearing central bankers call for structural reforms isnothing new! My colleagues and I on the ECB Governing Council have been regularly calling forfurther structural reform. For example, labour market reform that stimulates the movement of labouraround the euro area is likely to reduce euro area unemployment overall, as well as reducing disparityin prices, wages and unemployment rates between regions. Central bankers in other countries makesimilar points.Another approach would be to use fiscal policy to try and dampen national divergences. However,given the planning and implementation lags, it is not easy to use fiscal policy in a counter-cyclicalmanner. In addition, the main objective of fiscal policy is not normally to reduce cross-country orcross-sector divergences. Even though fiscal policy is normally formulated within a multi-yearframework, elements of discretion remain. Any discretion should be used to reduce, rather thanincrease, cross-country divergences in inflation. Fiscal policy should also be in a sustainable positionso that automatic stabilisers can operate fully. At times it may even be appropriate for fiscal policy toseek to offset divergences. It is certainly the case that there is little to be gained from discretionarypro-cyclical policies. Rather, economic cycles could become more pronounced, resulting in costlyadjustment taking place in downturns.The point I made earlier about small countries is relevant here. Euro area monetary policy is notsignificantly influenced by the inflation rate of a small country. It is therefore important for smallcountries to have the flexibility in other policy areas to offset inflation. Of course, large countrieswould also gain if they undertook structural reform and avoided pro-cyclical fiscal policy. And therecould be times when it is appropriate for large countries to use national policies to offset divergences. Iwould merely make the point that the costs of not being flexible might be greater for small countries inthe event of a downturn.Monetary policy after enlargementI would also like to briefly discuss how these issues apply to enlargement. First, the points maderegarding small countries currently in the euro area apply with even greater force to accessioncountries. Given the relative size of accession countries, monetary policy for the enlarged euro areawill be little influenced by their inflation rates. Accession countries are in general less converged inreal terms than the initial EMU members were when monetary union began. This is true whenmeasured on the basis of GDP per capita, and when adjustments are made for differences inpurchasing power. Real convergence may therefore take a considerable period of time. Ongoingconvergence, EU membership, and eventually adoption of the euro, could all result in economicshocks that mean monetary policy requirements in an accession country differ from those in the euroarea as a whole. Given these factors, the extent of the difference in monetary policy requirementscould be greater or more protracted than is the case for small countries currently in EMU. To minimisethe economic and social impact of divergences, it is important that accession countries have flexibleeconomies, sound financial systems, a solid fiscal position, and a well-developed institutionalframework. Arguably, accession will therefore have greater consequences for countries now than was
BIS Review 74/20004the case previously, in the sense that they are less converged in real and institutional terms than initialEMU members. A cautious approach to the adoption of the euro therefore appears appropriate, aspremature adoption could prove costly.Second, monetary policy within the EMU will continue to focus on area-wide conditions. Obviously,that area will be larger following enlargement. One of the important issues for us will be to ensure thatthe indicators we use in our monetary policy deliberations are based on developments across theenlarged area. Our data requirements will expand accordingly. We will also need to learn how themonetary policy transmission mechanism works across the new area. I expect that the national centralbanks from the accession countries will have an important role to play here in helping us understandthe workings of the enlarged euro area.ConclusionDespite having given some warnings about the consequences of divergences, I would like to concludeon an optimistic note. Yes there are differences within the euro area. But the differences do not createproblems for euro area monetary policy. The overall gains from membership certainly outweigh thecosts. I am confident the same will apply for accession countries. What the divergences do teach us isthat other policies must play their part if we are to maximise the gains from a common monetarypolicy. That is particularly important for small countries.Thank you for your attention. I would like to repeat my welcome to you, and wish you well for theremainder of the conference. I am sure that it will be both stimulating and fruitful.
1BIS Review 73/2000Ian Macfarlane: Recent major developments in the Australian economyTalk by Mr Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the World EconomicForum Asia Pacific Economic Summit Melbourne, on 11 September 2000.*      *      *It is a pleasure to be speaking before the World Economic Forum again. I have done so before in HongKong and Singapore, and I am proud that I can now add Melbourne to the list. It is also very pleasingthat the Forum has successfully expanded beyond its Davos base, and made the Asia Pacific region animportant part of its operations.In the short time I have available tonight, I would like to outline some of the major developments inthe Australian economy over recent years, and then say a few words about the outlook. Wherepossible, I will compare our performance to that of other countries. Inevitably, I will make a numberof comparisons with the United States as it is the yardstick by which everyone’s performance seems tobe judged these days.I will take as my starting point a comparison of economic growth rates of developed countries over themost recent decade (Column 1 of Table 1). These figures from the OECD show that except for Ireland,which is a very special case, the Australian growth rate has been higher than for any comparableOECD country. For me, the interesting thing about this table is that this is the first decade in myworking life where Australia has figured in the top half of the table, let alone being virtually in the topposition.Incidentally, these figures cover the whole decade and so include a recession for each country, usuallyin the early part of the decade. This holds the average growth rates down. Another approach would beto look at growth rates during current expansions. Up to the current quarter, our expansion has lasted37 quarters and averaged growth of 4.1% per annum: the comparable figures for the United States are38 quarters and 3.7% per annum.If we turn to an international ranking of inflation rates over the past decade (Column 2 of Table 1),Australia finishes in the middle of the field, with an average inflation rate of 2.3% per annum. This is ahuge improvement on recent decades, but, of course, virtually every country has shown a significantimprovement. There are a number of factors behind this improvement, but one I would like to mentiontoday is our monetary policy regime. Like a number of countries in the above list, Australia has amonetary policy regime which is based on the trilogy of an inflation target, an independent centralbank and a floating exchange rate.An important factor behind our good growth and low inflation has been our productivity performance.Here, if we use the simplest measure of productivity, which is labour productivity, the pattern inAustralia is very similar to the pattern in the United States (Graph 1): strong growth in the 1960s, aflattening out in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a pick-up in growth in the 1990s. But the pick-up inthe 1990s in Australia has been more pronounced than in the United States. We have gone fromgrowth of 1.7% per annum to 3.0% per annum, whereas the United States went from growth of 1.5 ercent per annum to 2% per annum.I do not want to suggest that this means we have higher productivity than the United States; rememberwe are only talking here about rates of change of productivity. The fact that we have been able tospeed up more than they have is, in large part, because we were starting from a lower base.Incidentally, the OECD recently completed a study called “Is There A New Economy?” in which itlooked at similar calculations to the ones I have shown above for a range of countries. It found that outof the 29 OECD economies, only six had achieved a higher trend growth of GDP per capita in the1990s compared with the 1980s. They were the United States, Australia, Ireland, Denmark, Norwayand the Netherlands.

3BIS Review 73/2000Whilst I am on the subject of productivity, I want to make two general points:• The first is the obvious one which I have made on numerous occasions that the main reasonsbehind the pick-up in productivity growth have been structural changes made over the past15 years in the Australian economy which have increased flexibility and competitivepressures. These changes include:–further tariff reductions;–financial deregulation;–labour market deregulation;–privatisation; and–a more stringent regime of competition policy.It has not been easy to put these changes in place, even though there has been for most of thedecade considerable bipartisan political support for change. Inevitably, compromises havehad to be made and, viewed in isolation, some of the individual changes do not look to be allthat thorough-going. But taken together, I think the total is larger than the sum of theindividual parts. Of course, one aspect of the economy that was not reformed during theperiod covered by these calculations was the tax system. But that finally changed a couple ofmonths ago when a Goods and Services Tax was introduced to replace the old wholesalesales tax and to take some of the weight off income taxes.• The second point about productivity I want to make concerns the new economy/old economydivide. Some people tend to judge a country’s technological sophistication by, for example,the number of listed companies in the IT sector. Although Australia has a number ofcompanies that fit this description, about 70 or so in fact, their combined share of the stockmarket is not large by international standards. But that is only one measure of technologicalsophistication. Another equally important one is the country’s willingness to embrace newtechnology. This may be a better guide to productivity improvements than focusing only onthe IT sector. I have two measures of the spread of technology:–The first is Internet usage as a percentage of the population, which shows Australia ina relatively high position among the countries compiled by the Consulting Group,NUA (Table 2).– A measure that is more specific to the business sector is the number of e-commerceservers per head of population. On this measure, Australia is second only to the UnitedStates (Table 3).

5BIS Review 73/2000So, in terms of willingness to adapt to new information technology, Australia would get a very highscore. This, along with the measures I mentioned earlier, helps to explain why there has recently beensuch a significant lift in the rate of growth of productivity.A big lift in productivity growth has a beneficial effect on many areas of the economy. A lot of it ispassed through to consumers and, in the process, this makes it easier to maintain low inflation. Someof it can also make businesses more profitable, which is, after all, the incentive that drives much of theefforts towards improving productivity in the first place. The two broadest measures of corporateprofits as a percentage of GDP in Australia have been trending up over the past decade, with profitsafter interest showing a much sharper rise than profits before interest, again another indirect benefit ofa low inflation (Graph 2) decade.With good growth and good profitability, businesses have been keen to hire staff. As a result,employment has grown strongly and the unemployment rate continues to decline (Graph 3). Again, acomparison with the United States is interesting - during our expansion, the unemployment rate hasfallen by 4.8 percentage points compared with a fall of 3.7 percentage points for the United States. Thefact that their level of the unemployment rate, at 4.1%, is lower than ours, at 6.4%, is due to theirlower starting point, in part a result of the relatively mild nature of their early 1990s recession.
BIS Review 73/20006There are two other things I wish to touch on before concluding. The first is the exchange rate, whichhas attracted a lot of attention and soul searching this year. It is surprising that in an economy showingthe medium-term characteristics I have just outlined, the exchange rate is so weak. If we refocus ourattention to the immediate period, the puzzle is, if anything, greater. We have an economy growing atwell over 4%, and probably more like 5%, with exports rising rapidly in the context of the strongestworld growth for a decade, rising commodity prices and high corporate profitability.Why markets are placing such a low valuation on the Australian dollar is not a question I can easilyanswer, any more than I can answer why valuations in some equity markets seem so high relative tonormal. These things can occur for periods in markets. They eventually come out right in most cases,but it can take some time, and in the meantime the effect can be uncomfortable, unhelpful and evendamaging. For my part, I think that an important contributing factor this time is that marketsunderestimated (and are still underestimating) the Australian economy’s underlying strength. Thecoincidence of a strong world economy plus a low Australian dollar is virtually unprecedented, and isone of the several reasons why we at the Reserve Bank have been confident in the strength of theAustralian economy.The influence of the world economy has been quite expansionary for Australia over the past year, mostnotably in the form of a 28% increase in exports. This has been the result of both strong volumegrowth and rising prices. Even with substantial growth in imports, the foreign balance is now making agood contribution to Australian growth and, at the same time, reducing the current account deficit(Graph 4).The reduction in the current account deficit from 6% of GDP a few quarters ago to 4.9% now may notlook to be a big story. However, what is unusual about it is that it has occurred at a time when theAustralian economy has been growing strongly. In all other instances where a turnaround of this sizehas occurred, a major cause has been a slowdown or contraction in the Australian economy (andconsequent fall in imports). On this occasion, the manner of the improvement in the current accountportends much better for the future.ConclusionWe are now in the tenth year of our current expansion, and are in much better shape than in the maturephase of previous expansions. This year is an eventful one in that it contains a number of one-offoccurrences such as the Y2K changeover, the introduction of the GST and, in a few days, the OlympicGames. These events have the effect of adding to demand and of shifting it around from month tomonth and quarter to quarter. This is making a number of indicators of the economy more difficult to
7BIS Review 73/2000read than normal, but I do not think it alters the overall assessment that this is an economy whichretains a fair bit of momentum, and where the economic fundamentals, both here and abroad, arecontinuing to provide a stimulus to growth.
1BIS Review 72/2000Eva Srejber: Price stability and growth in SwedenSpeech by Ms Eva Srejber, Second Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at SkandinaviskaEnskilda Banken, in Malmö, on 4 September 2000.*      *      *Sweden is now entering its third year with growth of over 3%. This year, GDP is expected to increaseby over 4% and our assessments indicate continued annual growth rates averaging over 3% for thenext two years. Despite the strength of the economy, inflation is low. Why doesn’t inflation rise more?What balances do we have to strike as monetary policy decisionmakers? These are the issues that Iwant to give my view on in today’s speech.Monetary policy strategyI would like to start by drawing attention to what guides us when we make monetary policy decisions,ie how we have formulated the monetary policy strategy.The new Riksbank Act, that came into force on 1 January 1999, confirmed by law that the objective ofmonetary policy is price stability. This objective was formulated in 1993 as an inflation target, whereCPI is to total 2% with a tolerance interval of plus/minus one percentage point. One reason foradopting CPI was because it is well-known and measures the prices consumers encounter for a largepart of their consumption. Two per cent was chosen, among other reasons, because it was consideredto be at a good European level at that time. When the new Executive Board of the Riksbank tookoffice at the beginning of 1999, we found no reason to change the target formulation.To make it possible to evaluate how we carry out our task, we endeavour to be as clear as possibleabout the grounds on which monetary policy decisions are made. Inflation assessments and interestrate decisions are explained in the Riksbank’s inflation reports.The Riksbank has also stated a rule of conduct for what should normally lead to decisions on interestrate rises, and the justifications for departures from this rule of conduct. Finally, the published minutesof the Executive Board’s monetary policy meetings contain an account of how we voted and thereasoning underlying the decisions.Resource use is important for inflationSince the interest rate affects inflation with a time lag, monetary policy decisions are based onforward-looking assessment of inflation.Highly simplified, the conceptual framework, used by the Riksbank in the appraisals of pricetendencies, can be described as follows: when there is unused capacity in the economy, price pressureis low and inflation is under the target. When demand is sufficiently high to lead to output exceedingthe level that coincides with the long-term trend level of production, inflation instead tends to exceedthe target. Inflation will be on target when output is at the level of the long-term trend level ofproduction - the output gap is closed. This reasoning assumes that inflation expectations are close tothe target for monetary policy.Inflation expectations are based therefore on forecasts for the development of the real demand, howmany unused resources there are in the economy initially, assessments of the productivity trend andthe long-term trend level of production.However, consumer prices can be affected by factors that are not related to resource use in theSwedish economy. Inflation measured by CPI is also affected, for instance, by changes in supply andother factors that temporarily affect inflation. When CPI is affected by temporary factors of this kind
BIS Review 72/20002that are unrelated to resource use, inflation diverges, in the simplified model, from the target evenwhen the output gap is closed. UND1X is a measure that makes adjustments for some of these effectsalthough far from all of them.The rule of conductThe Executive Board of the Riksbank has decided to formulate a decision rule that states that ifinflation, measured as the annual change in CPI, is expected to rise about the target of 2% during thenearest one to two years, then the interest rate should normally be increased and vice versa. The choiceof time horizon is justified by our assessment that an interest rate change has the greatest effect onprice developments during this period. However, interest rate changes also affect inflation in theshorter and longer term, so that there are reasons for giving some consideration to the inflationforecast for the coming year and for the time beyond two years.However, a monetary policy that aims in all situations to keep inflation at 2% can lead to largefluctuations in output. If monetary policy was to counteract price increases in CPI which are deemedto be temporary and not a consequence of excess demand, interest rates must be kept sufficiently highto hold down demand in the economy. Output would then be under the long-term trend level.Correspondingly, with the target of achieving 2% inflation, monetary policy must stimulate demandand press output up above the long-term trend level if inflation was held down by factors thattemporarily dampen prices.There are therefore reasons for modifying the monetary policy rule of conduct to make it possible toachieve balance between variations in inflation and in growth. Excessively large fluctuations in outputcan entail high economic costs. Fundamentally, after all, the reason for monetary policy being giventhe task of maintaining stable prices is that this is the way in which it is considered to make the bestcontribution to creating the prerequisites for high, stable growth.If inflation is affected by temporary factors or if the economy is affected by such extensivedisturbances that it can be difficult to bring inflation back on target within one to two years, there maytherefore be reasons to bring inflation back to target more slowly than usually. However, we shouldgive reasons for doing this.Scope for major differences, despite a common strategyEven if there is agreement on the strategy for monetary policy, there is, of course, considerable scopefor differences in assessments of where the interest rate should be in each situation.In the first place, the Executive Board can make different assessments of the most probable pricetendency. As we know, economics is not an exact science and forecasts of prices and growth potentialalways rest on many assessments of an enormous mass of information and correlations. Models cannever capture the complexity of the economy and how people’s economic decisions interact and musttherefore always be regarded as one of many aids in assessments.The Riksbank uses a lot of different approaches and indicators to make assessments. The focus of theRiksbank’s analysis has been until now on the real economy and how it affects price trends. In manyareas, we have come further than other central banks, while we have not come so far as regards theanalysis of different financial aggregates and their linkage with inflation and real demand. Anendeavour has certainly been made to take into account information provided by the development ofthe quantity of money and growth of credit. However, we have not for instance developed methodsthat can give guidance as to the level of indebtedness and the quantity of money that is compatiblewith the long-term sustainable growth of the economy on the basis of the inflation target. While thefinancial economy is in principle only a reflection of the real economy and vice versa, changes cantake place as to which component is in the driving seat. A well-developed analysis of both sides wouldprobably improve the basis for decision-making in monetary policy. Structural changes in the financialmarkets make it difficult to interpret developments and to find stable correlations between, forinstance, the quantity of money and inflation, although this is true for many parts of the economy. It
3BIS Review 72/2000applies, for instance, to methods for estimating such central variables as how many unused resourcesthere are in the economy and how great the potential growth can be. Different methods then producedifferent results.The ECB is an example of a central bank that builds up its analysis from the real side and from thefinancial side - monetary policy rests on two pillars. There are partly historical reasons for monetarypolicy strategy being conducted in this way. Their strategy is perhaps not the best way to take financialtrends into consideration. The risk with such a clear division is that the fact that it is actually aboutmirror images is disregarded and that the consistency between the real and financial analysis is lost.The advantage is that financial trends can clearly be taken into consideration when monetary policydecisions are made.In the second place, we can make different appraisals of the risk picture for the price trend during theforecast period. As there is normally great uncertainty in the inflation assessment of the main scenario,the Riksbank also produces risk scenarios; we also publish estimates of the probability distribution ofdifferent inflation outcomes. The distribution around the probable outcome is taken into considerationwhen decisions on the interest rate are taken.In the third place, we can make different assessments as to how monetary policy is to be conducted tostrike a reasonable balance between fluctuations in growth and inflation. As I mentioned earlier, theExecutive Board has agreed that we can decide not to bring inflation back to target within one to twoyears if CPI is affected by temporary factors or if the economy is affected by extensive disturbances.Making assessments and evaluating when - within these frameworks - there are sufficient reasons foravoiding output variations by extending the control horizon is far from self-evident, however.To maintain the credibility of monetary policy aimed at price stability, it is important therefore tojustify such departures.In the fourth place - and I am now starting to sound as if it is not at all possible to conduct monetarypolicy with a demand for clarity - we do not know exactly the stimulation or tightening produced by aparticular interest rate. This depends on our, like everybody else’s, limited knowledge of the“transmission mechanism”. It is also due to it being difficult to exactly define at what real interest rate,monetary policy has a neutral effect on demand. The difficulty is increased by the “neutral” realinterest rate changing, for instance when the productivity growth in the economy changes. On thebasis of experience, simple rules of thumb and rough calculations, everyone can per se obtain an ideaof how monetary policy operates. However, this is another area that needs to be developed.Altogether, this review shows that monetary policy decisions can never be made mechanically withthe aid of simple rules of thumb. In order to firm up the analysis and make it easier to describe thebasis for our decisions, it is notwithstanding this important to describe and keep to a conceptualframework, around which we construct our analysis. As we gain increased knowledge, our analysisand conceptual framework are complemented or modified. In order not to lose clarity, we endeavour inour inflation reports, speeches and publications to describe our analytical apparatus and itsdevelopment.Challenges in the present situationThe growth prospects for the Swedish economy have improved considerably in recent years. TheRiksbank has been successful in creating support for and making the inflation target credible, centralgovernment finances have improved and many structural reforms have been carried out, althoughmuch remains to be done.However, although for the most part, it looks good, there is a risk that the Swedish economy is nowgrowing too rapidly due to over-optimistic assessments of growth prospects. This must in my view betaken into consideration in the conduct of monetary policy. Excessively optimistic expectations of thefuture could lead to financial imbalances with excessive indebtedness building up in the Swedisheconomy. High stock exchange prices and increasing property prices can intensify this tendency. In
BIS Review 72/20004this situation, an expansive monetary policy, based on the same over-optimism, would contribute toimbalances being built up.However, an important issue for the Riksbank is whether such a scenario is possible without differentindicators for inflation signalling in time that overheating is on the way so that monetary policy hastime to react. Experiences from other countries show that low consumer price inflation and healthycentral government finances do not by themselves constitute a guarantee for future good development.Although one should always be cautious about drawing conclusions from comparisons betweencountries, it has been seen, for instance, that with experiences from Japan at the end of the 1980s andfrom Korea in the mid-1990s, overheating can be expressed in exaggerated stock exchange andproperty prices, high lending rates and low yield investments rather than in rising consumer prices.I can conceive of at least two factors in the Swedish economy that lead to an increasing overheatingnot being expressed in rising consumer prices and therefore risk leading the Riksbank and the generalpublic to draw the wrong conclusions about the state of the economy.In the first place I believe that both wage and pricing behaviour are affected by inflation expectationsbeing low and stable. It takes time before an increased use of resources has an effect on price and payincreases! In the same way as it takes time to adjust inflation expectations downwards, there is inertiain shifting them upwards. This would mean that even if demand and production are higher than what issustainable in the long-term, that this is not marked in price development before the use of resourceshas come under great strain. In the second place deregulations and increased competition can lead to consumer prices beingdampened as a result of excess profits being forced down in previously sheltered industries. Initially,increased competition will perhaps primarily lead to redistribution of real incomes. In the somewhatlonger term, productivity will also be improved. However, it is uncertain how quickly and to whatextent potential growth will increase as a result of increased competition.If monetary policy assessments are based on an overoptimistic view of growth prospects anddevelopments in consumer prices do not give any signals about this, this can lead to considerableimbalances being built up.Sooner or later, however, inflation will accelerate. When the scope for reduced profit margins as aresult of deregulations and increased competition begins to be exhausted and demand pressure finallybegins to be expressed in rising prices, there is a risk that price increases will be large and comequickly. Expectations of future growth prospects can then be abruptly interrupted. The consequencescan be that demand drops if companies and households are then too highly indebted. If a lot ofcompanies during the overheating period, have based their investment decisions on incorrectexpectations of the demand trend, the fall can be great.The example shows a development where monetary policy by acting too late creates high variability inboth inflation and output. The effects need not be visible either until after the forecast horizon. Theeconomic costs of waiting too long to change the direction of monetary policy can be high ifimbalances have grown great and the fall in production is large.The same course of events as in USA?Although the prospects for the Swedish economy look very bright, we cannot therefore disregard therisk of overoptimism. History has shown many times that an optimism that was well-founded to startwith has become self-reinforcing and has ended up by creating considerable imbalances in theeconomy. Developments in Japan in the 1980s and in Asia in the 1990s are clear examples of this.The exceptionally long upswing in the USA has contributed to strengthening expectations of fasterlong-term growth in Sweden as well. It is therefore important to understand whether an Americanlevel of growth is sustainable in the long-term and whether anything similar can take place in Sweden.An important basis for the favourable development in the USA is probably the focus on budgetconsolidation and price stability that has guided economic policy there for a long time. We have had asimilar development in these areas in Sweden, although the process started later here. At the same
5BIS Review 72/2000time, there are similarities with regard to the strong penetration of information technology in theeconomy, although we are also later in this development. As in the USA, high asset prices and strongoptimism have stimulated demand and increased the level of indebtedness in the Swedish economy.Although it is not yet possible to write off the risk of financial imbalances building up the USA -imbalances that can have negative effects for the American economy - it now seems as if the Americaneconomy may be on its way to a soft landing. However, there still remain the global financialimbalances that have been built up over many years with very high saving in Japan and very lowsaving and high indebtedness in the USA. We have still not seen how these imbalances are to beresolved and the consequences this will have for the world economy.Although there are some indications that the Swedish economy is experiencing a similar developmentas the American, the structural differences cannot be disregarded, which probably create greater inertiain the Swedish economy than in the American. One such area is the labour market. Considerablebarriers to competition remain in the Swedish economy as well. Another difference is that the cyclicalupswing we are now experiencing is taking place at the same time as an increase in growth andresource use in the rest of the world. We cannot therefore benefit in the same way as the USA fromthere being unused resources in the rest of the world.ConclusionsThe Riksbank makes the assessment now that GDP growth will be over 4% this year and average over3% during the next two years. This rise is taking place after a number of years with considerablegrowth. Despite this, inflation is low and is expected to remain so for the whole forecast period. Wecannot with certainty determine the processes concealed behind the weak increase in prices. I drew theconclusion during the spring that we had probably underestimated the output gap, ie the amount ofunused resources available in the economy initially and this is probably an explanation for the priceincreases being surprisingly low. Some productivity improvements and indications of shrinking profitmargins in the economy as a whole also indicate that deregulations and increasing competition play animportant role. I furthermore consider that the stabilisation-focused macropolicy and measures such asthe tax reform have moreover increased the potential growth in the Swedish economy.The strong growth that the Riksbank - assuming an unchanged repo rate - calculates with, is slightlytoo low in my view. At the same time, I have a somewhat less optimistic appraisal than the majority ofthe mode of functioning of the labour market and competition in a number of markets in Sweden.However, my assessment is that the low inflationary expectations are making it take a longer timebefore overheating tendencies are expressed in increasing consumer prices. This leads me to make theassessment that prices will not start to rise until the end of the forecast period but that price increaseswill then be stronger than the majority believes. My assessment is therefore that inflation at the end ofthe forecast period, in my main scenario, will end up marginally over the forecast that was reported inthe last inflation report, which the Executive Board majority did not find reason to revise.My assessments of developments during the next two years differ then only marginally from themajority view. I am more concerned about the price tendency and the risks I see in developments afterthe forecast horizon. The assessments of the use of resources and future production possibilities areuncertain. Structural changes of the Swedish as well as the international markets make it particularlydifficult to draw conclusions about future growth prospects. There is a risk that we go to excess. High,increasing indebtedness calculated as a share of GDP for both households and companies make meconcerned for financial imbalances that can be on their way to being created, although our knowledgeof what can be assumed to be long-term sustainable development is small.In my view, there is a risk that we overestimate potential output in the coming years and that wetherefore accept an excessively high level of demand in the economy. Low inflation expectations andthe effects of deregulations and increased competition can lead to the excessively strong demand notproducing an effect on CPI until a late stage,  but primarily in other parts of the economy. Theeconomic consequences that can ensue from an incorrect assessment can be high. Although theprobability of a dramatic development is small, the high costs that can arise if this comes about mustin my view be taken into account when making monetary policy decisions. Caution indicates that
BIS Review 72/20006monetary policy should at least be neutral in the present situation. I regard monetary policy as beingexpansive at present. I therefore consider that the interest rate should be increased.
1BIS Review 72/2000Masaru Hayami: The US and Japanese economies -reflections of a central bankerSpeech given by Mr Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the 32nd Annual JointMeeting of Japan-Midwest US Association and Midwest US-Japan Association, held in Tokyo, on11 September 2000.*      *      *I am honored to be invited today to the 32nd Annual Joint Meeting of Japan-Midwest US Association.As some of you may know, after having worked at the Bank of Japan from 1947 through 1981, I thenentered the private sector where I spent about 17 years, during which time I often participated inmeetings of business leaders from both the United States and Japan. At this Annual Joint Meeting, Iam told that political and business leaders from both countries are going to discuss the problems thatthe world economy faces, including the IT revolution and globalization. Needless to say, I am lookingforward to learning the results of the discussions.Some ten to fifteen years ago, that is, in the late 1980s, one of the main topics at such conferences waseconomic and trade friction between the United States and Japan. Indeed, I chaired a small groupestablished under the Japan-US Business Conference that discussed the resolution of disputes, which Ifound an important, but not an easy job. One of the advantages of serving as chairman was that I hadthe opportunity to visit a number of US cities, including Cleveland in the Midwest.Fortunately, the economic and trade friction hotly debated at that time has been greatly alleviated,partly because the cause has been removed and also partly because misunderstanding on both sides hasbeen resolved, which largely owes to the strenuous efforts made by those involved in solving theproblems underlying the friction. However, I think it also reflects the fact that over the past ten yearsJapan’s economy has stagnated while the US economy has revived.Japan’s economy saw the peak of the bubble about ten years ago. At that time, Japanese firms andfinancial institutions were expanding their global market share and were full of confidence. Many ofyou will remember a book entitled “Japan as Number One” written by a professor of HarvardUniversity which was published immediately before the bubble hit the peak. In contrast, ten years agothe United States was suffering from twin deficits, a combination of huge budget deficits and theexpansion of current account deficits.But that was ten years ago. Now, the US economy has been enjoying its longest ever period ofeconomic expansion. The unemployment rate has come down dramatically from 7.5% in 1992 to 4.1%recently. On the other hand, Japan’s economy has experienced severe trials since the bursting of thebubble. Such contrasting development between the United States and Japan is most typicallywitnessed in the movement of stock prices. The current Nikkei Stock Average is a little more than40% of what it was at the end of 1989, which happened to be its peak, while the New York Dow-JonesIndustrial Average has risen four-fold during the same period.Against this background, we Japanese have recently tended to become overly pessimistic about themedium- to long-term growth potential of Japan’s economy. However, I believe that Japan’s economywill be able to regain vitality if it firmly pursues economic reforms needed from a medium- tolong-term viewpoint, as witnessed by the revitalization of the US economy since the 1990s.To that end, we should learn lessons from past mistakes. At the same time, it is crucial that westeadfastly implement concrete reform measures while earnestly discussing how to revive Japan’seconomy. In view of the current boom of the US economy, it may be useful for US participants in thismeeting to draw possible lessons from Japan’s bitter experience which began when its economy wasstill in a good condition.
BIS Review 72/20002Bearing all this in mind, let me talk about two issues. The first issue is, in the context of the US-Japaneconomic relationship in the late 1980s, why did the bubble emerge and how did monetary policyaffect the emergence of the bubble? The second issue is, though it might sound a little bit vague, towhat extent do differences in economic and corporate management style, for example between theUnited States and Japan, affect economic growth?Regarding the first issue, there are various factors behind the stagnation of Japan’s economy in the1990s. The emergence of the huge bubble in the late 1980s and its subsequent bursting in the 1990swas certainly one of the major factors. Although why the bubble emerged has not yet been fullyanalyzed, we can obtain a few common observations if we look back on the history of bubblesincluding the case of Japan.One common observation is that it is inevitable that a bubble will emerge if public expectationsbecome extremely bullish for some reason. And, borrowing the expression of Fed ChairmanGreenspan, “irrational exuberance” prevails nationwide when a bubble emerges. However,intensification of bullish expectations alone is not enough for the emergence of a bubble, for it has tobe financed, which is another common observation. As a matter of fact, during the bubble period inJapan, the activity of financial institutions had become extremely aggressive and interest rates hadbeen kept low for a long period of time.Now, in the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble, we hear various questions and criticisms such as“Why did the Bank of Japan maintain monetary easing for a long period?” There were a couple ofreasons behind the delay in monetary tightening at that time. Above anything else, prices had beenvery stable. Furthermore, Japan had a sizable current account surplus, reaching 4.2% of GDP in 1986.And this strengthened the prevailing argument that Japan should continue monetary easing and expanddomestic demand to reduce the external surplus, which was another reason for the delay in raisinginterest rates. The United States advocated that Japan’s current account surplus should be reducedthrough the expansion of domestic demand, but such an argument was widely discussed in Japan aswell.The basic condition of the current account balance of a country is fundamentally determined by thetrend of the net balance between savings and investment which reflects demographic and otherunderlying factors. Economic theory tells us that it is hardly possible for monetary policy to affectsuch a basic condition of the current account balance. Nevertheless, in reality, not a few advocated theerroneous argument which was not warranted by economic theory. I think this was partly becausesome support was given to a misconception that microeconomic problems could be solved simply bymacroeconomic policy. In other words, there existed the mistaken notion that such problems as tradefriction between the United States and Japan could be solved by monetary policy.Looking at the booming US economy while reviewing the experience of Japan’s bubble period, Icannot help but feel some difficulty in judging the arrival of the new economy, in other words, thedifficulty in differentiating between “irrational exuberance” and “rational exuberance.”Most central banks would perhaps say “no” to the question as to whether monetary policy couldprevent the emergence of a bubble. But, I think they would say “yes” to the assertion that monetarypolicy can play a very important role in maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment. As we haveseen in the discussion based on the misconception about a reduction in the current account surplus, Istrongly believe it is important for both policy makers and business leaders to understand and sharesome kind of basic logic in terms of macroeconomic theory for the conduct of sound economic policy.Let me move on to the second issue I want to address which is to what extent differences in economicand corporate management style, for example between the United States and Japan, affect economicgrowth.Against the backdrop of prolonged economic stagnation in recent years in Japan, there has beengrowing recognition that we should further incorporate into our system the US style managementwhich emphasizes market-oriented economic management and shareholder-oriented corporatemanagement. Simply put, regarding economic management, competition should be further intensified.The relaxation and lifting of regulations should be promoted. The financial system should be shifted
3BIS Review 72/2000from one led by banks to one led by the capital market. And, on the corporate management front,corporate governance should put more emphasis on shareholders. Needless to say, employmentadjustment should be more drastic.From time to time such an argument goes to the extreme that further development of Japan’s economycannot be expected unless we completely shift from Japanese style to US style management. I thinkthis is overly pessimistic because Japanese style management is not something which never changes,but is rather something which has evolved in response to changes in the economic environment.Of course, I am not saying that current Japanese style economic and corporate management has noproblems. Indeed, I often mention the importance of structural reform, and am sometimes criticized forgoing beyond my position as central bank governor by making too strong a statement on the subject.Nevertheless, I strongly believe Japan needs structural reform. First of all, let me emphasize that thegrowth potential of the economy can be increased largely by improvements on the supply side, that is,achieving steady productivity gains, rather than the short-term boosting on the demand side. Forexample, if we compare the productivity of workers in 1998, the figure for Japan was about 40%lower than that for the United States based on purchasing power parity in the IMF’s World EconomicOutlook, and about 30% lower when based on the actual exchange rate. Of course, if the sole objectiveis higher labor productivity, it can be achieved by investing a huge amount of capital and raisingcapital per worker. But, in this case, capital productivity and return on capital would decline.Furthermore, growth driven only by the huge investment of resources would eventually reach a limit.For sustainable growth, we need to establish an indigenous mechanism that promotes growth bycombining labor and capital in an optimal manner under given prices and which generates innovationin various fields.Under such circumstances, we have to deal with the following three agendas.First, the allocation of resources should be reviewed in light of changes in the economic environmentand resources should be invested in more productive areas. In this way, resources would be moreefficiently utilized. For example, labor and capital need to be reallocated from the public to the privatesector, from low growth to high growth industries, and from less efficient to more efficient firms. Suchredistribution would certainly be accompanied by pain, but without it we cannot expect the steadydevelopment of Japan’s economy.Second, the legal, tax and accounting systems, some of which are outmoded and can be an obstacle toinnovation, should be reviewed. While I recognize that it is never easy to review any system, whichinevitably entails conflict of vested interest, we should know that we will not be able to take advantageof the power of innovation unless systems are reviewed in response to changes in the economicenvironment.Third, what we really need to see is the emergence of innovators. Changes in the economicenvironment will create a variety of opportunities for making profits. Transforming such opportunitiesinto profitable businesses cannot be achieved through a mechanical process. It can only be achieved ifinnovators are allowed to pursue their entrepreneurial abilities to the full.These three agendas boil down to the problem of how to improve the ability of the economy andsociety to cope with various changes. Such an ability is always needed, but, when technologicalinnovation and economic globalization are rapidly progressing, economies and societies that canrespond to such changes have a considerable competitive edge.I think the fact that the United States has recently recorded higher growth than Europe and Japanreflects a greater ability to cope with changes which can be characterized by flexibility and diversity.At a recent conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fed ChairmanGreenspan emphasized that the flexible US labor market had contributed to recent high economicgrowth, by noting the seemingly paradoxical situation of low unemployment despite many layoffs.From these viewpoints, we definitely observe the seeds of changes in the recent development ofJapan’s economy. Let me give you some concrete examples of such change.
BIS Review 72/20004First, the reform of systems is proceeding rapidly. For example, a number of changes have been madein the area of accounting, including mark-to-market valuation, more adequate pension liabilityaccounting, and the review of the relationship between subsidiaries and their parent companies. And,importantly, the level of disclosure has been greatly improved. By accurately showing the performanceof a firm, these changes put strong pressure on corporate managers to pursue restructuring and higherprofits.Second, corporate managers have become increasingly aware of return on capital.Third, the mentality of employees has changed. Japan’s labor market, which is characterized bylifetime employment and the seniority-based wage system, used to be perceived by many as lackingflexibility. However, recently we have seen gradual changes in the market as large-scale employmentadjustment has begun to be observed.Fourth, reform of the financial system has been proceeding. Since the autumn of 1998, a legalframework for the smooth dissolution of failed financial institutions has been established and publicfunds have been injected into major banks to strengthen their capital base. Although there remain a lotof things to be solved, the condition of Japanese financial institutions has significantly improvedthanks to the restructuring efforts on the part of financial institutions.Related to these positive developments, direct investment into Japan has substantially increased inrecent years. In the past, inward direct investment was much smaller than outward direct investment.In fact, it was only 200 million dollars in 1996. However, it has been on a rising trend, amounting to12.8 billion dollars last year. I have great expectations for a continuing increase in direct investmentfrom abroad as it would stimulate Japan’s economy through the transfer of managerial resources andbusiness expertise.Before closing, if I may summarize, firstly, a stable macroeconomic environment is a prerequisite forsustainable growth, and in this regard, monetary policy plays a very important role. Second, to raisethe economic growth rate over the medium to long run, structural reform affecting the supply side ofthe economy is indispensable. I think that the contrast between the US and Japanese economies duringthe past ten to fifteen years exactly proves this point.Let me conclude my remarks by quoting the following prayer for “Serenity“ by Dr Reinhold Niebuhrwhich I cherish whenever I face challenging issues as Governor of the Bank of Japan:God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,   The courage tochange the things I can;   And the wisdom to know the difference.Thank you very much for your kind attention.
1BIS Review 71/2000The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE: Britain and EuropeSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE, Governor of the Bank of England, at The BritishSwiss Chamber of Commerce Lunch, held in Zürich, on 12 September 2000.*      *      *I agreed to talk briefly about Britain and Europe - and then respond to questions. I will in fact talkmore specifically about Britain and the euro from my perspective at the Bank of England. But let memake clear, from the outset, that monetary union is fundamentally a political rather than an economicissue. It necessarily involves the deliberate pooling of national sovereignty over important aspects ofpublic policy, in the interest not just of collective economic advantage, but of a perceived widerpolitical harmony within Europe.As a central banker, I have nothing to say about the politics of monetary union - that’s for electedpoliticians and clearly political opinion is divided - not just in the UK - about how far and certainlyhow fast to go in the sensitive matter of pooling national sovereignty. But monetary union is also aneconomic issue and that is my concern.So what are the economic pros and cons?The arguments on either side are in fact now reasonably well defined in the UK where there hasalready been an intense and protracted debate - though different opinions inevitably attach differentweights to them.On the plus side, the crucial and unique economic advantage of monetary union is nominal exchangerate certainty within the Eurozone - which takes over half UK exports. I’m not talking just aboutreasonable exchange rate stability - which might result over time from each country pursuingdisciplined macro-economic policies in parallel. I’m talking about nominal exchange rate certainty forthe indefinite future.That very real economic advantage is well understood in the UK. It is particularly well understood bythose businesses in the UK that export to, or compete with, businesses in the Eurozone, especiallygiven the euro’s unexpected - and puzzlingly persistent - weakness since its inception at the beginningof last year. On that ground alone many of them, who are under intense competitive pressure as aresult of sterling’s excessive strength against the euro, though not against other major currencies,would see our joining the single currency as an advantage - provided, of course, the exchange rate atwhich we joined was fixed at an appropriate level, which most of them - and indeed most analystslooking at the economic fundamentals - think should be substantially lower than at present.At a broader macro-economic level the potential benefit of joining - as a result of greater transparencyof costs and prices and lower transaction costs - leading to greater competition and more efficienteconomic resource allocation is well understood.Exchange rate certainty within Europe - even though only within Europe, and even though it isnominal exchange rate certainty rather than real exchange rate certainty, which is what matters interms of competitiveness - would potentially enhance the benefits to be derived from the EuropeanSingle Market.The euro’s second very powerful advantage is the possibility it opens up for much broader and moreliquid financial markets. It will mean a progressive narrowing of spreads between borrowers andlenders, which is good news for the users of those markets - and that will be good news too forfinancial intermediaries as a group, because it will lead to higher volumes of financial activity. Notevery individual intermediary will benefit, of course, in the more competitive environment, but thosewho survive will thrive!The City of London is already making an important contribution to this process of euro financialmarket integration. It is in fact the greatest contribution that the UK can make to the success of the
BIS Review 71/20002euro while we remain outside. (It runs alongside the conceptually distinct, but closely related, pressurefor broader international integration of financial markets, currently reflected in a spate of initiatives tounify trading platforms, and both clearing mechanisms and settlement systems, in which London, ofcourse, is also very much involved.)These then - nominal exchange rate certainty throughout the Eurozone and integrated euro financialmarkets - are potentially powerful economic arguments in favour of UK membership. What then arethe risks - the possible arguments against our joining the euro?Essentially the potential downside can be summed up as the risk that the single monetary policy - the“one-size-fits-all” short term interest rate within the Eurozone, which is the inevitable consequence ofa single currency - will not in the event prove to be appropriate to the domestic monetary policy needsof all the participating countries.Countries may have divergent cyclical positions. They may face divergent fiscal positions, whichwould affect their appropriate fiscal/monetary policy mix in different directions - though this shouldbe contained by the Growth and Stability Pact. Or their domestic policy needs may diverge as a resultof economic shocks of some sort - a classic, but unique, example was German re-unification, but themore recent global economic disturbance was perhaps another example.The risks of divergent monetary policy needs within a monetary union are certainly real. They wererecognised in the Maastricht Treaty, which established the famous “convergence criteria” precisely inorder to try to limit the risks before the euro-project went ahead.They are essentially similar to the risks of sectoral or regional divergence within a national currencyarea - which we in the UK certainly know something about - it is in fact a major monetary policyheadache for us at the present time. But in the case of the Eurozone the risks are of divergent monetarypolicy needs between the different member countries - they apply at the national level. And if theymaterialised to any very significant extent, the resulting tensions could be serious, because alternativemechanisms - such as labour migration or fiscal redistribution through a central budget - which help tomitigate sectoral or regional disparities in the national context - are less developed at the Eurozonelevel. Some commentators point to the present inflationary pressures in Ireland as an example of theproblems that could arise where the single monetary policy is easier than the national situation mightrequire - though I am not sure how far one can sensibly generalise from the Irish experience. It isequally possible to envisage circumstances in which the single monetary policy is too restrictive forsome countries.The fact that the UK did not join in the first wave of EMU was a disappointment to some people,including to some of our European partners - but it was also a considerable relief to them - we wouldcertainly have complicated the task of the ECB in setting its single monetary policy. And from ourown perspective, if we had joined EMU from the start - and had Eurozone interest rates over the pasteighteen months or so, it is very difficult to envisage how we would have avoided an inflationaryboom in the UK. It is true that, to the extent that the present imbalance within our economy reflectssterling’s appreciation against the euro, we would have been protected against that. But, withaccelerating inflation in the economy as a whole, the effect would have been tantamount to realexchange rate appreciation, which would in any event have damaged their competitive position and soprovided at best only short-term relief even to them. And it would not in that case be possible toreverse that effect through exchange rate adjustment. The fact is that there are no easy answers or idealsolutions to the one-size-fits-all problem at the Eurozone level, without substantial - and sustainable -convergence between our economies, although coping with such tensions as may emerge within theEurozone - with or without the UK - is likely to be easier in a context of structural, supply-side,flexibility and adaptability in labour and product markets.Now, many people in the Eurozone acknowledge these concerns. But they are inclined to argue that ifa country participating in the monetary union were to find itself in an unsustainable situation, andgiven that it would have no macro-economic way out - through exchange rate adjustment, orindependent monetary policy action, or fiscal stimulus beyond the limits of the Growth and StabilityPact - and given limited labour migration or fiscal redistribution at the pan-European level - then itwould have an overwhelming incentive to undertake the supply-side reforms which have proved so
3BIS Review 71/2000difficult to introduce up until now. One of my ECB colleagues in fact once put it to me that - “whenwe have closed off every other policy option, we will finally be forced to do the things we know thatwe should have been doing all along!”There are those, I know, who find our hesitation about the euro - in an economic context - hard tounderstand. That’s true particularly of those who have been in effective de facto monetary union withthe Deutsche Mark for a long time already. But it is not just stubbornness or obstinacy on our part -though we British can of course be pretty stubborn at times. In the macro-economic context it reflectsa real debate about the risks and potential costs of divergence between our own monetary policy needsand those of the members of the Eurozone - which in turn depend upon the extent to which oureconomies really have achieved sustainable convergence, and the extent to which we are able torespond flexibly on the supply side to economic shocks or tensions between our domestic monetarypolicy needs and those of our European partners.As you know, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced some three years ago that we would notjoin the euro in the first wave. He made it clear that the present British Government is not opposed toEuro membership as a matter of principle. It will make a decision on pragmatic grounds, based uponfive economic tests. These are: whether the UK economy has achieved sustainable convergence withthe economies of the single currency; whether there is sufficient flexibility in the UK economy toadapt to change and other unexpected economic events; whether joining the single currency wouldcreate better conditions for businesses to make long-term decisions to invest in the UK; the impactmembership would have on the UK financial services industry; and ultimately whether joining thesingle currency would be good for employment. It would then submit a favourable decision toParliament, and the British people in a referendum.The Chancellor recognised that it was unrealistic to think that a decision could be reached during thelifetime of the present Parliament, which runs to May 2002 at the latest. But he stressed that in themeantime the UK should nevertheless prepare - not only for introduction of the euro on the Continenton 1 January 1999 - which we of course did very effectively - but also for our own eventualparticipation.The Chancellor’s statement was the first by a British Government to accept the principle of monetaryunion. It recognised that the single currency will affect us whether we are in fact in or out - and that itis clearly in our own national interest to do all that we can to ensure that the euro is successful.This policy of “prepare and decide” has subsequently been confirmed by the publication of a NationalChangeover Plan, which sets out the key steps that would be involved in the transition following apositive decision on UK entry. This remains the Government’s policy.In the meantime, we continue to pursue macro-economic - both fiscal and monetary - stability andsupply-side flexibility alongside our European partners, in our own national economic interest, whichwill also help to bring about closer convergence between our economies.Over the past seven years or so we have in the UK achieved the longest period of sustained lowinflation we’ve known for a generation. Retail price inflation - on the Government’s target measure -has averaged 2.6% since the beginning of 1993 and is currently running at 2.2%, or only 1% on theEuropean harmonised index of consumer prices.But alongside low inflation we’ve had the lowest nominal interest rates that most of us can remember.Short-term rates have averaged some 6¼% since the MPC’s first decision in June 1997 compared withsome 9.25% over the preceding decade. And 10 year government bond yields have fallen, withinflationary expectations, to around 5¼%, which apart from a brief period last year is the lowestthey’ve been for nearly 40 years.Much more fundamentally we’ve enjoyed the longest period of uninterrupted, quarter by quarter,economic growth since records began some 45 years ago - with annual growth since Q3 1992averaging 2.8% - between ¼ and ½% above most estimates of our underlying trend rate. The numberof people in employment is the highest on record. And unemployment has fallen from its most recentpeak of 10½% on a claimant count basis at the turn of 1992/93 to the present rate of 3.7%. That is thelowest for 25 years in the UK as a whole, and just about the lowest in nearly every region.
BIS Review 71/20004This is not just past history. Having come through the global economic slowdown a year or two ago,the economy as a whole is now again growing at well above trend, with inflation a bit below target;and the broad prospect for the next couple of years - on most forecasts, is for continuing relativelystrong growth with relatively high employment and relatively low inflation.Our economic progress - and the common approach to economic management that underlies it andwhich we share with our European partners - provides, in my view, a firm foundation for a continuingpositive and constructive relationship between the UK and other members of the European Union,whether or not they are members of the Eurozone. That of course is in the economic interest of allsides. Just as we benefit from a stable and prosperous Europe, so too the Continental European interestlies in a stable and prosperous UK. And that mutual self-interest above all is the thing we all need tohold on to.
1BIS Review 70/2000Willem F Duisenberg: Are different price developments in theeuro area a cause for concern?Speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Financial ServicesIndustry Association, Dublin, on 6 September 2000.*      *      *1.IntroductionLadies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to speak here in Dublin on the occasion of the annualdinner of the Financial Services Industry Association (FSIA). Public support for the euro in Irelandhas been particularly strong, and this may be due to the prevailing expectation, stronger thanelsewhere, of economic benefits resulting from the single currency. The introduction of the euro,however, also poses some new questions and challenges for the ECB and national economicpolicymakers. Today I should like to take the opportunity to elaborate on one particular issue, that isthe challenge posed by different inflation rates across countries or regions within the euro area. Thereis a general consensus that the euro area economies have experienced a great deal of convergence bothin terms of economic growth and inflation during the past decade. In fact, the move to a singlecurrency and the introduction of the euro are based on a successful convergence process towards ahigh degree of price stability in participating countries. However, this does not mean that countrieshave always had the same rates of inflation during the past decade. And, indeed, there is no reason tobelieve that they will - at all times - have the same rates of inflation within Monetary Union. I am wellaware that divergences in inflation have increased lately in the euro area as a whole. For example,inflation in Ireland deviates significantly from area-wide inflation.2.Different price developments will not generally disappearThere are a number of reasons why differences in economic conditions have occurred in the past, andthere is ample reason to expect that some degree of economic divergence will continue to emergewithin the euro area. First, there may be reasons why some differences in inflation may occur overrelatively short periods of time. Second, national or even regional rates of inflation may also differwithin a single currency area over longer periods of time. Let me elaborate on each of these factors inturn.Short-term differences in inflation may generally occur due to country-specific, statistical and “erratic”factors. First, government policies may lead to different price developments via tax changes,liberalisation measures and administrative price changes, as they are generally not of the samemagnitude and timing across all euro area countries. The deregulation of national electricity and gasmarkets or measures such as the eco tax in Germany or the tobacco excise duty in Ireland may serve asexamples of such policy measures. Secondly, since patterns of consumption are not the same in allparticipating countries, the weights used in the construction of the national components of theHarmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) differ. For example, processed food constitutes around13.5% of the HICP in the euro area as a whole, but 21% of the HICP in Ireland. This could, purelymechanically, generate measured inflation differentials across countries even if price changes forindividual goods were equal in all these countries. Finally, different weather conditions or differentnumbers and timing of national holidays can create “noise” in measured inflation rates, which wouldbe of only limited economic significance. Looking ahead, there is no reason to expect that such factorswould disappear within the euro area.In addition, a number of deeper economic factors may also contribute to short-term divergences ofprice developments. Trade patterns, production structures, tax systems, financial markets, andinstitutional structures differ significantly across euro area countries. Hence, common shocks may
BIS Review 70/20002affect countries in a diverse way. The 1998/1999 emerging market crisis, the depreciation of the euroagainst the US dollar, and the recent surge in oil prices may all serve as examples of common shockswhich have contributed to diverging developments within the euro area. Furthermore, second-roundeffects of common shocks may differ because of different institutional structures, such as thewage-bargaining system. Of course, the transmission of single monetary policy reactions to suchshocks may also still differ because of financial structures. Likewise, differences in inflation mayoccur on account of the impact of asymmetric shocks, or differences in the response to such shocks.German unification was a clear example of such an asymmetric shock.Looking ahead, some of these deeper economic factors may become less important as differences intrade patterns, tax systems, financial markets and institutional structures are likely to diminish. Othersmay become more important. In the face of increased openness and trade integration, a tendencytowards country-specific and regional specialisation might emerge. This could lead to some inflationdivergences between countries when shocks occur. However, to the extent that the linkages betweenindustries increase across national boundaries as part of the process of growing integration in the euroarea, the degree of synchronisation across national short-term economic developments may wellincrease.Let me now turn to the factors which could lead to long-term differences in inflation. I should like firstto address briefly the issue of price level convergence. Price level convergence could be expected totake place in the euro area for at least two reasons. First, the completion of the internal market andincreased cross-border price transparency contribute to eroding the scope for the existence ofsubstantial price differentials for products which are easily tradable across borders. To a large extent,this may have taken place already before the start of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), butdifferences remain. One example of such a price convergence that has attracted public attention relatesto car prices. Secondly, with regard to goods and services which are less easily tradable across nationalborders (such as housing and hairdressing), the long-term convergence of productivity and livingstandards across the euro area would create a tendency towards price level convergence. Countrieswith higher levels of economic development tend to have higher price levels for non-traded goods andservices. While higher wages in the traded goods sector largely reflect higher levels of productivity,spillovers of wage increases to the non-traded goods and services sector often imply that wage levelsin the economy as a whole will typically be higher in more developed economies. As the scope forincreasing productivity growth is usually more limited in the non-traded goods sector, a generalincrease in wages as a result of productivity gains in the traded goods sector will raise the cost ofproducing non-traded goods and services. This leads to higher relative price increases for non-tradedgoods and services. In a dynamic context, as a less developed country is catching up with itsneighbours, inflation in its non-traded goods sector could be rising more rapidly than in othercountries, and as a result, inflation will be higher. This type of convergence normally takes placegradually and within certain limits among relatively homogeneous industrial countries, but could, ofcourse, reach a much larger scale if differences in price levels among participating countries are moremarked.3.Are divergent price developments a cause for concern?Are differences in inflation among euro area countries a cause for concern? The short answer is, “itdepends”. On the one hand, as I have just explained, differences in inflation rates among euro areacountries had to be expected. They are in effect partly the result of the completion of the internalmarket and the creation of the single currency itself. On the other hand, if differences in inflation ratesare quite large, they need a thorough examination of the underlying reasons as well as appropriateeconomic policy action at the national level.The single monetary policy and the establishment of a more stable price environment in the euro areaas a whole have been accompanied by a considerable degree of narrowing in inflation differentials.However, current inflation differentials for some euro area countries are quite large. An analysis ofdata for price developments in various US cities in the past suggests that inflation differences mayoccur within a monetary union, which can be at least as great as those currently prevailing between
3BIS Review 70/2000most euro area countries. A further feature of the US data is that the observed divergences in inflationrates among these cities, although persistent, are not permanent. There seems to be a tendency forprice levels in individual cities to return to their initial levels relative to the national average. It can beassumed that similar adjustment processes would generally also operate in the euro area.The cyclical component of consumer price developments may be affected by the orientation ofmonetary policy and changes therein, and could thereby exhibit more common patterns in the future.Typically, all kinds of specific shocks, such as oil price changes, seasonal patterns and weatherconditions may then dominate the dispersion of price developments. To give you an example, thedifference between the highest and the lowest annual national HICP inflation rate increased to3.8 percentage points in July 2000, from an average of less than 2 percentage points recorded during1998 and 1999. The biggest differentials have emerged in product groups such as food and energy.These have traditionally been most exposed to such oil price shocks and weather conditions. Non-energy industrial goods not only show the lowest, but also the least volatile differentials.I have so far mentioned a number of reasons why divergences in price developments as such need notbe particularly worrisome. There are, however, also circumstances under which inflation differentialsare a cause for concern within a monetary union. Let us consider the case of a country where domesticdemand has long been growing strongly, pushing real GDP at or above its potential. A further stimulusto domestic demand may then tend to generate upward pressure on domestic costs and prices. It willalso lead to a higher demand for import goods. The external position deteriorates. The increase ininflationary pressures in such a case is not offset by a rise in productivity. Therefore the rise in pricesrelative to the external sector implies a loss of competitiveness for the economy. This in itself couldexacerbate external disequilibria. Moreover, if the losses in competitiveness are not corrected,domestic and foreign markets for some products may be permanently lost, damaging longer-termgrowth prospects. Within a monetary union, the potential correction mechanism through the exchangerate is no longer available. Hence, the adjustment has to occur through domestic costs and prices. Ifrigidities in product, labour and capital markets hamper such adjustment, the correction may only takeplace in the form of weaker growth and a loss in employment growth.4.The role of the single monetary policy and national economic policiesDifferences in price, and more generally, economic developments between euro area countries do notautomatically warrant concern. Some differences in economic developments across euro area countriesmay even be seen as an advantage as they would average out and help to smooth cyclicaldevelopments at the area-wide level. Perfectly synchronous movements would increase the amplitudeof cyclical movements in the euro area as a whole. However, a national policy response would beclearly warranted to deal with sizeable, growing and unsustainable divergences. The single monetarypolicy can only be geared towards the objective of price stability for the euro area as a whole. It istherefore not in a position to influence the dispersion of inflation rates across euro area countries. Ifaction is required, it must be taken through national economic policies. They need to ensure thecapability of individual economies to absorb and respond to shocks. The flexibility of nationaleconomic policies to deal with country-specific issues is required in all Member States of a currencyunion, but perhaps in particular in the smaller countries. Because of sheer size and weight, economicdevelopments in the large Member States have less potential to deviate from area-wide averages thanthose in a small country. Moreover, national developments in large Member States may have greaterspillover effects on other, smaller Member States’ developments. Furthermore, small economies, suchas Ireland, tend to have a higher degree of national openness, which implies that specific responses todivergent economic developments may be less effective and thus should be further-reaching than inthe larger economies.As regards structural policy, it is important to implement reforms in the product, labour and capitalmarkets, which are aimed at increasing overall economic flexibility and which would increase thedegree of flexibility of national economic policies in reacting to country-specific events and commonshocks. This is important for all countries, independent of their cyclical position. Policies that supportgreater wage flexibility, wage dispersion in line with labour productivity, and greater mobility of
BIS Review 70/20004labour across sectors and regions are likely to smooth the adjustment process, both in a boomingeconomy and during a downturn. Also, measures to increase competition in the non-traded sector,particularly services, would help to smooth the adjustment process. All such policies are desirable intheir own right, irrespective of membership of the euro area. However, the use of structural reforms toaddress excessive aggregate demand growth in the short term suffers from the substantial amount oftime needed to prepare and implement such reforms. This should make it clear that nationalgovernments have no time to lose in taking measures to increase the flexibility of their nationalproduct, labour and capital markets. The current favourable economic environment provides anexcellent opportunity to undertake the necessary structural reforms in euro area countries with vigour.It is also necessary for fiscal policy to play its part. In general, unbalanced fiscal policies have anegative effect on economic efficiency and on price developments. They also increase strains on thesingle monetary policy, and may have negative spillover effects on other countries. The Stability andGrowth Pact helps to guarantee sound public finances over the long term, which is an importantcontribution to macroeconomic stability and is also conducive to sustained economic growth andemployment. If the public debt is reduced to a sustainable level and fiscal deficits are close to balanceor in surplus, this creates room for manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers play their role in the event ofthe economy slowing down. However, in addition, particular attention also needs to be given to fiscalpolicy in an environment of strong growth, budget surpluses and decreasing debt ratios. In suchcircumstances, fiscal policy should by all means refrain from giving a pro-cyclical impulse to theeconomy.5.Concluding remarksTo summarise, the euro area has experienced a considerable degree of convergence in inflation ratesduring the past decade. National differences in output growth or inflation observed at the currentjuncture do not in general appear to be unusual either from a historical perspective or compared withdevelopments in the United States. The more pronounced divergences in some countries strengthen thecase for policy action at the national level. Looking ahead, there is reason to believe that divergentprice developments may continue to emerge. Some sources of divergence may become less significant,while others may become more important. The ECB will continue to monitor divergent developments,but as our monetary policy can only be geared towards maintaining price stability in the euro area as awhole, it cannot play a role in tackling growth and inflation differentials between euro area countries.Therefore, national economic policies need to take action if divergences threaten to cause undueimbalances. In this context, structural policy, strongly backed by fiscal policy, which is not pro-cyclical and in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as appropriate wage developmentstaking account of labour productivity growth and the level of unemployment, have to play a crucialrole. Fortunately, professional forecasters not only expect continued and strong output growth toprevail in the euro area over the next few years, but the outlook also suggests increasing convergenceboth in terms of economic growth and consumer price inflation within the euro area.
1BIS Review 69/2000Lee Hsien Loong: Capital markets in the new economySpeech by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of The Monetary Authority ofSingapore and Deputy Prime Minister, at the 25th Anniversary Celebration Dinner of the SingaporeInvestment Banking Association, held in Singapore, on 6 September 2000.*      *      *Chairman, SIBA, Mr Koh Kah Yeok, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,IntroductionI am happy to celebrate with the Singapore Investment Banking Association (SIBA) your25th anniversary.For many years, SIBA has actively provided industry feedback on government policies, especially oncapital market regulations and developments. These inputs have helped MAS to create a conduciveenvironment for all financial players.Last November, your association broadened its charter, reconstituted itself to include a wider spectrumof activities and financial institutions, and changed its name to SIBA. This was a timely move.I am pleased to note that you have formed the SIBA Debt Capital Market Committee. As an MASsurvey1 shows, corporate debt issuance more than doubled last year to S$ 19.5 billion. In the first halfof this year, corporate debt issuance is already S$ 21.2 billion, exceeding the volume for the whole oflast year. More diverse issuers are tapping the debt market, and interest from local investors hasgrown. An industry body to champion the development of the debt market, and institutionalise afeedback channel to MAS, will therefore play a useful role.Global trends in capital marketsIn the financial industry, globalisation is proceeding apace. There has been a worldwide wave ofconsolidation among financial institutions, stock and derivative exchanges, and even regulatorybodies. In 1999, there were 900 merger-and-acquisition (M&A) transactions among banks, worthUS$ 300 billion worldwide.2 The securities industry has been no less active, with exchanges andclearinghouses in a flurry of mergers and alliances.While globalisation and integration are established features of capital markets, two more recent trendsare noteworthy: firstly, stronger linkages between capital market and treasury activities, and secondly,the impact of technology and the internet on capital markets, particularly in the securities industry.MAS’ guidelines on treatment of credit derivatives and securitisationThe links between capital market and treasury activities reflect an increase in cross-bordertransactions. In the US and Europe, the spate of mergers and acquisitions has boosted the volume offoreign exchange flows. The mergers have also led to greater use of securitisation and creditderivatives, and caused European credit derivative markets to expand significantly.311999 Survey of the Singapore corporate debt market.2“European banking turns decisive corner on road to consolidation”, International Wealth Management, July 2000.3“Use of credit derivatives in bank mergers soars”, International Financing Review, March 2000.
BIS Review 69/20002In Singapore, the burgeoning capital market has similarly benefited our treasury industry. Increaseddebt issuance has led to more swaps and other money market activities. Participants are using moresophisticated treasury and capital market products. We must keep our regulatory frameworkup-to-date, so that it provides clarity, and allows growth and innovation.Credit derivatives form one potential growth area. Credit risk is an important issue for banks,particularly in Asia. Before credit derivatives were invented, banks generally had to stop extendingnew loans or services to customers to whom they had excessive exposure. This worked against thebanks’ efforts to maintain valued client relationships. Credit derivatives provide banks an alternative.Banks can now repackage and divest excess credit risk exposures, and continue to service their clients.MAS has studied how credit derivatives should be captured under the existing capital adequacyframework for banks. It has circulated draft guidelines to industry players and associations forcomments. MAS has now finalised the guidelines,4 which address capital treatment for three maincredit derivative products: the credit default swap, the total rate of return swap and the credit-linkednote.The guidelines reaffirm the principle of maintaining capital for risk exposure. If banks assume creditexposure via the use of derivatives, they will be subject to capital charges. But if banks use creditderivatives to hedge their underlying risk exposures, they will be granted relief, depending on thedegree of risk transfer. For example, where the hedge is imperfect, because of mismatches in maturity,asset or currency, regulatory relief will still be available, albeit to a smaller extent.A second promising area is that of securitisation. Like credit derivatives, securitisation allows banks tomanage their credit risk and capital more effectively. In its basic form, securitisation involves poolingassets in a special purpose vehicle, which is then funded by issuing securities.MAS has circulated draft prudential guidelines for securitisation to industry participants forcomments. The guidelines for banks have been finalised.5 These take into account feedback from theindustry and existing securitisation transactions. They set out the capital treatment of securitisedassets, as well as disclosure, separation and other requirements for the various roles that banks take onin a securitisation transaction.The guidelines seek to define clearly the roles, responsibilities and risks that banks retain or undertake,when they participate in a securitisation transaction. They also ensure that banks hold appropriatecapital against the risks they accept. Thus, a bank that has securitised its assets will be granted capitalrelief only where the transfer of risks and rewards of the securitised assets has been effective andcomplete.The internet and its impact on the securities industryThe second major issue is the impact of technology and the internet on capital markets.In the securities industry, the internet has caused fundamental change, slicing the value chain more andmore finely, and recombining it in novel configurations. Functions previously offered as a package bybrokers, such as analysis and advice, recommendation and order routing, are being separated andbroken up. New entities, such as aggregators or navigators, have emerged, offering hitherto-unseentypes of services.These changes will bring major benefits to the industry and investors.Firstly, the internet has fostered a free flow of investment information. With a surfeit of news,financial institutions are rethinking their business models. Research and analysis previously available4To be published as Notice 627.5To be published as Notice 628. Similar guidelines will be issued to finance companies and merchant banks.
3BIS Review 69/2000only at substantial fees to institutions and high net worth individuals are gradually becoming availableto online retail investors as well.6Secondly, the internet offers increased business opportunities and potentially limitless reach.Thirdly, the internet offers increased scope for cross selling financial products. Successful online firmslike Charles Schwab and E*Trade are leveraging on their huge customer base to diversify intobanking, bill payment and other areas of services.7Lastly, do-it-yourself finance facilitated by the internet allows institutions to cut whole layers ofcustomer administration costs. The internet is reducing the cost of capital, at the expense of thespreads that intermediaries traditionally enjoyed from a proprietary informational edge. This reductionof what has been called “knowledge float” will benefit both lenders and borrowers.But at the same time, the internet means new challenges. The same borderless nature can meanfootloose customers and businesses. Cyberspace so blurs physical distinctions and facilitatesconvenient access that financial institutions can uproot themselves, go elsewhere, and yet seamlesslyoffer the same services online. Jurisdictional boundaries become harder to enforce, while new businessmodels potentially raise new operational, strategic and systemic risks.Evolving the infrastructure for electronic finance in capital marketsMAS has been closely monitoring these developments and scrutinising their implications for ourfinancial centre.As financial activities consolidate globally into fewer centres, and services spill over traditionalborders, we need to constantly move up the value chain, in order to capture and root intellectualcontent creation in Singapore. A flexible and responsive supervisory framework is critical toaccommodate rapidly changing business profiles of e-finance.In prescribing rules to regulate new activities, we are unable to run ahead of innovation, because wecannot tell for sure which way technology, or the industry, will develop. Instead, we will monitortechnology and market developments closely, and craft and update our rules in step with the marketplace.Securities licensing in the electronic realmTwo months ago,8 MAS announced its intention to regulate securities and futures trading activitiesunder a single licence, and the provision of personal investment and financial planning advice, alsounder a single licence. We shifted toward a unified licensing regime and a more holistic approach topersonal investment advisory services, because the distinction between securities and derivativemarkets is blurring. Financial products are converging, and one-stop distribution channels areemerging.Those changes were part of a broader framework of review we have undertaken for the securities andfutures industries. MAS has now completed a study of another facet of the securities industry. We6For instance, Merrill Lynch provides its online clients access to some of its research and videos of analysts’ dailybriefings. From The Economist, 20-26 May 2000.7Charles Schwab offers bill payment facilities, while E*Trade has set up an online bank, E*Trade Bank. In May 2000,E*Trade acquired an ATM network to cross-sell E*Trade bank, brokerage, mutual fund, and asset management products.8These announcements were respectively made on 6 July by Minister Lim Hng Kiang at the third annual conference of theInvestment Management Association of Singapore and on 7 July 2000 by DPM Lee Hsien Loong at the first anniversarydinner of the Securities Investors Association (Singapore).
BIS Review 69/20004have reviewed securities licensing requirements in the electronic realm for market intermediaries:investment advisers and dealers.Objectives in supervising intermediariesOur key objectives in supervising intermediaries are:1. to reduce systemic risk in the securities market;2. to keep markets fair, efficient and transparent; and3. to safeguard investors’ interests by requiring high professional standards among financialservice providers and investor disclosure.These objectives are in line with the principles of the International Organization of SecuritiesCommissions, and principles adopted in other developed markets.Current interpretation of investment advice and dealing in securitiesOur current securities legislation relies on broadly worded definitions like “investment adviser” and“dealing in securities” to bring certain activities under our regulatory ambit.Under present laws, “dealing in securities” covers any activity relating to transactions in securities,which contain an element of inducement. A broad spectrum of activities could possibly constitute“dealing in securities”: broking in securities, referring customers to open accounts with licenseddealers for the purpose of trading in securities, or providing prospectuses and application forms toprospective customers.As for “investment advice”, our current interpretation accepts that the provision of factual informationdoes not constitute investment advice.What constituted dealing or investment advice used to be fairly clear-cut and well-established. But thebreakdown of the securities value chain has blurred the distinctions between fact and investmentadvice, and between dealing in securities and merely providing information. We therefore need torefine our interpretation of these terms, institute basic safeguards and spell out how to treat newentities.Licensing approachIn licensing investment advisers and dealers, our approach is to require persons conducting securitiesactivities in Singapore to possess suitable qualifications, relevant professional experience and goodcharacter. This would give comfort to investors that they can expect competent advice and reliableexecution from investment advisers and dealers.Our licensing requirements for the new electronic market intermediaries should not be unduly onerous.They will not impose heavy prudential capital requirements. The main focus will be on websitedisclosure of credentials, physical addresses and other relevant information. In lieu of a corporate trackrecord, licensees need only demonstrate individual qualifications and experience.Bona fide intermediaries who subscribe to the objective of providing financial services of highstandard should be pleased to come under our licensing ambit. With qualified intermediaries operatingwithin an environment based on transparency and disclosure, investors would have a suitable basis formaking well-informed decisions. This is another step towards realising the “caveat emptor”philosophy.
5BIS Review 69/2000New licensing principlesMAS will therefore adopt the following licensing principles for securities activities conducted throughthe internet:Interpretation of the activities of an investment adviser and a dealerContext and circumstanceOur first principle is that MAS will examine the context and circumstance in which activities areconducted, to determine whether licensing is required. This applies to both investment advice anddealing in securities.Suppose, for example, a web page of a business school provides a tool for calculating the value ofshares. Should we require the business school to be licensed? In deciding this, MAS would take intoconsideration the fact that the business school’s primary mission is education, not investment advice.In this context, we are unlikely to require the business school to be licensed to provide such a tool onits web page.Interpretation of the activities of an investment adviserFact versus opinionOur second principle relates to investment advice. In determining what constitutes investment advice,MAS will use the “fact versus opinion” test as a general guide, supplemented, where appropriate, bythe context and circumstance principle. The presence of interpretation, selectivity or subjectivity willrequire licensing.Let me explain. A wealth of information on securities is available on the internet. It ranges on acontinuum from pure factual statements, to calculated parameters, to outright buy/sell/holdrecommendations.While investors often use factual information concerning securities to guide their decisions, MAStakes the view that factual information itself is not investment advice. Data based on historical timeseries are facts, whereas forecasts would be considered subjective. Further, filtering data through thechoice of parameters, for example, to display only shares with favourable financial ratios, would beconsidered selective, and would require licensing.The “fact versus opinion” principle sets out quite clearly what would require licensing as investmentadvice. Nonetheless, in this information continuum, there remain some grey areas involving implicitadvice. For instance, where the interpretation and presentation of facts leads to a specific conclusion,MAS would need to review the context and circumstances, such as other information on the website,to decide whether licensing is required.Analytical tools: a common device which challenges our interpretation of “advice” is an analytic tool,for instance, computer software aimed at facilitating investment decisions. Such a tool may requirelicensing. In making this judgment, we would consider the output of this tool, subjecting it to the “factversus opinion” test. If the output goes beyond factual information, and includes subjective orinterpretative content, this tool would require licensing.9Other securities regulators have adopted the same stance in regard to the provision of implicitinvestment advice.9To avoid attracting licensing requirements, analytical tools should operate within the following guidelines: they(a) should not go beyond factual information; (b) should disclose analytical processes transparently and (c) providesufficient disclaimers to the effect that the tools are for informational purposes, and should not be relied upon asinvestment advice concerning securities.
BIS Review 69/20006Interpretation of the activities of a dealerReferrals for opening of trading accountsA third principle associated with dealing activity relates to referrals for the opening of tradingaccounts. MAS will not require the licensing of portals which refer investors to open trading accountswith stockbrokers, provided the stockbrokers themselves are licensed by MAS. This is so, even if thewebsites offer incentives for account opening. The reason is that trade orders will be handled bylicensed dealers supervised by MAS.Passive distribution conduits for advice and dealingOur fourth principle relates to websites acting as what we consider to be passive distribution conduits.Passive conduits, whether for investment advice or for dealing in securities, will not require licensing.Some examples include the following:1. Hypertext links and reproduction of investment research reports: portals often providehypertext links to websites of licensed or exempt financial institutions, for example, inadvertisements. Or they may reproduce investment research reports from such institutionsdirectly on their own websites.10 Such portals would be considered passive conduits, akin toa newspaper or TV advertisement.2. Investment advice by persons not carrying on a business: a growing number of onlinediscussion fora, chat-rooms and bulletin boards allow persons to post their opinionsconcerning securities. An entity providing a platform for public discussion of securitieswould not attract licensing.11 Neither would a participant, as long as he is not deemed to be“carrying on a business” of providing advice.In the context of dealing, we will treat two common practices as passive conduits. First, websitesproviding hypertext links to, or advertisements for, licensed dealers. But websites should not advertisefor, or link users, to unlicensed dealers, including overseas dealers not licensed by MAS. Second,licensing is not necessary for providing prospectuses and application forms passively on websites, orvia email upon the request of investors. These merely improve on the efficiency of paperdistribution.12Websites must not go beyond being passive conduits. MAS will consider portals or websites providingfacilities for accepting or relaying orders to dealers as licensable. This is because such a facility carriesthe risk of failure to transmit trade orders in a timely and accurate fashion, potentially to the detrimentof investors.Overseas websites specifically targeting Singapore residentsOur final principle deals with overseas websites. MAS will apply the same licensing principles tooverseas websites which specifically target Singapore residents, as it does to local websites. This is toensure that foreign and local internet players are treated on the same regulatory basis.10Portals which reproduce investment research reports should (a) attribute the report sources accurately, (b) should notexercise editorial control over, or modify contents of reproduced reports, and (c) should not endorse or otherwisecomment on the reports.11The webpages of such entities should contain disclaimers to the effect that the views expressed are not those of theentities.12Websites providing prospectuses and application forms in a passive manner should display disclaimers to the effect thatthey do not have the intention of inducing investors to subscribe for securities.
7BIS Review 69/2000Going forwardSeveral of the new licensing principles can be implemented based on the existing Securities IndustryAct and licensing framework. Others will require amendments to the legislation. The new provisionswill be included in the forthcoming Financial Advisers Act and the Omnibus Securities and FuturesAct, and announced in 2001.MAS has already received a number of new applications which fall under the proposed securitieslicensing framework. These are currently being evaluated. As I have just discussed the licensingprinciples broadly, interested parties should approach MAS to discuss the details of the revisedlicensing framework in relation to their business models. MAS will also be seeking further commentsfrom relevant industry players on these changes.ConclusionThe vitality and dynamism of global capital markets have ushered in challenging times for thefinancial services industry. With technology breaking down geographic and sectoral boundaries, linksbetween markets, institutions and instruments will flourish.Experience in developed economies show that financial services, notably stock trading, can takerapidly to the internet. This should be no surprise. As an Economist online finance survey recentlydescribed, financial institutions deal in a product - money - that has long been accepted as “virtual”.Unlike a piece of clothing, account-holders are happy to accept their money represented as figures onan ATM screen, or by a credit or smart card.13The new financial landscape calls for a tripartite, complementary response from regulators, industryand investors. The MAS as regulator will foster healthy market practices, while maintaining a soundoverall investment environment. At the same time, in a democratised environment, investors need torecognise that there is little substitute for self-education, and thereby exercise greater caution inmaking individual investment decisions. Finally, industry participants need to set high professionalstandards and observe an exemplary code of conduct, in order to retain their customers and build theirreputations which, in the long term, are their most precious assets.13“Online finance: a virtual threat”, The Economist, 20-26 May 2000.
1BIS Review 68/2000Laurence H Meyer: Why risk management is importantfor global financial institutionsSpeech by Mr Laurence H Meyer, Governor of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Bank of Thailand Symposium, Risk Management of Financial Institutions, held inBangkok, on 31 August 2000.*      *      *I am very pleased to have been invited to address this symposium on the timely and important topic ofrisk management. Continuing increases in the scale and complexity of financial institutions and in thepace of their financial transactions demand that they employ sophisticated risk managementtechniques and monitor rapidly changing risk exposures. At the same time, fortunately, advances ininformation technology have lowered the cost of acquiring, managing and analyzing data, and haveenabled considerable and ongoing advances in risk management at leading institutions worldwide. Asthis symposium illustrates, banks in many emerging market countries are also increasing their focus onrisk management in an effort to build more robust and sound financial systems, to remedy weaknessesthat were exposed by recent regional problems, and to position themselves to participate more fully inthe global economy.Why risk mattersBecause taking risk is an integral part of the banking business, it is not surprising that banks have beenpracticing risk management ever since there have been banks - the industry could not have survivedwithout it. The only real change is the degree of sophistication now required to reflect the morecomplex and fast-paced environment.Even today, however, some simple rules continue to be critical to risk management, and I cite Baringsas a negative example. By the simple act of separating front-office from back-office responsibilities,Barings could well have prevented the enormous losses that led to its failure. In addition, Barings’management never explored how Nick Leeson could have produced such high returns, even thoughthe trading he was authorized to undertake was essentially riskless and thus should not have been soprofitable. Had they questioned their “good fortune”, Barings’ management might have uncovered thehidden losses before they became large enough to bankrupt the firm. A third lesson from Barings isthat the benefit of risk management is the losses it will prevent, not the additional revenues it willgenerate.The Asian financial crisis of 1997 illustrates that ignoring basic risk management can also contributeto economy-wide difficulties. The long period of remarkable economic growth and prosperity in Asiamasked weaknesses in risk management at many financial institutions. Many Asian banks did notassess risk or conduct a cash flow analysis before extending a loan, but rather lent on the basis of theirrelationship with the borrower and the availability of collateral - despite the fact that collateral wasoften hard to seize in the event of default. The result was that loans - including, I might add, loans byforeign banks - expanded faster than the ability of the borrowers to repay. Additionally, because manybanks did not have or did not abide by limits on concentrations of lending to individual firms orbusiness sectors, loans to overextended borrowers were often large relative to bank capital, so thatwhen economic conditions worsened, these banks were weakened the most.The Asian crisis also illustrates the potential benefit of more sophisticated risk management practices.Many Asian banks did not adequately assess their exposures to exchange rate risk. Although somebanks matched their foreign currency liabilities with foreign currency assets, doing so merelytransformed exchange rate risk into credit risk, because their foreign currency borrowers did not haveassured sources of foreign currency revenues. Similarly, foreign banks underestimated country risk inAsia. In both cases, institutions seemed to have assumed that stability would continue in the region
BIS Review 68/20002and failed to consider what might happen if that were not the case. A greater willingness and ability ofbanks to subject their exposures to stress testing could have highlighted the risks and emphasized theimportance of key assumptions. Had they conducted stress tests, some lenders might have seen howexposed they were to changes in exchange rates or to an interruption of steady economic growth.Although avoiding failure is a principal reason for managing risk, global financial institutions alsohave the broader objective of maximizing their risk-adjusted rate of return on capital, or RAROC. Thismeans not just avoiding excessive risk exposures, but measuring and managing risks relative to returnsand to capital. By focusing on risk-adjusted returns on capital, global institutions avoid putting toomuch emphasis on activities and investments that have high expected returns but equally high orhigher risk. This has led to better management decisions and more efficient allocation of capital andother resources. Indeed, bank shareholders and creditors expect to receive an appropriate risk-adjustedrate of return, with the result that banks that do not focus on risk-adjusted returns will not be rewardedby the market.Risk management is clearly not free. In fact, as I will discuss, it’s expensive in both resources and ininstitutional disruption. But the cost of delaying or avoiding proper risk management can be extreme:failure of a bank and possibly failure of a banking system.A point too often overlooked, however, is that, by focusing on risk-adjusted returns, risk managementalso contributes to the strength and efficiency of the economy. It does so by providing a mechanismthat is designed to allocate resources - initially financial resources but ultimately real resources - totheir most efficient use. Projects with the highest risk-adjusted expected profitability are the mostlikely to be financed and to succeed. The result is more rapid economic growth. I want to emphasizethat point. The ultimate gain from risk management is higher economic growth. Without sound riskmanagement, no economy can grow to its potential.Stability and greater economic growth, in turn, lead to greater private saving, greater retention of thatsaving, greater capital imports and more real investment. All this, from sound risk management.Without it, not only do we lose these gains, but we also incur the considerable costs of bankdisruptions and failures that follow from unexpected, undesired and unmanaged risk-taking.Making risks matter to owners and managersOne might ask why many Asian banks made the mistake of paying little attention to risk. One answer,to which I have already alluded, is that the many years of strong economic performance by Asianeconomies lulled banks and their supervisors into complacency regarding risk. That is only part of theanswer, however. We have learned that certain prerequisites must exist before bank owners andmanagers will pay attention to risk. At least some of these prerequisites were absent in many Asiancountries. One prerequisite is that there be no implicit or explicit government guarantees for bankowners and managers. Their incentives to manage risk and avoid insolvency will be severely blunted ifinsolvent banks are merged with stronger banks or simply allowed to continue operating withoutowners losing their stake or managers losing their jobs. Similarly, bank creditors will exert no marketdiscipline if they run no risk of loss on their claims on banks. Thus, guarantees for bank creditors willalso blunt the incentive of banks to control risk. Market discipline also requires adequate accountingand disclosure standards, to enable bank investors to judge a bank’s condition accurately.An important complement to market discipline in promoting sound risk management is effective banksupervision. To be effective, though, bank supervisors must have the ability to assess a bank’scondition, especially the condition of the loan portfolio, and they must have the authority to requireadequate provisions for loan losses. After ensuring that loan loss reserves are adequate, supervisorsmust have the authority to close banks that are insolvent, wiping out owners or shareholders andremoving management. Without such authority - and the willingness to use it - a country effectivelyhas a policy of forbearance, even if officially it does not.Another prerequisite for risk to matter is that there be no government-directed lending, becausedirected lending carries with it an implicit government guarantee. In Korea, for example, during manyyears of directed lending to the large chaebols, banks did not develop the skills to assess the risk of
3BIS Review 68/2000these, their largest borrowers. Even after the end of government direction and the implied guarantee,banks still did not insist on receiving full financial information from the chaebols. Consequently,banks could not assess the risk of these loans, even though the risk they faced had become substantial.Prerequisites for risk managementThere are also prerequisites for banks to develop the ability to measure and manage risk effectively.First, in order to measure risk, the country must have solid accounting and disclosure standards thatprovide accurate, relevant, comprehensive and timely information so that banks can assess thecondition and performance of borrowers and counterparties. To ensure accuracy, accounting systemsneed to be supplemented by auditing systems and backed up by enforceable legal penalties forproviding fraudulent or misleading information to government agencies and outsiders. Banks alsoneed reliable information on the credit history of potential borrowers and on macroeconomic andfinancial variables that can affect credit and other risks. Additionally, banks need a staff with sufficientexpertise in risk management to identify and evaluate risk.Implicit in most methods of evaluating credit risk is the assumption that the probability of repaymentdepends on the ability of the borrower to repay, in other words, that willingness to repay is not theissue. If repayment depends on whim, then its probability is difficult if not impossible to assess. Thus,an adequate legal system and “credit culture”, in which borrowers are expected to repay and arepenalized if they do not, are yet further prerequisites for sound and accurate risk management. Theability to seize the collateral of borrowers in default is essential if banks are to have the incentives andability to mitigate risk. Without the legal infrastructure - the laws, courts and impartial judges -necessary to enforce financial contracts in a timely manner, much of risk management would be fornothing, once the initial decision to extend credit was made.Finally, the potential for conflicts of interest in risk management must be limited. In particular,regulations are needed that restrict and require disclosure of connected lending to bank owners,shareholders or management. Without such regulations, the desire for personal gain may distort theincentives of bank owners and managers to manage risk appropriately.Sound practices in risk managementAt this juncture, it might be useful if I shared with you developments and practices in one country. Ofcourse, I am most familiar with my own. Throughout the past decade, the Federal Reserve has devotedincreased attention to understanding the risk management practices of US banks and has redirected itssupervisory efforts to focus on management processes and areas of (perceived) greatest risk. The sheercomplexity, volume and pace of transactions in our largest institutions today demand that we evaluatetheir risks by reviewing the structure and effectiveness of their policies, procedures and controls.While a certain level of “transaction testing” remains important to ensure that internal systems workand that controls are real, we can no longer take comfort in the safety of large, complex banks byindependently assessing their overall condition at a specific point in time. Given the financial productson the market today, risk profiles of complex institutions can change too easily and quickly. We needthe assurance that the practices that have kept an institution sound so far are likely to keep it sound inthe foreseeable future.US bank managers had earlier come to the same conclusion regarding their own abilities to controlindividual transactions and positions in their worldwide operations. As a result, they have investedsteadily in developing prudent and understandable policies and in improving methods for measuringand managing risks, firm-wide. As their institutions and activities grew, they needed a commonmeasure to compare alternative uses of capital and to evaluate the performance of an expanding rangeof business lines. The now familiar concept of RAROC helped greatly to fill that need. They alsorequired a better process for maintaining quality results, providing management and employees withproper incentives, and detecting problems at an early stage. Along with their size and complexity, theirdemand for stronger and more objective methods of risk management increased. The financialinstitutions in the vanguard of risk management have tended to be those most active in international
BIS Review 68/20004capital markets and derivative activities, where participants are most informed, transactions are mostefficient and data are most readily available. They were the ones that, most typically, had not only theexpertise and resources to develop sophisticated systems for measuring and evaluating risks, but alsothe need to do so, given the complexity of their transactions and products. They needed to identify thekey factors driving market volatility and to quantify the underlying risks in order to manage theirpositions and product lines.For trading activities, the value-at-risk measure was an important breakthrough. It gives banks ameasure of a portfolio’s largest expected loss during a particular time period for a given level ofprobability. It provided a statistically sound and easily understood basis for managing market risk and,as you know, also served as the foundation for new regulatory capital requirements for internationallyactive banks. At most banks, though, market risk is relatively small. Measuring and controlling creditrisk is typically far more important and, unfortunately, a much more difficult task.In managing risk, banks must decide which risks to take, which to transfer and which to avoidaltogether. Market risks are easily transferred, often through swaps and other derivative products.Unless the institution believes it has a comparative advantage in accepting a particular risk, it istypically sold. During the past decade, the fivefold increase in the notional volume of derivativetransactions, to nearly USD 35 trillion for US banks alone, reflects the demand for risk-mitigatingproducts in this area. Certain other risks, such as operating risks and the chance of variousidiosyncratic losses, can be reduced through insurance, diversification and internal controls.Accepting credit risk, though, is fundamentally the business of banking and is the activity which mostbanks see as their principal competitive advantage. Typically, financial market participants have farless information than banks do about the credit quality of individual borrowers, and the terms andconditions of the borrowing arrangements are often complex and structured case-by-case. Credit cardloans and certain other retail credits are a notable exception.In recent years, leading banks have devoted increased attention to measuring credit risk and have madeimportant gains, both by employing innovative and sophisticated risk modeling techniques and also bystrengthening their more traditional practices. For example, a popular vendor model measures defaultrisk by applying option theory to the market value of a borrower’s equity share price and calculates theprobability of a negative net worth. That approach has the important feature of incorporating marketassessments of risk into the analysis and is often used to validate a bank’s independent view.Other models, including most internal models of banks, take a more direct approach to calculating thefundamental elements of credit risk. They estimate the probability a borrower will default, based onnumerous measures of its stated financial strength; the bank’s exposure given a default, reflecting anyunused commitments of the bank to lend; and the expected loss given default, taking into account anycollateral or other loss-mitigating features of the credit agreement.Combined, these measures reveal the expected loss, which a bank must know to underwrite and price acredit correctly, as well as to establish adequate loss reserves. However, it is the volatility of this lossand the contribution of the credit to the volatility of the bank’s cash flow on a firm-wide, portfoliobasis that is crucial to evaluating capital adequacy. As you can imagine, the process of modeling creditrisk is still as much art as science for most banks, requiring many assumptions and subjectivejudgments as well as substantial amounts of data. Testing the sensitivity of a model’s results to thesedecisions and maintaining the integrity of the process from start to finish will be a constant challenge.Nevertheless, leading institutions around the world have made substantial progress in measuring riskin recent years, and we expect much more progress in the years ahead as both the regulatory andbanking communities devote more attention and resources to the topic. The continually declining costof technology for storing and analyzing data will help greatly to encourage firms to create thedatabases necessary to understand credit risk better. This decade may see a watershed for riskmanagement as institutions make far greater use of information. Indeed, I fully anticipate that therevised Basel capital accord now under development will link capital requirements more closely to abank’s own internal evaluation of risk.
5BIS Review 68/2000For most institutions, though, success in risk management does not require sophisticated models, norwill models alone suffice. Clearly, all banks must take advantage of new technologies and keep pacewith market innovations to remain competitive and to survive. That need points to ever moresophisticated risk measurement and management practices. Nevertheless, adhering to the fundamentalprinciples of risk management and adapting sound practices to one’s own situation will remain key. AsI indicated earlier, the experience throughout the world with bank failures and other financial crisesdemonstrates time and again that violations of traditional and long-known management principlesproduce the largest losses. I gave some examples of this earlier. Technology and financial innovationfacilitate risk management and accommodate more sophisticated risk exposures. Financial models aretools and the environment around them must still be properly managed and controlled. I cannotoverstate that point. The most sophisticated risk management techniques are useless if the operatingenvironment and management incentives are deficient or if fundamental risk management principlesare ignored.Fundamental elements of sound risk managementThe fundamental elements of sound risk management are easy to describe in the abstract but are farmore difficult to apply case-by-case. Each situation is unique, built around the roles and capabilities ofindividuals and the structure, activities and objectives of the institution. What works for one firm may,of course, be unsatisfactory for another. Moreover, in the context of a particular firm, the definition ofa sound or adequate risk management system is ever changing, as new technology accommodatesinnovation and better information and as market efficiency grows. To remain competitive, institutionsmust adapt and constantly improve their process. That fact becomes clearer every day.Apart from those contingencies, however, certain basics apply quite generally. In any institution,support for crucial programs must come from the top. Each entity’s senior management and governingboard must set the institution’s risk appetite by establishing appropriate policies, limits and standards,and by ensuring that they are followed and enforced. Throughout the institution, risks must then bemeasured, monitored and reported to key decision-makers.While the complexity and formality may vary widely among institutions, each firm should have clearprocedures for assessing risk and evaluating performance over time. There must also be adequateaccountability, clear lines of authority and separation of duties between business functions and thoseinvolved in risk management and internal control. These elements, and others, are time-testedfundamentals of risk management that do not entail high technology or complex risk measurementtechniques.Getting thereI very much fear that institutions throughout the world view risk management - often “sophisticatedrisk management” - as a Holy Grail, without having a real understanding of its fundamental elementsand how difficult it can be to impose them. This, I believe, is particularly true in developing countrieswith traditions or cultures that emphasize relationships more than legally enforceable obligations.Moreover, even for organizations that operate in a culture - such as the United States - that is morerisk-oriented, risk management techniques can threaten traditional ways and thoughts. Managers whoare already in important decision-making posts and staff who do not yet have the technical skillsnecessary for risk management are especially likely to find change disruptive, mechanical and lackingin the all-important qualities of judgment and experience that they, of course, already have inconsiderable abundance. Do not misunderstand me. I am not an opponent of experience and judgment,and I do believe that building a risk management system that is designed to be automatic is foolhardy.My point is that change is difficult at any institution or set of institutions. It is even more difficult ifthe change is not consistent with the cultural and institutional environment and/or the skills of themanagement and staff.
BIS Review 68/20006Difficulty with staff expertise is why the first steps for effective risk management probably should bethe least technical and the ones with the best chance for payoff in the short run. I am thinking ofaccountability, clear lines of authority and responsibility, and - to avoid conflicts of interest - thecrucial separation of business line management from risk management and internal control. As I notedearlier, the latter alone could have saved Barings.The next step, I suggest, is to begin thinking about returns in terms of the risk-return nexus, theRAROC I noted earlier. Just that simple way of thinking about an investment decision goes a long wayin improving risk management. The best deal - especially for leveraged institutions like banks - ishardly ever the one with the best rate of return. Rates of return are provided to compensate for risk. Ifrates of return are high, it is because they are compensating for a high level of risk. Risk meansvariability, and leveraged institutions like banks have little tolerance for loss. That is why bankinginstitutions must reduce and manage risk exposures, think of yields on a risk-adjusted basis, andrealize that financial leverage can magnify the impact of losses as well as gains.A critical concern in developing a basic risk management process involves developing or attractingpersonnel with the skills necessary to apply risk management tools in meaningful ways. In the 18thand 19th centuries, bankers used to send their sons to work for competitors in financial centers in orderto learn the latest techniques and then bring them home. Some of that still goes on - although not somuch for relatives any more - with time often spent at the organization’s own foreign branch or at abusiness school rather than at competitors. Expertise was also transferred in the past by local branchesof foreign banks training local residents. In the 21st century these are all still excellent ways to importskills in banking in general and risk management in particular. Limiting foreign presence may be theworst thing for local banks - insulating them from competition and making the import of valuablehuman capital and expertise more costly.Risk management implies significant limits on the ability of highly leveraged financial institutionssuch as banks to provide badly needed venture capital; it implies that financial systems need more thanbanks. They need non-bank financial institutions that are less leveraged than banks and have muchlonger term liabilities. They also need functioning capital markets, including foreign providers oflong-term and equity capital. These other elements may constrain local banks, but they bringblessings, too. They create instruments and institutions that are stronger, more diversified and easier tomanage during periods of financial stress. They also provide greater stability to financial systems andalternative funding sources for borrowers.Summing upIndeed, this may be a lot to load onto such a seemingly small concept as risk management, but theconcept is not really so small. It is fundamental to sound banking and requires, I am afraid, arevolution in many of the world’s banking systems. Risk exists and banks must accept risk if they areto thrive and meet an economy’s needs. But they must manage the risks and recognize them as real.Risk matters. Whether or not it is temporarily ignored, it will eventually come out. Recognizing thatfact and dealing with it will benefit lending institutions and the economies in which they operate.Indeed, given globalization, we must all adopt increasingly sophisticated risk management practices inthe years ahead.
1BIS Review 67/2000Svein Gjedrem: Current monetary policy issues in NorwaySpeech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank, at the General Meeting of ACI Norway,held in Tromsø, on 19 August 2000.*      *      *IntroductionI would like to start by expressing my thanks for being given the opportunity to give this presentationof monetary policy in Norway. I will start my presentation with a brief review of the basis formonetary policy, and will go on to mention some of the considerations and reasoning behind NorgesBank’s recent setting of interest rates. Finally, I will turn to certain structural features of particularimportance to developments in the capital account balance which can shed light on the relationshipbetween the setting of interest rates in Norway and international interest rate developments.The basis for monetary policyThe chart shows movements in the krone exchange rate between 1980 and the present. There havebeen three major crossroads since 1986.Chart 1Krone exchange rate• Following the last devaluation in May 1986, the Norwegian authorities decided to introducea fixed exchange rate system for the krone. The monetary policy authorities boundthemselves to the mast. Under this system, the interest rate was to be set solely with the aimof maintaining exchange rate stability within narrow margins. At the same time, the kronewas supported through extensive exchange-market interventions. The fixed exchange ratesystem led to a gradual slowing of price inflation. A counter-cyclical fiscal policy alsohelped reinforce the credibility of the choice of monetary policy regime, sinceunemployment in this period was lower than would otherwise have been the case.
BIS Review 67/20002• In December 1992, the fixed exchange rate system had to be abandoned following asustained period of unrest and extensive speculation in European exchange markets. Afterthis the krone remained stable for several years without any significant changes to NorgesBank’s policy response pattern. The stability of the krone during this period was largely dueto the Norwegian economy entering a period of balanced growth. Fiscal policy was wellsuited to economic developments, while wage inflation was moderate and oil prices wererelatively stable. The monetary policy instruments merely accompanied these developments.Chart 2Daily variation in the krone exchange rate• From late 1996 the krone became less stable: the value of the krone fluctuated substantially,despite more active use of monetary policy instruments to dampen the fluctuations. Thisperiod saw high levels of economic activity in Norway, coupled with marked cost inflation.This coincided with considerable fluctuations in oil revenues and turbulence in internationalfinancial markets, which had a contagion effect on the krone.Developments since the end of 1996 indicate that the exchange rate is no longer ideally suited as anoperational short-term objective for monetary policy. Norges Bank is not in a position to fine-tunemovements in the krone exchange rate. When a central bank trades in its own currency to influence therange of the exchange rate, market participants can exploit a situation whereby the exchange rate doesnot reflect underlying market conditions. With free capital flows, this can trigger huge movements ofcapital. The interest rate, which is the Bank’s primary instrument of monetary policy, has a moreindirect, less predictable effect on the krone exchange rate, while the exchange rate may be affected bya number of conditions beyond the control of the Norwegian authorities.The Norwegian political authorities formulated Norges Bank’s mandate for the conduct of monetarypolicy. The regulation reads as follows:NOK per ECU/EURDaily variation in thekrone exchange ratesagainst ECU/EUR.Percent
3BIS Review 67/2000“The monetary policy to be conducted by Norges Bank shall be aimed at maintaining a stableexchange rate against European currencies, based on the range of the exchange rate maintained sincethe krone was floated on 10 December 1992. In the event of significant changes in the exchange rate,policy instruments will be oriented with a view to returning the exchange rate over time to its initialrange. No fluctuation margins are established, nor is there an appurtenant obligation on Norges Bankto intervene in the foreign exchange market”.This mandate allows Norges Bank latitude for exercising discretion in its conduct of monetary policy.Norges Bank has explained its interpretation of the Exchange Rate Regulation on several occasions,not least in a letter to the Ministry of Finance dated 21 October 1999, often referred to as the budgetsubmission. When exercising discretion, Norges Bank attaches importance to fulfilling thefundamental preconditions for exchange rate stability. To ensure stability in the exchange rate againstthe euro, monetary policy instruments must be oriented towards reducing price and cost inflation to thelevel aimed at by the European Central Bank. At the same time, monetary policy must not in itselfcontribute to deflationary recessions, as this could undermine confidence in the krone. Hence, there isno conflict between gearing monetary policy instruments towards low and stable inflation and theobjective of a stable krone exchange rate over time.In the budget submission, the Bank also provided information about key policy response patternswhen price and cost developments and the basis for exchange rate stability are influenced by externalfactors.Price and cost inflation are influenced by monetary policy through a number of channels. Wheninterest rates increase, it becomes more profitable to save and to postpone consumption until a laterdate. Interest expenses exceed interest income for households collectively, meaning that a rise ininterest rates reduces real disposable income. The value of household wealth decreases, since interestrate rises normally lead to lower house prices and weaker trends in securities markets. Growth inprivate consumption and fixed investment slows. Lower demand for goods and services may alsoaffect enterprises’ profit margins.Slower growth in domestic demand and production will curb growth in demand for labour. When theeffects of changes in interest rates reach the labour market, wage growth will be affected. Increases inlabour costs will in turn have an effect on inflation.
BIS Review 67/20004A more direct channel between changes in interest rates and price and cost inflation is to be found inthe exchange rate. Under normal circumstances, a higher interest rate strengthens the exchange rate,resulting in lower prices for imported goods (which account for approximately 40% of the goods andservices in the consumer price index). The change in the exchange rate will also affect earnings in theinternationally exposed sector and enterprises’ ability to raise wages.The relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate is not stable. We have seen cases of theexchange rate falling after a rise in interest rates when enterprises and financial operators assumed thatthe interest rate rise would seriously undermine the basis for economic growth. On the other hand, alow interest rate which fuels higher inflation will cause the krone to fluctuate considerably.Nevertheless, as long as monetary policy has a stabilising effect on the inflation outlook, we willgenerally be able to assume that raising interest rates strengthens the krone and that lowering interestrates weakens it.In its December 1999 Inflation Report, Norges Bank presented calculations based on ourmacroeconomic model which illustrated that an interest rate rise of 1 percentage point might reduceprice inflation by 0.3 percentage point after two years. This reduction is largely due to the effect on theexchange rate. These calculations were based on the assumption of uncovered interest rate parity. Aninterest rate rise will then result in an immediate appreciation of the krone, which is sufficient for theinterest rate differential between Norway and other countries to correspond to expectations of futurechanges in the exchange rate. After three years the effect is somewhat less strong as a result of thedepreciation of the krone, but at this stage domestic factors will gain in importance.A number of comparative analyses have been published which study the effect of rises in interest rateson inflation in different industrial countries.1 There is substantial variation in the calculations acrosscountries and between different analyses.In a report published by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England,2 the effect of aninterest rate rise which is sustained for one year is illustrated using simulations in the bank’smacroeconomic model. After two years, inflation has fallen somewhere in the region of 0.2 to0.4 percentage point, dependent on the other assumptions. The report emphasises that the effects aredependent on factors such as the general state of the economy and the credibility of the monetarypolicy regime.Calculations carried out by the central bank of Sweden, published in its December 1999 InflationReport, show effects comparable to those demonstrated in the English report.It is not uncommon for the effects of economic instruments to be uncertain. On the contrary. Thismeans that we cannot fine-tune economic developments. The possibilities for conducting a successfuleconomic policy increase by proceeding gradually when economic developments require changes inthe interest rate.Despite the uncertainty as to the speed and magnitude of the effect of changes in interest rates oninflation, there can be no doubt that higher interest rates lead to a reduction in price inflation. Almostall the analyses referred to above are based on economic models which have been quantified usinghistorical data, as have Norges Bank’s calculations. The models cover some of the channels forinterest rate effects, but not all of them. There is evidence to suggest that changes in interest rates maynow have a greater impact on the economy, and more swiftly, in Norway and in other countries thanwas formerly the case.1OECD (1999): EMU.

5BIS Review 67/2000Chart 3Consumer confidence indicator and interest rate differentialChart 3 illustrates the correlation between changes in the consumer confidence indicator and thedifferential between long-term and short-term interest rates since 1992. The consumer confidenceindicator attempts to chart households’ confidence in and expectations concerning their own financialsituation and the nation’s economy, and represents a leading indicator for private consumption. Thedifferential between long-term and short-term interest rates is an indicator of the tightness of monetarypolicy. A negative differential means that short interest rates are higher than long rates, and may betaken as an indication that monetary policy is contractionary. The correlation between the interest ratedifferential and the consumer confidence indicator would seem to imply that monetary policy, at leastin certain circumstances, has a swifter and stronger effect than previously assumed.The effects of monetary policy are channelled through the real economy and the exchange rate. Asalready mentioned, traditionally there has been a considerable lag before changes in the real economyhave affected price and cost inflation. However, if expectations are reflected in household andenterprise behaviour, prices may be affected more swiftly. If price expectations are affected, the effecton the exchange rate will be intensified, since lower price inflation in isolation implies a strongerexchange rate. It is thus likely that there is a third channel which monetary policy can affect, which wemay term the expectation channel. Developments throughout the 1990s would seem to suggest thatthis channel is gaining in importance. However, it is difficult to quantify with any degree of accuracyto what extent monetary policy affects price expectations. The relationship between monetary policyand price expectations is probably fairly unstable. This will be dependent on confidence in theimplementation of monetary policy.The Executive Board of Norges Bank currently assesses the Bank’s key rates eight times a year onpreviously announced dates. In addition to making decisions on interest rates, after each of thesemonetary policy meetings the Bank issues a statement on its assessment of probable interest ratechanges in the future. At the press conference on 9 August announcing the most recent rise in interestrates, the following statement was issued: “today’s decision to raise interest rates brings the overallincrease in interest rates to 1.25 percentage points from the beginning of the year. This represents asubstantial step in the adjustment of the interest rate that is appropriate on the basis of the analyses inthe June Inflation Report. However, the probability that the next change in interest rates will be anincrease remains greater than the probability of a reduction”.
BIS Review 67/20006In addition to the mandate for monetary policy, there are several other factors of importance to thedecisions made by the Bank, including:• the Bank’s interpretation of the mandate;• the policy response pattern in the use of monetary policy instruments as publicised;• the analyses in the inflation reports; and• assessments of probable interest rate changes in the future.These factors combined serve as a constraint for the Bank in almost the same way as exchange ratemovements did under the fixed exchange rate regime. Established courses of action may be set aside,but only in the face of extraordinary conditions, for example when financial stability is in jeopardy.The predictability of the behaviour of the central bank helps diminish uncertainty for all participants inthe economy. This makes the Norwegian economy less exposed to doubt and speculation concerningthe setting of interest rates, reinforcing stability in the formation of expectations and facilitatingsmoother developments in long-term interest rates. Continuity and consistency are therefore NorgesBank’s best contribution to economic stability and exchange rate stability.At the same time, however, the Bank’s leeway with regard to monetary policy is limited. Norges Bankwould have greater scope for manoeuvre if we were less open about our policy response pattern - if wekept our cards closer to our chest. This would enable us to surprise market participants, and in theshort term this might allow interest rate changes to have a greater impact. But enterprises and financialoperators would gradually learn from experience and take positions to guard their interests. Thelong-term results would be weaker confidence in monetary policy, higher interest rates and riskpremia, lower investment and an unstable exchange rate.Economic developmentsChart 4Effective exchange rate for EURNominal and real. Index 1995=100There have been substantial fluctuations between the major currencies since the introduction of theeuro. In general, the euro has depreciated against other currencies. Some academic papers suggest thatthe euro is undervalued. For instance, calculations in a working paper published by the IMF indicate
7BIS Review 67/2000that the nominal equilibrium exchange rate at the time of the introduction of the euro at the beginningof 1999 was USD 1.26 per euro.3Forecasts Norwegian kroneMarket makers’ estimatesExpectations in money and foreign exchange markets seem to suggest that the euro is also consideredto be undervalued in relation to the Norwegian krone. Estimates from market-makers indicate that thekrone is expected to weaken against the euro over the next three to twelve months.Chart 5Other exchange ratesIndex. January 1999=1000The krone has depreciated against other currencies since the beginning of the year. It has weakenedconsiderably against, for instance, the US dollar and pound sterling, but less against the Swedishkrona. Measured by the trade-weighted index calculated as a monthly average, the krone touched arecord low level earlier this summer.We can derive indicators of market expectations concerning future exchange rate movements andinflation. Implied forward rates can be interpreted as the expected nominal interest rate between twofuture dates. For a given expected real interest rate, the forward rate provides some indication ofinflation expectations.Chart 63E Alberola, S Cervero, H Lopez and A Ubide (1999): “Global Equilibrium Exchange Rates: Euro, Dollar, “Ins”, “Outs”and Other Major Currencies in a Panel Cointegration Framework”, IMF WP/99/175.
BIS Review 67/20008Nordic forward rate differentials against DEM 16 August 2000In the long term, ie up to ten years ahead, it is highly unlikely that market participants have specificexpectations about the economic situation. If the equilibrium real interest rate is the same betweencountries, the differential between Norwegian and foreign long-term forward rates may be interpretedas the differential in expected inflation plus any risk premium. The risk premium may be partlyattributable to the limited volume of Norwegian financial markets. As such, the long-term forward ratedifferential between Norway and Germany may be interpreted as the expected inflation differentialbetween Norway and the euro area in the future - plus any risk premium.Chart 7 shows that the forward rate differential between Norway and Germany, ie the differentialbetween short-term interest rates at future dates, is gradually narrowing, and is not much greater thanfor the other Nordic countries. I would like to emphasise, however, that calculations of this sort areuncertain.Chart 7Probability distribution for NOK/EUR in one monthOn the basis of the prices for various currency options, we can calculate the implied probabilitydistribution for the krone exchange rate. In simple terms, one can say that the further to the left in thediagram the figure is, the higher a future appreciation of the krone is priced. A narrow, symmetriccurve - or a bell - indicates that the uncertainty surrounding the future krone exchange rate isconsidered to be relatively slight, and that the risk of a depreciation or appreciation is priced
9BIS Review 67/2000symmetrically. The chart shows that the implied probability distribution for the krone has changedover time. Uncertainty surrounding the future krone exchange rate appears to have diminished.Chart 8Probability distribution for USD/EUR in one monthThe corresponding bell for the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar indicates that there isconsiderable uncertainty surrounding the future exchange rate between the two currencies. Sinceautumn 1999 this uncertainty has mounted, while at the same time the euro is expected to fall againstthe US dollar.Chart 9GDP mainland NorwayProjections for 2000 from Inflation Reports December 1998 to June 2000The assessment of the economic outlook has changed over the past 18 months. A year and a half ago(in the March and June 1999 Inflation Reports) we forecast a period of slower growth in the mainlandeconomy. We were uncertain as to how long it would take for the decline to be reversed. The basis forthese projections was high cost increases peculiar to Norway following the 1998 wage settlement,together with low international demand in the wake of the Asian crisis, low oil prices, sluggish pricetrends for other Norwegian export goods, and major restructuring in key manufacturing sectors.
BIS Review 67/200010We assumed that there was a relatively high risk of a major recession. The greatest uncertainty withregard to setting interest rates was linked to developments in the sheltered sector, where price and costpressures remained strong. A relatively tight central government budget for 1999 laid the foundationsfor curbing growth in the sheltered sector.On the basis of these analyses and the approved government budget for 1999, Norges Bank announcedthat it would be easing its monetary policy stance. The key rates were lowered in five stages by a totalof 2.5 percentage points in the course of the first nine months of 1999. This helped stabilise theNorwegian economy, and hence the krone.The outlook for the global economy and the Norwegian economy improved unexpectedly quickly. Itnow appears that the period of slower growth in the Norwegian economy was in fact over by summer1999. The upswing in the global economy spread to the Norwegian economy through strong exportgrowth and higher prices for Norwegian exports. At the same time, demand in the sheltered sectorremained buoyant. There was also slippage in government budget spending allocations throughout1999.Private consumption continues to rise, fixed investment is increasing in service sectors, andunemployment remains low.The decline in petroleum investment is necessitating restructuring and lower production levels in someNorwegian manufacturing sectors. Developments so far indicate that this turnaround has been offsetby continued high employment growth in the public sector, private services and non-petroleum-relatedmanufacturing.Chart 10Wage shares by industryLabour costs as a percentage of factor incomeHowever, enterprises’ financial position is vulnerable. The growth in labour costs in the latter half ofthe 1990s left its mark on profitability. Both in manufacturing and other industries, labour costs as apercentage of factor income have increased since the mid-1990s.The analysis in the June 2000 Inflation Report indicates that consumer price inflation in 2001 and2002 may exceed levels which are consistent with exchange rate stability over time. The risk of risingwage and price inflation has increased, while there now appears to be little risk of a pronouncedrecession over the next two years.On the basis of developments in the Norwegian economy and the future outlook, Norges Bank raisedits key rates by 0.25 percentage point as of 13 April, by 0.5 percentage point as of 15 June and by0.5 percentage point as of 10 August. As already mentioned, this represents a substantial step in theadjustment of the interest rate that is appropriate on the basis of the analyses in the June Inflation
11BIS Review 67/2000Report. However, in the light of recent trends in the economy and the balance of risks, the probabilitythat the next change in interest rates will be an increase is greater than the probability of a reduction.Coordination of economic policyThe experience of the 1970s and 1980s shows that, in the long term, monetary policy is not suitablefor influencing competitiveness or the size of the internationally exposed sector. Any attempt to dothis through the use of monetary policy instruments will inevitably lead to instability. However,fundamental real economic forces of this kind can be shaped through the use of fiscal policy.Although monetary policy is not suitable for influencing competitiveness, exchange rate fluctuationsmay provide an early warning that the internationally exposed sector is on the verge of losing orgaining strength in the contest for economic resources. A sound basis for exchange rate stability is afiscal policy which manages to smooth fluctuations in domestic demand and production, coupled withwell functioning income determination. The primary difference between Norway and countries whichhave chosen to base their monetary policy regime on an inflation target is to be found in the interactionbetween monetary policy and fiscal policy.The role of the Petroleum FundThe Norwegian economy is small and open. Fluctuations in oil prices and oil revenues pose aconsiderable challenge to Norwegian economic policy. The Government Petroleum Fund plays animportant role in stabilising developments in the mainland economy. A large portion of the centralgovernment’s oil and gas revenues is invested abroad through the Petroleum Fund. Balance in theNorwegian krone market is maintained by investing foreign exchange earnings abroad, therebycurbing the effect of fluctuations in oil prices on the krone exchange rate.Some of the petroleum revenues are used to finance central government budget expenditure. Theportion used by oil companies in Norway, partly to finance investment, also has an effect on themainland economy.The portion of central government oil revenues that is not used domestically is credited to thePetroleum Fund’s account in Norges Bank. Norges Bank acquires foreign exchange equivalent to theallocation to the Petroleum Fund. Foreign exchange earnings from the state’s direct financial interestin oil activities (SDFI) are transferred directly to Norges Bank, while the remainder is purchased in themarket. The Petroleum Fund’s capital, as well as the return on this capital, is invested abroad.The accumulation of capital in the Petroleum Fund serves as a channel for distributing oil revenuesamong generations and contributes to stable government finances in the long term. The larger thePetroleum Fund is, the less dependent we will be on petroleum revenues in the future.The Petroleum Fund shall also serve as a buffer against short-term fluctuations in oil revenues. Aslarge portions of the revenues from oil activities accrue to the state, fluctuations in oil prices and oilrevenues will primarily result in changes in allocations to the Petroleum Fund. Since all of the capitalin the Petroleum Fund is invested abroad, such changes will in principle not influence the level ofactivity in the economy. This makes the Norwegian economy more robust to fluctuations in oil pricesand thus less dependent on oil, even in the short run.
BIS Review 67/200012Chart 11Petroleum activity in 2000We may say that oil revenues enter the Norwegian economy through an external and internal circularflow. The distinction between the external and internal circular flow is important for exchange ratestability. This means, among other things, that short-term changes in oil prices shall not influence theorientation of economic policy. If the distinction between the two circular flows were to break down,and the use of oil revenues were to fluctuate more in step with oil prices, we would have an unstableeconomy, and hence an unstable exchange rate.Let us assume that the oil price temporarily increased by NOK 10 per barrel, or a little less thanUSD 1.50 per barrel. This is a small change in oil prices, well within normal variations from one yearto the next. Central government revenues - and thus the budget surplus - would then increase by aboutNOK 8 billion the first year and NOK 10-11 billion the following year, which is equivalent to nearly1% of Norway’s annual GDP. If the higher revenues are used in the economy through higherexpenditure or reduced taxes in the central government budget, aggregate domestic demand will beaffected. Higher expenditure requires an increase in the public sector’s use of real resources, primarilylabour. One per cent of GDP is then a substantial figure. If the increase in oil revenues is useddomestically in this way, it would correspond to nearly half of the annual growth in the mainlandeconomy in a normal year. If the private sector of the economy is also expanding, and the economy isalready close to capacity limits, this policy will swiftly lead to strong pressures on resources in theeconomy. This will result in a rise in wages and prices. This policy would also lead to unstableconditions in the foreign exchange market. The idea behind the Petroleum Fund is that the revenuesfrom an increase in oil prices of this magnitude shall accrue to the Petroleum Fund and be investedabroad, and that the increase in oil prices shall not influence the rest of the budget. In that case higherrevenues will not influence the domestic economy, but be invested abroad through the PetroleumFund.Structural features of the capital account balanceThe current account surpluses are related to substantial earnings from oil and gas exports. Theserevenues accrue to the state and oil companies and the capital paid in provides a basis for exports ofcapital. In the last five years the central government has exported capital not least through thePetroleum Fund’s investments.
13BIS Review 67/2000Balance of paymentSelected items 1996-1999In NOK billionsWhen petroleum revenues are excluded, the current account shows large deficits. In recent years,however, capital outflows from some sectors of the mainland economy have been considerable. Largeasset managers such as life insurance companies and securities funds accumulated substantial holdingsof foreign equities and bonds in the last half of the 1990s. Portfolio investment abroad reflects a desireto diversify. In the period 1996-May 2000 the capital outflow from the Petroleum Fund, insurancecompanies and securities funds came to altogether NOK 350 billion. In the same period the currentaccount surplus came to NOK 220 billion.This capital outflow has largely been matched by loans raised abroad by banks and other Norwegianenterprises. Norwegian banks have been an important importer of foreign capital. Net capital inflowsto banks amounted to about NOK 140 billion in this period, with short-term capital accounting foralmost half.Chart 12Banks’ gross foreign debtPercent of lending
BIS Review 67/200014Since 1995 there has been a shift towards higher foreign funding in the banking sector. Banks havefinanced the widening difference between customer deposits and lending from foreign sources. Chart12 shows that a large portion of foreign borrowing has been short-term. In 1998, lending growthslowed and customer deposits increased, and growth in banks’ foreign debt came to a halt.In recent years we have thus recorded exports of long-term capital that are considerably higher thanthe current account surplus. The substantial net outflow of long-term capital from the private sectormay partly reflect a thin Norwegian capital market. The Norwegian bond market is not very developedand the value of equities in the Norwegian market in relation to GDP is very low.Chart 13Net fixed investment rate and productivity growth in manufacturingPercentIt is also worth noting that according to highly uncertain national accounts figures, fixed investment isnow at a very low level and there is little growth in productivity in Norwegian manufacturing. Thereare few signs at the moment that the “new economy” has reached this segment of the Norwegianbusiness sector.The trend towards net exports of long-term capital, as seen in the table, and the tentative explanationsthat have been provided may shed some light on why the effective krone exchange rate has beenrelatively weak for the last few years, despite large current account surpluses and short-term interestrates on a par with or higher than in other countries.Thank you for your attention.
1BIS Review 66/2000The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE: Central bank independenceSpeech by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE, Governor of the Bank of England, to the SEANZAGovernors’ Symposium in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 26 August 2000.*      *      *Governor Jayawardena, fellow central bankers, I am honoured, personally and on behalf of the Bankof England to participate in your celebrations.On behalf of the Bank of England, and, I am sure, of all your guests here this morning, I congratulateyou, Mr Governor, on the great contribution that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has made to thedevelopment of your beautiful country in your first fifty years and I wish you continuing success inyour task in the years to come.You invite me to speak about Central Bank Independence, which of course I am happy to do- although I should perhaps make clear at the outset that it is a concept which I find somewhat elusive.Like so many other debates, the debate about central bank independence often seems to becomeunduly polarised.At one extreme it seems that some of those who resist central bank independence as undemocratic - oreven some central bankers who favour it - assume that it involves an elite body of individuals, who,once appointed are, by virtue of statute, beyond political influence, with extensive but onlygenerally-defined powers to affect the financial environment - and hence the lives of individuals andbusinesses throughout their currency area. At the opposite extreme it sometimes seems that the onlyalternative is for the central bank to be simply another arm of government, subservient to financeministers and their officials.Now I don’t know how many of you would recognise yourselves under either of these extremecategorisations. I guess not very many.I have to confess that - however attractive this definition of independence might appear as a centralbanking career option - if this really were the choice to be made, then, as a citizen of a democraticsociety I would have to choose the non-independent alternative. But, of course, the real debate is muchmore subtle and extends across a much narrower part of the spectrum between these polar extremes.The real debate is in fact well described by John Exter, the Federal Reserve Board official, whoadvised on the establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon, as it then was, and stayed on to becomeits first Governor.In his Report - published in November 1949 - Exter presented a draft bill accompanied by acommentary. It is still well worth reading. In that commentary Exter first outlines the case for the newcentral bank being “non-political” and having “a considerable amount of independence” - essentiallyon the grounds that central banking “puts the government into the business life of a country atespecially critical points, namely banking and other credit activities, capital markets, foreign exchangemarkets and the supply of currency”, and that it “embraces problems which are of an unusuallytechnical nature”!But Exter goes on to recognise that “there are many important problems of monetary policy, especiallythose relating to fiscal policy, on which a central bank must necessarily work in close harmony withthe government”. Noting that many governments had learned to value the sort of independent andobjective, detached, advice that central banks are able to give, Exter nevertheless acknowledges that“on matters of vital interest to the state it would be impossible for a central bank to adopt a policycontrary to the policy of the Government of the day”. His killer argument is that no central banker canhelp but be “acutely conscious of the fact that, since no Parliament can bind its successors, theirindependence is limited by the ultimate power of the Government to change the law”.
BIS Review 66/20002He concludes that the exact degree of independence of the central bank is likely to vary from time totime (giving the example of a peacetime and wartime economy) and he describes the ideal as one inwhich there will be continuous and constructive cooperation between the central bank and theGovernment. The effectiveness of this cooperation - he says - will depend more upon the menoccupying the key positions at particular times than upon any legal formula, no matter how carefullyor elaborately it might be worked out.I have quoted from Exter’s Report at some length because of its particular relevance to thisanniversary occasion, but also because, although he was writing in the particular context of Sri Lankaat the end of the 1940’s, contemplating a move from a currency board to a central bank, much of hiscomment is timeless. I should like to elaborate upon - or supplement - some of his themes drawingupon our own experience in the United Kingdom.For just over 50 years - from 1946 to 1998 - the Bank of England operated under legislation which,remarkably, did not attempt to define our objectives or functions - they were simply assumed to carryover from our earlier long history. The 1946 Bank of England Act conferred upon us powers, subjectto the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to issue directions to bankers - though the term“bankers” was not defined; and it provided for the Treasury to give such directions to the Bank as,after consultation with the Governor, they thought necessary in the public interest. Such directionswould necessarily have been made public: none were in fact ever given. In any event the Bank ofEngland was in a formal, statutory, sense throughout this period well along the spectrum towards thesubservient polar extreme which I described earlier, in relation to policy making, although we didenjoy elements of independence, for example, in relation to security of tenure for the duration of fixedterm appointments for Governors and Directors, and in some degree in relation to our finances.I am bound to say though that this was not at all how it felt in practice. Even within this statutoryframework independence is rather like age - you are as independent as you feel!The question really came down to how far we were able to influence the Government, which in turndepended upon how far they themselves valued our advice and how far they felt a need to take accountof it in the light of possible public - including importantly financial market - reactions in the event ofdisagreement. Clearly this put the ball very much in our own court in the sense that we needed to doall that we could to persuade successive Governments, but also financial markets and the public atlarge, of our integrity and objectivity on the one hand and of our technical and analytical competenceon the other. Without that our input to policy would not have been worth very much, and would nothave carried conviction. In fact integrity and objectivity together with professional competence are inmy view the essential foundations of effective independence whatever the statutory framework.Fundamentally it is up to us!For much of the period after 1946 two contextual factors served in any event to limit the degree ofindependence we could realistically expect to achieve.The first was the post-war context of direct intervention and controls, including initially the physicalallocation of scarce materials and consumer rationing but extended to the financial system for examplethrough credit ceilings and directional guidance as well as exchange controls, which were only finallyremoved in 1979. Direct resource allocation rather than allocation through market mechanismsinvolves intrinsically political judgements - choices between the social value of some forms of activityagainst others - which cannot easily be devolved to appointed officials. It would put the officialsdangerously in the political firing line - calling their impartiality and objectivity into question - if theywere. While central banks may legitimately advise on the technical implementation of suchintervention, and be the agency through which it is carried out, it is far better all round in my view thatresponsibility for the choices implicit in such policies remains clearly with the Government.Secondly, for a long time after the war in the UK - until well into the 1970’s, majority opinion did notidentify a specific role for monetary policy within overall economic policy; nor was there any veryclear understanding of the central bank’s role in maintaining systemic financial stability.Economic policy was widely seen as requiring the use of all available policy instruments - monetarypolicy, overall fiscal policy, direct controls, as I say, even prices and incomes policies - in concert to
3BIS Review 66/2000achieve an appropriate balance at any particular time between what were seen as the conflictingobjectives of growth and employment, on the one hand, and controlling inflation and maintainingreasonable balance of payments equilibrium, on the other. Economic policy overall was in factdirected at managing what was seen as the trade-off between these social objectives. And this againinvolved intrinsically political rather than technical judgements, though in this context, too, thereclearly was a role for the central bank in proffering detached technical and analytical advice. Alsoduring this period, while it was accepted that the Bank of England exercised prudential supervisionover the mainstream banking system, there was no effective oversight of the deposit-taking institutionsthat grew up outside the area of controls. It was only in 1979, after the fringe banking crisis of theearly 1970’s, that the Bank was given formal supervisory authority, extending to all deposit-takinginstitutions, but even then with the specific purpose of providing greater protection to depositors.Our world changed, gradually but very markedly, from the 1970’s onwards in all of these respects.Direct methods of monetary control gave way to fully-fledged market-based techniques, encouragingbut also encouraged by intensified financial competition, increasingly driven by the IT revolution.Crucially, a consensus gradually developed - with the Bank’s strong encouragement - across a broadpolitical spectrum in the UK (as it had earlier elsewhere) which recognised that there is in reality notrade-off between growth and stability except possibly in the short term. It recognised in fact thenowadays near-universal central bankers’ mantra that stability is a necessary condition for sustainablegrowth. The consensus recognised, too, that, while overall fiscal policy had significant implicationsfor macro-economic stability over the medium and longer-term it was not sufficiently flexible oradaptable to play the primary stabilising role in the shorter term. That task was specifically allocatedto monetary policy. Finally, there was an emerging recognition of the potential for conflict betweenthe central bank’s necessary concern with systemic financial stability (you cannot hope to delivermonetary stability if the financial system is crashing about your ears, while monetary stability is itselfa primary condition for financial stability) and consumer or depositor protection, which if carried toofar can itself undermine the strength of the financial system.These profound changes in underlying philosophy - which, as I say, spread across much of thepolitical spectrum - were in our case fundamentally important in opening the way to a more clearlydefined and distinctive role for the Bank of England and a necessary condition, in my view, for thedelegation by the Government to the Bank of greater independent, technical, responsibility.Even so, although those changes were a necessary condition, they were not in themselves sufficient,and greater independence did not come all at once.As often happens, sadly, a big step forward came after a major setback. In 1992 after we had beendriven unceremoniously out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (following the boom and bustof the late 1980s / early 1990s), the Government of the day adopted an explicit inflation target as thenominal anchor for monetary policy. Interest rate decisions in pursuit of that target remained with theChancellor of the Exchequer after consultation with myself as Governor and my senior monetarypolicy experts at the Bank. But the really novel feature of the new arrangements was theirtransparency. The Bank was required by the Government to publish a quarterly Inflation Reportsetting out the background to the monetary policy decisions and the prognosis, and, going further,Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, subsequently decided that minutes of our policymaking meetings shouldbe published six weeks or so after the event.This degree of transparency was a bold and far-reaching step. Before that - apart from the dozen or sopeople directly involved in the decision-making process - no one knew with any certainty whether themistakes that were made were a result of intervention by the Prime Minister, bad decisions by theChancellor, with or without advice from Treasury officials, or bad advice from the Governor and/orhis colleagues at the Bank. We all kept our heads down when things went badly, only putting themabove the parapet when things went well. The Bank was, it is true, able within limits to explain itsthinking publicly when summoned to appear before the relevant House of Commons SelectCommittee, or through Governor’s speeches, and this possibility may have acted as some kind of aconstraint on the Government, but such opportunities needed to be used with discretion or they couldhave caused a breakdown in the “continuous and constructive cooperation between the central bank
BIS Review 66/20004and the Government” which Exter rightly identified as the ideal - I would say even essential -relationship.I think successive Chancellors came to recognise that the opaqueness of the existing decision-makingprocess was inappropriate in principle in an effective democracy, which requires that we should eachbe accountable for the decisions that we take or for the advice that we give. They may also havethought that the public generally and Parliament in particular would not put up with it for much longeranyway. Or they may simply have felt that they were no longer prepared to carry the can for the badadvice they received. Whatever the motivation it is to their great credit that they were prepared to puttheir own reputations - as well as that of the Bank - on the line in this way! It not only allowed theBank to express its own analysis and judgements about monetary policy publicly, it actually requiredus to do so. That really concentrated the mind I can tell you; and it provided us with added stimulus tosharpen up our act. But for it to have this effect it was crucial that the intended integrity of the processwas respected. What you saw in the minutes of “the Ken and Eddie show” was verbatim the advicewhich I gave to the Chancellor and which I had discussed with senior colleagues beforehand.This new transparency was a big step towards greater independence for the Bank. But it was carriedmuch further by Chancellor Gordon Brown, as literally the new Labour Government’s first act ofpolicy - just four days after coming into office in 1997 - when he announced that the Bank wouldhenceforth be independently responsible for the operation of monetary policy. This commitment wassubsequently embodied in a new Bank of England Act that came into effect in 1998.The key characteristics of the new legislation were clarity of definition of the Bank’s responsibilities,and transparency and elaborate provision for public accountability for the manner in which thoseresponsibilities are carried out.In relation to monetary policy in particular the new Act defines our responsibility as “to maintain pricestability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government including itsobjectives for growth and employment”. It is the Chancellor who defines what, more precisely, is to beunderstood by “price stability” which he has done in the form of a symmetrical 2½% target for aparticular statistical measure of retail prices. So we have “instrument” rather than “goal”independence.It is sometimes suggested that this is a second best arrangement. In our national context at least Idisagree with that view. The precise objective of policy - even within the confines of the concept ofprice stability - remains a political decision: there will always be those who argue for a somewhathigher or somewhat lower target, and the fact that the Government endorses a precise target rather thanjust the vaguer goal of “stability” certainly strengthens our hand by allowing us to concentrate uponour essentially technical task. I am bound to say that in practice it seems to me to be rather a secondorder issue anyway given the narrowness of the range of definitions of “stability” that would carryconviction with the public, including financial markets.The Act confers the responsibility for meeting the Government’s inflation target specifically on anewly created Monetary Policy Committee, comprising myself as Chairman, the two DeputyGovernors, two Executive Directors appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Chancellorand four members appointed from outside the Bank by the Chancellor. The Governors are appointedas members of the Committee for their full five year (renewable) terms; the remaining members areappointed for three year terms which are also renewable. The Committee’s policy meetings are alsoattended by a senior Treasury Official in the capacity of an observer, who may participate in thediscussion - essentially to inform the Committee of any relevant aspects of the Government’s widereconomic policies and explain the Committee’s thinking to the Chancellor - but he may not express aview on the monetary policy decision or, of course, vote on that decision.One can argue endlessly about the precise composition of the Committee, their term of appointmentand so on. The key consideration for me is that all nine members need to be genuinely independent,technical experts in the field of monetary policy or a closely related field, not representatives of anyparticular social or industrial grouping. The objective of policy is appropriately determined by ademocratic process; the Committee’s job is, as I say, a technical one, which requires relevant technicalexpertise.
5BIS Review 66/2000The transparency of the Committee’s decision-making process is assured by continuation of therequirements that we should produce our quarterly Inflation Report and publish minutes of ourmonthly meetings, which we have now chosen to do with just a two week delay. Transparency isfurther enhanced by a requirement that the minutes should record how each individual member of theCommittee voted on the interest rate decision.As before, it is vital for public confidence in these new arrangements that their intention is notsubverted by the evolution of informal conventions - that the integrity of the procedures is respected.In this context we take great pains to ensure that the true nature of the policy debate is reflected in theminutes and that the range of views around our inflation forecast is properly reflected in the InflationReport. In fact I think we probably tend to err on the side of drawing too much, rather than too little,attention to differences of opinion within the Committee which are often largely a question of nuance.But it is better in my view to err on that side rather than to attempt to submerge the differences. We donot, however, attribute particular views to particular individuals. To do so would invite preparedstatements and militate against the inter-active debate which is an outstanding and immensely valuablecharacteristic of our meetings. It would suppress the kind of “what if” discussion in which the sameindividual may explore alternative views. No attempt is made to concert the outcome of the policydecision; in fact I go out of my way to discourage any kind of collusion, whether between the internalor external members of the Committee - we are, and must remain, nine independent members,individually accountable for our decisions as to how we vote.This, of course, means that the Committee is divided as often as not; but although this initially led topublic comment to the effect that the Committee did not know what it was doing and could not makeup its mind, it is now generally accepted as the natural order of things and helps to underline to thepublic at large that monetary policy making cannot be a precise science - however much it needs to beinformed by all the science available to us. That, in our context, is I think now much easier tounderstand than a more consensual approach would be, but there was certainly a learning period.It has been suggested to me that the arrangements I have described somehow diminish the position ofthe Governor. Well if that’s true this Governor at least welcomes it! I am sure that all of you are wellaware of how finely balanced monetary policy decisions are at the margin, and that all of you haveagonised, just as I have, over the right thing to do and the right time to do it. I find the cross-bearingson those decisions provided by the other Committee members - and they are I remind you all highlyqualified experts in their own right - immensely reassuring. If a majority of them argued for aparticular decision, that would certainly weigh heavily with me, although - as a matter of personalintegrity - I always reserve the right to take a different point of view from that of the majority on thoseoccasions when I am particularly confident of my own judgement. That has not so far happened but italmost certainly will; people should not be unduly surprised.Finally, in relation to monetary policy, let me say a few words about accountability. In the terms of thenew Act the Monetary Policy Committee - apart from its public accountability through the InflationReport and the minutes of its meetings - is accountable for the adequacy of its procedure to theNon-Executive Members on the Bank of England’s Board of Directors, who in turn report toParliament through the medium of the Bank’s Annual Report. We are all accountable to Parliament inthe sense that we may be - and regularly are - summoned to appear before the relevant SelectCommittees of both Upper and Lower Houses. And we are accountable to the Chancellor in that theChairman of the MPC is required to write him an open letter if the rate of inflation diverges by morethan one percent either side of the 2½% target explaining why and what steps we propose to take tobring inflation back within that range and over what time period. Finally, the Treasury has the powerto give the Bank directions in respect of monetary policy if they are satisfied that the directions arerequired in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances.Again, some observers have suggested that these elaborate accountability provisions are onerous andconstrain the Bank’s independence. I take the contrary view, that they are essential to the legitimacy ofthe arrangements as a whole and so actually reinforce our independence - provided of course we areable to provide convincing explanations of our conduct! And the likely public and financial market
BIS Review 66/20006reaction is, in my view, the most effective protection against abuse of the Treasury’s emergencypowers.What I have described up to this point relates solely to monetary policy. But the new legislationsimilarly deals with the Bank’s other key responsibility - maintaining financial stability. And at therisk of trying your patience let me say a few words about that. Less than a fortnight after announcingthe Bank’s new independent responsibility for the operation of monetary policy, Chancellor GordonBrown announced that the Bank’s responsibility for banking supervision would pass to a newinstitution - the Financial Services Authority, or FSA - which would assume responsibility for theregulation and supervision of all financial institutions in the UK. This was widely seen as the price wehad to pay for our enhanced monetary policy role. But at the same time the Chancellor confirmed theBank’s continuing responsibility for the stability of the financial system as a whole, so that in factwhat this has done - as in relation to monetary policy - is to distinguish and clarify the respective roles:of the Bank, which now focuses upon systemic risk - and retains its lender of last resort role withinparameters that are broadly defined by the legislation; of the FSA which oversees both the prudentialand business conduct of all individual financial institutions, including the banks, with the emphasis onconsumer protection; and the Treasury, which has ultimate responsibility for both these dimensions.The new arrangements make a good deal of sense in the UK context where traditional distinctionsbetween banks and other types of financial institution have progressively eroded and where there hasbeen a general movement towards greater consumer protection across a much broader front. But at thesame time as clarifying our respective responsibilities, and providing in each case for transparency andseparate accountability for the way in which they are carried out, the new legislation recognises thevital importance of close coordination between them and establishes a framework for that. It is earlydays to assess the effectiveness of these arrangements, but my impression is that so far they areworking well.Governor Jayawardena, there are many aspects of our new regime that I have not touched upon- including questions relating to our capital, our revenues, expenditure and allocation of profits andhow they are reported and accounted for - which can also affect the degree of independence we enjoy.Perhaps we might explore these together with the other issues in our discussion. But I hope I have saidenough to draw a few conclusions.My starting point had been that central bank independence in the extreme sense of exemption fromdemocratic control is unrealistic and inappropriate. Yet wise governments in many countries aroundthe world have recognised that they can gain advantage - in terms of public and market credibility -from detached and unbiased advice in its field of competence from the central bank. The value thatthey put on the central bank’s role depends very much on the quality of that advice - the central bank’sobjectivity and its technical expertise and professional competence. That is largely down to us. But thebenefit a government derives from it depends too upon the advice being seen to be detached andunbiased, as well as technically expert and professionally competent. And that depends also upon thegovernment. It can discourage the central bank from expressing views in public but gain little in termsof credibility from doing so; it can to varying degrees encourage greater independence on the basisthat this would strengthen public confidence but accepting that it could involve a greater degree ofconstraint on its policies; or, where there exists a sufficient consensus on the particular role ofmonetary and financial policy, it can devolve operational responsibilities to the central bank, holding itpublicly accountable for the way in which it exercises those responsibilities but accepting thelimitation that such arrangements place on the government’s own operational discretion.There is no single model to fit all situations. The appropriate arrangements for a particular country atany particular time depend upon the economic and financial environment and upon politicalperceptions relating to the approach to monetary and financial policy. I believe that we are now wellserved in the case of the UK by the present arrangements involving operational independence, basedupon the principles of clearly defined responsibilities, transparency and accountability, which I havedescribed. But I am very conscious that, whatever the formal arrangements applying to the centralbank, the political and public confidence on which our position depends is something that we, all ofus, need continuously to earn through personal and professional integrity, objectivity and competence.It is in the end, as I say, up to us.
1BIS Review 65/2000David Carse: Banking in Hong Kong after the Asian crisisSpeech by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at aLuncheon Meeting of the Ginyukai, held on 21 August 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I am very pleased to be here to address this luncheon meeting of the Ginyukai. Although I meetJapanese banks on an individual basis quite frequently, I see them as a group less often than I used tobefore the Asian crisis. In my earlier days in Hong Kong, we used to meet regularly at the numerousopening ceremonies and receptions of Japanese banks who were setting up new offices in Hong Kong.Over the last two years however I have been dealing with the voluntary revocation of the licenses ofmany of these same banks as they depart the Territory. This is a much sadder task than cutting theribbon at an opening ceremony.The figures tell their own story. In March 1997, there were 91 Japanese authorised institutions in HongKong. This includes some banks with multiple authorisations, for example as licensed banks and asdeposit-taking companies. By June of this year, the number of authorised institutions had dropped to35, a decline of 60%.The reasons behind this decline are varied. Some of the Japanese banks were forced to cut theiroverseas operations, including those in Hong Kong, because of critical balance sheet problems andheavy losses. Equally, it has to be said that a number of the regional banks who came to Hong Kong inthe 1990s lacked a clear business rationale for doing so and found it difficult to make money. Giventhe difficult economic climate back in Japan, it was probably right for these banks to cut their lossesand go home.Even the Japanese banks that stayed have cut back on their lending here. Between March 1997 andJune 2000, the total lending of the Japanese banks in Hong Kong fell from just over HK$2,000 billionto HK$643 billion, a decline of almost 70%. This has reduced the Japanese banks’ market share oftotal loans in Hong Kong from 51% in 1997 to around 25%.Of course, I am aware that these figures are a bit misleading, as Mr Kato of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishirecently pointed out to the press. Most of the decline in total loans was accounted for by euro-yenloans. These are yen loans to Japanese borrowers that were formerly booked offshore in Hong Kongfor a variety of reasons, including funding costs and domestic regulations. A change in theseregulations now makes it more feasible to book these loans onshore in Japan, hence the sharp declinein the amounts booked in Hong Kong.Having said that, the Japanese banks’ loans for use in Hong Kong have also fallen during the Asiancrisis, though to a lesser extent. Japanese banks currently account for about 8% of total loans for use inHong Kong, compared with 12% before the crisis. However, there have been welcome signs that thedecline in the Japanese banks’ domestic loans in Hong Kong has been levelling off this year.Moreover, in the Hong Kong syndicated loan market, it appears that the Japanese banks haverecovered some of their appetite for lending. According to the figures collected by Basis Point, in 1998the Japanese banks had dropped to 8th place in the league table of completed loans, with dealsamounting to only US$288 million. In the first half of 2000, however, the Japanese banks hadcompleted loan deals amounting to almost US$2 billion and had climbed to 3rd place in the leaguetable.I hope that this is a trend that will continue. Japanese banks have in the past made a significantcontribution to promoting the growth of the Hong Kong economy and I am sure that they will be ableto resume this role in the future. This may, however, involve less reliance on straightforward lendingthan in the past and a greater focus on capital market activities.
BIS Review 65/20002The Japanese banks have been through difficult times due to the collapse of the boom economy inJapan and the impact of the Asian crisis. Things are now looking brighter. The banks have beenaddressing their bad debt problems and have been assisted in this by capital support from theGovernment; two of the weakest banks have been nationalised and subsequently sold back into privateownership; and four mega-mergers have been announced which offer the banks concerned the chanceto improve their competitiveness at home and abroad.However, you will be more aware than I am that important challenges lie ahead for the Japanesebanks. The domestic environment within which they are operating is still uncertain. Although theJapanese economy is showing signs of recovery, the IMF has recently pointed out that the pickupremains “fragile and subject to downside risks”. Consumer confidence is still weak and the corporatesector remains under some strain as shown by the rise of 21% in corporate bankruptcies in the year toJuly. The recent termination of the Bank of Japan’s zero interest rate policy has led to fears thatcorporate finances may be put under further pressure.This is a difficult environment in which the Japanese banks are embarking on their mergers. From mydiscussions with the banks concerned it is clear that they know what needs to be done in order toachieve the desired synergies and economies of scale. But it all depends on the quality of theimplementation. Unlike the case with some past Japanese mergers, the banks will need to achieve fullintegration in their operations, technology, management and culture as quickly as possible, and jobswill have to be lost. There must be a much greater focus than in the past on return on capital and onthe generation of shareholder value rather than on pursuit of size and market share for its own sake.This is something in which we all have an interest. It is important for the stability of the worldfinancial system and for the economic development of the Asian region that the banks of the world’ssecond largest economy are fully restored to health and can resume their major role in financialintermediation at home and abroad. I wish you therefore all the best in your efforts.As I mentioned earlier, the Japanese banks have been and will remain an important part of thefinancial system in Hong Kong. They also of course have a similar role to play in relation to MainlandChina. I am aware that the Japanese banks felt particularly disappointed and aggrieved at the collapseof Gitic and the subsequent debt problems that afflicted other Mainland window companies. I do notintend to go over the past history of this episode that is hopefully now coming to an end. But it ispossible to see some good coming out of it if it helps, as I hope it will, to restore financial disciplinewithin China. It has also served as a useful reminder to both domestic and foreign banks in HongKong not to engage in name lending and not to rely on implicit guarantees. While financialtransparency among Mainland companies is by no means perfect, lenders are now at least betterequipped to identify those companies that have sound underlying businesses and good management.The long saga of GDE is now drawing to a close. The banks have, I believe, managed to negotiate thebest deal possible, and the last remaining step is for the banks to review and sign the detaileddocumentation to put the restructuring into effect. I understand that when the documentation is sent tothe banks, they will have plenty to read. But I hope that they will try to do this as quickly as possibleand that we can avoid any last minute problems and delays. There is unlikely to be any opportunity forrenegotiation of the deal, and if it were to collapse at the final stage, the banks would certainly beworse off.So far I have been concentrating on the position of the Japanese banks. Let me now review the moregeneral state of banking in Hong Kong after the Asian crisis.The first point to make is that the local Hong Kong banks have survived the crisis in good shape.Although one or two banks lost money, most banks remained profitable and actually managed toimprove their capital ratios during the period as their risk assets declined and their capital baseexpanded. No banks required financial assistance from the Government during the crisis, in contrast tothe situation in some of our Asian neighbours where the cost to the public finances of bank rescuesand restructuring could reach as much as US$100 billion.The rapid recovery in the Hong Kong economy is now helping to improve the banks’ performance andto bring down bad debts. In the first half of this year, the pre-tax operating profits of the local banks
3BIS Review 65/2000from their Hong Kong operations rose in aggregate by more than 50% over the same period of lastyear. Admittedly, much of this was due to the reduction of 58% in the bad debt charge, which will be atemporary factor in improving profitability. But even at the pre-provision level, profits grew by about15% compared with 1999. Surprisingly, after the publicity about declining margins on mortgagelending, the growth in profits was helped by an increase in the overall net interest margin. Thisreflected the fact that funding costs remained low during the period.The position of the local Hong Kong banks is therefore looking better than at any time since the Asiancrisis. However, like the Japanese banks, the banks here are also faced by a number of importantchallenges, albeit on a smaller scale than those in Japan.Foremost amongst these is increasing competition. This is being displayed most obviously in thedecline in lending margins already mentioned, particularly on residential mortgage lending which is amajor part of the loan portfolio of most of the local banks. The margin has recently reached a new lowof 2.25% below prime compared with the pre-crisis level of 1.25% above prime. To some extent thisreflects the temporary conditions of a depressed property sector, sluggish loan demand and plentifulliquidity. As loan demand picks up, as inevitably it will, the decline in margins will stabilise and mayeven reverse somewhat. But lending margins are unlikely to get back to where they were before thecrisis.Competitive pressures will be further intensified on the funding side when we deregulate current andsavings accounts next year. This is due to take place at the end of June 2001, and will only bepostponed if the prevailing economic and financial conditions are clearly unfavourable, which we donot expect to be the case. The banks therefore need to prepare for the pressure on margins that this willcause and to be able to quickly introduce new deposit products like interest bearing current accounts.If they do not do so, their competitors will.How do the local banks need to respond to these challenges? Most obviously, the challenges raise theissue of consolidation of the banking sector, through either merger or take-over. This is the trend wehave seen happen in other financial centres, including in Japan. It has been slow to take off here, but itis going to come, sooner rather than later, as competition gathers pace. Events such as the sale of theChase retail banking business, the restructuring of the Bank of China Group and the renewed interestof some foreign banks in acquiring an increased presence in Hong Kong will help to alter thecompetitive balance and could act as catalysts for change.Banks also need to respond by properly harnessing the power of new technology, including theinternet, to bring down costs and increase their ability to cross-sell a wider range of products. Theymay find it easier to finance the necessary investment, and obtain the skills and human resources theyneed, as part of larger units - which is a further argument in favour of consolidation.Finally, I strongly believe that banks in Hong Kong and elsewhere must become more aware of, andresponsive to, consumer needs. This not only means supplying the products that customers want butalso providing them with easy to understand information about the terms and conditions of theseproducts, including the fees and charges that attach to them. Hong Kong banks have not beensufficiently transparent in this respect, as a recent Consumer Council report on credit card charges hasdemonstrated. This is something that we will be aiming to put right in the current review of the Codeof Banking Practice.What does this mean for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority? Clearly, we also have to upgrade ourown skills and methods in our role as banking regulator to try to ensure that we can keep up withdevelopments in the market. This is most obviously the case with the new technology that requires usto devise new policies on innovations like virtual banking and internet security. This means that weneed to find and train staff who understand the technicalities and are capable of assessing throughonsite examination the adequacy of the banks’ controls over the new technology. As you will knowyourselves, people with this expertise are in short supply.This emphasis on technology is however only part of the process of trying to make our supervisionmore risk-based. This is the same approach that is being adopted by the FSA in Japan. It aims to focuson the “self-responsibility” of the banks themselves in ensuring that they have adequate systems to
BIS Review 65/20004identify, measure, monitor and control the whole range of risks with which they are faced. The role ofthe supervisor is then to assess the quality of the banks’ own systems in relation to the quantity of therisks they are running, and to require improvements if these are necessary.We have been developing this new approach for the last year with the help of the consultant secondedfrom the US Federal Reserve. So far the main focus has been on the local banks, but we hope to roll itout to the foreign banks next year. Hopefully, by focussing on the key risk areas, it should reducesome of your regulatory burden.We recognise that this process has to be transparent, in that we need to explain to the banks what thenew supervisory framework involves and what standards are expected of the banks. The examinationchecklists issued by the Japanese FSA are a good example of this approach. I know that some of theJapanese banks feel that the HKMA could do more along these lines in the area of transparency, andthis is something that we have very much in mind. We will be publishing soon a framework documentthat explains the risk-based approach, and we are currently engaged in the major rewrite of all oursupervisory guidelines. The aim is to put them into a common format and to make the text more userfriendly and easier to read. This is a big task that will take about a year to complete in full. In themeantime, all our existing guidelines are available on our website, and individual guidelines in thenew format will be added as they are produced.I hope that you have found useful this assessment of the state of the Hong Kong banking sector, andthe current position of the Japanese banks within it. Let me stress again that we greatly value thepresence of the Japanese banks in Hong Kong. While this presence may have diminished over the lasttwo years, Hong Kong remains an important market for the Japanese banks and I am sure that you willcontinue to demonstrate your commitment in the years to come.
1BIS Review 65/2000Urban Bäckström: Some reflections on financial and monetary stabilitySpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, at a seminar in Bangkok hosted bythe Bank of Thailand, on 24 August 2000.*      *      *Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,I would like to thank my dear colleague, Governor Sonakul at the Bank of Thailand, for the invitationto visit Bangkok and for the opportunity to address this distinguished audience this evening.In recent years, significant progress has been made in putting the global economy on a path towardssustainable growth. The world economy entered the year 2000 in considerably better shape than manyof us would have expected just a year ago. And after recovering to near its long-term average in 1999,global growth is forecast to go on accelerating in 2000.It is especially noteworthy that performance has improved in almost every region of the world.Southeast Asia, Russia and Brazil have all rebounded from their recent crises more strongly thanexpected. Many of the world’s poorest countries, including some in Africa, are posting respectablegrowth rates. The US economy is enjoying its longest recorded expansion ever. Growth in continentalEurope is picking up - especially in the larger economies where growth had been relatively weak. Andthere are signs of an incipient recovery in Japan.It is an indication of how far we have come that the weaknesses and uncertainties which sopreoccupied policymakers and market participants in 1997, 1998 and early 1999 have given way toconcerns about overheating in some parts of the world. The acceleration in global growth hasrefocused attention on inflationary pressures and on sustaining the monetary stability that economicpolicymakers have strived so hard to achieve in recent years.Steps are also being taken nationally and internationally to improve the working of the financialsystem. Ensuring financial stability has indeed become an important task in the light of events in thepast decade - years that saw financial problems in a number of European countries as well as inMexico and Asia, the devaluation of the rouble and suspended payments in Russia, the collapse of thehedgefund Long Term Capital Management, considerable turbulence in western financial markets andfinancial unrest in Brazil. The crisis in the international financial system developed, to cite PresidentClinton, from being “just a few small glitches in the road” into “the worst financial crisis in fiftyyears”.Although the momentum of the world economy and the policy actions taken to date to ensure financialand monetary stability give grounds for optimism, there are still challenges ahead of us. In my talktonight I will discuss a few of these challenges.Financial stabilityThe transition to a more global financial system has certainly not been free from problems. It shouldnot be forgotten that extensive capital regulations entail a mispricing of risks. Deregulation then leadsto desirable price adjustments. But it is during these transitional corrections that financial problems areliable to occur. Changes have often outstripped the ability of the system, including the institutionalinfrastructure, to keep pace. In most cases, neither the banks nor the public authorities had thenecessary prerequisites for adapting to the new conditions that a freer capital market created. Theexpansion of lending had too free a rein in many countries and the authorities did not adequatelymonitor what was happening at either micro or macro level.
BIS Review 65/20002Due to a rapid expansion of credit, the deregulation and opening up of the domestic financial systemwas often followed by economic overheating. Asset prices rose sharply and imbalances developed.Furthermore, in countries with a fixed exchange rate system, extensive short-term borrowing abroadwas stimulated. A large proportion of these funds was often channelled through the domestic bankingsystem and rendered this rather vulnerable. When capital flows subsequently reversed, the adjustmentwas often dramatic. Production fell, unemployment rose and both the currency and the banking systemfaced an acute crisis.Although several factors may have played some part in the run-up to recent financial crises, it isimportant to bear in mind that a deregulated financial system with free capital movements is not thebasic problem. Modern international financial markets have possibly contributed to an earlierappearance of crises and to their spread, but financial crises almost always originate in an unsuccessfuldomestic economic policy and in the structure and regulation of the domestic financial system.It is striking that several countries most affected by financial turbulence in the 1990s were relativelynew participants in the international financial system without having first established a sound domesticfinancial system and a sound economic policy. That applies to my own country, Sweden, whichexperienced a severe crisis in the early 1990s.One obvious insight is, and I quote Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, “that participation in theinternational financial system with all its benefits carries with it an obligation to maintain a level ofstability and a set of strong and transparent institutions and rules if an economy is to participate safelyand effectively in markets that have become highly sensitive to misallocation of capital and otherpolicy errors”.To say that the key to avoiding future crises in emerging markets must be found in domestic reforms isnot to deny that part of the solution may still lie in measures that change the way in whichinternational financial markets sometimes operate. While financial liberalisation and internationalfinancial integration bring unquestionable benefits, they can also be subject to episodes of excessiverisk-taking. In recent years, there does seem to have been imprudent lending, and not just to emergingmarket economies but also to borrowers within the industrial world.In part this has been spurred by competitive forces. That such forces will diminish as financialrestructuring accelerates seems unlikely. Information asymmetries lie at the heart of market failure,and the market's way of resolving them can give rise to unpredictable outcomes. Ensuring that marketshave adequate information about national economies, the strength of financial systems, aggregatepositions and the financial standing of counterparties is important. Equally important, if not more so, isto ensure that market participants' approach to risk management reflects the full balance of costs andrewards implied in their decisions.Given the costs and the difficulties of managing the successive crises over the past decade, we mustcontinue to devote considerable efforts to avoiding future crises and try hard to understand the kinds ofvulnerability that lie behind them. The work now being carried out in various international fora isthorough and can be summarised under three headings: crisis prevention, crisis containment and crisisresolution. Much of this work involves international institutions like, for instance, the InternationalMonetary Fund, the World Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, and the OECD, as well as the Financial Stability Forum.However, it is with national authorities that the often hard work of implementing policies and codeslies. The measures will contribute to better financial stability only if countries actually adopt andimplement them. A crucial ingredient in achieving this is of course to involve countries, formally orinformally, in the development of the policies, codes and standards. But even if that is achieved, Iknow from my own experience how difficult the actual implementation sometimes can be, not least forpolitical reasons.The events of the past decade have made it clear that greater efforts are needed to strengthen thefunctioning of markets. I would like to make the point that today’s favourable trends in the worldeconomy should not lead us to conclude that the danger is over. We have witnessed too many crises inthe last decade not to know that market confidence can suddenly shift. Instead, policymakers
3BIS Review 65/2000throughout the world must continue to work on forestalling new problems both because some evidentthreats to international financial and economic stability still remain and because there may well bevulnerabilities that are less evident. But the chances of the global economy continuing along the pathtowards sustainable growth without disruptive financial instability can be enhanced by implementingappropriate reforms.Monetary stabilityLet me now turn to monetary stability. In the last decade a growing number of countries have chosento conduct monetary policy with an explicit target for inflation. One reason behind this choice has nodoubt been these countries’ poor experience with a fixed, but adjustable, exchange rate regime.The first country to formally adopt a policy of targeting inflation was New Zealand in 1990. Canadadid the same in 1991, followed by the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. Other countries havealso introduced some variant of inflation targeting since then.It is interesting to note that before the 1990s the predominant view was that a floating exchange rateregime was not suitable for a small open economy. Today, I believe that experience has beenexceptionally good among those countries that are targeting inflation. In fact, even some emergingmarket countries are now building the same kind of regime. In recent years countries such as SouthAfrica, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Poland and Thailand have been inspired to introduce a similarstrategy. Consequently inflation targets are now introduced in quite a number of countries.Let me take this opportunity to commend the Governor of the Bank of Thailand and the bank’s stafffor the first excellent Inflation Report that was presented in July. The report is very impressive and ithas given me quite a few new ideas.The challenge during the 1990s for the inflation targeting countries has been to build a rigorousframework around the new regime. Questions like the choice of rate and index to be targeted, theusefulness of bands around the target and the degree of transparency all needed to be answered.It has also been important to formulate a monetary policy reaction function, that is, to define thebalance between inflation variability and output variability. The reason why central banks do not aimfor maximum short-term stability in either inflation or output is that attaining only one of the targetswould be costly for the economy.On the one hand, the central bank’s legitimacy among the general public could suffer if short-terminterest rates have to move sharply, causing output to fluctuate widely while inflation is held stableand exactly on the target. Maximum stability in output could, on the other hand, result in sharpfluctuations in the rate of inflation and erode the credibility of the monetary regime. A pointsomewhere midway between the two extremes must therefore be found.Let me also stress the importance of central bank independence. In order to be successful with theimplementation of an inflation target approach, the central bank must be able to act independently ofday-to-day party politics and to set interest rates continuously according to the specified inflationtarget. Otherwise a credibility problem arises because it will be hard for policymakers to convince thegeneral public of monetary policy’s long-term nature. Lack of credibility, in turn, means that thecentral bank has to set its interest rates higher than otherwise would have been the case.Looking ahead, I believe there are at least two major questions that central banks have to address morethoroughly.First, how should monetary policy react to asset prices, such as equity and/or real estate prices? Weknow from history that the development of asset prices can have a significant impact on both inflationand real economic activity. We need to establish whether or not there are actions that central banks canand should take to minimise the likelihood of macroeconomic instability arising from extremefluctuations in asset prices.Second, how should monetary policy react to structural changes in the economy?
BIS Review 65/20004Monetary policy and asset pricesLet me start with the question of monetary policy’s response to movements in asset prices. Thisdepends in turn on how the central bank chooses to use the information contained in asset prices.In a regime that explicitly targets inflation, asset prices are taken into account via the effects onaggregate demand. Rising share prices increase household wealth and that would raise consumptionfor a given level of income if these increments to wealth are considered to be of a permanent nature.At the same time, consumer confidence boosted by higher share prices could potentially makeindividuals more prone to spend their increased wealth.An increase in share prices also makes investment more attractive to firms since it increases collateralvalues and lowers the cost of new capital relative to existing capital. If share prices predict higherexpected output growth, this could also lead to more investment.If the asset prices on which households and firms base their consumption and investment decisionsprove to be too optimistic, this would create inflationary pressure in the short term. An importantquestion in this context is how sensitive households’ and firms’ consumption and investmentresponses are to changes in asset prices.Via the effects on inflation, asset prices are thus taken into account in the formulation of monetarypolicy, although they do not feature explicitly in the target variable.However, the simple use of financial asset prices as indicators is not a panacea for the central banks’forecasting problems. Asset prices can move for a variety of reasons. Understanding those reasons isimportant in determining the appropriate monetary policy response. For example, if a rise in shareprices stems from increased productivity and thus from expectations of higher future profits, theimplications for monetary policy would be very different from a case with no such fundamental reasonfor the higher share prices.This raises a number of questions. One pertains to the relative informativeness of different kinds ofasset prices. Another is how to integrate the information obtained from asset prices with othermacroeconomic information. Notwithstanding the empirical evidence of the indicator properties ofasset prices, the causal relationships between asset prices and real macroeconomic variables haveproved to be more difficult to understand and model. But, as I have just illustrated, the answers tothese questions can be very important for monetary policy. It seems quite clear that central bankscannot afford to adopt a view of asset markets as merely “side-shows”.There can be other, sometimes less straightforward, situations where monetary policy has reason toreact to movements in asset prices even though the effect on inflation is negligible. One such reason isthe central bank’s responsibility for the financial system’s stability.If asset prices have been driven up to unsustainable levels that do not correspond to the underlyingfundamentals, we are faced with a special kind of problem. We know from experience that speculativeasset price bubbles eventually burst. When they do, collateral values will fall and balance sheetsdeteriorate, potentially threatening the stability of the banking system. To avoid this kind ofdevelopment, the central bank needs to closely monitor the potential for excessive credit growth andthe possibility of asset price bubbles building up.It seems that historically the forming of speculative price bubbles has been closely linked to anexcessive expansion of credit. But we need to operationalise both the concept “excessive” and thedifficult concept of an asset’s “fundamental value”. As history has shown us, judging to what extentrising asset prices reflect strong fundamentals, rather than the “irrational exuberance” of investors, iseasier said than done.Nevertheless, certain important risks related to asset prices need careful watching in today’s world.The first risk is that imprudent lending could fuel unwarranted asset price increases - as so often in thepast. Although there is little evidence to date of a general lowering of credit standards, credit growthhas been very rapid and loans to finance equity purchases have risen sharply in some countries.
5BIS Review 65/2000Ensuring that investors are not sheltered from the consequences of their sometimes misguidedinvestments is important for maintaining prudent lending standards. It is important that the messagefrom central banks is clear: investors should not count on monetary policy underwriting any particularvaluation of equity markets.A second and related risk is that high asset prices might lead to complacency about debt levels.Household and corporate balance sheets may look healthy when asset prices are stable or increasing,but what if prices fall? Similarly, debt servicing ratios for some emerging market countries may looksustainable when market access is improving, but what will happen if interest rates rise?Rising levels of household and corporate indebtedness in some industrial countries, as well as risinglevels of external indebtedness in a number of emerging market countries, are based on expectations ofcontinued strong growth in income and production. Earlier I remarked that the momentum of theworld economy and the policy actions taken to date give reason for optimism. However, volatility isintrinsic to financial markets. Our experience during the 1990’s clearly demonstrates the danger ofbasing decisions solely on a single central scenario, rather than on a range of possible - includingworst case - scenarios.Monetary policy and structural changesLet me now briefly touch upon the question of how monetary policy should react to structural changesin the economy? Quite a lot of thinking has already been done on this issue, both among academicsand policymakers. Nevertheless, I believe that more must be done in this field, especially since at leastsome parts of the world economy have seen something of a productivity shock in recent years. I amdeliberately avoiding the buzzword “new economy” here, since history has been full of expressionslike that ever since the turn of the 19th century.The discussion about monetary policy and a productivity shock is taking place mostly in the UnitedStates, in the light of the impressive economic performance there and the acceleration in the rate ofproductivity growth. So one could certainly ask: what about the rest of the world? The possibility of aproductivity breakthrough also in other parts of the world cannot of course be ruled out.Higher - or accelerating - productivity growth does indeed pose new challenges for monetary policy. Itcould set in motion a complex of effects on aggregate supply and demand, on inflation, equity pricesand interest rates. Just to give a few examples, let me briefly mention the following effects.First, a positive productivity shock raises the economy’s potential growth rate. It also affectsaggregate demand through new, profitable investment opportunities, higher equity prices andexpectations among households of higher permanent income. One question for policymakers iswhether the demand effects are so powerful that they have the potential to outpace the growth ofaggregate supply in the short and medium perspective.Second, there could be temporary disinflation effects at work if the increase in productivity isunexpected initially. If wages are slow to adjust, higher productivity growth lowers unit labour costsand thereby reduces price inflation. Here again there are important questions for policymakers. Shouldthis effect be allowed to result in a temporary reduction of price inflation or unemployment?Third, an increase in the trend rate of productivity growth could also result in a higher equilibrium realinterest rate, when the output gap is closed, in order to balance saving and investment. Fiscal policyand the development of public financial balances could at least partly offset this effect, as could theeconomy’s degree of openness.All this implies that monetary policymakers could face quite a few challenges. One of them is toidentify structural changes and distinguish these from cyclical variations. Another challenge is todetect the magnitude of the effects. Furthermore, looking ahead in monetary policy is hard when theeconomy is going through major changes that make it difficult to forecast the future path of theeconomy and inflation.
BIS Review 65/20006It is quite clear that this demands a great deal of forecasters as well as of those who construct macromodels. The forecasts concern inflation one to two years ahead, which calls, for instance, forreasonable precision in the measurement of the output gap and the relationship between the output gapand inflation.It is already evident, for example, that inflation forecasts were frequently on the high side in manycountries in the 1990s. I believe that the best we can do, at least at this stage, is to pay close attentionto incoming data in the forecasting process, and examine how consistent they are with historicalrelationships. We have to deal more successfully with the fact that forecasts of economicdevelopments can never be completely accurate and still allow monetary policy to be forward looking.Final wordsLet me now conclude. When discussing financial and monetary stability, we must remember that wehave come a long way. The world economy shows strong growth coupled with low inflation andmonetary policy has contributed to this development. However, there are interesting, thoughsomewhat difficult, challenges ahead that must be met if we are to preserve this bright picture of theworld economy.
1BIS Review 64/2000Y V Reddy: Issues in managing capital account liberalisationPresentation by Dr Y V Reddy, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at CommonwealthSecretariat - World Bank Conference on Developing Countries and Global Financial Architecture,held in London, on 23 June 2000.*      *      *The objectives of this presentation are:(i) to suggest the need of some of the developing countries for managing capital account,implying elements of control, regulation and liberalisation as appropriate;(ii) to emphasise the importance of both international and national context in the management ofcapital account;(iii) to outline the contours of control and regulatory framework and the possible use of these inprioritising capital flows while suggesting the dynamic elements needed to enableliberalisation;(iv) to elaborate the linkages with other external sector policies, while considering theappropriate control and regulatory framework or liberalisation;(v) to highlight the complementary policies that are necessary while considering liberalisation ofcapital account.This presentation is from the perspective of policy making in developing countries, and is drawnmainly from the Indian experience.NeedIt is currently well recognised that although global capital flows have a potential for improvingefficiency and growth prospects, they can also trigger instability, due to a variety of reasons. Theobjective of current deliberations on the international financial architecture is to enhance efficiency ofsuch flows while avoiding, to the extent possible, instability, and managing instability if and when itoccurs. These issues are assessed essentially from the view point of developing countries, which, as agroup has tended to be more vulnerable to instability arising out of capital flows.Though there are some differences of opinion as to whether liberalisation of capital account wouldnecessarily add to growth prospects of developing countries, there are several developments in regardto international trade in goods and services, international business, technology, cross-border flows ofcapital, etc. that would necessitate a more active management of capital account, with a view tocontinuously assessing the costs and benefits of liberalisation vis-à-vis control or regulation.In the current debate on international financial architecture, there is no settled position on several ofthe actions being considered. In respect of liberalisation of capital account, however, there appears tobe a broad consensus, viz. such a liberalisation is desirable, should be gradual, well-sequenced andundertaken in conjunction with several other measures at micro and macro level. In most cases, thedesirability of limiting total external debt, especially short-term is generally advocated.In other words, there is need for developing countries to choose or prioritise alternative forms ofcapital flow on the basis of costs and benefits. In choosing the alternative forms, the costs and benefitsof a variety of instruments by which each of the forms of flows can be influenced should also beassessed. The need for prudent limits on short-term debt is universally acknowledged in the currentdebate. The treatment of individual components of the capital account and the pace of liberalisationneed to vary. Briefly restated, the components of the capital account needs to be managed by eachcountry taking into account country specific characteristics.
BIS Review 64/20002It is also clear that while several initiatives are proposed at the global level, the task of preventing acrisis is essentially a national responsibility though an enabling international environment is sought tobe put in place to facilitate action by individual countries. No doubt, in today’s globalised world,prevention of crises as well as mitigating the effects require multilateral efforts, but the socialconsequences of such crises are to be met by the national governments concerned. In this sense, theultimate responsibility in regard to crisis prevention and management rests primarily on the policymakers of the countries concerned.The policy makers in developing countries, therefore, have to manage their capital accounts to ensurean orderly process of liberalisation. In this context, management of the capital account involvesmanagement of control, regulation and liberalisation. Gradualism in liberalisation implies that the mixbetween controlled, regulated and liberalised capital transactions keeps changing gradually in favourof the latter. In fact, if the option of re-imposing controls to meet an emergency is contemplated, themanagement of capital account should always contain control, regulatory and liberalisation options.In India, capital account liberalisation is treated as a process. The medium-term objective is orderlyliberalisation, while the short-run challenges are met by flexible use of the control and regulatoryframework In other words, there may be occasions when the pace of liberalisation needs to betemporarily slowed down or halted, though in some rare cases the process has to be reversed, albeit fora short period.ContextIndustrial and developing countries do have a common interest in encouraging larger but less volatileglobal flows. Since the policy-making in developing countries involves gradual liberalisation, the paceand sequencing would also depend on the international context as appropriate to the country. Amongthe relevant international factors are the following.Firstly, the state of global arrangements for prevention of crises.Secondly, the extent, nature, anticipated promptness, and apolitical element in liquidity support frominternational financial institutions.Thirdly, the arrangements in international financial architecture for burden-sharing between domesticand global as also between private and public sectors.Fourthly, the perception of a developing country on the potential for magnification of possibleinadequacies in domestic policies by the international financial community.Similarly, the country-context is important in managing capital account.Among the relevant aspects are:First, size and structure of economy, especially the share of external sector.Second, socio-political orientation to risk-taking or risk-aversion or the societal weights to efficiencyvis-à-vis stability.Third, the potential benefits of liberalisation. For example, in some low-income developing countries,the capital flow may be restricted to official flows, Foreign Direct Investment and trade related flows.The immediate benefits of liberalisation in terms of private flows are, therefore, not evident.Fourth, the level of development of financial markets and consequently the possible responses ofdomestic financial institutions to the liberalisation may be such as to indicate relatively more or lessefficiency gains, compared to the costs of instability.Briefly stated, in the absence of effective lender of last resort at the international level, and perceivedbenefits and cost of liberalisation vis-à-vis regulatory framework and controls on capital flows, adeveloping country may have to keep choosing from time to time a capital account managementregime appropriate to itself.
3BIS Review 64/2000In India there is a significant opinion in favour of cautious liberalisation, but at the same time there areunderstandable fears of destabilisation. In India there is perhaps a greater weight attached to stability.This may be in view of the size and structure of the economy and the uncertain comfort level oninternational official, and private sector response to a crises on an apolitical basis. Thus, the policy inIndia is to approach liberalisation on capital account cautiously, gradually, in a well-sequencedmanner, treating it as a process and responding to domestic monetary and financial sectordevelopments as also the evolving international financial architecture.Control and regulatory framework and liberalisationThe mainstream thinking till the Asian crisis was averse to capital-controls, but in the recent past, suchaversion has yielded to a lively debate on the efficacy of such controls, and consequently theframework and operation of such controls. The control-framework can be viewed from differentangles. Basically, the control instruments are quantitative or price-based, including price ceilings orfloors and possibly a combination of the two. Controls or lack of controls may be based on size of atransaction, purpose, or category of participant. Asymmetrical treatments in regard to applicability andnature of controls are common between inflows and outflows; between outflows associated withinflows (i.e. principal, interest, dividend, profits and sale proceeds) and other outflows; resident andnon-residents; and between individuals, corporates, banks and other financial intermediaries. Theinstruments of control do vary from non-applicability, to total prohibition with intermediate regimes,say of approval on an automatic basis, case-by-case or simply price-based. The control may alsodifferentiate financial instruments by their nature or ratings.In managing the capital account through control framework, there could be a prioritisation of capitalflows - in terms of their desirability or otherwise. Thus, for example, a higher preference could be toForeign Direct investment and long-term debt compared to portfolio flows and short-term debt.It must be recognised that the efficacy of control depends, among many other things, on the categoryof flows or participant. For example, it is less complex to control the inflows from non-residents, sincenon-residents are keen to have a legal title to their asset. Empirical evidence indicates that the controlover outflows from residents is facilitated more by the appropriate tax regime and acceptable exchangerates, than through the control framework.It is necessary to make a distinction between control framework and regulatory framework. Animportant component of regulatory framework relates to prudential regulation on banks vis-à-vis theexternal sector. They may include provisioning requirements for net external positions; limits on openpositions, and limits on investments in foreign currency denominated assets. There could also bedifferentiated tax regimes affecting the maturity pattern. Monetary measures such as reserverequirements have both an external sector and monetary angle. These regulatory instruments are partof the package available for influencing the size and composition of capital flows. Similarly,regulatory restrictions on portfolio investments by a securities regulator would also provide fordifferent degrees of openness from time to time.While controls may have a potential to be inefficient, there is considerable merit in using theregulatory mechanisms for moderating the ebb and flow in capital movements. The gradual movementtowards liberalisation can be operationalised through a change in the mix and rigour of controls orregulatory framework, especially taking into account the tendency towards perceived excess in inflowsor outflows.In regard to the dynamic of control or regulation vis-à-vis liberalisation, it is clear that a workableframework appropriate to each country is necessary. The more important aspect of management ofcapital account is the flexibility available in the framework to progressively liberalise thecapital-account transactions, depending on the domestic and international developments. At the sametime, such a flexibility could permit quick responses to changes in magnitudes, direction andcomposition of flows that may appear to be inappropriate to the circumstances. This flexibility inoperations may, for success, warrant complementarity with other policies. Finally, there may be a casefor retaining the freedom to re-impose controls or tighten regulations as long as the vulnerability to
BIS Review 64/20004highly speculative or motivated attack on the currency exists, since market corrections may be moredestabilising to the economy. Thus, it may be wise, even in the liberalised framework in capitalaccount to retain an option to impose controls or tighten regulations.In India, regulatory framework has been used in several combinations to address problems ofexcessive inflows and pressures towards outflows, during the reform-period, implying short-termmovements bi-directionally, i.e. tightening or loosening controls as also regulations, while maintainingmedium-term progress in liberalisation. Controls, however, continue to apply mostly to residents.A qualitative change, however, has been brought about in the legal framework for management offoreign exchange in June 2000 by which the objectives of regulation are redefined as facilitating tradeand payments as well as orderly development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market inIndia. The legal framework envisages both a developmental dimension and orderliness or stability.The legislation provides power to the government to reimpose controls if public interest warrants it.LinkagesIt appears that the porous nature of capital controls is minimised if the dangers of capital flowsoccurring in the guise of current account transactions are avoided. Among the measures adopted inIndia are the twin requirements, viz. repatriation and surrender of current receipts of the residents(which includes entities) and restricting foreign currency payments only to genuine transactions, andin reasonable amounts. Furthermore, serious distortions in trade policy could make the management ofcapital account difficult. Thus, liberalisation of the import of gold to officialising inevitable import ofgold to satisfy the domestic demand was considered essential to enable liberalisation of capital accountin India. Moreover, if there is a commodity-concentration in exports or imports (oil in the case ofIndia), careful monitoring is required to assess the impact and respond, if need be, with changes inmanagement of capital account.Experience indicates that foreign currency denominated assets within the country and trading ofdomestic currency outside the country could have destabilising effects on the balance sheets andcurrencies for reasons essentially external to the domestic economic factors.The adequacy of forex reserves is yet another important consideration in the management of capitalaccount. First, adequacy has to be viewed not only in terms of trade needs but also other short-termliabilities. Secondly, it is not merely the long-term or short-term debt in terms of original maturity thatis relevant for reserves, but the residual maturity. Thus, in managing the capital account, the maturityprofile of debt, including short-term debt becomes important. Thirdly, a trade-related debt which is inthe nature of collateralised debt may be less severe on reserve-requirements. Fourthly, any addition toportfolio-flows may warrant comfort through some additions to reserves, which implies that the netcontribution to investment in the country through portfolio flows is, in effect, less than what themagnitudes indicate. This is not to deny the indirect effects on competition of enhancing efficiencythrough portfolio flows. Fifthly, there is usually a cost of maintaining forex reserves and the net costwould depend on the difference between the marginal cost at which the reserves have been built andthe marginal return from deployment of reserves. The liquidity management including level of forwardliabilities is also relevant. Disclosures of such liabilities, as in India, have proven to be effective.Finally, while the optimal level of reserves is difficult to quantify, attention to level of reserves andtheir management are critical to overall capital account management, especially to the sentimentsprevailing in forex markets. Often, the incremental changes in level of reserves rather than the levelseem to be of significance to market perceptions. Further, the market perceptions appear to be moresensitive to downward movement in reserves than upward movements. To the extent that managementof capital account tries to influence the size and composition of capital flows impacting on meeting thecurrent account deficit as well as movements in reserves, the adequacy of level of reserves is arelevant factor.In India the level of forex reserves is so maintained and increased from year to year as to coveradequately not only imports but also the short-term liabilities, especially short-term debt and portfolioinvestment. Further, the level of reserves also takes into account the operational need to enable the
5BIS Review 64/2000Reserve Bank to even out the mismatches between supply and demand in forex markets and thusensure orderly conditions in a less developed market characterised by lumpy demands.On exchange rate, the possibility of persistent misalignments due to reasons other than domesticfactors cannot be ruled out and correction cannot be left entirely to the market. The developingcountries do need some armoury to address such issues. It appears almost certain that capital controlswould be ineffective if, in popular perception, the exchange rate does not appear to be realistic. Inother words, there is considerable merit in the argument that capital controls are not substitutes for anappropriate exchange rate regime even though capital controls facilitate avoidance of excess volatilityin the exchange rate that may be caused by destabilising capital flows.Finally, an integrated view of the state of development of and activities in financial markets isappropriate. The activities in forex markets and its linkages with other markets, especiallymoney-market, debt market, especially government securities market, and equity markets, have to beidentified and monitored while managing capital flows. Recognition of linkages, monitoring thedevelopments, and willingness to intervene credibly in any or all of these markets as appropriate maybe essential. Perhaps markets should be aware of the broad objectives of such intervention. As each ofthe financial markets develop and get integrated with others, measures to increasingly liberalisedcapital account could be considered. Indeed, it is possible to argue that liberalisation of capital accountwould aid the process of development of financial markets, but this is valid only when some informedjudgements are made in respect of each country on the interactions between the management of capitalaccount and the financial markets. In any case, capital control or regulatory framework orliberalisation would be ineffective or unstable in the absence of proper appreciation of such linkagesamong financial markets.Above all, irrespective of the extent of liberalisation, official monitoring and surveillance of largeinternational transactions and players would be helpful in effective and credible management of capitalaccount.In India, during periods of surges in capital inflows or pressures on outflows, operations in the externalsector were coordinated with actions by the Reserve Bank in the money and government securitiesmarket to ensure stability.Complementary policiesThere are several policy areas that have been identified as being critical to the health of globalmonetary and financial systems in future. Many of them fall within the jurisdiction of the countriesconcerned. There is certainly an implicit recognition that the net benefits from liberalisation of capitalaccount in respect of any developing country would be enhanced if the complementary policies arefollowed. Among the more important of these are: first, strengthening the banking system, diversifyingfinancial intermediation through both banks and non-banks, and developing as well as regulatingfinancial markets in a sound manner.Secondly, the regulatory practices and the coordination between regulators as the national level andamong the national level regulators at the international level are also attracting attention.Thirdly, monitoring the balance sheets of large banks, large corporates and even governments in termsof their growth, quality and vulnerability to shocks is considered important. This monitoring may haveto cover stocks and flows, as also foreign currency exposures hedged or otherwise and direct orindirect.Fourthly, there is a fiscal burden in case there are systemic problems, especially in the banking sector,irrespective of whether banking is in the public or private sector. The health of the banking sector iscritical for many reasons, one of them being stability in the external sector.In India, the complementary policies considered essential have been identified by the Committee ofCapital Account Convertibility (1997). The Committee observed that while there were benefits of amore open capital account, it could also impose pressures on the financial system. Hence the
BIS Review 64/20006Committee indicated certain sign posts or preconditions for a more open capital account and these are:fiscal consolidation, inflation-mandate and strengthening the financial system.Of particular significance in regard to complementary policies that are relevant to management ofcapital account are standards and codes being evolved and monitored by several agencies, including inparticular IMF, World Bank, BIS, Financial Stability Forum etc. (Dr. S.N. Acharya has made anexcellent presentation on this at this Conference).Each country will no doubt benchmark their existing practices against the international codes andstandards, and consider their appropriateness, extent of application, nature of adaptation needed,relative priorities, etc. Several of the actions suggested require tremendous effort in regard to manydeveloping countries and if full compliance is desirable for further liberalisation of capital account, thepace of such liberalisation may not be rapid.In India, several Advisory Groups have commenced a review of the international standards and codesand an assessment insofar as India is concerned; some of these reports are expected to be released forpublic debate during the next 6 to 9 months.OutlookIt is clear that avoiding crises is ultimately a national responsibility. The impact of instability in timesof crisis appears at this stage of global environment to be borne largely by the home or domesticpublic sector rather than the global private sector. Moreover, the burden of such an asymmetricalimpact is more painful on developing countries, especially the poorer ones. Hence, in this context, thedistinct preference for stability, on the part of some developing countries needs to be appreciated. Sucha preference towards stability also argues for managing their capital account regime. Such regimescould have a mix of control, regulatory and liberal elements as appear most appropriate from time totime, to the national authorities who are accountable to the people for possible crises. In such a mix,there is merit in avoiding controls, but taking recourse to regulatory measures, while pursuing theliberalisation objectives.Within this overall framework, the progress in capital account liberalisation would perhaps depend onseveral international and domestic factors. Some of them are: first, the progress in global cooperationand understanding on relevant codes and practices to assure financial stability. Secondly, the quality ofassurances and support from the international financial community in general and InternationalFinancial Institutions in particular, if crises were to occur. Thirdly, the nature of burden-sharingarrangements with private sector in case of crises. Fourth, the progress of institutional and financialmarket developments in the country concerned.In India, it is recognised that the pace of liberalisation of the capital account would depend on bothdomestic factors, especially progress in the financial sector reform and the evolving internationalfinancial architecture.
1BIS Review 63/2000Yutaka Yamaguchi: Thinking behind current monetary policySpeech by Mr Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Japan National PressClub, Tokyo, on 4 August 2000.*      *      *I am honored to be invited today to the Japan National Press Club. I once heard a joke that a centralbanker can deliver a speech to members of this esteemed Club, who are well known for their barrageof sharp questions, only when the economy is performing satisfactorily and he is confident enough toanswer any questions. I am here today, not because this is the case, but because I think it is a goodopportunity to elaborate on our thinking behind current monetary policy and ask for your comments.The main purpose of my remarks today is to present an overview of the zero interest rate policy byreviewing various discussions at past monetary policy meetings with respect to the termination of thezero interest rate policy.I.Economic developments after the zero interest rate policy was adoptedLet me begin by briefly explaining what the zero interest rate policy is. It was in February 1999 thatthe Bank of Japan effected the zero interest rate policy. At the time, Japan’s economy was on the vergeof falling into a deflationary spiral which was a vicious circle combining price declines and economicrecession. In response, the Bank of Japan decided to guide the short-term interest rate, specifically theuncollateralized overnight call rate, down to virtually zero by flexibly providing ample funds to themoney market. Then, in April 1999, the Bank decided to continue the zero interest rate policy untilsuch time it could be ascertained deflationary concern had been dispelled. Chart 1 shows thedevelopment of market interest rates since April 1999. To the best of my knowledge, I cannot think ofany precedents in financial history, either at home or abroad, where a central bank has guidedshort-term interest rates down to virtually zero and maintained that level for a long period. Short-terminterest rates are the key variable in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and a central bankinfluences them by controlling reserves in the money market, thereby affecting various aspects of theoverall economy. Thus, guiding short-term interest rates down to virtually zero means that the centralbank has used its traditional policy tool to the maximum extent possible.A variety of economic indicators suggest that Japan’s economy is on a recovery path, albeit moderate.Chart 2 compares recent economic conditions with those in February 1999. For example, theyear-on-year growth rate of real GDP increased from minus 0.4% in the first quarter of 1999 to plus0.7% in the same quarter of 2000, and industrial production growth rose from minus 3.8% in the firstquarter of 1999 to plus 7% in the second quarter of 2000. Business sentiment in terms of the Tankandiffusion index for all industries and sizes of firms has substantially improved from minus 44 in March1999 to minus 18 in June 2000. And, the consensus forecast of the private sector for real GDP growthfor this fiscal year has been revised upward from 0.8% at the beginning of this year to 1.5% recently.Moreover, June’s Tankan survey showed that corporate profits were expected to mark a double-digitincrease for two consecutive years in fiscal 1999 and 2000. While inflation in terms of WPI is slightlyabove the previous year’s level, that in terms of CPI is slightly below.There are a number of factors responsible for the moderate economic recovery. First and foremost isthe implementation of several important policy measures to restore financial system stability. Publicfunds were injected into major banks to strengthen their capital base and a legal framework wasestablished to speed up the bankruptcy process. Under such circumstances, financial institutionsthemselves are striving to reconstruct their management. The second factor is support frommacroeconomic policy, which includes both fiscal policy of the government and the zero interest ratepolicy of the Bank of Japan. The third factor is the upturn of overseas economies. In addition to theexpansion in the United States and Europe, Asian economies have been recovering rapidly afterovercoming currency and financial crises. The fourth factor is the boom in the high-tech and IT-related
BIS Review 63/20002business areas. Whether trends like the IT revolution witnessed in the United States will spread toJapan depends on how firms and individuals as users take advantage of information technology.Japanese producers related to high-tech business have swiftly responded to the rapid increase indemand both at home and abroad, and an increasing number of them have been expanding investmentreflecting the tightening supply and demand conditions.It is natural that economic recovery leads to the question of whether the zero interest rate policy shouldbe terminated. As I mentioned, the Bank of Japan announced in April 1999 that it would continue thezero interest rate policy until deflationary concern had been dispelled. Discussions at subsequentmonetary policy meetings have disclosed that such deflationary concern would be dispelled if webecame confident that economic recovery was led by private demand. As has been described in theminutes of these meetings, members of the Policy Board have closely examined economic andfinancial conditions to determine whether deflationary concern has been dispelled. Though theminutes of the 17 July meeting are yet to be released, the statement issued immediately after themeeting in Chart 3 said that the majority of the Policy Board considered that Japan’s economy wasapproaching a stage where deflationary concern might be dispelled. However, it also said that someviews were expressed that before reaching a final decision to lift the zero interest rate policy, it wasdesirable to ensure the firmness of economic conditions including employment and household income.Moreover, it was pointed out that the Board needed to ascertain how the so-called Sogo problemwould affect market sentiment.II.Points at issue relating to the termination of the zero interest rate policyAs you know, there are arguments for and against the termination of the zero interest rate policy asevidenced in newspaper editorials of recent months as well as the opinions of business leaders,economists, and market participants. Such a division of opinions is usually the case every time thequestion of raising interest rates is brought up after a period of prolonged monetary easing. In May1989 when interest rates were last raised in the midst of the bubble economy, very few articles innewspapers and magazines had supported it before the raise. Needless to say, at past monetary policymeetings, we have carefully examined various points related to the pros and cons of lifting the zerointerest rate policy. Let me now discuss some of the important points at issue.Is private consumption recovering?The first point is whether or not we can conclude that the economy as a whole has fully recoveredwhile a recovery of private consumption has yet to be confirmed. Indeed, the current economicrecovery has been driven mainly by an improvement in the corporate sector. While June’s Tankansurvey shows that the ratio of current profits to sales in the manufacturing industry for fiscal 2000 isexpected to recover to 4.01%, which is slightly higher than the average of 3.84% since fiscal 1980, therecovery of the household sector has been delayed. The underlying trend of private consumption isdetermined by consumer sentiment and employee income. While consumer sentiment has beenimproving against such a background as receding concerns over financial system stability and stockprices, employee income has only very recently stopped declining. Thus, we cannot yet confirm arecovery of private consumption as a whole.Nevertheless, if we look more broadly at the situation Japan’s economy faces including such bigchallenges as the balance sheet adjustment of the corporate sector and the transformation of industrialstructure, in the current recovery process we consider it quite logical that an improvement in thecorporate sector precedes that in the household sector. In Chart 4, labor’s share of income has shown asignificant increase, which on the other hand means a substantial decrease in return on capital since thebursting of the bubble. Needless to say, capital is an important factor of production supportingeconomic development. If capital cannot generate sufficient returns for a long period, it will becomedifficult for firms to raise capital. In such a case, firms cannot help but improve return on capital byreducing various costs including labor. The need to improve return on capital has become especiallypressing for firms directly exposed to pressure from the global financial market. In other words,
3BIS Review 63/2000restructuring of the corporate sector is a prerequisite for sustainable growth of the overall economyincluding the household sector.In view of the need to improve return on capital, it is unlikely that household income and privateconsumption will significantly increase for the time being. Of course, if labor’s share of incomedeclines substantially, the resultant stagnation of private consumption will hamper the recovery of theoverall economy. Therefore, a delicate balancing of income distribution is the key to a full-fledgedeconomic recovery. In this regard, though the number of employees is still below that of a year ago,supply and demand conditions in the labor market have somewhat tightened as evidenced by theincrease in job offers. Wages, which had been decreasing for the past two to three years, have this yearincreased on a year-on-year basis.We sometimes discuss the relation between corporate profits and household income metaphoricallylikening it to the relation between the water level in a dam and the release of water from it. If we canclearly observe the rise in the water level, which signifies increasing corporate profits, the probabilitythat water will be released from the dam rises, leading to an increase in household income and then anincrease in private consumption. However, since it is not easy and takes time for firms to raise returnon capital and improve their balance sheets, the release of water from the dam cannot increasesignificantly. Yet I think that if household income recovers even moderately, there is a higherprobability that the economy will return to a growth path led by business fixed investment. If I mayinterpret the thinking of members of the Policy Board behind the statement of 17 July, the majoritywould like to confirm with more confidence that such a mechanism is at work.Are prices declining?The second point is whether or not it can be maintained that deflationary concerns have been trulydispelled when CPI and the GDP deflator are still falling. As Chart 5 shows, these price indexes aredeclining while WPI has recently begun to exceed the prior-year level. Such movements in CPI andthe GDP deflator may provoke an argument that not only has deflationary concern not been dispelled,but that the economy is actually in a deflationary state. The reason we are afraid of deflation is becauseonce the economy falls into a deflationary spiral, which is a vicious circle where price declines depresseconomic activity in turn leading to downward pressure on prices, it is very difficult to escape from it.To avoid such a situation, in February 1999 the Bank adopted the zero interest rate policy, which wasa drastic monetary easing measure. All this shows that how to interpret the decline in CPI and theGDP deflator is an important issue and we have been carefully examining it.A close look at the movement of price statistics may not always lead to a full understanding of whatprice changes indicate. This is because various price indexes often move in different directions ortemporarily their movement does not appear consistent with the movement of other economicindicators. For example, take the latter half of 1988, which is the peak of the bubble period. While theeconomy was strong, measured prices were extremely stable. Another example is 1991, immediatelyafter the bursting of the bubble. Notwithstanding the fact that the economy entered a serious recession,inflation marked a peak. Furthermore, in 1996 while the GDP deflator traced its largest decline of the1990s, GDP growth recorded its highest figure in the post-bubble period. These examples underscorethe importance of assessing the movement of price indexes in relation to the overall economicsituation. The current decline in CPI is partly attributable to such structural changes as those in thedistribution system in addition to the past appreciation of the yen and the falling prices of consumerdurables. It is also due to the decrease in unit labor cost, which is often observed in the early stage ofeconomic recovery. In the early stage of recovery, productivity rises as idle resources are brought backinto use, unit labor cost declines, and then downward pressure on prices is seen. The phenomenon ofthe decline in labor costs and prices coupled with higher growth was observed in 1987 and 1996. Itappears that the factors behind this phenomenon have been partly responsible for the recent decline inprices, particularly in the GDP deflator.On the other hand, it may be possible to argue that any price declines would eventually lead to thedanger of the economy falling into a deflationary spiral. However, if the recent decline in CPI hadentailed danger of a deflationary spiral, corporate profits would have declined leading to a decrease in
BIS Review 63/20004business fixed investment and employment, whereas, in fact, we have observed increases in bothcorporate profits and business fixed investment. Moreover, such a danger would have adverselyinfluenced the labor market through the supply and demand of goods and services, but, as a matter offact, wages have stopped declining. To sum up, I do not think it appropriate to judge whether or notthe economy might fall into a deflationary spiral simply by looking at the decline in CPI and the GDPdeflator alone.Based on such argument, the Policy Board has closely monitored and examined the deterioration in thesupply and demand balance, and the risk of price declines stemming from weak demand.Conceptually, the supply and demand balance in Japan’s economy as a whole could be described bysuch indicators as the output gap. The problem is that it is difficult to accurately estimate the outputgap. The difficulty is common to many industrial countries, and the main reason is that the speed oftechnological innovation has become so fast that it is not easy to measure the economic value ofcapital. As a result, we face a situation where the estimated output gap cannot explain the fluctuationin prices. For example, in 1998 and 1999, calculations based on traditional models produced largeoutput gap estimates, and not a few economists thus forecast considerable price declines. The actualprice decline, however, was not so large as the forecast. On the other hand, the supply and demandbalance perceived by firms reported in the Tankan survey has greatly improved during the past year.These observations suggest that in order to grasp the change in the supply and demand balance, weshould not only apply the estimated output gap deduced from conventional methodology but alsomake full use of the information regarding the supply and demand balance for individual goods andservices.Let me summarize my view. First, it is very difficult to accurately estimate the output gap, which isthe degree of excess supply in macroeconomic terms. Second, it is likely that the potential growth ratehas recently declined substantially as a result of stagnant investment over the past ten years. Thus,even if aggregate demand only grows moderately for one to two years, the supply and demand balanceshould improve, which is indeed evidenced by economic developments since last year. Third, whetherthe output gap continues to narrow depends on prospects for economic recovery led by privatedemand. If we become confident of such a recovery, moderate declines in some price indexes shouldnot necessarily be interpreted as a supply and demand imbalance or manifestation of the risk of adeflationary spiral.Excessive corporate debt and the financial system problemThe third point is whether or not the economy will exhibit a robust recovery in a situation where firmsare burdened with excessive debt and banks still hold a large amount of non-performing assets.Indeed, one of the major factors behind the sluggishness of Japan’s economy during the 1990s wasbalance sheet adjustment at firms and banks. We fully recognize the gravity of the excessive debt heldby firms, especially those in the construction, real estate, and distribution industries, not to mention thenon-performing assets held by banks. In fact, we experienced a serious financial system crisis in 1997and 1998 characterized by a large-scale credit crunch and the financial sector exerting strongdownward pressure on economic activity. Thus, it is extremely important to incorporate theassessment of financial system into economic outlooks. This is one reason we believe that theeconomic recovery is more likely to be moderate rather than robust.It is also true that financial system stability has been significantly restored as a result of the injectionof capital into major banks in March 1999. With improved creditworthiness and receding concern overliquidity, banks are once again competing to win good customers. According to the Tankan survey,firms have reported a gradual relaxation in the lending attitude of banks. While we may be far from asituation where many banks aggressively assume credit risk with appropriate risk control systems inplace and strongly support economic growth, we are not in a situation where the lending attitude ofbanks is so cautious that it would hamper economic recovery. Therefore, while there remain industriesand firms burdened with excessive debt, I think it possible to expect a recovery, though not as speedyas in previous recoveries, of the overall economy as momentum for new growth intensifies reflectingthe progress of technological innovation.
5BIS Review 63/2000Another reason we care about the debt problem is that when large firms like Sogo collapse, the marketsometimes becomes extremely nervous. It should be noted that the impact of a shock differs from caseto case. For example, the case of Sogo is special in that its reconstruction framework was suddenlychanged. In any event, if there are no problems in the financial system, the collapse of an individualfirm is likely to be perceived as an isolated case. At the moment, we need to closely monitor whetherthere is the risk that the market may suddenly turn nervous, and this is, in my view, one of the factorsthat should be rightly taken into account in the conduct of monetary policy.The relationship between structural adjustment and monetary policySince the release of the statement on 17 July, there have been various comments to the effect that theBank of Japan should continue the zero interest rate policy until concern of large-scale bankruptciesdisappears and structural adjustment is completed. There have also been comments to the contrary,namely, that the continuation of the zero interest rate policy is delaying the progress of structuraladjustment. This brings me to my fourth point relating to the termination of the zero interest ratepolicy, the relationship between it and structural adjustment.Regarding the view that the Bank should continue the zero interest rate policy until structuraladjustment is completed, we do not think this necessary. In discussing this, we need to distinguishbetween the potential growth rate and the cyclical and short-term growth rate of Japan’s economy. Inrecent years, it is often said that the potential growth rate of the US economy has been boosted by theIT revolution. But it should be pointed out that it took a long time before IT was applied to businessand resulted in improved productivity. Similarly, it will take a long time before structural reformpromoted by Japanese firms leads to improved productivity and higher potential growth. Here, itshould be noted that various forces other than structural adjustment influence the economy. Andhence, even if the potential growth rate is low, the economy will be able to grow strongly with thecyclical growth rate exceeding the potential growth rate. This, I think, is the business cycle.To deal with the decline in potential growth stemming from structural factors, a policy targeted tosolve structural problems and firms’ own efforts for restructuring are indispensable. There is no otherway. In short, monetary policy cannot replace structural policy.Let me now turn to the contrary comments that the zero interest rate policy has been holding backstructural adjustment. We also hear related comments that the zero interest rate policy has beengenerating various kinds of moral hazard, both socially and economically. It is true that the zerointerest rate policy, which provides the market with ample funds to guide the overnight rate tovirtually zero, could create a situation where banks and firms have become less sensitive to borrowingcosts and liquidity risks. Indeed, it is through this effect that the policy supports economic recoveryand promotes structural reform. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the policy may tend to delaystructural reform by making economic agents with a large amount of debt less conscious of borrowingcosts and liquidity risks. Of course, I do not think it appropriate to lift the zero interest rate policy toprevent moral hazard. Let me make it clear that the termination of the zero interest rate policy dependson whether we can be confident that the economic recovery is being primarily led by private demand.Is the termination of the zero interest rate policy consistent with fiscal policy?The fifth point is the relation between the termination of the zero interest rate policy and thegovernment’s fiscal policy stance. Some argue that a stimulus from the monetary policy side isessential and it is premature to terminate the zero interest rate policy because no further stimulus fromfiscal policy can be expected considering the significant deterioration in the government’s fiscalposition. Others argue that, when the government formulates a supplementary budget to stimulate theeconomy, fiscal policy aimed at achieving an economic recovery led by private demand and theBank’s monetary policy should be harmonized.Of course, the Bank of Japan never ignores the government’s fiscal policy stance when conductingmonetary policy. As I have reiterated many times, we will not terminate the zero interest rate policyunless we feel confident that the economic recovery is led by private demand. Chart 6 shows the
BIS Review 63/20006contribution of private demand and government expenditure to the year-on-year growth of real GDP,which indicates that the driving force behind the economy has steadily shifted from governmentexpenditure to private demand, and the GDP growth rate has been gradually rising. The Bank of Japanwill terminate the zero interest rate policy only when it feels confident that an economic recovery ledby private demand is in prospect, and I believe this is consistent with what the government is aimingat.Impairing the proper functioning of the market mechanismThe sixth point relates to the functioning of the market mechanism. There is a view that the properfunctioning of the financial market has been impaired by the zero interest rate policy and that it shouldbe restored by terminating the policy. In fact, we too were worried about the impairment of marketfunctions when adopting the unprecedented zero interest rate policy in February 1999. Therefore, wetook a cautious approach in guiding the overnight call rate to zero by confirming the properfunctioning of the market mechanism on the way. In retrospect, it is my tentative assessment at thispoint in time that the impairment of market functions turned out to be smaller than anticipated. Theovernight call rate is not exactly zero percent, though as close to zero as can be, and long-term interestrates are above zero. Under such a configuration of interest rates, the market mechanism isfunctioning.The contraction of the call market is often cited as an example to evidence impairment of the marketmechanism. This reflects the fact that, as the interest rate on ordinary deposits has been higher than thecall rate, investors have transferred funds from the call market to ordinary deposits. Under suchcircumstances, a sudden withdrawal of funds by investors from ordinary deposits would causeinstability in the liquidity position of banks which have received these deposits, and might eventuallyinfluence the formation of the overnight call rate. However, this problem cannot be a decisive factor indetermining whether to terminate the zero interest rate policy.Interest income of pensionersThe seventh and last point is the fact that the zero interest rate policy is having a negative effect oneconomic agents who largely depend on interest income, such as pensioners. Obviously interestincome from financial assets has fallen significantly under the zero interest rate policy, and we arewell aware of the fact that the policy is adversely affecting households that depend heavily on interestincome. The elderly hold a relatively large amount of financial assets as evidenced by the fact thatabout half of the total financial assets of individuals is held by those aged 60 and over, and whoseearned income is not much. As a result, the elderly are most affected as low interest rates havecontinued for a long period, and we sympathize with their situation.However, let me emphasize that raising interest rates would not solve the problem. Households canearn interest income from their deposits because banks obtain interest income on their loans. In otherwords, the source of interest income received is economic growth, and interest income will not begenerated if the economy does not grow. Viewed from a different angle, economic growth andincreased employment opportunities would ensure the stability of household income. Householdincome primarily consists of employee income, which accounts for more than 70% of national income.By reviewing these facts, I hope you will understand the imminent need to achieve a sustainableeconomic recovery led by private demand.III.Monetary policy under uncertaintySo far I have presented the majority view of the Policy Board on issues related to the termination ofthe zero interest rate policy. The Bank of Japan has recently stated that Japan’s economy is coming toa stage where the condition for lifting the zero interest rate policy is being met. However, since thereare no inflationary risks, some argue that termination of the zero interest rate policy is unnecessary,besides which the risks involved in termination are unknown. We have been discussing the conduct ofmonetary policy, always bearing in mind the risks of both termination and continuation of the zero
7BIS Review 63/2000interest rate policy. The difficulty inherent in the conduct of monetary policy stems from the fact that aclear decision, whether or not to change interest rates, has to be made under uncertainty withinherently limited information on the outlook and the mechanism of the economy.Among various metaphors about the central bank, I remember one that says a central bank is like adriver on a winding road with a misted up windshield and rearview mirrors and an inaccuratespeedometer. I think this well describes the essence of some of the difficulties that central banks facein conducting monetary policy. The economic outlook corresponds to the misted up windshield, andthe limitation of economic statistics to the rearview mirrors and inaccurate speedometer. And thevarious risks that the economy faces correspond to the winding road. A central bank driving a carunder such conditions has to stay alert to anticipated risks while making use of the lessons obtainedfrom past experiences. With this comment as an introduction, let me present my personal view on themeaning of discussing the termination of the zero interest rate policy at a time when we do not observeany imminent risk of inflation.We often hear the argument that monetary policy should be changed only when the risk of inflationbecomes evident. At first glance this argument appears reasonable since the target for monetary policyis price stability. As a matter of fact, in the bubble period of the late 1980s, the conduct of monetarypolicy was based on this argument. From 1986 through 1988, the economy grew at an annual rate of5%, asset prices soared, and the general price level was extremely stable. Under such circumstances,the Bank of Japan could not find an opportunity to preemptively correct the low interest rate policy atthe time. It was only in May 1989 when inflationary pressure became obvious to everybody that theBank could raise the official discount rate. Since history never exactly repeats itself, we cannot claimthat we have fully experienced all the various situations when monetary policy might be changed onceinflationary pressure becomes evident. It should also be pointed out that today’s situation, which isheavily burdened with the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble, is vastly different from the situationduring the bubble period. With these caveats, we should ask ourselves what are the lessons learnedfrom the experience of the late 1980s in today’s context? Let me mention two points.First, the policy change in response to a clear and present risk of inflation would inevitably bemonetary tightening, and, moreover, cumulative interest rate hikes would probably be needed as wasthe case in 1989 and 1990. In view of the very high amount of government bonds outstanding, forexample compared with the late 1980s, the capital loss on these government bonds caused by higherinterest rates would, other things being equal, pose much larger problems for the economy. We mustthus avoid, to the extent possible, monetary policy that forces the central bank to raise interest ratesrapidly and substantially at a later stage because it could destabilize the economy and the financialsystem.Second, if the zero interest rate policy continues for a long period even after the economy clearlyrecovers, more economic agents will tend to conduct activities based on the expectation that currentextremely low interest rates will be sustained indefinitely. This is what happened in the bubble period,leading to an enormous waste of resources which continues to inflict pain on us today. I do not at alladvocate a higher probability that a similar situation would occur on a similar scale. What I would liketo mention is that the current situation of financial markets, where, for example, the premium on creditrisk is suppressed by the liquidity effect of the zero interest rate policy, could include the potential riskof creating the misallocation of resources.Then, when is appropriate timing for adjusting interest rates before inflation risk becomes a matter ofconcern? If we can come up with a perfectly accurate economic outlook as well as the time needed forthe policy effect to permeate the economy, we should conduct farsighted and preemptive policy at theright time on an appropriate scale. This is always an ideal vision for central banks. In fact, the Bank ofJapan has been making efforts to accurately analyze the past, present, and future economy. Though wemake policy judgments based on these analyses, admittedly we conduct monetary policy under greatuncertainty with limited second sight as well as imperfect data and information just like the metaphorof the car driver. This is a brutal fact that central banks all over the world, including the Bank of Japan,must face.
BIS Review 63/20008There are central banks that visibly incorporate this uncertainty into the modus operandi of theconduct of monetary policy. For example, the Bank of England forecasts inflation, not by a singlefigure, but by a probability distribution. We can thus easily understand how great uncertainty is inpredicting, for example, the growth rate and inflation for 2002. If we have to humbly accept suchuncertainty even after we try our utmost to make accurate economic forecasts, one useful approachmight be to confirm the degree of economic improvement and adjust monetary easing accordingly inorder to realize sustainable growth. As a digression, the Taylor Rule, the most well known of policyrule theories, attracts attention internationally and is actively studied. This Rule advocates the smoothadjustment of interest rates while paying attention to the output gap and fluctuation in prices, whichseems to be based on a similar policy philosophy to what I have just described.A hundred and eighteen years have passed since the Bank of Japan was established. And, yet, it is alsoa “young” central bank as it was reborn two years ago under the new Bank of Japan Law, and thus notrack record has yet been established. I believe a good track record will be won by calmly evaluatingeconomic and financial conditions, fully explaining decisions and implementing them, and giving dueconsideration to constructive criticism from those who know the importance of having a central bankwhich can be trusted.

1BIS Review 115/2000European Central Bank: Press conference - introductory statementIntroductory statement by Mr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank andMr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the press conference, held inFrankfurt am Main, on 14 December 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today’s meeting ofthe Governing Council of the ECB.Let me first report that the Governing Council decided to reconfirm the existing reference value formonetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad aggregate M3. This decisionwas taken on the grounds that the available evidence continues to support the assumptions underlyingthe initial derivation of the reference value in December 1998 (and its confirmation in December1999), namely those for trend potential output growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity inthe euro area. With regard to the assessment of trend potential output growth, there is still no decisiveevidence that measurable and lasting increases in productivity growth in the euro area would warrant asignificant upward revision in the assumption for trend potential growth. This notwithstanding, theuncertainties surrounding estimates of the medium-term development of potential output growth in theeuro area have become skewed to the upside. Against this background, the Governing Council willcarefully monitor further evidence with regard to an acceleration of productivity growth in the euroarea. The Governing Council also wishes to emphasise that potential output growth could bestrengthened by further structural reforms in the labour and goods markets. Naturally, the ECB’smonetary policy will take such changes appropriately into account. The ECB will issue a press releasetoday to provide some background information on the review of the reference value carried out by theGoverning Council.The Governing Council also conducted its regular examination of monetary and economicdevelopments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decidedto leave the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem unchanged at4.75%. The interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were also keptunchanged at 5.75% and 3.75% respectively.Starting with the first pillar, it is fair to say that M3 growth rates have shown signs of moderation overthe past few months. However, taking into account the protracted upward deviation of M3 growthfrom the reference value of 4 1/2% and the still robust growth of credit to the private sector, cautioncontinues to be warranted with regard to the upside risks to price stability stemming from themonetary side.As for key indicators related to the second pillar, the assessment is currently complicated by increaseduncertainty. In the first place, this applies to tendencies in the world economy. With regard to theevolution of real GDP growth currently foreseeable for the euro area, the underlying dynamism ofgrowth continues to prevail, although subject to some moderation. Developments in euro area bondmarkets, characterised by a decline in bond yields in November and December, broadly confirm thisassessment of growth. In foreign exchange markets, also reflecting the current outlook for globalgrowth patterns, the euro has appreciated against the currencies of the euro area’s most importanttrading partners. The Governing Council considers this development to be a step in the right direction.Turning to consumer price developments, recent developments have continued to reflect, above all,developments in oil prices, but also previous developments in the euro exchange rate. Over themedium term, the upward pressures from energy prices are expected to disappear gradually, whileHICP rates of inflation will increasingly depend on domestic forces. On balance, the GoverningCouncil judges the risks to price stability still to be on the upside.The Governing Council will continue to counteract any risks to price stability in the medium term byresponding in a timely manner. At the same time, it does stress the importance of all economic actors
BIS Review 115/20002responding in an appropriate manner to the current oil price-led increase in consumer price inflation.In particular, social partners can rely on the commitment of monetary policy to maintain price stabilityover the medium term and they should continue along the path of wage moderation observed in recentyears. In the same vein, fiscal authorities should control expenditure growth, as it could otherwise fuelupward pressures on prices.Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to inform you about other issues discussed by theGoverning Council.First of all, I should like to provide you with information on several issues relating to the eurobanknotes and coins.First, pursuant to the Treaty (Article 106 (2)), the ECB has the exclusive right to approve the volumeof coins issued by the euro area Member States. To this end, the Governing Council adopted an ECBDecision on the volume of coin issuance in 2001. This Decision, which also covers Greece for thefirst time, will soon be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.Second, in order to raise citizens’ awareness and to prepare them for the cash changeover at thebeginning of 2002, the Governing Council agreed to organise a series of conferences on eurochangeover issues in the course of 2001. These conferences will bring together the key partiesinvolved in the euro cash changeover process, both at the national and at the European level, with aview to focusing on the cash changeover preparations. This action should also be seen against thebackground of the Conclusions of the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 to 9 December 2000.Third, the Governing Council decided that tests on the euro banknotes will be carried out in all euroarea countries in 2001. These tests will offer companies an opportunity to check and fine-tune theircash and/or vending machines and sensors with regard to their being able to recognise and accept eurobanknotes. They will be organised by the euro area national central banks; the Bank of England willalso be invited to participate. The ECB will monitor the test scenario in order to ensure a consistentapproach and will act as the contact point for companies registered in a country without a test centre.Fourth, further to the ECB’s press release of 3 August 2000, when the decisions of the GoverningCouncil regarding the euro area financial modalities for the 2002 cash changeover were announced,the Governing Council agreed on general principles for the so-called frontloading andsub-frontloading of euro banknotes outside the euro area as from 1 December 2001. Today’sdecision, which complements the principles agreed with regard to the frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes inside the euro area, has to be seen as a contribution to ensuring asmooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in aseparate press release to be issued this afternoon.With regard to TARGET, the Governing Council decided to establish a long-term calendar ofTARGET operating days to be applied from 2002 onwards. The establishment of such a commonlong-term calendar was deemed necessary in order to reduce uncertainties for financial markets. Inaddition to Saturdays and Sundays, TARGET as a whole, including both domestic and cross-bordertransactions, will be closed for a total of six days in the calendar year. You will find furtherinformation relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon.The Governing Council also adopted several legal acts related to the field of accounting, which willbe published shortly in the Official Journal of the European Communities. These acts relate to thelegal framework for accounting and reporting within the ESCB, the annual accounts of the ECB andthe allocation of monetary income of the euro area national central banks and losses of the ECB for thefinancial years 1999 to 2001.Let me also draw your attention to some of the decisions taken by the Governing Council at itsprevious two meetings.First, the ECB budget for 2001 has been approved. It includes a staff increase of 7%. By the end of2001, the ECB will therefore have approximately 1,100 staff members.Second, in connection with the Bank of Greece’s entry into the Eurosystem, the Governing Counciladopted several legal instruments on the transfer of foreign reserves from the Bank of Greece to the
3BIS Review 115/2000ECB, the crediting to the Bank of Greece of a corresponding claim on the ECB and the contribution tothe capital, reserves and provisions of the ECB by the Bank of Greece. These legal acts will bepublished in the Official Journal of the European Communities shortly. Amendments to several otherlegal instruments were also adopted.Third, I should like to mention that, following the very positive reaction to last year’s "HelsinkiSeminar", the ECB is organising a second seminar with high-ranking officials from the centralbanks of the EU accession countries. This seminar will be held tomorrow in Vienna, in co-operationwith the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, and will focus in particular on issues related to the pricedynamics in accession countries, the role of the central banks in managing the accession process andthe co-operation between the Eurosystem and the accession countries’ central banks. The "ViennaSeminar" will be followed by a press conference at 4 p.m. tomorrow.Finally, I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that its next meeting,which is scheduled for 4 January 2001, will be held by means of a teleconference. The pressconference originally planned for that day has thus been cancelled. The next press conference willtake place on 1 February 2001.
1BIS Review 115/2000Jean-Claude Trichet:The economic situation in France and the euro areaSpeech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the Banque de France, at the press conference of theMonetary Policy Council of the Banque de France on 20 December 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,Allow me to welcome you on behalf of the Monetary Policy Council of the Banque de France. As theeuro stands on the threshold of its third year, I shall discuss in the name of our MPC the economicsituation in France and the euro area, before commenting upon the latest monetary policy decisionsmade by the Eurosystem.Activity advanced at a sustained pace in the euro areaThe upturn experienced by the euro-area economies in the first half of 1999 continued andstrengthened throughout 2000. Foreign trade contributed significantly to the rebound. In addition, theeuro area benefited from a marked improvement in domestic demand, with household consumptionincreasing at a fast clip before stabilising at a high level in the third quarter. At the same time, goodborrowing conditions and the prospect of robust demand, coupled with a substantial increase in the useof production capacity and improved corporate profitability, gave investment a strong boost.According to the most recent estimates, the conjunction of these auspicious developments shouldtranslate into 3.4% growth in euro-area GDP in 2000.Given the prevailing wage moderation, this acceleration in activity has been particularly propitious forjob creation: the euro-area unemployment rate has declined by one percentage point since October1999 and stood at 8.9% in October 2000.Surging oil prices and the depreciation in the euro’s effective exchange rate have fuelled a marked risein inflationary pressure since the autumn of 1999. Inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP) thus rose above the 2% threshold in the twelve months to February 2000. InNovember 2000, the year-on-year increase amounted to 2.9%.There have also been increasing signs of pressure on the productive system, with the appearance ofproduction bottlenecks and rising capacity utilisation rates throughout the euro area. The latter workout to 84.7% for the fourth quarter of 2000, i.e. almost three points above their long-term average of81.8%.In addition, the value of imports rose substantially under the combined impact of buoyant economicactivity, an almost two-fold increase in oil prices and the euro’s depreciation. As a result, the currentaccount, which had shown a surplus, shrank to a slight deficit.Robust growth for the French economyFollowing the trend initiated in 1999, the French economy enjoyed robust growth. Although thegrowth rate levelled off somewhat in the third quarter, it should remain sustained given the renewedconfidence expressed by households and the business prospects of the industrial sector, where oursurveys indicate that order books are well-filled. Under these conditions, GDP is expected to grow by3.2% in 2000, and perhaps by roughly 3% in 2001.All components of GDP were favourably oriented, in particular corporate investment, which grew byabout 6%. Household consumption also made a significant contribution to growth despite the strongrise in retail prices during the year, which were impacted in particular by raw material and oil prices.Foreign trade made strong headway and generated a current account surplus that was still substantial
BIS Review 115/20002despite the oil shock, reflecting in particular the continued buoyancy of service trade. The currentaccount surplus for the first nine months of 2000 amounted to EUR 23.6 billion.The labour market benefited from the continued growth. According to INSEE (France’s nationalinstitute of statistics and economic studies), some 485,000 net salaried positions were created in themarket sector during the year. The unemployment rate according to the ILO definition stood at 9.4%of the labour force in October, down by 1.6 point year-on-year.The sharp increase in the prices of imported goods, due chiefly to oil price developments and thedepreciation of the euro, translated into a sharp acceleration in the consumer price index, with a year-on-year increase of 2.2% in November. These developments call for vigilance, particularly since theunderlying index, excluding energy and food prices, also quickened steadily throughout the year toreach a year-on-year increase of 1.4% in November, compared with 0.7% in December 1999.At the same time, the pressures on the productive system appeared to be particularly strong in France.The Banque de France’s surveys indicate that the production capacity utilisation rate of over 87% isalmost three points higher than its long-run average. Recruitment has become increasingly difficult:according to the INSEE surveys, 53% of industrial companies reported difficulty in hiring new staff inOctober 2000, against 39% in January 2000 and 32% in October 1999. This was the informationavailable to me on 20 December 1999 when I commented on monetary policy developments in 1999.It is the highest level ever recorded in these statistics. These pressures on the productive system havebeen corroborated by the sharp increase in imported capital goods and manufactured products.Price stability: the monetary policy decisions of the EurosystemThe recent decisions should be assessed against the price stability objective assigned to theEurosystem by the Treaty on European Union. In its pursuit of transparency and accountability, theGoverning Council of the European Central Bank decided in October 1998 to give a precise definitionof price stability as being a year-on-year increase in the euro-area HICP of below 2%. Its success inmeeting this objective, which is the same as that adopted by the Monetary Policy Council for Frenchmonetary policy when the Banque de France became independent, should be assessed in the mediumterm.In order to meet its primary objective of price stability, the Governing Council has based its monetarystrategy on two pillars, which were already part of the strategy of the Banque de France. It has pursuedthis strategy steadfastly.The first pillar assigns a prominent role to money, signalled by the announcement of a quantitativereference value for M3 growth, the euro area’s broad monetary aggregate.At its meeting on 14 December 2000, the Governing Council reviewed its reference value formonetary growth. It decided to reconfirm this value, namely an annual growth rate of 4.5% for thebroad M3 aggregate.The monetary authorities also wanted to be able to base their decisions on all of the informationavailable. Hence the second pillar, which makes it possible to assess present and future pricedevelopments using a broad range of non-monetary indicators.These indicators stem from a wide range of sources: macroeconomic data, financial market indicators,exchange rates, survey findings and projections, etc.After a co-ordinated reduction in the key rates of the future euro area in December 1998 and a furthercut in April 1999, which reduced the rate of the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operation to 2.5%, theGoverning Council has raised the Eurosystem’s key rates in several stages since November 1999 for atotal increase of 2.25 points. These moves were made in response to signals from the two monetarystrategy pillars, which pointed to deteriorating risks to price stability.With regard to the first pillar, i.e. monetary developments, the euro area has consistently enjoyedample liquidity conditions. Measured in terms of the moving three-month average, the M3 aggregate,which started the year with a growth trend of above 6%, began to show signs of slowing in the second
3BIS Review 115/2000quarter of 2000, due in particular to the hikes in the key rates. It worked out to 5.5% for the August toOctober 2000 period, that is, one point above the 4.5% reference value. Although M1 growth(banknotes and coins, overnight deposits) has slowed considerably, it was still very sustained with ayear-on-year increase of 5.8% in October. Overnight deposits alone rose by 6.6%. This dynamismreflects the need for high cash balances in a brisk economic environment, despite the increase in theopportunity cost of holding such balances.In October, the annual growth rate of credit granted by monetary financial institutions to the privatesector was 10.8% and that of loans 9.7%, while financing extended in the form of securities purchasesgrew by 21.2% year-on-year. This strong growth in credit to the private sector underlies the markedexpansion of M3. The dynamic trend in the credit to euro-area residents counterpart to M3, whichreflects the good performance of the economy, can also be explained by the increasing borrowingrequirements of telecommunications operators, surging property prices in certain euro-area countries,and the spread of mergers and acquisitions.However, external transactions have had a restrictive impact on M3 growth, albeit to a lesser extentthan in 1999.In France, credit to the private sector continued to advance at a sustained pace, posting a year-on-yearincrease of 9.3% in October. The annual growth rate of total domestic debt was 5.7% in October.In the course of the year, the various components of the second pillar signalled upside risks to pricestability. This was true for the indicators for supply and labour markets, the continuing rise in oilprices and the protracted depreciation in the euro’s exchange rate, which have exerted or continue toexert upward pressure on import, production and consumer prices.As regards the exchange rate of the euro, which is an important monetary policy indicator, both theMonetary Policy Council and the ECB Governing Council are convinced that the external value of theeuro does not reflect the euro area’s favourable situation and future prospects.This sentiment is shared by the Eurogroup, which agreed with the European Central Bank in Versaillesthat "a strong euro is in the interests of Europe". This phrase is the most concise and clear statementof Europe’s position with respect to the external value of the euro.Moreover, the G7 also concurs with the Eurosystem’s analysis. On 23 September, following theconcerted intervention on foreign exchange markets on 22 September, the G7 expressed "the sharedconcern of the Finance Ministers and the Governors about the potential implications of recentmovements in the euro for the world economy".Financial stabilityIn Europe, price stability is the statutory responsibility of the central banks, that is, the Eurosystem.Not just because that is how one safeguards the purchasing power of our fellow citizens, in particularof the most vulnerable amongst them, who have the least protection against price increases. But alsobecause price stability allows us to create the conditions for sustainable growth and dynamic jobcreation, and to combat unemployment effectively.In today’s world, however, financial stability, for which price stability is a prerequisite, is of greatvalue. We must unremittingly endeavour to create conditions for the international economy thatminimise misalignments in asset prices, excessive volatility, purely speculative phenomena anddangerous herd behaviour. This is the underlying message in central banks’ repeated calls for prudenceand caution. Nothing is more conducive to economic euphoria than ample monetary liquidity, but theafter-effects can be very painful, with the formation of speculative bubbles, sharp swings in assetprices, and the herd behaviour of huge capital flows. A monetary policy based on stability is theindispensable complement to the remarkable efforts undertaken these past years to improve theinternational financial architecture.*      *      *
BIS Review 115/20004The economy of the euro area has the favourable monetary, financial and competitive conditionsnecessary to contribute to the pursuit of growth that is sustainable because non-inflationary. But as theMonetary Policy Council has indicated these past years, monetary policy needs to be relayed by theother main components of economic policy. Four conditions would appear necessary to preserve andreinforce the complete success of the single currency.Firstly, national fiscal policies should contribute to maintaining the framework of stabilityThe single monetary policy cannot, by itself, ensure price stability in the best possible conditions.Fiscal policies must respect the letter and the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact.In the absence of a significant Community budget, the close co-ordination of national fiscal policiesand careful peer surveillance within the Council of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council—consistingof the Finance Ministers of the 15 member countries—are indispensable for there to be an appropriatepolicy mix for the euro area as a whole.This surveillance is all the more necessary as Monetary Union introduces a degree of interdependencein fiscal matters. While the short-term macro-economic effects of an excessively expansionarynational fiscal policy remain fairly restricted to the domestic economy involved, the costs in terms ofrisk premia on interest and exchange rates are borne by all members of Monetary Union. Under thesecircumstances, the Pact allows well-managed economies to avoid unwarranted risk premia byorganising a system for sanctioning excessive deficits, thus helping to prevent such deficits.Furthermore, the purpose of the Pact is to allow national automatic stabilisers to come into play wherenecessary. Its medium-term objective, which stipulates that public finances must be close to balance orin surplus, encourages the Union's Member States to re-establish as fast as possible the leewayallowing them to cope with cyclical swings or any asymmetrical shocks affecting one of them withoutexceeding the 3% deficit ceiling.Consequently, more than ever, the Member States should take advantage of the improved economicconditions in the euro area to step up their consolidation efforts.Concerning France in particular, the Monetary Policy Council notes that, as in previous years, publicspending as a percentage of GDP is too high. According to the European Commission, it stood at53.9% in France in 1999, compared with an average of 49.1% for the euro area as a whole and lessthan 40% for the G7 countries. An initial decrease in this ratio to less than 50% of GDP is necessary tomaintain the low medium and long-term market interest rates that are propitious for growth and thefight against unemployment, and to create the conditions for a gradual and lasting reduction ofcompulsory levies.Secondly, implementing adequate structural reformsThe effectiveness of economic policies is not merely the result of a good mix of fiscal and monetarypolicies. Structural policies also have a major role to play. This is particularly true in France and allthe large economies of the euro area in which, according to all international organisations,unemployment stems largely from structural factors, i.e. it is unfortunately maintained by our ownregulations and approaches.The importance of structural reforms in the effective fight against unemployment was explicitlyrecognised by the European Council meeting in Nice after those of Luxembourg and Cardiff.It is not the Banque de France’s role to take the place of the relevant authorities by issuing a list ofrecommendations for reforms in the fields of education and training, the functioning of the labourmarket or social welfare. However, as far as methods are concerned, the Monetary Policy Councilbelieves that a benchmarking principle for structural issues could be adopted in the euro area, namelyconvergence towards best practices, as we did in monetary and fiscal matters with the Maastrichtcriteria. Why not reverse the burden of proof in the field of structural reform by asking euro areacountries why they do not introduce, in their own countries, reforms that have been successfully
5BIS Review 115/2000implemented in another euro area country? The choice of such reforms should depend on threecriteria: first that they have been decided on the basis of a political consensus, second, that they havebeen implemented on the basis of a social consensus and third, that they have been successful incombating unemployment. A large number of reforms pursued within the euro area meet these criteria.Thirdly, maintaining economic competitiveness: making France an attractive business locationin an equally attractive euro areaIn the new environment created by Monetary Union and the single currency, cost and pricecompetitiveness is, more than ever a key indicator of the conduct of national economic policies.European policies must place the emphasis upon this aspect of competitiveness. Before the euro,national economic policies were based on the close monitoring of several indicators such as the tradebalance, the balance of payments, the exchange and interest rates. Policymakers thus constantlyreceived information on the markets’ main reactions to shifts in economic policy and were stronglyencouraged to take them into account where relevant.With the introduction of the euro, some of these indicators have either disappeared at the domesticlevel or their impact has been severely limited. Of course, the indicators continue to exist for the euroarea as a whole, hence the importance of the Treaty's provisions on the co-ordination of fiscal andeconomic policies.Nevertheless, the rules of the market economy continue to apply to each Member State of MonetaryUnion as well as to the Union as a whole. At the national level therefore, economic policymakers needto be even more vigilant than before regarding the indicators of competitiveness. These data, whichfocus on trends in unit labour costs, the quality of the regulatory and tax framework and, moregenerally, an economic, legal and tax environment conducive to the creation and dynamism ofcompanies, represent the main indicators shaping monetary domestic policies in the Monetary Union.The level of unit production costs is of primary importance. It would be a serious mistake to forget thisin the context of a buoyant economy. It is mainly because the French economy has preserved andstrengthened its competitiveness over a long period that we have, in the past four years, enjoyedgrowth that is robust and more rapid than that of the other large European countries, while alsomaintaining a large current account surplus. The multipartisan strategy of low inflation andcompetitiveness, conducted consistently and tenaciously over a long period, must be steadfastlypursued in the single currency context.Fourthly, the gradual change in the mindset governing our perception of economic phenomenaThe objective of durable, sustained and non-inflationary growth, which could force unemploymentdown to its low tidemark, could be more easily achieved if Europe and France gradually adopted anopen attitude towards the important “factors of production”, namely labour, capital and technicalprogress. For a long time, persistent mass unemployment, the structural causes of which were poorlyunderstood, led to the adoption of certain neo-Malthusian attitudes: efforts to reduce the availableworkforce in order to curtail unemployment, spurning productivity-enhancing investment thought tocontribute to higher unemployment and, finally, wariness towards technical progress, which was seenas a potential destroyer of jobs.Little wonder that after seeking to limit the available workforce, capital stock and technical progress,Europe and France saw that their non-inflationary growth potential was still not as high as they wouldhave wished, despite the significant advances made in recent years. Fortunately, a profound change inperspective is underway in Europe and France, and we are discarding neo-Malthusian attitudes. Thischange has been prompted notably by the new information and communication technologies and bythe realisation that the spread in Europe of pre-inflationary bottlenecks is, in itself, an obstacle togrowth that is robust and sustainable because it is non-inflationary. To entrench this change in attitude,our strategy should move in three directions to:
BIS Review 115/20006• ease the constraints on labour. Some 53% of companies currently report that they arefacing serious recruitment difficulties, notwithstanding the 9.4% unemployment rate. It istherefore necessary to step up the education, training and integration of people hithertoexcluded from the workforce. Companies in particular must increase their efforts. As theMonetary Policy Council has been recommending for the past three years, a more extensiveuse of overtime should be accepted, especially in sectors where there is a labour shortage.More generally, the increase in Europe’s employment rate from the current 61% to 70% inten years’ time, an objective which was confirmed by the European Council meeting in Niceand which aims at expanding the available workforce, is particularly timely and reveals aprofound change in attitude;• invest massively and loosen the constraints on capital. Investment is essential in oureconomy in which the capacity utilisation rate is currently at a historic high, and where anincreasing proportion of companies—41% today, as opposed to 30% at the end of 1999—areexperiencing production bottlenecks. The latest Banque de France survey shows that thecapacity utilisation rate has reached a record high. This state of affairs makes therecommendation issued by the Council over the past four years more appropriate than ever:“Now is the time to invest”.• lastly, actively seek improvements in productivity, which lie at the very heart ofeconomic growth by embracing technical progress, the digital revolution, the newinformation and communication technologies, biotechnology and material sciences and bypromoting a high level of research and development in the productive sector in France aswell as Europe. This openness to technical progress and rapid productivity enhancement isone of the keys to maintaining low inflation and a long-lasting growth, which is vibrant,sustainable and creates jobs.*      *      *This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is what I wished to say about monetary policy and the French andEuropean economies as we stand on the verge of the year 2001. May I draw your attention to the presskit that will be handed out to you. It contains documents that should prove very useful to a soundunderstanding of the economic and monetary situation, in particular the charts on productionbottlenecks and recruitment difficulties. I would also like to point out the one hundred questions-and-answers on the changeover to the euro. These should provide individuals, professionals and thespecialised press with clear and accurate information on any questions that may arise regarding thechallenging events that await us in the years 2001 and 2002. This document will be available bytomorrow on the Bank's web site at www.banque-France.fr, and it will be constantly updated.Thank you for your attention.
1BIS Review 114/2000Joseph Yam, JP: Open and connected – Scaling new heightsLuncheon Address by Mr Joseph Yam, JP, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, atthe 7th Annual Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Business Summit “Hong Kong: The Hubof Asia”, held in Hong Kong on 13 December 2000.*      *      *1.I am grateful, and much honoured, to have the opportunity to speak to this 7th AnnualBusiness Summit of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. This conference is billed as a‘business summit’. The word ‘summit’ always makes me think of one of my favourite hobbies –hiking. Those of you who have enjoyed – or endured – some of the more spectacular mountain trails inHong Kong will know what I mean. I am thinking especially of the steep ranges in the remoter parts ofSai Kung, but you don’t have to go far in Hong Kong before you find yourself in the middle of one ofour wild and mountainous country parks. They are among the attractions that make Hong Kong such aspecial place. In my view, they should be included in any list of the qualities that make Hong Kong adesirable city to do business in – along with the rule of law, a low and simple tax regime, an educatedworkforce, and so on. If you haven’t enjoyed these mountains, I recommend you take advantage ofthis long-awaited fine autumn weather to try them out. But if you are used to eating lavish lunches likethis one every day, check with your doctor before you tackle the mountains in Sai Kung. And avoidSharp Peak, the steepest, slipperiest and sharpest summit of the lot.2.Hong Kong’s economic development bears some resemblance to its mountain ranges:indeed, the dramatic ups and downs of the past decade alone form as stark a profile as anything thatcan be seen on the Maclehose Trail – the most daunting and relentless of all of Hong Kong’s hikingtrails. Go back further into Hong Kong’s history, and it is possible to see, decade after decade, thissame jagged landscape. The remarkably rapid reconstruction of an entrepot economy after thedevastation of World War II. Then the blow to Hong Kong’s entrepot position from the UNembargoes on China during the Korean War, which, far from destroying Hong Kong, helped stimulateits dramatic transformation into a major manufacturing economy. And again, in the late ’70s and early’80s, when the Mainland began to liberalise its economy, and when manufacturing industries began toshift from Hong Kong to the Pearl River Delta and beyond, Hong Kong’s re-creation of itself as aregional entrepot and its further development beyond into an international financial and servicescentre. Hong Kong has been sent more than its fair share of challenges, and there have been hardshipsand casualties along the way, but it has scaled each of them with the skills and the stamina of the bestmountaineers. And, while pausing to enjoy the view, it has also found it possible to look beyondthrough the mist to the taller peaks gleaming in the distance.WTO and Hong Kong3.The most prominent of these peaks – at least among those visible to us now – is theprospective accession by China to the WTO. It is still not clear when exactly this event will take place,although the latest predictions seem to put it at some time during the second quarter of next year. Noris it entirely clear how extensive an impact the event will have on China, on the world, on the region,or on Hong Kong – or how fast or slow the impact will be to take effect.4.Some initial assessments about the impact on Hong Kong of China’s WTO accession were,in fact, quite negative. A few were even alarmist. The trend of analysis now seems to be more positive.It is, however, qualified by a recognition of the challenges that Hong Kong faces, and of the standardswe need to maintain, and improve on, if we are to make the most of our uniquely advantageousposition. The Chamber’s own detailed analysis of the implications (which has provided a solid basisfor the discussion at this summit) is, in my view, an excellent example of what we need to help usunderstand this historical turning point in world trade relations: a rational, balanced, informedapproach to a complex issue. The study focuses its analysis through another form of ‘turning point’ –
BIS Review 114/20002the ‘hub’ – in positioning Hong Kong as a logistical, financial and digital centre of intermediationbetween the Mainland and the rest of the world. Indeed, China’s entry into the WTO, along withglobalisation and technological advance are the three processes that I believe will shape Hong Kong’srole as such a hub over the coming years.5.I have recently spoken in some detail elsewhere on the economic implications, and, inparticular, the implications for Hong Kong’s banking and financial sectors of China’s entry into WTO.So I shall deal with these only briefly here, before turning to the other two processes of globalisationand technological advance. To summarise the research by the World Bank, the HKMA and otherorganisations: China’s share in the world’s external trade is predicted to double in the space of fiveyears as a result of WTO entry – from around three-and-a-half per cent to more than seven per cent.This rapid growth in the Mainland’s share of world trade, coupled with a projected growth in tradevolume at the rate of 7% per annum, is likely to mean yet more Mainland-related business for HongKong, just as it will undoubtedly also mean a great deal more business for Shanghai and otherMainland cities as well. In other words, the business ‘creation effect’ stimulated by WTO accessionwill far outweigh the ‘diversion effect’, under which the pessimists had been predicting that HongKong’s trade would gradually dry out and shrivel up. To put a figure on it, our estimates within theHKMA suggest that Hong Kong’s annual GDP growth rate will be boosted by somewhere betweenhalf to one per cent through the increase in re-export trade resulting from China’s membership of theWTO.6.But that is not the end of it. For our less visible trade, in financial, technical and professionalservices, the outlook is even more promising. These lucrative service industries, which areincreasingly taking pride of place in Hong Kong’s economy, will be greatly boosted by business fromChinese enterprises seeking to expand their capabilities and improve their governance to handleincreased trade and meet foreign competition. They will also be stimulated by overseas investors whoneed advice on how to make the best of the opportunities on the Mainland and who find Hong Kongthe best place at which to obtain that advice. These trends have been in play for a long time – indeedthey reflect Hong Kong’s historic role as a hub of commercial, technological and cultural exchangebetween China and the rest of the world. But there are clear signs that these mediatory and advisoryservices are now receiving a boost in anticipation of WTO entry, as companies in the Mainland, inHong Kong and overseas position themselves for new kinds of commercial relationships.7.How do banking and finance fit into all of this? We expect to see two main developmentsover the next few years. The first is the greater demand for banking services resulting from thegrowing volume of business that will follow WTO accession. The second is the financial deepening,stimulated by more rapid financial liberalisation, greater banking competition, and product innovationinduced by the terms of WTO accession. These developments will accelerate the reforms already intrain within China’s domestic banking sector – reforms that cover the whole spectrum of bankingmanagement and services from corporate governance to the professional training of staff. Thedevelopments will also progressively open China’s business environment to competition from banksfrom outside the Mainland. In two years’ time, foreign banks will be able to conduct RMB businesswith Chinese enterprises in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Dalian. Within five years, they will beable to deal with all Chinese enterprises without any geographical restriction. The advantages forbanks with a base in Hong Kong are obvious. Many of them have a head start on the Mainland, withnetworks of branches and more than a generation of practical experience. They also have all theadvantages of geographical proximity, a common language and culture, yet separate financial andlegal jurisdictions that Hong Kong’s unique position in China brings. Forty per cent of the Mainland’strade is routed through Hong Kong. Hong Kong is the Mainland’s largest source of foreign directinvestment and China’s main financial conduit and funding centre. There is every reason to expect thatthese activities – all of which require banking services at a variety of levels – will continue to bechannelled through Hong Kong.8.But there are also potential diversion effects, which Hong Kong’s banks will need to addressif they wish to make the most out of their natural competitive advantages. Size is perhaps the greatestproblem. Quite apart from the obvious economies of scale, and the momentum for expansion thatlarger operations can enjoy, there seems to me little likelihood in the near future of any relaxation of
3BIS Review 114/2000the size criterion of US$20 billion for entry into the Mainland’s banking market. Hong Kong banksthat do not currently meet this criterion will have to find a way of dealing with this. The obvioussolution is consolidation, which already has many other advantages to commend it. And for those whoare fortunate enough to have been admitted before the introduction of the size criterion, they canalternatively lobby and hope for a favourable outcome of Beijing’s consideration of the“grandfathering” proposal that we have already put on the table on their behalf. On this I am hopeful,given that the grandfathering arrangement in relation to a change in policy is internationally acceptedpractice and that such an arrangement would apply to banks from Hong Kong as well as otherjurisdictions. But I also do not wish to understate the complexity of the matter when considered in thecontext of WTO negotiations.9.This substantial, but not insuperable, reservation aside, I am confident that, in terms ofproducing business for Hong Kong’s banks, the creation effect of WTO entry will outweigh anydiversion that will arise from the preference of some foreign banks and enterprises for dealing directlywith the Mainland. There will still be factors that will encourage international businesses to use HongKong as a financial centre. These include the efficiency and sophistication of Hong Kong’s financialmarkets and the financial infrastructure, the critical mass that goes with being the world’s fourthlargest banking centre, and all the qualities that single out Hong Kong, of which an audience such asthis needs little reminder: the rule of law, the free movement of goods, capital and information, lightgovernment, and a trained and energetic workforce.Globalisation10.WTO is about globalisation. So let me turn to that subject now. Hong Kong’s openness, andour connectedness to the larger world, place us in an excellent position to take advantage of theacceleration of globalisation that trade and financial liberalisation, and other forces are bringing about.Globalisation is not a new phenomenon. Our ancestors embraced the idea with the opening of tradingroutes, the building of canals and steamships, and the laying of railway lines and telegraph cables. Andfor a hundred and fifty years or more, Hong Kong has been a classic example of a global hub – a cityat the crossroads of a number of regional and transcontinental trading routes. The process ofglobalisation is not, as we are frequently reminded, a universally benevolent force. But the process haslargely ensured that international capital is allocated to where it can be most efficiently used, and thatnations produce goods and services for which they have a competitive advantage. And, whatever therisks and shortcomings, the more efficient the global financial system, the more effective the processof globalisation is. As a result, global growth and development benefit.11.It is possible to discuss this subject from a number of angles and for a very long time. But Ishould like to focus on two aspects today. One is how globalisation, as we are experiencing it today, ischanging the role of governments. The other is the implication of globalisation for the choice ofexchange rate regimes by individual jurisdictions.12.To benefit from globalisation, national economic systems have made a distinct movementtowards what Alan Greenspan has called ‘market-oriented capitalist structures’. Fifty years or moreago, the clear trend was towards state regulation, centralisation, and – at the extreme – nationalisation.Today, it is in the opposite direction: the themes are liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation.Indeed, economies are now graded on the extent of their market orientation. Governments havebecome smaller relative to the economies they serve. Market competition, freed from distortingregulation or dirigiste policies, has come more fully into play, with lower transaction and informationcosts and increased market efficiency. There is generally greater recognition of the beneficial impactof market-oriented policies, and greater realisation that globalisation has made intervention, howeverdesirable it might be in some cases, a great deal less effective.13.We have therefore seen a sea change in the way in which governments approach economicmanagement. In the post-war period the imperative of reconstruction and concerns about marketfailure predominated: so the approach was extensive government involvement in the functioning of aneconomy and frequent intervention. The consensus approach now, followed to one degree or anotherin most major economies, is government retreat from economic management, though without
BIS Review 114/20004abdicating the responsibility for seeking to ensure that the arenas in which market forces come intoplay operate in a fair, equal and transparent way.14.Hong Kong came into this new paradigm much earlier than most. In fact, the general viewoutside Hong Kong is that we are the most developed example of the paradigm. The philosophy ofpositive non-interventionism, coined twenty-odd years ago to describe the paradoxical but highlyeffective economic policy the government had already been following for some years, intersects neatlywith the rise of global ‘market-oriented capitalist structures’ of whatever size and complexity. Our freemarket tradition and our openness to the world have positioned us well for the new globalism.15.But globalisation has brought challenges of a scale and immediacy that we have not seenbefore, and our very openness has at times been our vulnerability. The most difficult of thesechallenges have been in the financial market, where problems from outside can rapidly escalate intocrises that threaten the integrity of our whole system. Capital flows, particularly those that are boostedby high leverage, have become large, fast, volatile and sometimes quite destabilising. Large economieswith deep markets may have been able to withstand the volatility without their stability being seriouslyundermined. Yet, even then, government intervention in one form or another has been necessary:witness the LTCM episode in 1998, or the more recent interventions in support of the euro. For smalland open economies, such as our own, the challenge is even harder to meet, and the measuresnecessary to prevent market failure have been even more dramatic. We faced our own episode here inHong Kong in 1998, when the shock waves from highly mobile and volatile international capital flowsthreatened our markets with collapse. Our intervention in the stock market in August 1998 to keep ourmarkets working earned us a great deal of vilification at the time, and – for the wrong reason perhapssince we did not go in to make a profit – a great deal of praise since. But let’s leave the last word onthis – at least for the time being – to Alan Greenspan. He said, in his post mortem earlier this year onthe Asian financial crisis, the following words:Official safety nets and interventions cannot be eliminated entirely. There arelimits to the size and extent of the shocks that the private sector can manage, atleast in the short run, without official assistance.16.Looking ahead, to minimise the need for government intervention aimed at heading offmarket failures induced by large and volatile capital flows, we need to build bigger markets and tostrengthen the markets we already have. The challenge here – in an age when grandiose governmentschemes are no longer palatable or feasible – is to find ways of doing this without too muchgovernment, including regulatory, involvement. Among the more significant developments in theinternational efforts to deal with this issue are codes of practice, rather than regulatory impositions,and the promotion of transparency. Increasingly, the focus is not so much on architecture – buildingsomething grand and visible to replace the now defunct Bretton Woods system – but on infrastructure:laying down the connections and making sure they work properly rather than building walls andbarriers. I shall say more about this in a few minutes.17.A crucial element in the management of international capital flows is, of course, the questionof exchange rate systems, which were a special target of large speculators looking for short-term profitopportunities during the Asian financial crisis. Where there is an exchange rate target against whichbets can be laid, the pressures that build up can be quite formidable. Even when the exchange rate isfreely floating, and therefore theoretically free of any precise exchange rate target, when sentiment isone-sided, which is often the case in financial markets, exchange rate overshooting can be quitecommon.18.Largely against the background of financial crises in the 1990s, in which the choice ofexchange rate regime has been a prominent issue, there has been a clear trend in thinking on whatconstitutes an effective and credible choice. This choice boils down to two options, in what is nowcommonly referred to as the two corner solutions: either an exchange rate target that is perceived to beimpregnable or a regime that does not involve any exchange rate target, as in a free float. Neithersolution is, admittedly, immune to crisis, particularly in the case of open and liquid markets. And theprecondition has to be that any exchange rate regime, if it is to be credible, is built upon sensibleeconomic policies, strong institutions and robust market infrastructures.
5BIS Review 114/200019.Clearly, no exchange rate regime can be perfect, and no simple regime can suit all. Thepresent trend is towards floating regimes, though these seem to work best for the larger economies,whose foreign exchange markets are big enough to absorb voluminous capital flows, and for thesmaller economies where controls and restrictions are practised. For Hong Kong, we have in ourlinked exchange rate system the most extreme case of an exchange rate target that is perceived to beimpregnable – and has been proved to be impregnable under the most adverse of conditions. The link,in combination with sound fundamentals and well managed banks, has helped us through the recentcrisis: not without hardship, it must be acknowledged, but with considerably less damage anduncertainty than we would have experienced had it not been in place. The tight discipline it exerts onour economy is helping to propel improvements in productivity, an important element in our currentrobust recovery. Indeed, the evidence to date suggests that Hong Kong experienced one of the fastestrebounds in productivity growth in the region. Labour productivity, measured in terms of GDP perperson employed, registered the strongest gains of 10% in the post-crisis period, well above otherAsian economies, whose gains were in the range of 5 to 8%. Because the exchange rate link suits anexternally oriented, entrepot economy, it will continue to serve Hong Kong well in its expanding roleas a regional and international hub, as China enters the WTO. And this applies, it should be added,regardless of the path taken by the renminbi – a path that will likely involve careful and controlledexperiments with greater exchange rate flexibility in the not too distant future, and cautious andconsidered moves towards currency convertibility in the fullness of time.Technological advance20.I made reference earlier to the emphasis in international financial reform on laying downconnections, rather than on raising up walls and restrictions. So let me turn to the process oftechnological advance, my final topic today. This is intricately linked with the question ofglobalisation, particularly in the case of information technology. Indeed, without it, globalisation aswe understand it would not be taking place. Again, this is not a new trend: over the centuries newnavigation aids, railways and steamships, the telegraph, the telephone, and later radio, television andsatellites have all boosted the speed and quantity in which information travels around the world. Nowthe internet and other electronic channels have vastly expanded that capacity.21.In the field of financial services, recent advances in information technology have played anenormous role in determining the speed and manner in which money circulates and the nature of thecompetitive landscape. Money, which was once solid, heavy and difficult to shift around, turns intoelectronic pulses, which can be sent around the world at the touch of a button in a matter of seconds.At the consumer end of the industry many of us now rarely enter a bank, but carry out our transactionson cash machines, over the telephone, and increasingly through computer terminals, and, no doubt intime, over WAP telephones. The little plastic card, of which we all have at least one in our pockets,has seen a growth in business by more than thirty times in the past thirty years. Technology does notonly manifest itself in web and wires, but also in the rarefied area of financial engineering, withadvanced mathematical models and complex equations developed to price new derivative products.These have become useful instruments for hedging purposes and for offloading and allocating risks tothose who have the appetite and capacity to take them on.22.But these developments have brought dangers and anxieties as well as benefits andconvenience. The Y2K episode – though it was well managed and ultimately uneventful – underlinedhow dependent we have become on the technology created over the last decade or so, and howirreversible that technology is. More recently, and now that the Y2K anxiety has been overcome, therapid development of e-banking has underlined other concerns about privacy, security, riskmanagement, customer protection – even about the very nature of banking – in a borderless world. Thedangers posed by innovative financial products hardly need to be laboured in a place that has beenvery much at the brunt of their more destructive forces in recent years.23.What can a monetary authority do in the face of such difficulties? I have referred already tothe drastic measures taken in 1998, and more than enough has been said on that matter elsewhere. Inthe field of regulation and supervision, we need to ensure that we keep pace with the rapid
BIS Review 114/20006developments going on, so that anxieties about e-money and e-banking – real or imagined – areproperly addressed. In this area, Hong Kong has been one of the first regulatory authorities to issueguidelines that, among other things, require banks to ensure that their internet security platforms areairtight and that risk management systems are properly in place. We have strengthened oursupervisory skills and resources to enable us to check that this is being done. This is not going to be aneasy process. No-one can predict what directions technical innovation, customer behaviour, or latentpractical problems will take. The challenge for regulators like the HKMA is to seek a balance betweennot allowing these developments to bring unmanageable risk and not stifling the application of usefulnew technology by holding back innovation. It is a difficult balance to achieve. Too great an interestby the regulator in new initiatives by the bank can often be misunderstood as heavy-handedover-regulation. The answer to the dilemma, clearly, is for regulator and industry to work hand in handin a constructive way. Our policy in this, as in other areas, is to consult with - and listen to – theindustry organisations as well as to the public at large and its representatives.24.In other areas of its work, the HKMA has itself become something of a pioneer and iscurrently a clear leader in this time zone. Of particular importance here is our work on financialinfrastructure. This is how we look at the matter. It is now possible to trade globally over the telephoneor over the net from anywhere in this world – and no doubt, with the right equipment, from out of thisworld as well. But those who trade have to come down to earth to effect settlement and, very simply,Hong Kong is where we would like them to be when they land. To serve as a financial centre in aworld connected in this way means primarily having the capability and infrastructure to capture thesedeals and provide safe, efficient and inexpensive settlement and clearing services. This is why we inthe HKMA have, since our establishment in 1993, been paying particular attention to buildingfinancial infrastructure as the foundation of our strategy in developing Hong Kong as the financial hubof Asia.25.We built over ten years ago a fully computerised and paperless debt clearing system as partof our efforts to develop the domestic debt market. We have since linked that system with similar debtclearing systems in a number of other jurisdictions to facilitate cross border and cross currencyinvestments in debt markets. We are about to develop our debt clearing system further into what wecall an ICSD or an international central securities depository in an attempt to pull debt issues in theregion into our system. In respect of the safety and efficiency in the movement of money, we builtalmost five years ago a state-of-the-art Real Time Gross Settlement system for the full range of HongKong dollar financial transactions. This RTGS system has a seamless interface with our debt clearingsystem – the first of its kind in Asia. We have just replicated that payment system for the US dollar,enabling US dollar transactions to be settled real time in our time zone rather than having to wait forNew York to open. The US dollar payment system is also linked up with the Hong Kong dollarpayment system and in September this year we achieved the first payment versus payment (PvP)transaction in world financial history between two different currencies. This arrangement makes itpossible for Herstatt risk – the risk that money might get lost during transactions between differenttime zones – to be eliminated. If payment systems for other currencies in this region are also linked upwith our US dollar payment system, then most foreign currency transactions involving the US dollarconducted in this region can benefit from this risk reduction service. There is a standing invitationfrom us to central banks in the region running real time payment systems for their currencies. I hopethey will take up this offer. And five days from now, the final phase of the system, which will allowpaper cheque clearing and delivery versus payment settlement of debt securities denominated in USdollars in Hong Kong, will fall into place. Those among you with responsibility for corporate treasuryfunctions should consider making use of this system, which will lower costs and considerably reducesettlement risks.26.Technology changes our lives fundamentally. We are somewhat lucky to be living in an ageof rapid technological revolution, and are perhaps luckier than our ancestors who experienced similarrevolutions, because the revolution now going on is directed largely towards the arts of peace ratherthan of war. I say ‘lucky’ because, despite all the uncertainties and disruptions it brings, thistechnological revolution has the potential to change people’s lives for the better. But it also bringsabout pain, and, if not applied with skill, can accentuate inequalities of geography, education and
7BIS Review 114/2000wealth. Labour is displaced by machines and software, and labour requirements turn away from thepurely physical to the more knowledge-based – witness the slowness in the improvement of ourunemployment rate. The workforce will need to adapt. And our economy will need to adapt toaccommodate the kind of knowledge-based industries that are concentrated into a logistics, financialand digital hub. And technology itself, in the understandably confused state of revolution, is awfullydifficult to price in financial markets, particularly when the highly uncertain nature of future earningsin respect of technologically intensive companies has to be taken into account, typically in the equitymarket, not to mention derivatives thereof. There has therefore been an additional, micro dimension oftechnology induced financial market volatility and this could well be manifested in enormous creationor destruction of wealth possibly to the extent equivalent to a substantial proportion of the GDP.Investors and the regulators of markets and of institutions providing credit will also need to adapt.Conclusion27.But Hong Kong and its people have been always good at adapting in the past: this is a super-flexible and super-adaptable city. There is every evidence now – after a flicker of self-doubt in the late1990s – that the vigour, the creativity that brought us through the last 50 years is still in full flow. Weshall need all of that vigour and creativity if we are really to make the most of the opportunities andride out the volatilities of the coming decades. As with most things in life, these opportunities andvolatilities come tangled together: we cannot just say yes to the opportunities without exposingourselves to the volatilities. In my speech today, I have explored what I see as the three mainopportunities for Hong Kong in the coming few years. Trade liberalisation, in its most far-reachingmanifestation – China’s prospective entry into the WTO, brings enormous opportunity for Hong Kongto enlarge and deepen its intermediary role. Globalisation is transforming the way in whichgovernment and business relate to each other, and Hong Kong is in an excellent position as an open,lightly governed city to take advantage of the process. Technological advance offers new tools torealise the practical benefits of globalisation, particularly in the field of financial services, and HongKong is in the vanguard of the innovative work that is going on.28.But these processes also carry risks and uncertainties, which can be reduced, through hardwork and vigilance, but never eradicated. How much business will be diverted from Hong Kong toother cities after China enters the WTO? How should small, open markets like Hong Kong safeguardthemselves against the shocks and threats which are transmitted more quickly, more sharply and moreforcefully through globalisation? And how, when we frankly have very little idea of where innovationis taking us or of where the dead ends may be, do we cope with the volatilities and unknowns – notleast in the financial projections of technology-led companies – of a white hot technologicalrevolution? These are among the many challenges of living in a logistics, financial and digital hub. Asone of the world’s most open and connected of cities, Hong Kong is better placed than most torespond to these challenges and to deepen further its role as a global city. We can certainly lookforward to an interesting and exciting few years ahead.
1BIS Review 113/2000Enrique V Iglesias: Economic Trends in Latin America– The Context of a Globalized EconomyStatement of Mr Enrique V Iglesias, President of the Inter-American Development Bank, at themeeting of the Bank for International Settlements, in Mexico City, Mexico, on 13 November 2000.*      *      *Dear Governors and friends:I am honored that BIS invited me to speak to this distinguished audience of Central Bank Governorsfrom so many countries. That our host, the Bank of Mexico, is celebrating its 75th anniversary makesthis a particularly special occasion.As you may expect, my topic today is Latin America. I would like to use this opportunity to conveythe views of the Inter-American Development Bank on the state of economic affairs in the region andalso to share with you some of our concerns about the future. I hope that some of these concerns maybe of interest to the BIS as they relate to its important work of strengthening financial systems.I shall divide my remarks in three parts. FIRST, I shall briefly talk about the deep reforms that ourregion undertook in the past decade, which have radically transformed for the better the economiclandscape of Latin America. However, despite the strong policies and institutions that were put inplace, as you know, our economies were overwhelmed by the external shocks suffered in recent years.SECOND, I shall tell you how our region has experienced recent international financial turmoil andhow it is currently recovering from a growth slowdown. The key question now is whether changeshave been made to prevent the same experience from happening again and, after this painful episodecomes to an end, whether growth and stability will prevail. I certainly hope so, but, FINALLY, I shallclose with some of my concerns about our continuing vulnerability to a sometimes hostile externalenvironment, which I think are of interest to the BIS and others involved in reforming the internationalfinancial architecture.1.The reforms undertaken by the region in the last decadeThe reforms were deep: In the last decade, Latin America embarked on a broad range ofmacroeconomic stabilization efforts and structural reforms that radically changed the economicenvironment.Macroeconomic stabilization has been the result of a very important effort to correct our traditionalfiscal imbalances throughout the region. Fiscal deficits larger than 3% of GDP were common in theeighties and are now exceptional: The average fiscal deficit in the last ten years has been just 1.4% ofGDP. Fiscal consolidation has been supplemented with sound monetary policies, which has resulted inmuch lower levels of inflation in most countries of the region. The typical rate of inflation in ourcountries is now 6%.The progress of structural reform has been equally impressive. In the eighties, the typical LatinAmerican economy was isolated from the rest of the world, financially repressed, and seriouslydistorted by all sorts of government interventions. That has changed. Trade restrictions have beenvirtually eliminated and tariffs have been drastically cut to less than 10% at present. Privatization hasbeen the most visible component of the strategy of modernization and consolidation of the state inLatin America. In the area of finance, liberalization measures have led to lifting controls on capital andinterest rates, as well as dismantling bankrupt systems of targeted credit.Improvements in prudential regulation and supervision of banking systems, in large part based on welllearned lessons from past banking crises, merit special mention. Banking crises of the past led toimportant lessons. The shift towards accepting and acting on these lessons began in the late 1980s, butgained its full impetus only after the Mexican financial crisis in 1994-95. The policy lessons extracted
BIS Review 113/20002include the need for accounting standards, especially concerning the valuation of loan portfolios,standards on information disclosure and auditing, the importance of regulating loan concentration andconnected lending, and the weakness of the supporting legal system, especially bankruptcy law. Thereis growing recognition in the region that international Basle capital requirements may be insufficienton average due to the larger shock volatility in Latin America, but in any event, requirements ought toreflect overall portfolio risk, not only credit but also exchange and interest rate risks. Many of theseareas of regulation, such as most of the standards, are universal and the corresponding internationalstandards ought to be promptly adopted. Others are dependent on country diversity and internationalconvergence will be more difficult. Supervision needs to be independent. Bank restructuring needs tobe done promptly, making sure that owners are not unduly saved and face potential losses.Not everything is fine, unfortunately. For all their promise, a decade of reforms have not made avisible reduction in poverty or a dent in income inequality, which as you know is a very big socialproblem in Latin America. Many economists think that inequality would have actually worsened in theperiod in the absence of these reforms, and they may very well be right, but we will not be satisfieduntil we see a significant drop in inequality.Nevertheless, reforms have improved efficiency as expected and led to higher growth and resiliency.Our research shows that macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms have led to significantgains in growth. As a result, 1997 was the year of fastest growth in 25 years. This same process led tounprecedented resiliency in the face of serious challenges during 1998-99. In fact, with the exceptionof Ecuador, fiscal discipline was maintained, inflation was tamed, and there was no uncontrolledcurrency crisis, widespread banking crisis, or external payments crisis.The reforms are solid: they were not rolled back, but withstood the 1998-99 recession. Much has beensaid about an alleged reversal of reforms. Such a reversal has not taken place. In spite of the seriousdifficulties caused by the international financial crisis of 1998-99, virtually all countries of the regioncontinued to deepen the structural reforms instituted in earlier years. Of 14 countries evaluated by theBank, 10 promoted major fiscal or tax reforms in 1999, 7 were discussing significant reforms in theirsocial security systems, 4 had made major progress in their privatization programs and 4 werediscussing deep labor reforms. The review noted an additional 25 cases of reforms in financialsystems, in legislation to promote competition and in other areas of economic and social policy inthose countries.2.Recent experience with financial turmoilIf reforms were so effective and fundamentals so strong, why did Latin America have a serious growthslowdown and recession during 1998-99? The answer is the combination of negative external shocks,to which the region remains quite vulnerable. In their absence, the region was poised to maintain apath of relatively high growth.International terms of trade and commodity prices deteriorated substantially in 1998, in large part as aresult of the East Asian crisis. Most Latin American countries are still quite vulnerable to changes incommodity prices. Some countries were severely hit by natural disasters, including El Nino.These external shocks could have been accommodated with additional external financing, but it wasnot available. Worse yet, normal external financing dried up and became the main problem. Not onlywere international capital markets not there for Latin America when they were most needed, but theyactually aggravated the problem. Unfortunately, this procyclical pattern with external financing,drying up when external conditions (such as terms of trade or interest rates) deteriorate, is typical inLatin America.Right there you have a core problem in our region: precarious access to external financing thatdisappears when it is most needed. That is why our hosts, our Mexican friends, decided to arrange aspecial stand-by financial package under the umbrella of the IMF, “blindaje” as we say in Spanish, toinsure against any market surprise during the electoral season despite the strength of their economy.This is a good example for the entire region.
3BIS Review 113/2000In this episode, fundamentals were quite strong and access would have been maintained if it were notfor the coup de grace of the Russian crisis. Subsequent financial contagion led to external financialconditions totally misaligned with the region’s strong fundamentals. This collapse in externalfinancing resulted from the problems faced by our main foreign investors, not problems in oureconomies. The problem was not our countries’ creditworthiness but that of our foreign investors.Over time, however, difficulties in accessing external finance do hurt fundamentals and may rendercountries truly uncreditworthy. From a Latin American perspective, international financial contagionand financial panic are new and dangerous sources of external shocks associated with financialintegration.The combination of negative shocks led to a severe contraction in imports and a greater growthslowdown than during the Tequila crisis in 1995. The exception is Mexico, which benefits from itscurrent association with the US economy; but South America experienced negative growth in 1999.The collapse in private foreign financing was similar in both the Tequila and the current episodes.However, this time there was a significant deterioration in the terms of trade and less help fromofficial sources.Recovery is now well under way (albeit hesitant in Argentina) and this year’s growth rate will beabove 4%, despite the fact that commodity prices and risk spreads have not completely returned tonormal. Prospects are excellent, barring new external shocks. However, the volatility of financialconditions and their overall deterioration in recent months sound a clear warning that recovery isvulnerable to external shocks. In fact, our concerns for the future, to which I now turn, areconcentrated on the extent to which we have made progress in achieving deeper and safer financialintegration.3.Is the financial world a better place now? Will growth and stability prevail in thefuture?How is the Region responding to the challenge of strengthening its financial systems?The IDB is convinced of the importance of strengthening financial systems throughout the region. Atthe IDB we have pioneered efforts to warn against the risk associated with credit booms and to deriveits implications for macroeconomic policy, to highlight the importance of standards to make regulationmeaningful, to insist on strong and countercyclical regulatory requirements, and to suggests ways toimprove the independence and quality of the institutions of bank supervision. In particular, we havehighlighted the need to adopt more strenuous capital and liquidity standards on account of the highervolatility of our economic environment. I have just received an invitation from Andrew Crockett forthe IDB to cooperate with the Financial Stability Forum in raising awareness in our region of theinternational standards that have been developed and to promote the discussion of the implementationissues that would arise. It is a pleasure for me to announce here that I am delighted to accept thisinvitation to cooperate in this issue of common interest.Countries are also very interested in finding ways to further strengthen their financial systems, to thepoint that many of them would like to have the opportunity to participate more actively in thedevelopment of new ideas and standards. As you can imagine, more participation in the elaborationprocess would greatly facilitate the productive discussion of the implementation issues of the Forum’sinternational standards that I have just mentioned. This issue of participation is critical in the case ofreform of the credit risk capital rules to ensure that it addresses the needs of all global marketparticipants. The regulatory capital framework must be drafted with a view to its implementation inemerging markets as well as advanced markets, which requires more intensive and effectiveparticipation by emerging market regulators in the drafting process. It is my hope that Latin Americanbanking regulators will be involved in finalizing the regulatory capital rules in the next and final roundof consultation starting, I understand, in January 2001, so that we are not surprised by the finalstandards.
BIS Review 113/20004As I already mentioned, there has been a solid response on the part of countries concerning the twounderlying factors of financial strength: macroeconomic stability and domestic reforms of prudentialregulation and supervision. You will find a very receptive ear to ideas to further strengthen thecountries’ financial systems. But we need to recognize that domestic protection is limited and costly.For example, countries in Latin America hold huge amounts of international reserves with asignificant carrying cost at current rates and no clear stabilizing effect. In fact, there is the fear that thevery use of the reserves may signal weakness and prompt an attack. Many countries in the regionfollow prudent policies such as stringent bank liquidity requirements, or long debt maturities, orcontrols on short-term capital inflows, but none has been spared from financial contagion. It is clearthat the systemic problems that threaten growth and stability in Latin American countries requiresystemic solutions, so the key question is:How is the financial community responding to the challenge of countries exposed to contagioneffects?Let me start by saying that we welcome the efforts of the international /financial community to workon systemic initiatives. But one concern we have is that the systemic initiatives to reform theinternational financial architecture that are currently being implemented may not be of much help toLatin America. For example, standards on banking regulation and supervision, information, etc. are allvery important and good. However, our region is already advanced in these areas, especially after theTequila crisis. The fact is that our high standards do not appear to have protected us much frominstability during recent financial turmoil. Therefore, our region could benefit only marginally fromthe application of these initiatives. Furthermore, moral hazard induced by implicit public guarantees ofpoorly regulated and supervised financial systems, which some identified as an important factor in therecent Asian crisis, is not a significant risk factor in Latin American financial systems. Therefore,initiatives aimed at reducing moral hazard might have little beneficial impact in our region.In particular, we are concerned that Latin America’s main problem of precarious access to externalfinancing, subject to contagion and panic, is not being specifically addressed. Latin America is now asvulnerable to contagion and panic from abroad as it was before this last episode. (I will come back tothis key point at the end of my talk).We are also concerned that current thinking about international financial architecture does notenthusiastically support official rescue packages of the kind that were so successful in our region, in1995 in Mexico and Argentina and in 1998 in Brazil. The current debate points to promoting stabilityby impeding capital inflows through the increase in the cost of capital to the point that it reflects thetrue risk of investments, which would be underestimated by investors because they believe that theofficial sector will bail them out. The problem is that, again, this source of moral hazard is not asignificant factor in Latin America. The simple fact is that rescue operations of past years stopped thecountries’ downfall, led to fast recovery, and were quickly repaid. Nobody was bailed out from highrisk. Rather, the rescue packages eliminated an unnecessary risk (the liquidity risk), yielding anenormous benefit to countries and to the whole region. I grant you that there is the risk that suchoperations may not always work as anticipated. But, I wonder: how conservative would donorcountries have to be in order not to favor rescue packages in countries with strong economies aftercrisis prevention fails?More generally, it is cause for deep concern that new thinking on international financial architecturemay involuntarily have counterproductive effects on Latin America. Our concern is that we simply endup with lower capital inflows and growth but no worthwhile gain in stability. Subjecting the privatecapital to uncertainty and discretion will have this effect. The curtailment of official financial supportwith the purpose of eliminating moral hazard would at the same time fail to prevent liquidity crises. Ifthe latter is more relevant than the former, as I think it is in Latin America, the result would be notonly less capital but also less stability!Let me offer some concrete examples of our concerns in connection with the currently proposedmodification of the Basle Capital Accord for bank credit risk. As I already mentioned, IDB has longhad an interest in strengthening the regulatory framework for banks and making it flexible to
5BIS Review 113/2000accommodate financial stress. To the extent that the new regulatory capital rules provide emergingmarket supervisors with stronger tools for assessing the strength of a bank and for encouragingbankers to improve their risk management systems, I believe that the proposed new rules couldcontribute greatly to the development of more mature lending markets. Having said that, it isimportant to recognize that in this proposal the cost of capital will increase in most of our countries.As you know, at present net bank lending has largely disappeared already and this may be a lethalblow to this class of credit. I am not sure this is a cost worth paying. Apart from that, there are anumber of concerns that I take the liberty to stress:• We do not think that the use of private rating agencies to determine capital requirements forsovereign lending is a good idea. First, it puts the agencies in a position to play God withcountries’ fortunes, which neither the region nor the agencies want. And second, it is likelyto be destabilizing as agencies try to conform to market perceptions.• In contrast, in Latin America we like to think that internal rating systems are a more sensiblebasis for a BIS system. I should also mention that a number of countries in the region havesuccessful public credit bureaus that should also be taken into consideration as a possiblestandard to be used in setting requirements.• The proposal that no private company should receive a rating better than its sovereign’s isnot consistent with the evidence of corporate and sovereign market risk spreads and appearsto be an artificial limitation.• Capital requirements on short-term loans ought to be lower for countries in which domesticliquidity provisions are more prudent. This is the case of Latin America. Uniformly higherrequirements would implicitly put our region at a disadvantage and discourage its ownprudential policies.• Finally, I understand that according to private banks the proposed changes to the definitionof short-term credit could adversely affect the trade financing business, and if so, I would bevery concerned too.I would like to close by sharing some thoughts with you on the kind of reforms that we think would beneeded to address our key problem of precarious and unreliable access to external financing.• First, liquidity crises appear to have become common in emerging countries. Like bank runs,these crises can be prevented and solved by the provision of liquidity. An internationalmechanism is needed to produce the required funding. Real progress demands addressingthis issue. I recognize the difficulties and risks, and think that easy access to liquidity has tobe restricted to countries prequalified on the basis of their fundamentals. The ContingentCredit Line (CCL) Facility of the IMF, perhaps made more attractive to countries, is a goodfirst step in this direction.• Second, it is imperative to contain the degree of financial volatility to which countries aresubjected during episodes of panic and financial contagion. I think we need to look atregulations in developed countries and ask ourselves how they can be adjusted to address theproblems created by contagion and panic in emerging countries. It seems to me thatregulations ought to be flexible in order to lean against the wind of financial turbulence anddiscourage the propagation of contagion. For example, impose less stringent regulation onemerging country financing in times of international financial contagion. At the same time,the IDB and the rest of the official sector need to be ready to offer financial support duringthese temporary emergencies.• And finally, there is the important issue of how to coordinate the efforts of countries, theprivate sector, and the official sector, especially in the most severe crises. I think that theofficial sector should lead, move first, and propose a consistent plan. However, thiscoordination requires some rules of the game, and not be left to improvisation, so thatofficial intervention is not perceived as arbitrary by countries and private investors.“Constructive ambiguity” in this case produces “destructive ambiguity”. Ex ante rules would
BIS Review 113/20006go a long way in solving some of the tensions surrounding private sector involvement. But Iwould go further. It seems to me that those rules should contemplate a private sectorcontribution only to the extent needed, so that countries can quickly regain access to privatefinancial markets.In a recent article in Financial Times, Martin Wolf, commenting on emerging market economies,ended with these words that deserve our attention:“Optimists are not wrong: we do know how to make emerging market economiesmore seaworthy than they have been. But pessimists are also right: the turbulentglobal capital markets remain dangerous for the unprepared. Those managingemerging market economies should be aware of the risks. They must understand,too, that they will receive only modest help from outside. The price of safetyremains careful preparation and eternal vigilance.”Thank you very much for your attention.
1BIS Review 113/2000Bodil Nyboe Andersen: Monetary policy and financial marketdevelopments in DenmarkSpeech by Mrs Bodil Nyboe Andersen, Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank, at the Annual Meetingof the Danish Bankers Association, held in Copenhagen on 6 December 2000.*      *      *In 2000 monetary policy has been the focus of more attention than we are accustomed to. Monetarypolicy is normally a relatively anonymous exercise in Denmark – except in periods of foreign-exchange unrest.But the debate leading up to the referendum on Denmark’s adoption of the euro on 28 Septemberbrought monetary policy into the limelight in two respects. Considerable interest was shown in thestructure and monetary policy of the European Central Bank, while Denmark’s fixed-exchange-ratepolicy and its significance to monetary policy were also in focus.The ECB’s monetary policy naturally attracted interest because if Denmark had decided to adopt theeuro, we would have participated in the single monetary policy, and participated fully in the work ofthe European Central Bank. Being outside the euro area, the ECB’s monetary policy is also of interestto us since our fixed-exchange-rate policy entails that our monetary policy mirrors that of the euroarea.Up to the introduction of the euro and in the spring of 1999 the European economy was characterisedby weak economic growth, with very low inflation expectations. This entailed reductions of theofficial interest rates. During most of 1999 the ECB’s benchmark interest rate was only 2.5 per cent.However, as from autumn 1999 inflation prospects in Europe deteriorated and since November 1999the ECB has successively raised its interest rate to almost twice that level, so that it is now just under5 per cent.In certain periods monetary policy also drew a lot of attention because of the great contrast betweeneconomic growth in the USA and Europe, and the strong inflow of capital to the USA. This caused thedollar to strengthen, despite a massive US balance-of-payments deficit. Notwithstanding the euro’srecent strengthening, there is general agreement that the euro is still clearly undervalued in relation tothe dollar.However, it is not the task of the ECB to directly manage the euro/dollar rate by adjusting interestrates, nor is this the responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Both central banks must ensure internalstability as the central element of their monetary policy. Nevertheless, excessive fluctuations ormovements in exchange rates may be countered by intervention, as we have seen on a few occasionsthis autumn.The objective of the ECB is stated in the Treaty to be price stability. This has been defined as a rate ofprice increases of less than 2 per cent in the medium term. It follows that the ECB’s central task is toensure the stability of the euro – not in terms of the dollar rate, but in terms of the euro’s purchasingpower.The current average rate of inflation in Europe is somewhat higher than 2 per cent, primarily due to thestrong oil-price increases. But, as stated, the objective of the ECB’s monetary policy is to influenceinflation in the medium term. The decisive factor is thus not the current inflation rate, but expectedinflation. Interest-rate decisions are forward-looking and must be based on an assessment of expectedfuture inflation. The ECB recently announced its intention to publish its economic projection twice ayear. Together with a number of other indicators of the economic and financial situation thisprojection forms the basis for discussions of interest-rate policy.In view of Denmark’s fixed-exchange-rate policy vis-à-vis the euro the ECB’s monetary policydetermines the development in the Nationalbank’s interest rates. The benchmark short-term interest
BIS Review 113/20002rate, the Nationalbank’s rate for lending and certificates of deposit, is thus determined on the basis ofthe euro interest rate, plus a spread reflecting Denmark’s foreign-exchange situation.At the beginning of the year this interest rate stood at 3.30 per cent, which was 30 basis points higherthan the ECB’s equivalent interest rate.In view of the considerable outflow of capital the interest-rate differential widened during the springand the summer. At the end of 1999 the foreign-exchange reserve amounted to kr. 165 billion. By theend of the 3rd quarter of this year it had fallen to kr. 108 billion. Therefore the interest-rate differentialgradually widened from 30 basis points in January to 45 basis points in June, while at the same timethe Nationalbank followed suit on the four occasions that the ECB raised its interest rates.At the end of June the ECB adopted a new method of determining the interest rate for the mainrefinancing operations. A minimum bid rate is now fixed at meetings of the Governing Council.Liquidity is allocated every Tuesday under a tender procedure. In the tender procedure the actuallending rate tends to fluctuate a good deal, which affects the Danish interest-rate differential. TheNationalbank has chosen to mirror only the major changes. This means that we will not adjust ourlending rate if the euro interest rates fluctuate by a few basis points in either direction.Maintaining Denmark’s monetary policy unchanged thus requires more frequent adjustments in thelight of the ECB’s new procedure for liquidity allocation, as a consequence of which the actuallending rate is subject to greater fluctuation.Immediately after the referendum the Nationalbank raised the lending rate by 0.5 per cent, therebywidening the interest-rate differential to 95 basis points. The intention was to prevent uncertaintyconcerning the krone’s exchange rate. Since then, it has been possible to narrow the interest-ratedifferential to around 60 basis points, in view of a certain reflow of foreign exchange. Nevertheless,the interest-rate differential is still twice as high as at the beginning of 2000.It is very satisfying to note that the fixed-exchange-rate policy has not encountered any seriousdifficulties during this year. Although money-market interest rates were rather high for a period up tothe referendum there was no actual foreign-exchange unrest at any time. There was a tendency for anoutflow of capital, which was countered by the Nationalbank’s sale of foreign exchange and thewidening of the interest-rate differential, so that a very stable krone rate could be held against the euroin 2000 so far. This could only be achieved on the basis of the strong confidence in thefixed-exchange-rate policy.Together with the effects of the Whitsun package of economic measures the development in exchangerates has contributed to a strong improvement in the balance of payments over the last two years.However, even with a favourable balance-of-payments situation and a stable exchange rate a fiscal-policy tightening may be necessary, if the low unemployment rate exerts greater pressure on pricesand wages. On several occasions the government has announced that it will not hesitate to tighten theeconomy if the fixed-exchange-rate policy so requires.The fiscal-policy agreement does not represent a tightening of fiscal policy. Even in the light of aconsiderable government budget surplus in 2001 the Finance Act agreement must be characterised asrather expansionary. Moreover, it does not entail the type of structural improvements in the labourmarket which Denmark has implemented successfully in recent years.It is to be hoped that other factors will counteract the expansionary fiscal policy in the coming year. Inany case it is important that fiscal policy is not weakened further during the year, and that the objectiveis to return to a tight fiscal policy in the following years.We are very proud of Denmark’s economic development in current years, but we must not forget theold saying that the seeds of future problems are sown in the good years. This applies to themacroeconomic balance, but also to the financial sector.That is why politicians and the Nationalbank alike have often on occasions like this warned the banksagainst being too bold when the going is good. The old saying is still as valid as ever. It is now that thebanks must prepare themselves for future losses.
3BIS Review 113/2000It is therefore surprising to note that the Finance Act agreement includes a reduction of the liquidityadvantage on the provisions of banks and mortgage-credit institutes. The Nationalbank will notcomment on the issue of whether it is fair to increase the taxation of the financial institutions tocounteract the reduction of the corporation tax. Nevertheless, we find the choice of a method whichreduces the incentive to make provisions to be unfortunate.Experience shows that a prudent provisions policy, together with ample own funds, is vital to theability of financial institutions to weather periods of recession.The financial sector has seen many mergers during the past decades. The mortgage-credit sectoraccounted for most mergers in the 1970s and the 1980s, while the period around 1990 saw majormergers in the commercial bank and savings bank sector. Later on, the special focus has been oncross-border mergers, with the transgression of both sectoral and geographical borders.This has resulted in larger, but also more complex, institutions which make new demands not only ofboards and management, but also of the authorities. A particular problem is that legislation is based onfinancial institutions with a clear national foundation, even though they have extensive internationaloperations.This has, for example, led to agreement on intensified cooperation between the supervisory authoritiesof the Nordic countries. The Nordic central banks have also set themselves the task of evaluating therole of the central banks in relation to the cross-border financial groups.The functioning of the financial markets is affected by the restructuring into fewer and largerinstitutions.The money market especially is characterised by the reduction in the number of participants. Themoney market is an inter-bank market for trading liquidity between banks. An active market andefficient price formation require a suitable number of major market players. The mergers reduce thenumber of participants, however, so that liquidity flows are internalised within the individualinstitutions.Prohibitions or regulations cannot change this, since the very objective of the money market is todistribute liquidity among the individual financial institutions. The fewer and the larger the banks, theless need for redistribution. However, several smaller banks still depend on the money market and onefficient price formation. We expect the large banks to continue to safeguard this structure. Otherwise,the Nationalbank will occasionally have to play a more active role on the money market than before.The foreign-exchange market is characterised by a small number of active Danish participants and alsoa number of foreign participants trading kroner against foreign currencies.Another important factor is that as an element of internationalisation major capital transactions aremade to and from Denmark in connection with the acquisition and sale of companies and portfolioinvestments.These transactions sometimes have a significant impact on the foreign-exchange market, emphasisingthat the Danish krone is a small currency in international terms.The third financial market, the capital market, may also be affected by the decrease in the number offinancial institutions. However, efficient price formation for bonds depends especially on investorbehaviour. The restructuring of the tax system from real-interest tax to return-on-capital tax haseliminated the former locking effects on the capital market. The new rules on the taxation of the returnon capital of institutional investors are neutral in relation to portfolio restructuring within the sector.The cooperation between Danmarks Nationalbank and the Danish Bankers Association and itsmembers covers a wide range of topics. These years have seen a number of major projects calling forthe development of new types of cooperation. The payment systems have been modernised andsignificant innovations are being introduced in the statistics area. At the beginning of 2001 we willcommence the publication of balance-sheet statistics for financial institutions in a new format. All ofthese projects require a major effort on the part of the banks, and not least their IT departments.
BIS Review 113/20004On behalf of the Nationalbank I would like to thank all of our cooperation partners who are part of theDanish Bankers Association.
1BIS Review 112/2000Gordon Thiessen: Why a floating exchange rate regime makes sense for CanadaSpeech by Mr Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Chambre de commerce duMontréal métropolitain,  Montreal, Quebec, 4 December 2000.*      *      *Why a floating exchange rate regime makes sense for CanadaAs I near the end of my term as Governor, I find myself looking back more and more, focusing on thebroad, longer-term trends in our economy and in financial markets and on what those trends mayimply for the future.One of the issues that has often surfaced over the years is the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar.Indeed, over the past couple of years, it has been a topic of considerable public discussion. Thatdiscussion has revolved around such questions as: Should we continue floating, or should we peg ourcurrency to the US dollar? In fact, should we even keep our own currency, or should we adopt the UScurrency?That there is such interest in our exchange rate is hardly surprising. Some of the more recent attentionno doubt stems from public concern about the relatively low value of the Canadian dollar incomparison to the US dollar. But the fundamental reason for this interest is that the exchange rate is animportant price in an economy, particularly in one as open as ours. Exports represent about 40% oftotal Canadian output. And if we add imports, this proportion doubles to 80%. In addition, more than80% of this trade is with the United States. So the value of our currency in terms of the US dollar hasalways been particularly important for us. But we must be careful not to exaggerate this point, becausewhen it comes to exports, we compete with many other foreign countries for a share of the US market.And so the exchange rates of those currencies relative to ours also matter a great deal.In 1950, after the Second World War, Canada became the first major country to adopt a floatingexchange rate. In 1962, we went back to a fixed exchange rate only to float our currency again in1970. In all, the Canadian dollar has floated for 42 out of the past 50 years. No other major countryhas had as much experience with a floating exchange rate.This does not mean that our floating exchange rate regime has somehow outlasted all its critics! Forthe most part, though, the debate over the years has been about the market value of the Canadian dollar- whether it has floated too high or too low, especially from the viewpoint of certain exporters andimporters.More recently, however, and certainly here in Montreal, some of the discussion has focused more onwhether a floating currency is the right exchange rate regime for Canada. This particular debate hasbeen kindled by the advent of the euro and its adoption by 11 members of the European Union at thebeginning of 1999.I entered that debate early in 1999, arguing that the introduction of the euro was a remarkableachievement, but that it did not provide a useful role model for Canada and for our position in NorthAmerica. Since then, with increased interest in the subject internationally, there has been considerablediscussion of exchange rate alternatives for Canada and for other countries.In Canada, the debate about exchange rate regimes has been mainly among academic economists. But,with the decline of our currency against the US dollar through the 1990s, the exchange rate has alsobeen raised as a concern in the business community when comparing our less-impressive economicperformance with that of the United States.Outside Canada, the debate on exchange rate regimes has also become more active, especially in partsof Latin America that have had a long history of high inflation and exchange rate crises. Indeed, insome of these countries, commentators have argued in favour of the outright adoption of the UScurrency.
BIS Review 112/20002Today, I would like to return to the issue of the right exchange rate regime for Canada. Having againconsidered the advantages and disadvantages of our current arrangements, I can tell you at the outsetthat I remain convinced that a floating exchange rate continues to make sense for us at this stage of ourhistory. I propose to examine the different sides of the argument with respect to a floating currency inas simple and straightforward a manner as possible.The transactions costs of a floating currencyWhen the amount of cross-border trade and financial transactions is as large as ours is with the UnitedStates, the need to exchange currency raises the cost of such transactions. Moreover, if the currenciesinvolved are floating, so that the future level of the exchange rate is uncertain, there is also a foreignexchange risk to consider and to hedge against. For example, investors and borrowers must take intoaccount not only the level of interest rates in Canada and the United States, but also potentialmovements in the exchange rate over the term of their investment or loan. So, yes, there are certaintransactions costs in having a separate currency.A fixed exchange rate between the Canadian and US currencies, such as we had from 1962 to 1970,does not do away with all these transactions costs. Conversions between the two currencies would stillbe required. Moreover, a fixed exchange rate does not eliminate currency risk. If there were anyperceived risk of a future devaluation of the fixed rate for the Canadian dollar, the result would bepersistently higher interest rates in Canada than in the United States to compensate for that risk.Even where countries have gone beyond a fixed exchange rate and have tied their currencies rigidly tothe US dollar - as Hong Kong and Argentina have, through a currency board - the costs, in terms ofrisk premiums in domestic interest rates, have not completely disappeared.So, in fact, the only way to eliminate cross-border transactions costs with the United States andeliminate premiums in our interest rates for potential exchange rate risk is not through a fixedexchange rate but through some sort of currency union with the United States. In reality, this wouldmean “dollarization”.Dollarization versus monetary unionBut why not a common-currency arrangement, as in Europe? Wouldn’t that be better?On the face of it, of course, a currency union would be better than dollarization. Under such anarrangement, we would, in principle, still have some say in determining a North American monetarypolicy. Presumably, we would also be able to keep some of the revenue (or seigniorage) from issuingthat common currency.But we must understand what a North American monetary union would mean in reality. The Europeanexperience is rather enlightening in this respect. Economic and monetary union in Europe is theproduct of 50 years of increasing political and economic integration. The recent adoption of a commoncurrency, which was a further step on the road to European integration, was taken mainly for political,rather than economic, reasons. And when it comes to decision-making at the European Central Bank,the three large countries in the euro area (Germany, France, and Italy) have agreed to a “one country -one vote” rule with their other eight medium- and small-sized partners.I do not see how we could possibly have similar arrangements in North America, given the cleardominance of the US economy. In effect, a monetary union with the United States could only meanthat Canada would adopt the US dollar.The advantages of a floating exchange rateSo far, I have been focusing on the costs of cross-border transactions and the exchange rate regimesthat could reduce those costs. But that is not all that matters. The real world is a more complicated
3BIS Review 112/2000place, as I shall explain in a moment. And that is why a floating exchange rate regime makes sense forCanada.The case typically made for a floating rate for Canada is that it gives us the chance to run anindependent monetary policy. That is true. But these days, there is really very little difference in thelow-inflation objectives of industrial countries. The real value of a floating exchange rate for Canadais that it allows us to have different monetary conditions than the United States - monetary conditionsappropriate to our own economic circumstances, even as we pursue the same general objective of lowand stable inflation. The significance of having this option is our ability to respond to externaleconomic shocks that affect us differently from our southern neighbours, or to respond to differencesin domestic economic policies.Let me give you a couple of examples of economic shocks and policies that have reflected thesedifferences.Fluctuations in world commodity prices are an important first example. Although our reliance onprimary commodities has diminished substantially through the years, such goods still account for30 to 40% of Canada’s exports. The United States, on the other hand, is a net importer ofcommodities. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, which led to a 20% decline in the prices of thekey primary commodities that we export, was a major negative shock for Canada. In contrast, theUnited States benefited from these lower prices.The decline in the value of our currency against the US dollar at the time was in response to thateconomic shock. And it helped Canadian manufacturing and other non-commodity sectors to increasetheir exports to the United States. In this way, the impact of falling employment and incomes in ourprimary sector because of the lower commodity prices was largely offset by greater expansion in theseother sectors.Another example involves the fiscal restraint measures that were undertaken by our federal andprovincial governments, beginning in the mid-1990s, to deal with persistent deficits and the resultingunsustainable accumulation of public debt. The United States also had a budgetary problem. But theneed for fiscal tightening was much greater here and so was the effect of the corrective measures ontotal demand in our economy. To help the transfer of resources from the public to the private sectorand so support overall demand in Canada, we needed lower interest rates here than in the UnitedStates. These lower rates were maintained through most of the period from 1996 to the present. Intoday’s globalized financial markets, such persistent interest rate differences in the circumstances Ihave described are possible only with a floating exchange rate.In both these examples, the exchange rate acted as a shock absorber between the US and Canadianeconomies, helping to facilitate the needed adjustment in response to differing shocks and differingpolicy requirements. Even though our two economies are closely linked, they can move in differentdirections. And when that happens, the shock-absorber role of a floating exchange rate is invaluable.Although these recent examples involved downward adjustments in our currency, this has not alwaysbeen the case. Indeed, there have been times when economic shocks and policy differences in the twocountries have worked in the opposite direction, leading to increases in the value of the Canadiandollar.It is, of course, possible to cope with unexpected shocks and policy differences under a fixed exchangerate or a monetary union. But the adjustment process will take longer, will be more difficult, and willcost more overall.Imagine the adjustment in our economy that would have been required in 1997-98 in response to thefall in commodity prices, if the Canadian dollar had not been floating. To maintain a fixed exchangerate throughout that period, much higher interest rates would have been necessary to resist thedownward pressure on our currency from the falling receipts for commodity exports. In effect, thiswould have meant a more serious economic slowdown to bring wages and salaries down to a level thatwould make other industries more competitive and allow them to increase their exports.
BIS Review 112/20004Even under a common-currency arrangement, we would still have had to go through much the sameadjustment over the longer term. But under such an arrangement, more of the short-term pain - interms of declines in employment and incomes - would have been felt in the primary industries and inregions of Canada with a higher concentration of such industries.The bottom line is: There is no escaping the need to adjust to real economic shocks regardless of thecurrency regime. But a floating-rate regime does help to facilitate and smooth the adjustment process.Before concluding, I would like to quickly deal with a couple of common misconceptions aboutflexible exchange rates.The first one relates to the incentives for business to innovate and invest in new technology. If theargument here is that a low exchange rate gives exporting firms easier profits and blunts theirmotivation to innovate and become more efficient and competitive, I am inclined to say that thissuggests a rather serious problem of corporate governance. Surely, the job of company directors is toensure that management is doing everything necessary to maximize profits and stock values, no matterwhat the circumstances. Any company that does not operate this way will soon find itself losing to thecompetition.Another misconception is that a relatively low exchange rate puts a country at a disadvantage in termsof foreign takeovers. Here, I would say that if Canadian companies became more attractive in recentyears to US corporate buyers, it was primarily because of high stock market valuations in the UnitedStates, not because of a lower Canadian dollar. High stock prices essentially provided US companieswith very cheap financing for corporate takeovers in countries where market valuations were lower.We saw a similar process involving Canadian takeovers of foreign companies more recently, whenstock market valuations hit very high levels in this country.Concluding thoughtsLet me summarize my main points. In view of our close economic and financial links with the UnitedStates, I recognize the attractions of the reduced currency uncertainty and lower transactions costs thatwould be part of a fixed exchange rate arrangement with the US dollar.Nonetheless, I believe that for Canada, the macroeconomic advantages of a flexible exchange ratecontinue to far outweigh the lower transactions costs of a fixed rate. As long as we remain a majorproducer of primary commodities, and as long as we want to pursue separate economic policies thatare suited to our own circumstances and that require differing monetary conditions, the shock-absorberelement of a floating currency will serve us well.Does a floating exchange rate regime mean that we are likely to have a persistently weak currency?No, it does not.Through the second half of the 1990s, we have seen a US dollar that is strong against virtually allother currencies, reflecting the remarkable performance of the US economy. In the process, however,the United States has also built up a very large cumulative deficit in its transactions with the rest of theworld. At some stage, this external deficit will have to be reversed, and a lower US dollar will be partof this adjustment.Here in Canada, after a slow start in the early 1990s, the fundamentals of our economy have improved.Growth has been more robust in recent years, employment and incomes have been rising, and inflationis low and stable. Government budget deficits have been eliminated, and the public debt relative to thesize of our economy has been shrinking. Moreover, as part of a major restructuring effort by theprivate sector, businesses have been investing heavily in machinery, equipment, and technology. Wemay now be starting to see the payoff of these efforts, in the form of some larger productivity gains,which I hope will grow and continue, thereby providing the basis for improved standards of living forCanadians in the future.All in all, the prospects for our economy are very positive. If these prospects are realized, we will alsosee a stronger Canadian dollar over the medium term.
1BIS Review 111/2000Lee Hsien Loong: ASEAN post-crisis - rebuilding confidence and prosperitySpeech by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Chairman of the MonetaryAuthority of Singapore, at the Bank of Thailand, Bangkok, 30 November 2000.*      *      *Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,IntroductionI am honoured to be here today to deliver this lecture organised by the Bank of Thailand inconjunction with the 72nd birthday celebrations of His Majesty the King. On this joyous occasion, onbehalf of Singapore and its citizens, I wish His Majesty good health and many happy returns of theday.The topic of my talk today is, “ASEAN post-crisis: rebuilding confidence and prosperity”. The Asiancrisis is past, but its consequences are still with us. I propose to review the post-crisis environmentwhich ASEAN faces today, and discuss some of the lessons to be drawn from the crisis. Then I willfocus on what ASEAN and its member countries should do to restore confidence, long-term growthand prosperity in the region.Passing of the crisisThe financial crisis swept through ASEAN economies like a tidal wave. Between 1997-99, thecombined GDP of the original five ASEAN members fell about one-fifth, in US$ terms.Unemployment rose, businesses folded, and governments and societies came under stress.Three years after the crisis struck, the region is stabilising. The worst passed much sooner than manyexpected. The recovery initially depended on expansionary fiscal policies, and strong exportsespecially of electronics products. But it has now broadened. Intra-regional trade is buoyant. In mostcountries, consumer spending has rebounded, and private investment has picked up.Challenging conditions remainThe recovery has given the Asian economies breathing space to tackle the problems uncovered by thecrisis. But these problems have not gone away. Post-crisis ASEAN faces major challenges. North EastAsia seems to be doing better than South East Asia. And continuing political and economic difficultiesin South East Asia, plus the perceived weakness of ASEAN as an organisation, are strongly colouringthe views of analysts and investors.North East AsiaThe thaw in relations between North and South Korea bodes well for North East Asia. South Korea,one of the crisis countries, has recovered quickly and strongly. Under President Kim Dae Jung, thegovernment pushed hard for economic reforms, restructuring the chaebols and cleaning up the bankingsector. Last year South Korea recorded the fastest growth in Asia - 10.7%.South Korea’s reforms are now running into difficulties. The actual task of breaking up and selling offpieces of the chaebols is encountering stiff union resistance. But North East Asia continues to attractinterest. Other than South Korea, another major reason is China.China has weathered the economic crisis much better than many analysts had expected. Its economyslowed down but did not falter, and is now growing strongly again. China is continuing with its
BIS Review 111/20002economic reforms, improving its investment environment and offering attractive long termopportunities for investors.China’s imminent entry into the WTO is a major plus for China’s economic development. Asia willbenefit from China’s continued stability and prosperity. But China’s entry will also mean strongercompetition for ASEAN countries, particularly those which depend on labour intensive industries.ASEAN’s exports will be affected, as will its foreign direct investments.South East AsiaIn South East Asia, many countries are still tackling economic and political issues. Economically, thebroad view is that progress in reforming the banking and corporate sectors has been slow, causing theregion to remain vulnerable to any softening of external demand.Politically, Indonesia is in the midst of a wrenching transition, with the final resolution still unclear. Inthe Philippines, the political unrest and now the impeachment and trial of President Estrada hasaffected the peso, the stock market, and the economy. In Malaysia, UMNO is striving hard to win backthe Malay ground, and is fending off a strong challenge from PAS, the opposition Islamic party.Thailand is preparing for general elections.ASEANThe crisis has also raised doubts about ASEAN’s credibility and relevance as a regional organisation.ASEAN appeared divided and slow in responding to the crisis, and even now is seen as weakened anddrifting.The expansion of ASEAN to 10 members has made it harder for the organisation to maintain focusand reach consensus. From a long term geopolitical perspective, this expansion is crucial forASEAN’s strength. But in the short term it has added to doubts about ASEAN’s viability.Regional and international journals have portrayed ASEAN as drifting apart. Analysts doubt whetherASEAN countries can get together to pursue economic cooperation, lower trade barriers and restoreprosperity and confidence. As one analyst said on BBC TV:“A lot of these issues are more or less on hold. … there’s very little impetus forreally substantial change in the past few years and ASEAN hasn’t coped well withthe various political and economic crises that the region has seen.If you look at investment, it’s really shifted to Korea, to China and it’s going toprobably get much more competitive when China joins the WTO. In many ways, alot of Southeast Asia has lost its competitive edge. The political problems,economic problems have really hurt the region. So, what you are seeing now is alot of investors really reassessing their view of this region and moving much moretowards the north east of Asia.”1Falling behindThe figures confirm this. Since 1996, Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) to the North have continuedto rise, whereas FDIs to the South have fallen to about half pre-crisis levels. As a result, SoutheastAsia’s share of total FDIs to East Asia (excluding Japan) halved, from 33% in 1996 to just 15% in1999.In equity markets, Southeast Asia’s weight has declined, while Northeast Asia’s has increased. Beforethe crisis, Southeast Asian markets had more than twice the weight of Northeast Asian markets1Robert Templer of Strategic Intelligence, interviewed on Asia Business Report, BBC TV, 22 November 2000.

Now the position has been totallyreversed.Lessons from the crisisASEAN countries must not allow this situation to continue. They should strengthen themselvesindividually, and also work together to sustain their long-term prosperity. Then they can dispel theperception of a region in distress, restore confidence and get on the move again.Sound fundamentalsWhat lessons should ASEAN countries draw from the crisis? First, that despite the upheaval, thetransformation of East Asia over the last two decades was no mirage. The Asian miracle was real - thehalving of poverty rates, the dramatic improvement in living standards, literacy and health standards,and the modernisation of the economies. Asia’s prolonged boom had been underpinned by soundeconomic fundamentals. These remain a vital positive factor, which can help ASEAN to prosperagain.However, many economies had significant structural weaknesses. Financial regulation and supervisionwere weak, transparency was lacking, and there were serious shortcomings in governance and publicadministration. “KKN” - the Indonesian acronym for corruption, collusion, and nepotism - was often aproblem. These weaknesses may or may not have caused the crisis, but they certainly contributed to itsseverity. The weaknesses must be resolutely tackled, otherwise even if economic growth resumes, thefundamental problems and vulnerabilities will remain.Capital account risksSecond, the crisis exposed the risks of opening up capital accounts prematurely. A free flow of capitalcan provide countries with much needed funds to develop their economies. But countries have toliberalise their capital regimes in step with the strengthening of their domestic economy andinstitutions. If they open up before their corporate sectors and financial systems are ready, they run therisk of being swamped by volatile capital flows, both inwards as well as outwards.Bank financing risksThird, the crisis highlighted the dangers of relying too heavily on bank financing. Capital markets inmost ASEAN countries are relatively under-developed. Before the crisis, many firms borrowedshort-term in foreign currencies, in order to finance long-term projects earning revenues denominatedin local currencies. These mismatches exposed the borrowers, the lenders, and the entire system toconsiderable risks. When the crisis struck and currencies plunged, there was a vicious spiral.Businesses were saddled with a massive increase in debt burden from their foreign currency debts, andran into difficulties. This got the banks into trouble, which, in turn, left firms with no alternativeavenues to raise working capital to stay afloat. Countries therefore need to develop their capitalmarkets, so as to diversify their sources of funding and reduce their dependence on bank lending.The international financial systemBeyond these domestic factors, the crisis has also uncovered weaknesses in the international financialsystem, and raised questions about the roles of the IMF and World Bank. Several international groupsare examining these issues. They have made useful proposals and recommendations to improveaspects of the global financial architecture, although some issues still remain contentious, such as howto regulate hedge funds. The task now is to implement without delay those reforms on which broadconsensus has been reached. The reforms will not prevent all future crises or mishaps. However, theyshould make financial systems, especially in emerging markets, more robust and less vulnerable tocontagion effects when the next crisis strikes.
BIS Review 111/20004Rebuilding confidence and prosperityGiven these conclusions, what should ASEAN do to rebuild investor confidence and achieveprosperity?Accepting globalisationFirst, countries have to accept that globalisation is a reality. They should take advantage ofglobalisation, and not fight against it. It is a powerful trend that can bring benefits to their people.Before the crisis, ASEAN had prospered by riding the wave of globalisation. Their take off had beenfuelled by strong investments by MNCs, buoyant exports and freer trade and economic policies.Within ASEAN, the most open economies were also the fastest growing, whereas isolation led tostagnation.Against this backdrop, the crisis came as a profound shock, which could easily have caused a backlashagainst globalisation. Had countries turned their backs on foreign investments and exports, it wouldhave impoverished them and weakened the region. Fortunately this has not happened.There have been understandable nationalistic sentiments against selling distressed companies at lowprices to foreigners. But all ASEAN countries continue to seek foreign investments and trade. Theirpeople are eager to learn English, and to exploit the internet. They know that plugging into the globaleconomy is still the best way to sustain growth, and to create jobs and prosperity for their citizens.They also know that competition has become keener, and that they have to make their economies moreattractive to foreign investments. As Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin acknowledged inhis recent Budget speech:“In a borderless world, large international conglomerates have greater choices intheir investment decisions.”Accepting globalisation means progressively deregulating and liberalising ASEAN economies, easingrules on foreign ownership and participation, and opening up hitherto protected sectors. By exposingtheir economies to the winds of change and the pressures of global competition, countries willstrengthen their own players, who will learn to hold their own without crutches or protection.Of course the process has to be managed. Sudden deregulation of a controlled economy may lead tochaos and collapse, as happened in Indonesia in 1998, when the IMF pressed the Suharto governmentto dismantle everything overnight. But properly implemented, opening up will lead to substantial longterm benefits and prosperity, despite the short term social and economic costs.Globalisation does not mean that ASEAN countries should allow themselves to be swamped byforeign companies. It is a legitimate ambition for countries to want to build up their own strongcompanies. But the companies need to be internationally competitive; it is not viable for them todepend on protected home markets. Companies which cannot hold their own domestically will find itvery difficult to compete abroad.Furthermore, governments must understand what industries they have the best chance of building up,given the nature of the global marketplace. In many industries technology and economies of scale haveled to a worldwide wave of mergers and consolidations. For example in banking and automanufacturing the scale has become global, with a few large players dominating the worldwidemarket. In these industries, the most promising approach for small and medium countries is to seekinvestments from these major players, not to build up their own national champions to compete againstthe giants. This is what Thailand has done with the auto industry.Globalisation has its downside. The competition is intense, the environment is constantly and rapidlychanging, restructuring and upgrading are endless tasks, and unpredictable disasters strike from timeto time. All this brings disorientation, new insecurities, and a sense of loss of control. But governmentshave to manage these problems and risks. They need to cushion the social impact of globalisation, tohelp industries that are no longer viable make the change, to equip the population with the necessaryskills for the new economy, and to provide a social safety net for those at the bottom. There is no realalternative to accepting globalisation in order to improve the lives of our people.
5BIS Review 111/2000ASEAN economic cooperationIt is also important for ASEAN countries to work together, both to strengthen cooperation amongthemselves, and to address international issues of common concern to all of us.ASEAN economic cooperation was progressively gaining momentum before the crisis. Majorinitiatives had been launched, especially the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEANInvestment Area (AIA). These promised to increase significantly the flow of trade and investmentsamong ASEAN countries.However the crisis has caused some countries to hold back, in order to give struggling domesticindustries more breathing space. These pressures are real, but in their anxiety to protect individualindustries, countries should not lose sight of the wider benefits of ASEAN cooperation to theireconomies as a whole.It is therefore important for ASEAN members to reaffirm their commitment to regional economiccooperation and integration, and implement AFTA and the ASEAN Investment Area in letter andspirit. The ASEAN members which are doing relatively better, such as Thailand, Malaysia, Singaporeand Brunei, should take the lead, and work together to put ASEAN cooperation on track again.At last week’s 4th ASEAN Informal Summit in Singapore, ASEAN leaders launched an Initiative forASEAN Integration or “IAI”. It is intended to narrow the divide between the older and newermembers of ASEAN and enhance ASEAN’s competitiveness as a region. It is a framework for themore developed ASEAN members to help those members that most need help, and in so doing makeASEAN prosper. To kick it off, Singapore is offering a package of IT training and assistance in humanresource development to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, while China, Japan and SouthKorea have also offered assistance that falls within IAI’s broad framework.Of course, ASEAN’s future depends as much on external factors as it does on these direct initiatives topromote intra-ASEAN trade and investment, and build up the economic strength of individualmembers. Our economies are highly dependent on international trade, and it is in our interest to worktogether actively for a freer, more stable and secure global trading environment.ASEAN therefore needs to support an open, stable multilateral trading system under the WTO, and theearly launch of a new round of trade negotiations. Strong multilateral rules are the foundation forworld trade, and protection against anarchic bilateral and unilateral trade policies. Small countriescould not survive without them; even large economies would be much poorer off in a tit-for-tatenvironment. Hence ASEAN strongly supported the candidacy of Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi for theDirector Generalship of the WTO.Besides the WTO, ASEAN and its members need to take full advantage of APEC, supporting itsconcept of “open regionalism”, and its goal of free trade and investment in the Asia Pacific region.ASEAN also needs to explore links with other regional groups, for example with North East Asiathrough a possible free trade area with China, Japan and South Korea. At the Informal Summit, theASEAN plus three countries clearly recognised that it is not in their own interest for the dividebetween Northeast and Southeast Asia to continue widening. The “plus three countries” want to workwith ASEAN, to develop closer and deeper linkages between the two sub-regions.The way to strengthen ASEAN economic cooperation is by participating actively in these externalfora, and not by opting out of them. This will send a strong signal to the world that ASEAN remainsan open and outward looking organisation, with its members welcoming competition andstrengthening themselves as a group. It will help restore ASEAN’s credibility as a vigorous andeffective organisation that plays a responsible, relevant role on the international stage.Corporate sector restructuringThe third area on which the crisis countries have to focus attention is their corporate sectors. Insolventand non-viable companies have to be restructured, to set growth on a firm basis and restoreconfidence. The problems differ from country to country, but some fundamental issues are common.
BIS Review 111/20006First, the huge outstanding debt owed by the corporate sector must be resolved, as cleanly andexpeditiously as possible. Governments need to step in to push the process through, and in extremis totake over insolvent firms and do the clean-up themselves. Clear and enforceable bankruptcy laws areneeded to deter prolonged default by debtors, and give creditors incentives to settle. And for thefuture, there must be more transparency in terms of corporate governance and reporting.For example, Thailand passed new bankruptcy and foreclosure laws last year, and I understand hasjust passed a new Accounting Act. Among other things, the new laws will stipulate minimumqualifications for auditors, and ensure that directors take greater responsibility for the accuracy offinancial statements. Investors and analysts will view these steps positively, especially if foreclosurecases brought under the new laws and now before the courts are fairly and speedily settled.Second, many private sector firms, particularly family-owned companies, need to upgrade andmodernise their management.Family businesses and conglomerates are a feature of many Asian economies. These were built upthrough the business acumen and drive of their founders, and still account for a sizeable component ofthe economies.But the world has changed. Capability and competence are now at a premium, and relationships countfor less. Family companies need to segregate clearly ownership rights and management functions, andbring in other significant shareholders and external capital. Their challenge is to evolve into moderncorporations that are more than family companies. They need to be run professionally by the best manfor the job, and not by heirs who may or may not have inherited the business skills and acumen of thefounder.Third, governments need to untangle the complicated and deeply-entrenched ties between state, banksand industry, which exist in many Asian countries, like the chaebols in South Korea, or thestate-owned enterprises in China. Such industries and enterprises often account for a significant shareof GDP, but they are neither subject to market discipline, nor driven purely by economicconsiderations. They often find it difficult to operate as efficiently as private sector firms. Banks fail toapply normal criteria in approving loans, because of political pressure or implicit state guarantees.Employees enjoy de facto life-time job security. Well-connected persons help themselves to privilegesat the companies’ expense. And governments find it politically impossible to close down theoperations, no matter how unsuccessful.It is essential to speed up restructuring and reforming these unproductive enterprises. In China, thegovernment is making a massive effort to reform its SOEs. In South Korea President Kim Dae Jung ispushing chaebols to rationalise and consolidate, and change their traditional ways of doing business.ASEAN countries must not lag behind, or else it will affect confidence in their investment climate.Banking sector reformsBesides pursuing corporate restructuring, ASEAN economies must persevere to clean up andrecapitalise unsound banks, and strengthen the banking sector. Banks play a critical role in everyeconomy. For ASEAN economies to continue to grow, they will need new investments. Theseinvestments will require financing, by sound banks able and willing to lend to sound borrowers.The immediate priority is to speed up the resolution of the non-performing loans (NPL) within thebanking system. The process is underway, but is far from complete. Even today, NPLs in someASEAN countries remain well above 20%. As in the case of corporate restructuring, effectivebankruptcy laws are essential. Asset Management Companies (AMCs) need sufficient power to dealexpeditiously with debts which are unrecoverable. Otherwise the banking problems will infect thewhole economy, and drag countries into the same deep-seated malaise as Japan.Finding new money and writing off bad loans is the relatively easy part. It is more difficult, butequally important, for banks to put in place proper systems, structures, and prudential standards, toprevent the same problem from happening again. They need to establish rigorous credit cultures. They
7BIS Review 111/2000must lend based not on personal relationships, but on objective assessments of the borrowers’creditworthiness.Many countries are encouraging bank mergers and consolidation as part of their plans to strengthenthe financial sector. Mergers can help to strengthen the commercial banks, and give them the scale tocompete in the globalised financial industry. However, mergers by themselves are insufficient. Unlessmergers are accompanied by other measures to improve corporate governance, we will merely createone large weak bank out of several small weak ones.Financial sector reforms also have to include strengthening of the supervisory system and institutions.Had supervision been adequate in the first place, the problems would not have become so grave.Professional and independent supervisory authorities will tighten standards of acceptable bankingpractices, and over time instil rigour and rectitude among all participants in the system. Thesupervisors have to set standards, penalise errant lenders, and remove implicit guarantees. Creditdiscipline will foster the emergence of stronger companies, and provide the basis for sustained growth.Political and social preconditionsAll these policies - accepting globalisation, fostering ASEAN economic cooperation, restructuring thecorporate sector, and reforming the banking sector - are essential for countries to recover. But to be ina position to implement and make such economic policies work, countries must first create the rightpolitical and social preconditions.Investors, both domestic and foreign, will adopt a wait-and-see attitude until they know how politicaluncertainties are resolved. Their views are coloured by past experiences, and they will look forevidence of a clear break with the past.A stable political climate is essential to foster confidence, investment and growth. Governments mustput their houses in order, bring corruption under control, and install men and women of integrity andcompetence to key positions within the top leadership. As Mr Anand Panyarachun, former PrimeMinister of Thailand and now President of the Thai chapter of Transparency International, said:“The very basis of a non-corrupt culture is integrity. … It is a state of mind, anattitude. You can be corrupt without taking any money.”2The values, norms and business environment of ASEAN countries cannot be transformed overnight. Itis more than enacting new laws and regulations. It means changing deeply established socialrelationships and norms which vary from country to country. Businessmen, civil servants andpoliticians used to operating in one way for years will not suddenly abandon or condemn old practicesas soon as a new law is passed. Mom Rachawong Chatu Mongol Sonakul put it aptly:“What we are doing is a very long process. We’re not talking of months or years.We are talking in, maybe, decades or generations. We’re not changing our way ofworking. We actually try to change our way of life.”3These are matters that each country has to resolve for itself, in its own way. External inputs can behelpful, but may also be counter-productive. For example in Indonesia the IMF sought drasticeconomic reforms, which inevitably had far-reaching political implications. The result was a completecollapse of the Suharto government. But creating a new order to follow this is now a challenge whichonly Indonesia’s people and leaders can resolve. Foreign advice and assistance now play only asecondary role.2Asiaweek, 3 November 2000.3Keynote address during a seminar organised jointly by the Bank of Thailand and the World Bank entitled “GoodGovernance for Financial Institutions” on 10 June 2000.
BIS Review 111/20008There are, therefore, no one-size-fits-all solutions. Each country will have to pick up from theexperiences of others, and adapt these experiences to their own conditions. Each will have to judge foritself the right balance and speed of changes to suit its own needs and circumstances. Nobody else hasthe same stake in the outcome.ConclusionThe crisis has been a major setback for ASEAN and its member economies. Many external observersand investors still consider our economic prospects doubtful, and see ASEAN as an ineffective sunsetorganisation. These perceptions are political facts which can define political reality. If ASEANeconomies do not deliver by way of structural reforms and strong, sustained economic recovery, andNorth East Asia continues to pull ahead, international investors will relegate us to the sidelines, andwe will be marginalised.Perceptions, however, can be proved wrong. The best answer to them is real action and change. Wemust strengthen our economies and make ourselves more competitive, while safeguarding ourselvesagainst external shocks. We must press on with economic cooperation among ourselves, and with therest of the world. And each country must set its own house in order, by creating the politicalpreconditions, restructuring its corporate sector, and reforming its banking system. Then the resilienceof individual members will result in a strengthened ASEAN as a whole.ASEAN and its members have overcome many difficult challenges over the past three decades.Despite the crisis, we are much better off today than we were before the economic take off. The roadahead is indeed difficult. But the ingredients which fuelled our rapid growth in the past are all stillthere. Given the political will and the right policies, I am confident that in time ASEAN will recapturethe lost ground, and thrive and prosper into the new century.
1BIS Review 110/2000Antonio Fazio: The relationships between currencies and goldSpeech by Mr. Antonio Fazio, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the World Gold Council InternationalConference “The Euro, the Dollar and Gold”, held in Rome on 17 November 2000.*      *      *1.“If a gold standard had never existed, it might be necessary to invent something of the kind”. Thisquotation from a monograph by Dennis Robertson (Money, 1928, p 122) refers to one of the positiveaspects of the gold standard: that of shielding central bankers from pressures to increase the moneysupply. After the First World War the return to gold was in fact the overriding objective of economicpolicymakers, in order to ensure monetary stability.The economic disequilibria produced by the war were so pronounced, however, that they made it hardto re-establish the gold standard. The cost, in terms of welfare, imposed by inflation, rising public debtand war reparations was so high that it prevented the rapid return to gold.The Genoa conference of April 1922 laid the foundations for an important innovation: the creation ofthe gold exchange standard, under which gold was flanked by convertible currencies and central bankswere granted greater autonomy; this was to be used to stabilize the value of gold, through internationalcooperation. However, the new system did not enjoy the same credibility as the earlier regime and, atthe same time, failed to leave the monetary authorities sufficient room for manoeuvre. Culturally stillunder the influence of the gold standard, the monetary authorities were in any case little inclined tocooperate and tended to accumulate gold reserves, thereby exerting powerful deflationary pressure onthe economy.The monetary disorder of the thirties created the need for a new reform, which was implemented afterthe Second World War with the Bretton Woods agreements.The suspension of the dollar’s convertibility on 15 August 1971 officially cut the link between legaltender and gold - an epochal change after more than 2,500 years during which money had always beenbased explicitly or implicitly on a precious metal, prevalently gold.2.The abandonment of a monetary system hinging directly or indirectly on gold was a consequence ofthe severe economic disequilibria that developed between the two world wars. The advances made inmonetary theory also exerted a powerful influence.Ricardo provides us with a clear indication of the main objective of the gold standard: “To secure thepublic against any other variations in the value of currency than those to which the standard itself issubject, and, at the same time, to carry on the circulation with a medium the least expensive…”. Healso noted that: “Experience, however, shews, that neither a State nor a Bank ever had the unrestrictedpower of issuing paper money, without abusing that power: in all States, therefore, the issue of papermoney ought to be under some check and controul; and none seems so proper for that purpose, as thatof subjecting the issuers of paper money to the obligation of paying their notes, either in gold coin orbullion.” The same concepts are to be found some hundred years later in Irving Fisher.The success of the gold standard was due, among other things, to the broad consensus on metallismand the classical model; one of the latter’s key features is the self-adjusting ability of the economy.The restoration rule, which required the gold parity to be re-established after a period of suspensiondue to exceptional circumstances, was an essential part of the gold standard. Short suspensions ofconvertibility made it possible to overcome temporary difficulties. The system allowed discretion to be
BIS Review 110/20002exercised only within very rigid limits. Gold acted as an anchor both for the monetary system and forthe economic system by making maintenance of the parity a constraint on economic policy.A commodity standard, however, is not without its weaknesses, owing to the impossibility ofcontrolling the money stock in the face of exogenous fluctuations in the quantity of metal. Given theshort-run non-neutrality of money, countries suffered substantial welfare costs in deflationary periods,as in the closing decades of the 19th century. During the heyday of the gold standard several proposalswere put forward to overcome this difficulty: Jevons’s revival of the tabular standard, Marshall’ssymmetallism and Fisher’s compensated dollar. Wicksell even suggested cutting the link with preciousmetals altogether, thus anticipating by a quarter of a century Keynes’s radical approach in the Tract onMonetary Reform (1923).England’s ephemeral return to gold in the first half of the 1920s and, just a few years later, the terribleimpact of the Great Depression greatly affected economic and political thinking.The discussion on monetary reform ceased to be confined to the purely academic domain. Theadvocates of reform (including, albeit with different approaches, economists such as Keynes, Fisher,Hawtrey and Robertson) focused primarily on the “artificialness” of the value of gold: demand for themetal depended crucially, among other things, on the conventions that governed the monetary systemsof the various countries. While Keynes held that gold had exhausted its monetary role, othereconomists, such as Fisher and Hawtrey, continued to assign it a leading part, although they envisagedthat central banks would neutralize the variations in its value - with the result that gold itself would beanchored.Keynes’s once heterodox view became widely accepted, since the malfunctioning of the monetarysystem was seen as one of the main causes of the propagation of the Depression.On the eve of the Second World War, the need to reform the monetary system faced economists withan intellectual challenge. For the first time in history, experts designed a new monetary “order”, to useProfessor Mundell’s expression.The Bretton Woods architects set themselves the objective of re-establishing a fixed exchange regimeand allowing each country to pursue a full-employment policy by means of capital controls. Paritychanges were to be permitted only in the event of “fundamental disequilibrium”, which was notdefined.In practice the system turned into a fixed-rate dollar standard. The importance attributed to domestictargets in the economic policy of the United States undermined the coherence and operation of thesystem, thereby preparing the ground for the abandonment of the link with gold and the move tofloating exchange rates.3.In the decade immediately following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods regime, the world economybecame prey to high and variable inflation. This tendency was subsequently halted when, afterabsorbing the effects of the real shocks of the seventies, monetary policies were directed with greaterdetermination to restoring price stability. Floating exchange rates proved highly volatile.In the last 30 years the international monetary system has come to find itself in a position where theexpansion of credit and the creation of money have not been constrained, at the global level, bybinding rules. After the about-turn in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve at the end of theseventies, the restrictions imposed on the stock of money in the leading countries put a brake onmonetary growth. Nonetheless, the combination of fiat money and the possibility of short-term capitalmovements between the different parts of the world has led to a system which does not permit theexpansion of credit to be closely controlled and which is inherently unstable.In this context price stability is ensured in the leading countries; to some extent their behaviour theninfluences that of the world economy.
3BIS Review 110/2000Economic theory has taught us, rigorously (consider, for example, the analysis put forward byPatinkin), that even with fiat money the price level can be determinate when the central bank exercisescontrol over the nominal quantity of money.The creation of important monetary areas - that of the euro alongside those of the dollar and the yen -contributes to the stability of the world economy, even though many countries remain outside theseareas.The expansion of credit at the international level is closely connected with the operation and stabilityof banking systems and capital markets.Important steps are being taken to subject countries outside the main monetary areas to standards ofbanking supervision that help to ensure the orderly expansion of credit and money.4.In the absence of rigorous control over the quantity of money at world level, the last two decades haveseen crises that, despite their occurring in just a part of the globe, have triggered a combination ofinflation and deflation, with the destruction of some of the savings accumulated in banking systemsand slowdowns in the growth of economies. The crises have become more frequent in the last fiveyears and their effects more far-reaching as a consequence of contagion.The enormous advances made in data processing and telecommunications have fostered a growth ininternational monetary flows and total financial assets that has far exceeded the expansion of the worldeconomy. This has undoubtedly contributed to the growth in productive investment at the global levelin a period marked by low inflation, attributable in part to the increased competition in trade in goodsand services and especially raw materials.The last five years have been marked by very rapid growth in the stock of financial assets made up ofpublic and private-sector securities and bank deposits. The expansion began in 1995 at the time of thedecision to carry out massive interventions in the foreign exchange markets in order to correct thepricing distortions between the dollar and other weak currencies on the one hand and the yen and otherstrong currencies on the other. On that occasion sales of yen against dollars amounting to several tensof billions of dollars were made; at the same time, a policy was adopted aimed at reducing yen interestrates until they were close to zero.The expansion of yen-denominated liquidity enabled the dollar and other weak currencies, includingthe lira, the peseta and sterling, to strengthen. The global market saw the start of bond and sharepurchases by highly-leveraged intermediaries; the latter borrowed funds at low cost and then investedin financial markets, making substantial use of derivative instruments.The parallel growth of the New Economy in the United States, consisting essentially in an increase inthe productivity of capital and labour connected with the large-scale application of informationtechnology to production, led to a flow of capital to the United States and a continuous rise in shareprices, which, in five years, roughly tripled.The ratio of financial wealth - shares, bonds and the money stock - to annual GDP at current pricesrose from 240 to 360%.The growth of derivatives makes it possible to carry out transactions with very high leverage,increases the velocity of circulation of the money balances used for financial transactions.Interest rates and the cost of capital have decreased. The recovery of the world economy, under waysince 1999, is connected with these developments.The American economy, performing as a high-growth component of the global economy, attractscapital while simultaneously helping to sustain economic activity in the rest of the world with itsimports.The low cost of capital is helping the expansion of investment in Europe and other parts of the globe.These developments can be said to have constituted an application on an international scale of the
BIS Review 110/20004process, theorized in the past by Tobin, of monetary expansion increasing the value of the existingcapital stock and thereby stimulating investment.The process up to now has followed a virtuous course, without excessive inflationary pressures thanksto heightened competition and productivity gains in the United States. Its Achilles’ heel is the rise inthe prices of raw materials and energy products.5.The gold reserves of the central banks today amount to some 32,000 tons, about one quarter of theworld stock.Like other real assets, gold can appreciate when there is widespread inflation, which remains a threat.Gold’s importance as a monetary anchor came to an end with the emergence of more rigorousmonetary policies in the 1980s and especially the 1990s. But in periods of crisis gold can constitute asort of reserve or guarantee “of last resort” for a country, as Italy demonstrated during the 1970s.This view appears to be shared by the central banks of the leading industrial countries; when theysigned the September 1999 agreement, they stated that gold continued to have an important role toplay in the management of global reserves.It is up to economists to analyze whether and to what extent, in an international monetary system thathas surely not yet become fully consistent in many of its parts, reference to gold, which performed amonetary function for thousands of years, can still contribute, in the decades ahead, to preserving thatfundamental condition for orderly economic activity - price stability.The experience of the period following the Second World War shows that macroeconomicstabilization has always provided the basis for the growth of the most successful economies.Conserving this stability and the soundness of economies’ fundamentals is one of the principal tasks ofgovernments and central banks.
1BIS Review 109/2000Gazi Erçel: The role of the euro from the Turkish standpointSpeech by Mr Gazi Erçel, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, made during the6th International Financial and Economic Forum, held in Vienna on 9 November 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I would like to thank the organizers of this conference for inviting me to share my thoughts on the euro’srole as seen from the Turkish point of view.Of course, the introduction of the euro is affecting not only the economies that are members of theEuropean Union but also non-member economies that have close links with members. These includeemerging market economies much of whose trade and financial transactions is with European Unionmembers. Those whose external debt is largely denominated in European Union currencies will beaffected the most.Even though Turkey is not yet a member of the European Union, it has close ties with countries that are.Not only does Turkey carry on a large volume of foreign trade with EU members, it is also the onlycandidate for membership that has entered into a customs union with the EU, signed at the end of 1995.Turkey’s close relationship with EU countries and the present role of the euro in the Turkisheconomy are illustrated by the following:• Europe is Turkey’s largest trading partner. In 1999, 54% of Turkish exports - $14.3 billion - and53% of Turkish imports - $21.4 billion - went to or came from EU countries.• About 54% of Turkey’s official reserves consists of Euro - 11 currencies and the euro itself.• The foreign exchange deposits belonging to Turkish workers in other countries and held in theCentral Bank of Turkey amount to about 11 billion euros, almost 93% of which is in the form ofdeutsche marks.• Our external debt totals about US$106 billion, 34% of which consists of Euro - 11 currenciesand the euro itself.• Since 1 January 2000 the Turkish Treasury has borrowed via bond issues in the internationalcapital markets a total US$7.5 billion, 37% of which is denominated in euros.• During the last five years, 60% of direct foreign investments in Turkey came from Europe.• Of the 9.3 million foreign tourists who visited Turkey during the first ten months of this year,5.1 million came from Europe.Given the breadth and depth of Turkey’s relationship with the European Union, it is no wonder that theeuro and the creation of a European currency will powerfully affect the Turkish economy from now on.Assuming that the euro is accepted by the international financial markets as a stable reserve currency, themedium and long term will see the euro’s share in Turkey’s financial accounts continue to increase. Ipersonally think that acceptance of the euro in daily life and financial transactions will come faster inTurkey than in other countries, for three reasons: the large numbers of Turkish citizens living in Europe,the large volume of trade and tourism transactions with Europe, and the consistent stability of the deutschemark for 20 years and more. The introduction of the euro has reduced transaction costs and removed therisks connected with more volatile currencies, increasing the incentives for European capital markets torely more on direct financing. A deep, liquid, and efficient euro bond market will be welcomed by Turkishsovereign and private bond issuers. Moreover, the volume of transactions in the euro bond market isexpected to be much larger than today.
BIS Review 109/20002Increased acceptance of euros in Turkish trade and financial transactions, of course combined with anenvironment of low inflation, will make direct investments in Turkey more attractive to European firms.Turkey’s presently very small total of direct foreign investments from European investors would surely beencouraged to grow by the disappearance of foreign exchange risks.Under such circumstances, both Turkish and European banks could be expected to increase their mergerand acquisition activities.For the short term, the most important goal is to promote the euro as an international currency. Successwill crucially depend on the new currency’s acceptance by the people of the EMU countries and othercountries as well. The faster this acceptance can be achieved, the greater will be the euro’s strength as acurrency in the medium and longer term. Unfortunately, we cannot say this has already happened. Itsdepreciation against the US dollar has not promoted increased confidence in the euro.This is probably a good moment to describe how the fluctuations in the euro/dollar exchange ratehave affected the Turkish economy. A low valuation of the euro would affect our economy throughtwo channels: first, through the euro’s role in our new exchange rate system; and second, through thelarge share of EU countries in our foreign trade.At the beginning of the year 2000, Turkey launched a comprehensive disinflation program based on a pre-announced path of the Turkish lira against a currency basket consisting of “1 US dollar plus 0.77 Euros.”Mainly by taking advantage of the remarkable pass-through of the exchange rate to price levels, thisprogram has brought about a considerable lowering of the inflation rate. Unfortunately, the rapidappreciation of the US dollar against the euro in the international markets has somewhat weakened theeffect of the exchange rate basket on inflation. During the first ten months of this year, the Turkish liradepreciated by an average 26.5% against the US dollar, but by an average 6.5% against the euro. Theoperation of the pass-through mechanism to price indices in Turkey is much stronger for the dollar than itis for the euro, or previously was for the deutsche mark. Turkish inflationary expectations have beenfollowing the behavior of the US dollar. Under these circumstances, inflation outcomes have laggedabove the targeted level. In addition, due to the preannounced depreciation path of the Turkish lira againstthe currency basket, the continuous depreciation of the euro against the dollar has resulted in a loss ofcompetitiveness of Turkey vis-à-vis Europe. Due to this chain of events, the total value of Turkey’simports from the EU countries has risen 29.6% in the first half of the year, while the value of Turkey’sexports to EU countries has grown by only 3.4%. In other words, the depreciation of the euro hascontributed to Turkey’s growing trade deficit, which was initially mistaken for a side effect of thedisinflation program. In this situation, the correction of the euro’s value against other major currencieswill have a beneficial effect on Turkey’s current account balance, in addition to the offsetting of thenegative effects of the weak euro provided by the high productivity of our manufacturing sector and thediversified nature of our exports.The weak euro has also led to a portfolio shift in the Turkish economy. At the end of September, totalforeign exchange deposits in Turkish commercial banks amounted to US$43 billion. Of this 27%consisted of euros, which have decreased in value by 38.5% since the end of 1998. The share of USdollars gradually increased during the same period from 58% to 71%.At the Central Bank, we have also shifted the currency composition of our reserves from euros to USdollars. The share of euros in our reserves has fallen from 73% to 54%, and there has been a parallel shiftin the composition of our foreign exchange liabilities.Now let me point out two major positive effects of introducing the euro into the Turkish economy.The first positive effect is that elimination of the transaction costs arising from a multitude of Europeanexchange rates has encouraged the use of the euro as a unit of currency. Between 1994 and 1998, theeuro’s share in the current account’s foreign exchange receipts averaged 37% and in its foreign exchangeexpenditures averaged 32%. Eighteen months after the introduction of the euro, these figures have barelychanged: the respective shares are 40% and 33%.The second positive effect is that the Convergence Criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, and the CopenhagenCriteria, require economies seeking to join the EU and EMU to become efficient market economies andachieve a high degree of verifiable convergence with the EU. As we all know, the requirements include
3BIS Review 109/2000price stability, low market-based interest rates, stable exchange rates, and sustainable public finances. Andwhether or not it is considered immediately important for Turkey to become a member of EMU, theseconvergence criteria can give us an effective means of disciplining our economy.This is why we have launched a comprehensive disinflation program aimed at reaching single-digitinflation and eliminating macroeconomic imbalances by the end of 2002. Winning for Turkey thepossibility of membership in the EU and EMU is one of the main goals of our program.The ideal of independent central banks is a core issue for the countries of the European Union. We arecurrently in the process of examining our Banking Law to determine what must be done to bring it up tothe standards promulgated by the European System of Central Banks. New modifications are planned tomake price stability the principal goal of monetary policy. Debt monetization will no longer be allowed.The new Law will also grant more independence to the Central Bank.Before ending these remarks, I want to point out that introducing a single currency and reaping the fullbenefits of doing so is a long-term endeavor. For the time being, Turkish monetary policy is directedtowards a single transparent objective, that of price stability. Price stability will serve as a link between theinitial expectations about the euro area and the potential economic benefits of a single currency system.The reforms and changes executed up to now will provide a base for ambitious future policies that willbroaden the area of integration and encourage the faith of economic agents that the area offers additionalbenefits such as greater price transparency, improved efficiency, growing investments and economicactivity, and a more competitive environment. And no doubt the world economy will also have a share inthese benefits.
1BIS Review 109/2000Urban Bäckström: The Swedish economySpeech by Mr Urban Bäckström, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank and Chairman of the Board ofDirectors and President of the Bank for International Settlements, to the Swedish ShareholdersAssociation, in Stockholm on 28 November 2000.*      *      *First a word of thanks for the invitation to talk to you this evening. My topic is the Swedish economyand monetary policy. Provided nothing unexpected occurs, in my opinion it will soon be time to raisethe repo rate. It is, however, difficult to tell just when this will happen. The Board is made up of sixmembers, each with their own opinion of what is the most appropriate monetary stance and a say inthe final decision. But this evening I would like to elaborate on why I personally believe it will soonbe time to raise the repo rate.In order to put the present monetary policy situation in perspective, we need to look back some yearsinto the past. During 1996, when confidence had been established in economic policy’s overallcommitment to price stability and the consolidation of the public finances had begun, the Riksbankwas in a position to initiate a comparatively marked reduction of the repo rate. This had been precededby a period with a tight monetary stance, when the repo rate had reached a high of almost 9%.When the 2% inflation target was introduced, few observers believed at first that trend inflation wouldultimately land up around 2%. We would do well to remember, however, that people’s perceptions ofthe future are often shaped not so much by words as by actions. So, after a series of purposefuldecisions by the Government, the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) and the Riksbank, economicpolicy’s general commitment to macroeconomic stability began to inspire confidence.Economic policy’s credibility gave the Riksbank greater freedom to actThe growing confidence accordingly meant in turn that, without jeopardising the objective of pricestability, the Riksbank was able to lower the repo rate relatively markedly, from almost 9% to justover 4%. Interest rates for longer maturities also fell. This led, as we have all seen in recent years, notjust to higher GDP growth but also to a more uniform development of demand in different sectors.When the cyclical upswing began towards the end of 1993, most of the growth came from the exportsector. However, lower levels of interest rates benefited Swedish households and firms by easing theheavily restrictive effect of the high level previously. This contributed to an increase in domesticdemand as well and broadened the economic upswing. That can be said to have instigated theconsiderable reduction of unemployment we have seen in recent years.Neither the Asian crisis in 1997 nor the turbulence in international financial markets in the autumn of1998 had much of an impact, thanks not least to a monetary policy realignment in many countries. TheSwedish repo rate was also cut, to a low of 2.90%. So despite these crises elsewhere, growth inSweden remained stable at an average annual rate of 3 to 4%. When the unrest had subsided, the reporate was raised to the current level of 3.75%.The Riksbank has heralded a repo rate increase for some timeDuring the past year, Riksbank representatives have frequently said that sooner or later, a continuationof strong economic activity will make a further repo rate increase necessary. This is because an annualGDP growth rate of 3 to 4% is more than the economy can achieve without generating imbalances.Higher economic growth is, however, feasible for a time if there are unutilised resources in theeconomy. But when tensions arise between total demand and supply, various bottleneck problems areliable to result in price and wage increases that ultimately threaten price stability.
BIS Review 109/20002Perhaps the best illustration of this is to be found in the labour market. The increase in employment inrecent years has exceeded what demographic factors are contributing to labour force growth by around40,000 to 70,000 persons a year. Employment growth is in fact the strongest for several decades.Considering how high unemployment has been, this is welcome. But sooner or later, such adevelopment means that firms will have difficulties in recruiting labour. Then, if not before, wagecosts are liable to accelerate and push prices up. The issue of when this will happen does not have todo with either the actual level of unemployment or the number who were employed when activity lastpeaked in the late 1980s. It depends instead on how serious any bottleneck problems are becoming andhow strong those with jobs consider their bargaining position to be in wage negotiations. Briefly, then,important factors in the assessment of the risks of inflationary tendencies are how well the labourmarket is functioning and how quickly resource utilisation is rising.Monetary policy contributes to stabilityIn an upward cyclical phase, the move towards a situation where the tensions in markets for goods,services and labour threaten to gain the upper hand and jeopardise price stability is a gradual process.That makes it difficult to tell exactly when the imbalances constitute a genuine problem. Observersand those who decide economic policy have to assemble the pieces of this puzzle. In an economy thatis approaching a strained situation in resource utilisation, signs that imbalances are beginning to buildup will appear with increasing intensity and frequency. As more and more pieces of the puzzle fall intoplace, they ultimately provide a basis for action. The whole of this process is complicated by the timelag before monetary measures elicit effects. Our premise is that the full effect of an interest rateadjustment materialises after one to two years. So measures taken today would not have their fulleffect until some time during 2002.Monetary policy therefore involves balancing the risks of acting too soon against those of acting toolate. Acting prematurely is liable to lead to unemployment being higher than it need be. If theRiksbank acts too late, on the other hand, price and wage increases may already have got under way.In that case, the economy may ultimately land in a recession, perhaps with even higher unemployment.Fortunately, it is not a question of either/or. A monetary policy adjustment can be decided gradually,with stepwise changes in the repo rate. Consequently it is always possible to compare forecasts withoutcomes, assess the policy stance continuously and make the adjustments that are considered to benecessary.If monetary policy is successful, a foundation is laid, not only for low, stable inflation in line with thetarget and the Riksbank’s statutory objective, but also for a stable long-term growth of output andemployment. Seen from this angle, low inflation, besides being our objective, is accordingly a meansof trying to achieve a stable economic development in general. That is something which should beunderscored.Inflation prospectsIn an analysis of the situation in the run up to the next Inflation Report, due to be published on 7December, the following can be noted:• The price trend to date is approximately in line with the forecast that was presented in theOctober Report.• As expected, there have been signals that international economic activity is tending tobecome somewhat slacker. The pattern is clearest in the United States but even some slowingof growth in Europe seems likely in the coming years.• In Sweden, too, there are indications that activity has become somewhat calmer. Bothhouseholds and firms have become somewhat less optimistic about the future. Car purchaseshave fallen. Corporate order books are not being replenished quite as rapidly as before. Ingeneral, this is in line with what we foresaw in the October Report. But domestic economic
3BIS Review 109/2000activity still seems to be rising rapidly, even when allowance is made for the signs of aslowdown. That needs to be underscored.• Share prices, as we all know, have been volatile in the past six months but the fall to date isnot a major cause for concern. Private consumption is being sustained in the first place by astrong development of income that stems from higher employment, a good increase in realwages and a fiscal stance that is less restrictive than before. It should be borne in mind thateven including the fall that has occurred, aggregate stock-market wealth has grown verymarkedly in recent years.• The present round of wage negotiations contains some elements of concern. In a sense, witha wage share that amounts to approximately two-thirds of the economy, that is inevitablewhen many settlements are being concluded simultaneously. For the path of the Swedisheconomy in the coming years, no other single factor is therefore anything like as importantas the total wage trend. The picture of the negotiations that are now beginning is mixed andtensions do exist. Since the previous survey in September, all the interviewed groups’expectations of the annual wage rise have been revised upwards for all time horizons. Wageexpectations are highest among the employee organisations. Moreover, the wage demandsthat have been presented are higher than before the previous round of negotiations. It isevidently becoming more difficult to find people with the appropriate competence for thejobs that are advertised. This presumably makes the risk of future wage drift greater than inprevious years. All this could be a sign that we are approaching a situation where, bit by bit,aggregate wage costs in the Swedish economy start to accelerate, albeit from moderatelevels.• When it comes to judging inflationary pressure in the coming years, a central concept is totalresource utilisation. The available amount of unutilised resources is crucial for the domesticgeneration of inflationary pressure, at least as long as inflation expectations are parkedaround our 2% target. In the coming years it is highly probable that, for the first time in along while, our estimates of total resource utilisation - the output gap - will show that the gaphas closed and the economy has reached or even moved above the capacity ceiling. Thisaccordingly holds even if activity does move into a more subdued phase.• The overall picture of inflation is also complicated by the krona having been weak recentlyinstead of appreciating as we assumed in October. Moreover, the price of oil remains high.This may mean that the earlier tendency for import prices to counter what has otherwise beengradually growing domestic inflationary pressure may not apply to the same extent. In thisrespect, then, the outlook is more in line with the risk spectrum we outlined in the OctoberReport than with our main scenario there.The composite assessment of the various risks associated with wage formation, the exchange rate, theprice of oil and the possibility of weaker activity is naturally a matter of judgement. In my opinion,however, inflation prospects in general are now somewhat more troublesome than before. There hasclearly been a gradual increase in resource utilisation. The overall assessment of activity in the comingyears implies that growth will continue to be above the level of 2.0 to 2.5% that the Riksbankconsiders to be sustainable in the longer run. That applies even if there is a slight slowdown ininternational activity. There are also the high price of oil, the weakening of the exchange rate and signsof some disturbing tendencies in wage formation.To some extent, therefore, the situation for monetary policy has changed. That is also why I began bysaying that the time will soon come to raise the repo rate. Not because I have dramatically revised myassessment of inflation prospects but rather because resource utilisation is still rising and a shift can bediscerned in the risk spectrum. We will have to bear these things in mind so that the development ofproduction and employment can remain stable.
1BIS Review 108/2000Sakuya Fujiwara: Recent financial and economic developmentsin Japan and the euro areaKeynote Speech by Mr Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Fourth ParisEUROPLACE Financial Forum, held in Paris on 27 November 2000.*      *      *IntroductionLadies and Gentlemen,It is my great honor to be given this opportunity to speak again at this Paris EUROPLACE FinancialForum. I also understand that this is a forum, where exchange of views among distinguishedparticipants of different experiences is of special importance. Therefore I reserve the right to ask foryour opinions on such interesting topics as recent developments in capital markets and the impact ofinformation technology in the euro area.Now, with respect to my duty today, I have three topics in my mind. First, I will discuss Japan’seconomy and the challenges it faces. Then, I will turn to recent developments in the euro area, asubject which is of particular interest to myself. Here, I dare to introduce my observation on theeconomic structural reform recently underway in the euro area. And last, I will briefly touch onenhanced interrelations between the euro area and Japan.1.Japan’s economy and the challenges it facesCompared with a year ago, when I gave a speech at this forum last year, Japan’s economy has shownnotable improvement. The recent economic recovery is mainly driven by the corporate sector, wherewe witness the increases in production and corporate profits. Against such background, business fixedinvestment has been increasing, especially in the IT and telecommunications fields. Although the paceof recovery remains sluggish in the household sector, positive developments are observed inemployment and income, reflecting the recovery of business activity. In sum, Japan’s economy isrecovering gradually, with business fixed investment continuing to increase.At the same time, however, we cannot ignore the fact that Japan has yet to solve structural problems inthe economy. In this context, Japanese firms and banks continue to suffer from balance sheetproblems, the aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble in the 1990s. And, while the world economy,especially the United States, has registered high growth by exploiting the benefits of new technologysupported by salient entrepreneurship as well as the vibrant capital market, Japan has somewhatlagged behind in its ability to adjust itself to such new environment. With a nascent recovery nowunderway in Japan, constant efforts are necessary to continue to tackle the remaining structuralproblems head on, which in turn should be the prerequisite for sustainable growth.Important progress has already been observed, though, in the financial sector. Bank capital base hasbeen strengthened by the injection of public money. There has also been a progress in reinforcingsafety nets. On top of that, the consolidation of financial institutions, especially large ones, is inprogress, something which Japan has never experienced since the end of the World War II. I sincerelyhope these changes will beef up the profitability and competitiveness of financial institutions, therebyenhancing the efficiency and stability of the financial system as a whole.Meanwhile, ongoing corporate restructuring process may exert downward pressure on the economy inthe short run. But I believe this should facilitate efficient allocation of resources to high-growthindustries, contributing to sustainable growth in the long run.To accelerate such structural change, determined efforts on the part of policy makers are alsoimportant. Such efforts should include deregulation, tax reform and improvement of accounting and
BIS Review 108/20002legal systems. The Bank of Japan, as a central bank, must contribute to ensuring a stablemacroeconomic environment through appropriate monetary policy measures, which will form thebasis for creative and future-oriented corporate activity. In addition to this, the Bank of Japan assumesimportant responsibilities in improving the financial market and payment system infrastructure. Thestart of real-time gross settlement of fund transfers and government bond transfers from the beginningof next year is one of such efforts.2.Dynamism of the euro area economyWhen I think about structural reforms in the Japanese economy, I always think of the experiences ofthe euro area economy on this front.Today, nobody doubts the importance of structural reform, but it is difficult to achieve a social andpolitical consensus as to the most practical approach. Reform is accompanied by pain, and also takes along time to bear fruit. But once the direction is set, reform calls for further reform, thereby generatingautonomous momentum. Developments in the euro area economy have considerable implications andare encouraging to us. I realize it may sound too simplistic but the essence of reform lies in marketintegration.I say this because market integration leads to intensified competition. In the euro area, mergers andacquisitions are a driving force for corporate restructuring and industry reorganization. This increasein M&A, which started from around 1997, was no doubt sparked by the introduction of the euro. Inaddition, firms are being forced to change their management strategy so that they can survive amidglobal competition and keep up with technological innovation. Indeed, firms are increasingly awarethat efficient management and higher profitability are more important today than ever, and suchrecognition is evident in recent M&A examples. These days firms are not expanding their businessfields, but rather streamlining businesses that they have little competitive edge in, and beefing up theones that are strategically important.Market integration in the euro area has also brought about dynamic changes in the economicinfrastructure, including transportation, electric power, telecommunications, and finance. In the area offinance, some examples of positive developments include the creation of new payment systems, suchas TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer), the rapidexpansion of capital markets, and the merger and integration of stock exchanges. In addition, the euroarea has begun to review tax systems and labor practices.Amid the sea change of market integration and the introduction of the euro, deregulation and marketinfrastructure consolidation are being seen. And the private sector is making the most of resources, soto strengthen competitiveness. Thus, market integration accelerates momentum for competition, and inturn stimulates momentum for reform in other areas of the economy and finance. I believe that everyeconomy has the potential for growth. The problem is how to realize such potential. Structural reformseems to be a trigger in this regard.I know that some are skeptical about the euro area economy. Such voices often argue that the weakeconomy is the reason for the weak euro. For example, they say that structural rigidity of the euro areaeconomy, or the difference in productivity between the United States and the euro area, has inducedthe massive outflow of capital to the United States thus causing the euro to weaken.The mechanism behind exchange rates is very complex, and as a central banker, I ought not to makeany careless remarks on this delicate subject. However, I have to say we should not hastily assume thatthe weak euro merely reflects a weak economy. Capital outflows across the Atlantic could be the resultof intensified global competition that has stimulated various types of strategic alliances across theborder.Integration of the European markets and the introduction of a common currency are historically themost remarkable events since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system nearly thirty years ago. Assuch, they can be characterized as part of a project which has the potential to dramatically change the
3BIS Review 108/2000landscape of the world economy. With this in mind, I will continue to keep a close watch on economicdevelopments in the euro area.3. Interrelations between the euro area and JapanLastly, I would like to give my view on interrelationships between the euro area and Japan, focusingon capital flows. As I have mentioned, in the euro area, monetary union has triggered various kinds ofstructural change, bolstering the development of the overall economy. The impact is so large that it hasaffected not only the euro area itself, but also Japan.An example of the effect is direct investment. Direct investment from western Europe to Japan soaredmore than tenfold in a year, from about 100 billion yen in 1998 to over 1 trillion yen in 1999.Investment from France was especially large, which reflects the capital collaboration that was seen inthe automobile industry. Direct investment from Japan to the euro area is also on the rise. The increasein direct investment will promote the reallocation of management resources, technology transfer, andcompetition, resulting in boosting both economies.The increase in capital flows between the two economies is well evidenced in portfolio investment. In1999, Japan’s portfolio investment in the euro area exceeded that in the United States. Japan’s foreignportfolio investment in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, the four euro areacountries for which individual data are available, totaled almost 5.6 trillion yen in 1999. On the otherhand, Japan’s portfolio investment in the United States was 1.4 trillion yen. This is rather noteworthy,because, in international capital markets, the United States, with its huge current account deficit,absorbs a lot of funds provided by the euro area and Japan. Despite such a situation, capital flowsbetween the euro area and Japan are surging, and both economies are growing more interdependent ininternational capital markets.In the increasingly integrated global market, the euro area and Japan are becoming more and moredependent. I hope today’s forum will contribute to bringing the two economies closer, and serve as anopportunity to enhance communication between the private sector of the euro area and that of Japan. Iknow this forum will be a success.
1BIS Review 107/2000Christian Noyer: How to combine a deepeningand widening of the European UnionSpeech by Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Oxford UniversityEuropean Affairs Society, Oxford, 22 November 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to come to this prestigious university and to address themembers of the European Affairs Society tonight. As I was told, your Society is an independent forumfor the discussion of European issues within this university. Independence and a certain level ofdetachment from the everyday political debate, as I know from the experience of the European CentralBank, can indeed provide propitious conditions for true discourse and the free expression of ideas.This is why I appreciate the opportunity I have tonight to address the important topic of how tocombine both the widening and the deepening of the European Union. In so doing, I shall approach thesubject from the specific viewpoint of a central banker and share with you some ideas concerning theparticular role of the euro in the further integration process of a growing European Union. At the sametime, I should like to stress that it is clearly not for central bankers, but rather for politicians andEuropean citizens to make the necessary “hard decisions” in the coming weeks, months and years.The challenges of enlargementEuropean integration was conceived as a project aimed at ensuring peace, stability and prosperity inEurope. It has remained so throughout the five decades of its successful progress. At the beginning- owing to the geopolitical circumstances at the time - this new and innovative concept of achievingreconciliation and stability through economic integration could only be applied to western Europe.Today, ten years after the “return to Europe” of those countries unfortunate enough to be on the otherside of the “Iron Curtain”, we face the challenge of extending the successful model of Europeanintegration to the whole of Europe, so as to truly overcome the division of our continent. Therefore, Iwould regard the forthcoming enlargement of the EU not just as the institutional response to centraland eastern European countries’ application for membership. Rather, it should be seen as therealisation of the Union’s longer-term objective of providing a framework for political stability andeconomic progress. Such a vision is clearly underlined by the EU’s current political agenda, whichtreats enlargement to include 12 applicant countries, mostly from central and eastern Europe, not as aquestion of “whether or not”, but rather as a matter of “when and how”.What will the impact be of the European Union almost doubling in size? It is reasonable to expect thatthe forthcoming enlargement will increase diversity and complexity within the Union to anunprecedented extent.In economic terms, the proper fulfilment of the so-called “Copenhagen criteria”, which require theaccession countries to be functioning market economies and able to adopt the existing Communityrules, should help to avoid severe imbalances within an enlarged Union. In this context, it should alsobe borne in mind that the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of all accession countries- measured in today’s figures - accounts for only 5% of the European Union’s GDP. In addition, theinherent dynamics of the single market and the “convergence pressure” exercised by policymakers andfinancial markets alike are also set to aid a rapid catching-up of the future new Member States. Theevidence of real convergence provided by Ireland, Spain or Portugal after their accession to theEuropean Community gives grounds for confidence in this respect.In political and institutional terms, however, the EU will indeed be facing great challenges. The sheerincrease in numbers will make decision-making more difficult and the legitimate interests of the“newcomers” may diverge significantly from those of the existing members, given the different stages
BIS Review 107/20002of their economic transition and development and their specific historical experiences whichundoubtedly shape their views on Europe.The Member States appear to be committed to addressing these challenges in the context of theongoing Intergovernmental Conference on institutional reforms. Let us hope that the IGC can agree onat least those reforms which are absolutely essential to allow the Union to function even afterenlargement. Even so, it appears almost certain that the forthcoming Nice Treaty will only be amilestone. It will by no means be the end point of the ongoing fundamental institutional debate on thefuture shape of Europe. In this wider debate, many observers have argued that the original objective ofan “ever closer Union” might be somewhat incompatible with the current movement towards an “everwider Union”.Combining the deepening and widening of the European UnionIn addressing this altogether intelligible concern that the greater size and heterogeneity of an enlargedEuropean Union might lead to a standstill in integration or even an unravelling of the degree ofdeepening achieved so far, I would suggest starting with a certain amount of “introspection” aimed atassessing the depth of integration in the EU today.I believe there can be little doubt that the EU has already achieved a high degree of integration, both ineconomic and political terms: a functioning single market has been complemented by the successfulintroduction of a single currency. The framework for the pursuit of a common foreign and securitypolicy is being given real substance, soon to be underpinned by a nascent military capability. Inaddition, the scope of common activities now also extends to highly sensitive fields such as internalsecurity, immigration and asylum.It is on this premise that I should like to put forward the following proposition, which I will try toillustrate in the remainder of my presentation: The depth of integration in the EU today, which isbased not only, but especially, on the establishment of Economic and Monetary Union, in itself will,over time, trigger further integrative steps. These dynamics are at work anyway, and are unlikely tobe derailed by the process of enlargement. Using the metaphor of the “bicycle theory”, which is thenotion that European integration has to progress in order to avoid backtracking on past achievements- just like a bicycle has to keep going to avoid falling over - I would argue that the future EU, ratherthan being diluted, is set to achieve further deepening, even if enlargement increases diversity.Allow me to illustrate.EMU as a catalyst for integrationEconomic and Monetary Union in itself could be regarded as a source of, and catalyst for, deeperintegration in Europe - and the fact that both sides in the euro debate in this country use this argumentmight be seen as underlining its significance. There is plenty of evidence to support this proposition,which can be seen from the preparatory phase of EMU (during the 1990s) or in connection with theactual launch of the euro in 1999. But I believe it is also true from a longer-term perspective.Over the past decade, the very process of preparing for the introduction of the euro has brought about agreater degree of integration. The aim of achieving Economic and Monetary Union by 1999 at thelatest called for the complete liberalisation of capital movements within the European Community,closer coordination of national economic policies, as well as institutionalised cooperation amongmonetary authorities within the European Monetary Institute. An emerging “stability consensus”among policymakers in Europe on the desirability of a stable currency and sound public financesprovided the crucial backing for a, sometimes painful, process of budgetary consolidation anddisinflation, in which domestic policy objectives needed to be brought in line with the need to fulfilthe Maastricht convergence criteria.If the preparatory phase of EMU could be best characterised as generating common policy objectivesand a joint outlook among policymakers - albeit without changes to the existing institutions - the
3BIS Review 107/2000actual introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 certainly marked a quantum leap in institutionalterms. As of that day, a new supranational institution, the ECB assumed responsibility for themanagement of the single currency. Endowed with the necessary competencies to define andimplement the single monetary policy, given a clear objective to maintain price stability and grantedfull independence, the ECB now exercises a core aspect of state sovereignty at the European level.In policy terms, the single monetary policy is by definition indivisible and aims to ensure themaintenance of price stability in the euro area as a whole, meaning that it cannot take into accountspecific national situations. There is only one key interest rate, a single integrated money market todistribute liquidity across the euro area, and - what has been a focal point of media reporting - onlyone euro exchange rate.Sharing a common currency implies the need to take a policy perspective which goes beyond the levelof the national economy, and this also applies to policy fields other than monetary policy. TheStability and Growth Pact, aimed at shoring up the proper functioning of Economic and MonetaryUnion, requires Member States to observe fiscal discipline and to make their national budgetary planssubject to the scrutiny of other Member States. Increasingly, the Member States are also willing totake and give advice and to learn from each other in policy areas which have traditionally been - andwill remain - exclusive national domains, such as labour market reform or the financing of pensionliabilities. In all of these areas, closer cooperation in Europe does not mean the forced acceptance of auniform model, imposed by an ever-more powerful and increasingly remote Brussels bureaucracy.Rather, such exchanges of views help to identify best practices and provide room for the free play ofcompeting concepts and policy designs - which is to the benefit of all involved.Finally, “deeper integration” within the sphere of European economic policymaking could be seen asno more than the long-overdue, political response to market developments towards globalisationwhich, in any case, cannot be avoided. Take, for example, the increasing integration of financialmarkets, driven by the desire of market participants to reap the benefits arising from the introductionof the euro. Closer cooperation among policymakers and regulators, the setting of common rules andthe promotion of consistent practices merely help to provide the necessary framework for the properfunctioning of a single European financial market, with a depth and sophistication similar to that of theUnited States. It is in such an integrated European financial market that resources will be allocatedmost efficiently, to the benefit of all, be they individual savers, institutional investors or corporateborrowers.As I have amply illustrated thus far, the introduction of the euro has undoubtedly marked a significantstep towards the deepening of the European Union. It has also further advanced the emergence of aunified EU economy, which, in turn, has contributed towards developing an external perception of“Europe” as an entity in its own right.Ladies and gentlemen, having “prepared the ground” on the basis of existing evidence, allow me toelaborate now on possibly the most controversial aspect of my aforementioned proposition, namelythat Economic and Monetary Union will, in itself, act as an impetus for further deepening.The internal dynamics of EMU as a source of future deepeningThe euro is in a unique position in that it is “a currency without a state”. Historically, the soundness ofmoney has always been closely associated with the strength and stability of the political structure ofwhich it is an expression. Therefore, it is a legitimate question to ask whether EMU can functionwithout some form of political union.Allow me to approach this question in the following manner. To start off, the concept of politicalunion is not very well defined. I am sure that you, as attentive observers of the euro debate in thiscountry, would agree with me that the term “political union” can mean many things to many people,often depending on political expediency or the desired public relations impact. From a central banker’sperspective, that is, “a forward-looking assessment based on all the information currently available”, Iwould argue that the EU today, with its single currency, already represents a highly advancedinstitutional construction, combining both supranational and intergovernmental elements. With the
BIS Review 107/20004introduction of the euro, Member States’ governments, especially those of the euro area, have startedto jointly assume - together with the European Commission and the ECB - their “shared specificresponsibilities for the single currency” (Luxembourg European Council Conclusions). Will the jointexercise of shared responsibilities for an area as pivotal as macroeconomic policy - even if thisconcerns so far only a sub-group of EU Member States - not inevitably lead to a gradual transfer ofcompetencies to Brussels? Is this what is meant by “political union” - an increasing centralisation ofpolicy decisions? I should think not. Allow me to give you two examples.First, I would not consider it advisable to centralise employment or social policies at the EU level;rather, decisions should be taken at the national, regional, or even local level to allow for the necessaryflexibility to adjust in the context of the specific constraints of the single currency. Second, it isquestionable as to whether a centralised “federal” fiscal policy would be the appropriate means tosupport the ECB’s single monetary policy. Instead of such Brussels-steered policies aimed at“levelling out” national or regional differences within the euro area, the current system appears moreappropriate. Today, national fiscal policies are subject to basic common rules as laid down in theStability and Growth Pact. These rules, although constraining, are in fact a means of preserving acertain margin of manoeuvre in the Member States’ budgetary policies, while at the same timeavoiding undue pressure being exerted on the single monetary policy.As shown by these examples of economic policymaking, I would argue that making the euro a successdoes not necessarily call for the creation of a United States of Europe or some sort of “Europeansuperstate”. In fact, the economic governance of the euro area - although there is certainly scope forimprovements in terms of efficiency, effectiveness as well as legitimacy - could be seen as exhibitingessential features of a multi-levelled European polity. Such a political edifice would be based on arespect for the subsidiarity principle and a clear assignment of policy responsibilities and objectives.At the end of the day, and I should like to make this clear once more, the task of shaping the futureconstitutional evolution of the European Union, and of determining its “finalité politique” is a matterfor the politicians and the citizens of Europe - and not for central bankers. Having said that, the euro iscertainly one parameter in this process. A currency has always been a powerful symbol of identity, andthis will also be true for the euro. Particularly from the beginning of 2002 onwards, when the euro willbe in the pockets of some 300 million European citizens, our common currency is set to become asymbol of a shared identity which brings the reality of Europe into everyday lives.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude my remarks on a cautiously optimistic note. As I haveillustrated, a substantial widening of the EU can indeed be combined with further deepening. Oneessential precondition will be a successful conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference at thesummit meeting in Nice in a few weeks’ time. Once this long and laborious, but altogether necessary,reappraisal of the EU internal functioning is successfully completed and the necessary institutionalreforms are implemented, the Union should be in a position to look forward to the coming rounds ofenlargement with some confidence. Our contribution, as the European Central Bank, to thisunprecedented endeavour is to help make the euro a success. I am confident that a well-functioningsingle currency, as a unifying symbol and truly European point of reference, can and will help toprovide the EU with the integrative “glue” needed to face enlargement and welcome the newmembers, and thus to avoid the danger of diluting the integration progress achieved thus far.
1BIS Review 107/2000Ernst Welteke: Regulating European financial marketsSpeech by Mr Ernst Welteke, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Frankfurt EuropeanBanking Congress, held in Frankfurt, on 17 November 2000.*      *      *ILadies and gentlemen,“What are the essential features of an efficient regulation of the financial markets in Europe?” That isa question which cannot be answered in a single sentence. Nevertheless, it is possible to specifyelements which form an indispensable part of a modern regulatory framework. These include:1. Rules for the markets and the participants - rules which are in line with market conditionsand, at the same time, underpin the stability of the financial system.2. Organisational forms of financial market supervision which should mirror market structures,but not run ahead of them.3. Supervisory practices which - especially in Europe - have to be harmonised even moreclosely in order to improve and safeguard the “level playing field”.4. A sufficient quantity of highly qualified experts in the field of supervision.Globalisation, technological progress and international competition are the trends that are shaping allthe financial markets - and, of course, the stock markets in Europe. The stock markets are engaged infierce competition with each other. Issuers and investors want a liquid market that is efficient, secureand as cost-effective as possible in terms of both trading and settlement. Alliances or even mergers arestrategic options for strengthening competitive positions. These changes are taking place in a settingwhere there is comparatively little harmonisation in the regulatory environment provided by securitiesand stock exchange law. Relatively new competitors have recently been entering the field in the shapeof electronic communication networks (ECNs). These are electronic trading platforms but are notlicensed stock exchanges. In terms of turnover, these ECNs do not play a major role at present but,even so, there arises the problem of competition between licensed and regulated stock exchanges andthe scarcely regulated ECNs. In my view, it is very important for a “level playing field” to be createdin this area.Given this dynamic setting, analysing the present system of securities and stock exchange supervisionin Europe is both prudent and necessary. The group of financial experts under the direction of BaronAlexandre Lamfalussy has presented an interim report which is to be discussed in the near future bythe ECOFIN Council. Without wishing to pre-empt that discussion, a gradual approach appears to meto be a solution that is both prudent and feasible. That is also what is stated in the report by BaronLamfalussy. As a matter of priority, the regulatory gaps should be filled in and the process ofharmonisation in the stock exchange and securities sector should be accelerated. One example is the“European Passport” for issuers. The Forum of the European Securities Commissions (FESCO) willbe presenting a proposal on this shortly.At present, the creation of uniform regulations, combined with an intensification of cross-bordercooperation in committees represents a better course of action than a “Big Bang”. Centralised stockexchange and securities supervision would scarcely be able to function without a European regulatoryframework. Effective stock exchange supervision depends on being particularly close to the markets.National bodies possess such market proximity in a more or less natural way.
BIS Review 107/20002IIThe appropriateness of the present supervisory structures in Europe is being studied by bankingsupervisors, too. The report commissioned by the ECOFIN Council, known as the Henk BrouwerReport, has confirmed that the existing structure of European banking supervision is - without anyreservations - doing its job properly. Even so, the report states that practical cooperation among thoseinvolved in banking supervision still has to be further optimised. Among other things, that findingreflects a development that attracts little attention from the general public: banking supervisors havebeen continuously adapting themselves to the trend towards cross-border activities. They have beenpursuing their own internationalisation strategy. The present system of banking supervision in Europeessentially rests on three pillars:• harmonisation of the regulations;• national regulatory competence; and• bilateral and multilateral cooperation.Bilateral cooperation is based on memoranda of understanding between the supervisory bodies. Addedto this, at the multilateral level there is the Banking Supervision Committee at the ECB. Thiscommittee is filled by senior representatives of the supervisory authorities and central banks of all the15 EU member states and facilitates the exchange of information and cooperation both among thenational supervisors themselves and with the ESCB.One main area of the BSC’s work consists of macro-prudential studies on the stability of the EUbanking systems. This includes, for example, the study on “Asset Price Inflation and BankingStability”, which has also been published. The committee thereby makes a major contribution to crisisprevention. In the converging European financial market, systemic crises are becoming an increasinglyimportant issue. Central banks, in particular, have a special interest in safeguarding the stability of thefinancial system. The prevention of crises has to be the paramount consideration. Nevertheless, wealso have to be prepared for the worst. What has to be done in the event of cross-border crises? Whohas to be informed? Where can we meet? Naturally, responsibility initially rests at the national level. Ibelieve, however, that the BSC, in which central bankers and regulators are already represented, is asuitable platform for multilateral crisis management. Proximity to the ECB is proving to be anadvantage, since the ECB can provide the required infrastructure. Central banks can play a major rolein crisis management - something which is also shown by the example of the New York Fed in thecase of LTCM.Another area of current relevance in the work of the BSC - as well as of other supervisory bodieswithin the EU - is the convergence of supervisory practices. Great progress has been achieved inharmonising banking supervisory law. Even so, there still exist noticeable differences in practice.Furthermore, mention should also be made of the (informal) Groupe de Contact and the BankingAdvisory Committee in Brussels. These bodies that already exist are doing a good job. They could bepacemakers for the ongoing harmonisation of prudential regulations and, above all, of supervisorypractices which still diverge too widely in some cases.A centralised European banking regulatory body is not necessary for that purpose, nor would such abody be able to cope with the requirements of the present financial market structures. Why?• The national supervisors are more intimately acquainted with the economic and legalframework in which their own banking systems operate. Even with a centralised solution,they would have to continue to perform their present duties in order to prevent losses ofefficiency in the regulatory process.• Despite the tendency to convergence, the national banking systems will continue to differfrom each other for the foreseeable future.In other words, the integration of the European banking systems is not yet far enough advanced forpolicymakers to respond with institutional reforms at present. Regulators should follow the marketstructures as they develop. They should not attempt to steer the market structures in a particular
3BIS Review 107/2000direction. Europe is not yet sufficiently integrated politically for it to be possible to ensure theeffectiveness and efficiency of a centralised European supervisory body. It is difficult to imaginecentralised banking supervision in Europe without having first achieved a political union in majorareas such as taxes or legal and fiscal policy. Sovereign interventions on the part of a centralisedauthority involving, say, the closure of a bank or a decision on the use of national taxpayers’ money,for example, are unlikely to meet with much approval. At the moment, it is not possible to tell whetherpolicymakers are prepared to take such comparatively far-reaching steps. As I see it, the objectiveshould not be a “Big Bang” but rather the creation of better coordinated regulations and supervisorypractices.IIII wish to talk now briefly about insurance supervision. In this area, too, the differences in theregulations in Europe are probably still too great for a Europe-wide centralisation of insurancesupervision to appear an appropriate solution. But the debate is even going beyond that - in thedirection of a European “one-stop” financial supervisory authority. Given the problems in theindividual financial sectors that I have just outlined, I do not believe that this would be a suitableorganisational model for Europe in the foreseeable future.  Moreover, “one-stop” financial supervisionis not a familiar regulatory model in Europe. It would therefore probably be difficult to implement.IVTherefore, my conclusion is that it is necessary to close the remaining regulatory gaps, to harmonisethe existing regulations and supervisory practices and to intensify cross-border and cross-sectorcooperation among the supervisors. I believe that new institutions in Europe are not practicable at themoment. The existing bodies should be strengthened instead. Ensuring an appropriate system ofregulation for the European financial system remains an ongoing task. More than ever, this calls for aflexible response from policymakers and regulators.
1BIS Review 106/2000Stephen Grenville: Inflation targeting in the world of volatile capital flowsSpeech by Mr Stephen Grenville, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Bank ofThailand’s International Economic Conference “Practical Experiences on Inflation Targeting”, held inBangkok on 20 October 2000.*      *      *While a number of developed countries adopted inflation targeting in the early part of the 1990s, therewas a commonly held view that it would not be easy to apply this approach to monetary policy inemerging countries. For instance, Paul Masson et al. (1997) set out the prerequisites and buildingblocks of this monetary framework, identifying the main ones as being:• the ability to carry out a substantially independent monetary policy, especially one notconstrained by fiscal considerations; and• freedom from commitment to another nominal anchor such as the exchange rate or wages.They concluded that “these fairly stringent technical and institutional requirements cannot be met bymany developing countries because seigniorage remains an important source of finance and/or becausethere is no consensus that attainment of low inflation should be the overriding objective of monetarypolicy. We thus conclude that the way to improve the monetary and inflation performance ofdeveloping countries may not be through the adoption of a framework akin to inflation targeting, atleast not in the near term”.In the short period since then, there has been a lot more attention and interest in inflation targeting inemerging-market countries. What has caused this change of view? One answer is that the literature hadbeen overly influenced by the poor inflationary record in Latin America in the 1980s, and as the betterrecord in Latin America in the 1990s became clearer, commentators and analysis came to recognisethe benefits of an inflation targeting framework.Perhaps more importantly still (and relevant to this paper because of its emphasis on the externalsector and capital flows), decisions about exchange rate regimes have put inflation targeting more inthe forefront. To the extent that a number of Latin American countries had chosen a fixed exchangerate as the nominal anchor for their monetary policy, in the hope of driving down the rate of inflationand keeping it low by a commitment to a fixed exchange rate, there was no place for inflation targetingin this strategy: this was clearly an alternative strategy to inflation targeting. But over time, thefashionable paradigm on exchange rate regimes has shifted, for several reasons. First, a number ofcountries found the use of the exchange rate as a nominal target presented serious problems during thephase of inflation reduction. Even though this strategy might have been quite effective in gettinginflation down, inflation came down slowly and greatly eroded their international competitiveness.There was, also, the “exit” problem. Secondly, there was much more attention on finding an exchangerate regime which would help with the difficult task of adapting to a world of large and sometimesvolatile capital flows. While some countries responded to this by “hardening” their fixed exchange ratepolicies (even to the extent of adopting currency boards or dollarisation), a number of other countrieshave moved to the opposite end of the exchange regime spectrum, to some variation on floating rates.Thirdly, of course, there were crises in several fixed rate countries (Mexico and Brazil), and theyadopted flexible exchange rates as a result.It is this more widespread adoption of exchange rate regimes at the floating end of the spectrum -which I would like to call “flexible” rather than “floating” (more on this later) - that brought inflationtargeting to centre-stage. Once a fixed exchange rate is abandoned as the nominal anchor of monetarypolicy, the question is what should be put in its place.Going back several decades, the answer might have been to adopt some form of monetary target. Butwe have come to recognise (some of us painfully) that there is a very uncertain relationship between
BIS Review 106/20002the monetary aggregates and the final objectives of macro policy (inflation and output). If there is arelationship, it does not have enough stability and predictability to make it an effective basis formonetary policy.So if this option is not feasible or desirable, and if fixed exchange rates are not the answer (for someother reason), then the third main alternative to unconstrained discretion for monetary policy is someform of inflation targeting. While it might still be possible to have an informal regime with a lot ofdiscretion (it could be argued that the United States is in this category), the “total discretion” regime isone that requires a long history of good performance and quite a bit of confidence on the part of themarkets in the monetary authorities. For most of us, what we need is a regime which provides whathas been called “constrained discretion” - a consistent framework which will help the authorities toresist the various political pressures which are on them (often captured under the rubric of “timeinconsistency”); which the markets will judge to be in some sense “best practice”; but which allowsthe authorities sufficient discretion to handle successfully the exigencies and shocks which inevitablyarise and which have been the downfall of simple mechanical rules. Hence the attraction of inflationtargeting, not only to those developed countries which adopted it in the early 1990s, but to emergingcountries which, having come through the Asian crisis, now accept that a high degree of flexibility ofthe exchange rate is desirable. In this world, we need some kind of framework to help in theincreasingly complex (both economically and politically) task of running good monetary policy which,in the end, will be judged very largely in terms of the inflation performance.What is inflation targeting?Rick Mishkin (2000, p 1) puts the heart of inflation targeting this way: “Inflation targeting is amonetary policy strategy that encompasses five main elements: (1) the public announcement ofmedium-term numerical targets for inflation; (2) an institutional commitment to price stability as theprimary goal of monetary policy, to which other goals are subordinated; (3) an information inclusivestrategy in which many variables, and not just monetary aggregates or the exchange rate, are used fordeciding the setting of policy instruments; (4) increased transparency of the monetary policy strategythrough communication with the public and the markets about the plans, objectives, and decisions ofthe monetary authorities; and (5) increased accountability of the central bank for attaining its inflationobjectives. The list should clarify one crucial point about inflation targeting: it entails much more thana public announcement of numerical targets for inflation for the year ahead”. Note, in particular,point 3.It is important to keep in mind that the inflation target is an alternative (not a complement) to anexchange rate target. Mishkin and Savastano (2000), in examining the Chilean experience, noted thatChile had embraced both an inflation target and an exchange rate target (a moving band), but wasalways prepared to make the exchange rate target subservient to the inflation target to the extent thatthere was any conflict. So the first strong point we want to make is that countries need to settle ontheir exchange rate regime before they decide to adopt inflation targeting, and if they have a strongcommitment to a particular exchange rate target, then it will be very difficult to simultaneously pursuean inflation target. This does not mean that the exchange rate is irrelevant to the inflation targetingregime - far from it. In fact, I will spend a fair bit of my talk today trying to figure out just where theexchange rate does feature within an inflation target. But the basic starting point is that it has to be partof and subservient to the inflation targeting regime.1 So inflation targeting should be seen as part of anoverall approach to macro policy, encompassing fiscal policy and the exchange rate regime.1Mishkin and Savastano (2000, p 7) observe: “What is important to stress, however, is that from the perspective ofmonetary policy a strategy of monetary targeting or inflation targeting does not imply or require “benign neglect” of theexchange rate and no intervention in the foreign exchange market (ie a ‘clean’ float). What matters is that the centralbank makes it clear to the public, through both its actions and pronouncements, that the nominal exchange rate willalways move in the direction set by the market and, crucially, that the exchange rate is not a nominal anchor for monetarypolicy and inflation expectations”.
3BIS Review 106/2000Evolution of the inflation targeting framework, and the role of economic activityAt the same time that changes in views about exchange rate regimes have made inflation targeting arelevant option for a wider range of countries, so too the inflation targeting framework has, itself,become more complex over time, with an increasing recognition that a simple interpretation of aninflation target is misleading, or at least incomplete, as a guide for policy. Whereas early versions ofinflation targeting simply specified a target (usually reasonably rigorously, ie narrowly), and evenwent out of their way to avoid any mention of economic activity (or its related variables, such asunemployment) in the target itself or in inflation reports, over time there has been an increasingrecognition that the target is operationally much more complicated than this, and that for it to besuccessful it must embody a considerable degree of flexibility. Hence, the notion of “constraineddiscretion”. It is a reminder, if you like, that whatever you do in economic policy must be able to passthrough the filter of common sense. You must always keep your eyes open and wits alert, taking in allthe signals which the economy is giving.2In broad-brush terms, the change which has come about in the specification of inflation targetingregimes comes from the recognition that if the inflation target is specified narrowly and the timehorizon over which it must be achieved is tight, then the effort to keep the actual inflation rateconstantly within a narrow band will involve quite a bit of short-term variation of the interest ratelever (and, consequentially, the exchange rate), and policy will be jerking output around disruptively,probably unnecessarily. Central banks may regard their sole objective as inflation, but it seems prettyclear that the community’s wishes (their objective function) have output in there as well. Any centralbank which achieves its inflation objective but damages output in a way unacceptable to thecommunity will not keep its mandate for long. It is the recognition of this point which has produced avoluminous discussion and academic literature, which basically asks the question: what is the righttrade-off between rigid adherence, moment by moment, to the inflation target (on the one hand) and asteady path of output (on the other).So the issue here is the specification of the target: if it is too “tight”, output will be unnecessarilyvolatile. If too loose, policy will lack credibility and the inflation objective will not be achieved. Thereare obviously difficult issues here, which differ from country to country and, even within a particularcountry, probably change as the inflation targeting framework gets more acceptance. When aninflation target is first put in place, it probably needs to be more rigid in order to gain acceptability andcredibility, but as credibility is established, there is more opportunity to let go a bit of slack oninflation variability over time, in order to smooth other variables such as interest rates, exchange ratesand output. All these issues will be covered by other speakers, so I should focus on the one whichstems directly from issues of capital flow - ie the exchange rate - and ask if, and how, the inflationtargeting regime should be modified to adapt it to the fact that the economy is open, and this openness(providing shocks both on the trade and capital account) is transmitted via exchange rate changes.How should this be incorporated into the inflation framework?Capital flowsFirst of all, just a reminder of how big, volatile and potentially damaging capital flows can be for thecountries of this region. The most graphic measure of how big they are is to remind you that in 1996Thailand received capital inflows equal to 13 per cent of its GDP - an inflow which no country couldhave absorbed easily. To see how volatile these flows are, we again need to look no further than therecent experience, where inflows of US$90 billion per year turned into outflows of US$50 billion peryear.To add to these historical observations of size and volatility, let me assert that flows of this kind willreturn, and will be the norm rather than the exception. What makes me confident in asserting this is the2As policymakers we should be pleased by this view, because the alternative - that it is a mechanical process which can becaptured by a relatively simple one-line rule - would mean that there is no serious job for us to do.
BIS Review 106/20004existence of huge portfolios in the developed countries, in the form of actively-managed funds seekingthe highest return in a globalised world. The managers will inevitably shift part of their portfolios tothe countries of this region, if only because their actual degree of diversification is well below thetheoretical norm: these portfolios do not yet have enough weight of emerging market assets. On top ofthis (again a subjective assertion), the countries of this region will have above-average profitopportunities over the next decades as they move towards the technological frontier. Diversificationand profit prospects will drive developed countries’ portfolio managers to shift funds into this region.The question of scale is not simply that the supply of these funds comes from portfolios which arehuge: the point that Paul Volcker has emphasised again and again is one of relative size, in that therecipient financial institutions and even the entire countries are quite small compared with the size ofthe portfolios which have already been built up in America and Europe - and these portfolios seemlikely to continue to grow strongly, as private individuals increasingly respond to concerns about theirretirement incomes. One more subjective assessment: these flows are likely to be volatile; this viewcomes from the persistent evidence that financial markets overshoot and behind this overshooting isherding and contagion - “fear, greed and ignorance” are still important motivations of capital flow, andare likely to remain so. So the starting point, the environment in which we will have to work, is one oflarge and volatile capital flows.Exchange rate regimesThis takes us directly to questions of exchange rate regime. While there will be legitimate and indeedpowerful cases where individual countries might want to adopt a fixed rate (Hong Kong is the classicexample), these are special cases driven by the specifics of their environment. The much morecommon case will encourage countries to move towards the flexible end of the exchange rate regimespectrum, and this immediately raises the issue: with the exchange rate floating or flexible, what willbe the nominal anchor for monetary policy?The extra element which we should discuss here is that it cannot realistically be expected that flexibleexchange rates will be stable. Even between the Big Three, where there are deep financial institutions,and well-developed ideas on the behaviour of the exchange rate which should guide markets andanchor their exchange rate expectations, it is now abundantly clear that the exchange rate can movesubstantially, not driven by the fundamentals. One only has to quote the yen at 80 per US dollar inApril 1995, followed by 147 in mid 1998 to see the problem. We are, in all probability, observingsome similar phenomenon in relation to the US dollar and the euro. If such large fluctuations canoccur in deep, well-developed markets with long history of flexible rates and clear ideas on how theprice discovery process works (ie a well-defined “model”), then how much more difficult for emergingcountries with no long histories of exchange rate behaviour, relatively undeveloped financialinstitutions, and very few players (either at home or abroad) who are prepared to “take a position” onthe exchange rate, which - in the textbook story - is the anchor holding the exchange rate reasonablystable.So this takes us to what I believe is the central issue in this topic - given that large and volatile capitalflows will produce quite large swings in exchange rates, how should this be incorporated into aninflation targeting framework?Exchange rates and the inflation targetThis has been the subject of considerable academic research in recent years (see Ball (2000), Bharuchaand Kent (1998), Ryan and Thompson (2000) and Svensson (1998)). I will not attempt to add to this,but merely to give an intuitive, heuristic interpretation of the issues.Perhaps the easiest way to think about this is in terms of a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate. Tothe extent that this pushes up inflation (via “cost push” channels, and also via the stimulus to activitywhich a depreciation provides), how should an inflation targeting regime respond? Of course thedepreciation cannot be an excuse for allowing inflation to rise to a permanently higher rate. So, to theextent that the central bank’s objective is stated simply in terms of an inflation target, this clearly stillhas to be met. The issue is: “over what time horizon”? Knowing that any change in interest rates will
5BIS Review 106/2000have an effect on activity (after all, this is one of the principal channels of monetary policytransmission), how much “damage” should be done to activity to offset not only the extra stimulus toactivity from the depreciation, but the cost push effects as the effects of the depreciation feed throughto prices?If the authorities had perfect foresight and were sure that the depreciation was temporary and short-lived, then they might well want to do nothing - whatever upward pressures there are on prices will beunwound in due course, and provided price expectations are not dislodged during this process, then nogreat harm is done by any temporary increase in inflation.3 But on the other hand, if the depreciation ispermanent, even if the pressure on inflation via the cost push channel is a one-shot boost, thedepreciation gives an ongoing stimulus to activity which needs to be offset.We are already getting, from this example, a hint of the central issue - that is, that policymakers needmore information than is available from a mechanical interpretation of (or rigid adherence to) a simpleinflation target, if they are to distinguish between these cases and get the right answer, which willdiffer depending on the circumstances. Most specifications for an inflation target do not includesomething which begins: “it depends …”. But in an uncertain world, this is the right starting point.It is intuitively tempting to suggest that the inflation target should be rejigged so as to focus ondomestic prices (either non-traded goods or, the more deeply-embedded version, wages). The intuitionhere is that, if the exchange rate depreciation is indeed temporary and not very long-lived, then it isgood policy to ignore it, allowing the temporary rise in inflation. While this gets the right answer inthe case of a temporary and reversed change in the exchange rate, it does not seem to get the rightanswer if the exchange rate change is long-lived or structural. It is true that the direct cost push effectof the depreciation on inflation may well be once-off and therefore will pass out of the system(hopefully without disturbing price expectations). But the depreciation leaves a permanent boost toactivity which remains there unless or until inflation wipes out the effect of the nominal depreciation.4When we are in the world of “it depends …”, then we need to relate the policy advice much morespecifically to the particular economy in question. At the Reserve Bank of Australia, we have donesome work asking the question whether focusing on non-traded prices in the face of a variety ofshocks would tend to give better answers, and the short answer is “no”. “Non-traded inflation (and unitlabour cost growth) rules appear to generate at least as much variability in output and aggregateinflation - it is aggregate inflation that we care about - without any significant reduction in interest ratevariability” (Ryan and Thompson 2000).These same issues were examined by Larry Ball (2000). He is attracted to the idea that “optimal rulesin open economies differ considerably from optimal rules in closed economies. In open economies,stability is best achieved by targeting “long-run inflation” - a measure of inflation adjusted to removetransitory effects of exchange rate movements”. But this is just another way of stating the intuitionwith which this section opened - that in the face of temporary exchange rate shocks, the authoritiesshould not react but in the face of a permanent or structural change in the exchange rate, they should.The trick is knowing, as the exchange rate moves, whether it is temporary or structural. In practice, itwould seem sensible to assume that at least some of the movement is structural, or at least will lastlong enough to either damage price expectations, or affect economic activity (too much expansion, inthe case of a depreciation). So I am not sure that the Ball rule has advanced us much past the intuition.3The damage done by short-term exchange rate movements may change over time, and be regime-dependent: “It is alsoimportant for central banks to recognise that, as is the case for most economic relationships, the passthrough fromexchange rate changes to prices is likely to be regime-dependent. After a sustained period of low inflation with effective,as opposed to fictional, exchange rate flexibility, the informational content of the exchange rate in the expectations-formation process and price-setting practices of households and firms is likely to fall. Thus, the widespread view that acurrently high passthrough from exchange rate changes to prices is a barrier to successful inflation targeting is probablyexaggerated” (Mishkin and Savastano 2000, pp 56-57).4After all, in this world, there is no point in wiping out the real effect of the exchange rate change, because we areassuming that this is reflecting some long-term fundamentals, to which the economy should be adapting.
BIS Review 106/20006But perhaps this is the important point to make - we still need to use intuition, and common sense, inimplementing inflation targets.5Ball also raises another controversial but important issue in trying to incorporate the exchange rateinto an inflation targeting rule. He makes the case that the authorities should use as their operatingrule (ie their policy reaction function) a monetary conditions index, rather than an interest rate. It isinteresting that an academic should come to examine this issue at this stage, because it has been anissue tried in practice by at least two countries - Canada and New Zealand - and both have abandonedor de-emphasised the use of an MCI. In Australia, it was urged on us (by the OECD). Ball examinesthis issue with great finesse and subtlety, but let me try to set out the issues intuitively. It is true thatwhen an exchange rate goes down, this will be expansionary on an economy and if nothing else hashappened, then interest rates will need to be higher. So if the right weightings can be found betweeninterest rates and the exchange rate, it might be possible to produce an index which reflects, in somesense, the stance of monetary policy. In practice, however, things do not remain the same. Inparticular, there is often a good reason why the exchange rate is moving down, and in the case ofAustralia in particular, it is often because commodity prices have moved unfavourably. In this worldof lower commodity prices, we need a more expansionary stance of monetary policy, and the fall inthe exchange rate provides this more or less automatically. It would not be appropriate or good policyto offset this by raising interest rates. Once again, I am afraid, good policymaking starts off with theproviso: “it depends …”.So far I have talked about the sorts of problems we have faced in countries like Australia and NewZealand. My intuition is that the countries of this region will face a different problem if they use thecombination of a floating exchange rate and inflation targeting as a guide to the “constraineddiscretion” of policymaking. The problem is a familiar one, faced during the first half of the 1990s.That is, that there are very large and increasing capital inflows, which put continuing upward pressureon the exchange rate. Following the reasoning I have outlined so far, the proper response to this is toallow the exchange rate to appreciate. To the extent that this is a long-term or structural change, theinflation targeting framework would allow the appreciation to be reflected in inflation, to the extentthat it meant that non-traded (domestic) prices would rise faster than the target. On most counts, this iso.k. - it is proper that the relative price between tradeables and non-tradeables changes (in order toencourage the current account deficit that is the counterpart of the financial capital inflows). But it is alegitimate question to ask whether, having set an inflation target on the basis that this rate of inflationis not disruptive, to accept that some of the most central and basic prices (principally wages) will risefaster than this - see footnote 4. There is, of course, also the very substantial danger that a rise in non-tradeable prices faster than the target inflation rate will trigger an asset boom, particularly in theclassic non-traded asset of real estate property. There is also the issue that, compared with the situationbefore the capital inflow and appreciation of the exchange rate, interest rates will have to fall: weknow that the extra capital inflows are putting pressure on domestic asset prices, and it might well beasked whether this is an appropriate time to be easing domestic interest rates - which seems to be theimplication of a simple reading of an inflation targeting regime.I hope I have said enough about this case (which I believe will be relevant to many of you beforelong), to alert you to the policy difficulties which are faced in this environment. I hope I have not leftyou with the impression that I know what the right answer is in this case. I would return to what I5There may be another, subtly different, reason for focusing on domestic prices, separate from the point that movement inexchange-rate-driven tradeable prices may be temporary. From the point of view of the smooth running of the domesticeconomy, some notion of domestic prices (either non-traded goods or wages) may be in itself the proper target forinflation. This depends to some extent on economics, but to some extent on the community’s “objective function”. It maybe possible to argue that an economy will work best if wages (or domestic prices) are growing at a particular constantrate, and this is properly the main focus of stability. But if this argument were made, it would be important to keep inmind that the change in relative prices between tradeable and non-tradeable goods is an important signal for investmentand resource allocation, and it would not be sensible to have this relative price moving about too much: it is not onlydomestic prices that matter for price signals to the domestic economy. And, in any case, consumers care about the cost ofliving (ie aggregate prices).
7BIS Review 106/2000regard as the bedrock or base of good economic policymaking - the application of common sense. Incircumstances where countries are receiving large capital inflows which are difficult to absorb, thefirst question might be whether something could be done to slow down these capital inflows withoutdistorting the economy too badly, in order to help the transition process. The sorts of things whichmight be done here are very intrusive prudential supervision and various rules (or at least monitoring)on all those who borrow overseas, if only to try to put some “sand in the wheels”. Chilean-style capitalinflow controls might also be a possibility. Direct foreign investment may be easier to absorb (thegoods inflow comes as part-and-parcel of the capital inflow, so the transfer takes place with lessupward pressure on the exchange rate). Having done whatever is feasible and sensible to try to rein inthe capital flows (and hopefully make them less volatile by slowing down the herd), what should bedone then? There is little doubt in my mind that the exchange rate should appreciate. This is part of thenecessary process of bringing about the real transfer of resources (a current account deficit) which isthe counterpart of the financial flows. But, to the extent that the exchange rate may well overshoot inthis process, intervention is a legitimate policy option. We all know the constraints and difficultieswith this. In particular, it is fiscally very expensive. But it can be a useful instrument in the toolbox,for moderate, occasional and discrete use. The extra element which can, it seems to me, belegitimately applied in these circumstances is to be vigilant in the face of asset price rises, and to usewhatever instrument (within reason) can be used to prevent such bubbles from occurring - prudentialrules, taxation, and even the classic fall-back, bureaucratic red tape.Of course, there is some hope that the rising exchange rate might discourage the capital inflows (thetextbooks say that it should), although I have little faith that this mechanism will work at all smoothly,and there is too much evidence of herd and euphoria behaviour to give me any confidence thatflexibility in the exchange rate will be an effective break on the sorts of capital inflows which you maywell see within a few years.ConclusionIn conclusion, I would argue just one simple line - the inflation targeting regime has been enormouslyuseful to us in Australia, and used as a form of “constrained discretion” it may well be an importantpart of a good regime in other Asian countries which do not have a strong commitment to a fixedexchange rate. The inflation target provides an organisational framework for the debate on the impactof capital flows and the exchange rate. But good policy does not come from simple one-dimensionalrules - it comes from strong institutions, a rigorous policy debate, and a dominant priority given to thatrarest element in policymaking - common sense.ReferencesBall, Laurence (2000), “Policy Rules and External Shocks”, NBER Working Paper 7910.Bharucha, Nargis and Christopher Kent (1998), “Inflation Targeting in a Small Open Economy”,Reserve Bank of Australia Research Discussion Paper No 9807.

1BIS Review 105/2000Svein Gjedrem: Norwegian monetary policySpeech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, held in Copenhagen on17 November 2000.*      *      *IntroductionI am happy to have this opportunity to speak to you here in Copenhagen about trends in the Norwegianeconomy and about Norwegian monetary policy.Norway’s choice of monetary policy regime is closely linked to the structure of the Norwegianeconomy. Norway is a welfare society with a large public sector, a high level of transfers tohouseholds and enterprises and high direct and indirect taxes. Our economy is also characterised bythe great significance of petroleum activities. We have a growing aquaculture industry, and ourmanufacturing is also partly resource-based. The engineering industry - which is substantial - is partlybased on petroleum activities. The exposed sector of the mainland economy has been fragile andvulnerable. A key concern in economic policy since the 1970s has been to avoid undermining theexposed sector too much, in view of our desire to avoid becoming too dependent on petroleumrevenues. In this address I will discuss the relationship between the special structure of the Norwegianeconomy and Norwegian monetary policy. I will attempt to shed some light on certain differencesbetween the Norwegian and Danish economies, and how these differences have influenced theformulation of monetary policy.BackgroundOil production started in the early 1970s and has gradually increased. Forecasts show that productionwill peak in 2002, and thereafter decrease gradually. Gas production is expected to continue toincrease in the years ahead, and will account for a growing proportion of total petroleum production.The long-term forecasts for oil and gas extraction are highly uncertain, and future price movements foroil, market opportunities for gas and production and extraction costs in the petroleum sector areshrouded in uncertainty.
BIS Review 105/20002The revenues from the petroleum sector are of great significance to the Norwegian economy as awhole, and to the public sector in particular. In the 1990s, the export value of oil accounted forroughly one third of total exports excluding ships and oil rigs.Government revenues from petroleum activities are currently extremely high, due to high oil pricescoupled with high production volumes. Current projections indicate that petroleum revenues will peakin 2002, and thereafter decline in pace with the production volume and lower oil prices.
3BIS Review 105/2000Government revenues from petroleum activities have contributed to substantial government budgetsurpluses in recent years. As can be seen from the chart, considerable surpluses are also expected inthe next few years. The amount of petroleum revenues used to finance public expenditure varies fromone year to the next. A large portion of the revenues is saved, and is invested in foreign equities andbonds through the Government Petroleum Fund.Long-term fiscal policy challenges - the role of the Government Petroleum FundNevertheless, the Norwegian economy is facing considerable challenges as a result of an ageingpopulation and a marked rise in pension expenses and in the cost of nursing and care services.The number of old-age and disability pensioners is estimated to rise by 50% by 2030, and centralgovernment expenditure on old-age and disability pensions is expected to increase from approximately7% of GDP in 2000 to 15% in 30 years’ time.
BIS Review 105/20004In order to meet these long-term fiscal policy challenges, it is appropriate for resources to be put asidein times of high petroleum revenues. The larger the Petroleum Fund, the less dependent we will be onpetroleum revenues in the future.The Norwegian Ministry of Finance assesses the long-term outlook for public expenditure usinggenerational accounts.1 Such accounts can be used to assess whether the tax burden will need to beincreased in the future to meet the government’s long-term social security obligations and to maintainpublic services and amenities.The calculations presented by the Ministry of Finance2 indicate that the generational accounts aremore or less balanced. The ministry emphasises the uncertainty shrouding this type of long-termassessment of fiscal policy.Fluctuations in the oil price and petroleum earnings also create challenges for economy policy in theshort and medium term.Let us suppose that the oil price temporarily increased by USD 1 per barrel. This is a small change,well within normal variations from one year to the next. Government revenues - and thus the budgetsurplus - would increase by almost 1% of Norway’s annual GDP. If the increase in petroleumrevenues is used in Norway, it corresponds to almost half of the annual growth in the non-oil economyin a normal year. If the private sector of the economy is also expanding, and the economy is alreadyclose to capacity, this policy would swiftly lead to strong pressures on the resources in the economy.This would result in a rise in wages and prices, and would also lead to unstable conditions in theforeign exchange market.The Government Petroleum Fund shall serve as a buffer against short-term fluctuations in oilrevenues. As large portions of the revenues from oil activities accrue to the state, fluctuations in oilprices and oil revenues will primarily result in changes in allocations to the Petroleum Fund. Since allof the capital in the Petroleum Fund is invested abroad, such changes will in principle not influence1See Auerbach et al (1993).2See Report to the Storting No 1 (2000-01), the National Budget for 2001.
5BIS Review 105/2000the level of activity in the economy. This makes the Norwegian economy more robust to fluctuationsin oil prices and thus less dependent on oil, even in the short run.Some of the petroleum revenues are therefore used to finance central government budget expenditure.The portion used by oil companies in Norway, partly to finance investment, also has an effect on themainland economy.We can say that oil revenues enter the Norwegian economy through an external and an internalcircular flow. The distinction between the external and internal circular flow is important for exchangerate stability. This means, among other things, that short-term changes in oil prices shall not influencethe orientation of economic policy. If the distinction between the two circular flows were to breakdown, and the use of oil revenues were to fluctuate more in step with oil prices, we would have anunstable economy, and hence an unstable exchange rate.The Government Petroleum Fund thus has two objectives. It serves as a buffer for the mainlandeconomy against fluctuations in oil revenues, and it manages a considerable portion of thegovernment’s financial wealth.In addition to capital outflow from the Petroleum Fund, in recent years there have also beenconsiderable capital outflows from various non-oil sectors. As in other Nordic countries, large assetmanagers such as life insurance companies and securities funds accumulated substantial holdings offoreign equities and bonds in the latter half of the 1990s. These portfolio investments abroad reflect adesire to diversify risk. The substantial net outflow of long-term capital from the private sector maypartly reflect a thin Norwegian capital market. The Norwegian bond market is not very developed andthe total value of equities in the Norwegian market in relation to GDP is very low.Norwegian monetary policyIn the long term, a country’s exchange rate tends to move in line with developments in domestic priceand cost inflation compared with other countries. If the level of prices in one country rises at a fasterpace, that country’s currency will tend to depreciate to the same extent over time. Empirical evidencefor these effects has been found for a number of countries, although the effects are relatively weak in
BIS Review 105/20006the short term. However, substantial medium-term convergence in purchasing power parity has alsobeen found between Norway and its trading partners.3 This means that higher inflation in Norway thanin our trading partners has been followed by depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. This isreflected in the fact that the real krone exchange rate has been relatively stable over time.Movements in the krone exchange rate against the German mark over the past 30 years may serve toillustrate this. In the 1970s and 1980s interest rates were kept low, and they were politicallydetermined. Price and cost inflation was generally higher than that of Norway’s trading partners.Frequent devaluations were used to redress the negative effects of high price and wage inflation on3 See Akram (2000).
7BIS Review 105/2000competitiveness. The average rate of increase in prices between 1973 and 1987 was almost 10% -twice as high as the level in Germany. The value of the Norwegian krone against the Deutsche markwas nearly halved between 1973 and 1987. We paid about 2 kroner for 1 mark in 1973 and close to4 kroner in 1987. Since 1987, the krone exchange rate against the Deutsche mark has remained moreor less unchanged. During this period, price inflation in Norway has been no higher than that inGermany.We cannot be sure how fast the inflation differential between Norway and other countries willtranslate into changes in nominal exchange rates in the future. Nevertheless, we must expect that anydifferences in the rate of inflation may be a key cause of changes in the nominal krone exchange rateover time.The Norwegian monetary authorities abandoned the devaluation approach in 1986. From 1986 to 1992Norway had a fixed exchange rate with a defined central rate and fluctuation margins. This system wasabandoned in 1992 following extensive speculation against the krone in connection with theturbulence in European exchange markets. After the krone was allowed to float on 10 December 1992,the guidelines for monetary policy were also revised. Monetary policy was still oriented towards theobjective of krone exchange rate stability, but no specific central rate with fluctuation margins wasstipulated.The krone depreciated slightly in 1992, but thereafter it remained relatively stable. Looking back atdevelopments in the Norwegian foreign exchange market in the 1990s, no significant change reallyappears to have occurred in 1992.However, there was a marked shift in January 1997. From that time, daily and monthly variations inthe krone exchange rate show that the krone is floating. Our analyses suggest that oil price fluctuationsare just one of several contributory factors behind the variation in the krone exchange rate in recentyears.4 In the short term the krone exchange rate is also affected by uncertainty in the global economyand turbulence in international financial markets.The Exchange Rate Regulation - which is the mandate assigned to Norges Bank by the politicalauthorities - states that monetary policy shall be aimed at maintaining a stable krone exchange rate4 See Bernhardsen and Røisland (2000).
BIS Review 105/20008against European currencies. Since 1 January 1999, Norges Bank has defined European currencies asthe euro.The Exchange Rate Regulation takes into account that the krone exchange rate may remain outside itsnormal range. In the event of significant changes in the exchange rate, Norges Bank shall orientinstruments with a view to returning the exchange rate over time to its initial range. The concept“significant changes” is not quantified. The term must be given an economic content. Norges Bankconsiders an exchange rate change to be significant if it influences expectations concerning price andcost inflation to the extent that the change in the exchange rate may become self-reinforcing.In its conduct of monetary policy, Norges Bank places emphasis on satisfying the fundamentalpreconditions for exchange rate stability against the euro: instruments must be oriented with a view toreducing price and cost inflation to the level aimed at by the European Central Bank (ECB). At the
9BIS Review 105/2000same time, monetary policy must not in itself contribute to deflationary recessions, as this couldundermine confidence in the krone.According to the Maastricht Treaty, the main objective of the ECB is the maintenance of pricestability. The ECB has defined price stability as inflation of less than 2%.Inflation in Norway cannot remain higher than inflation in the euro area year after year without thishaving consequences for the exchange rate of the Norwegian krone against the euro. If price and costinflation remains higher than the rate of increase aimed at by the ECB over a long period, ourexperience indicates that the krone will depreciate against the euro sooner or later. Norges Bank musttherefore counter such a development.There are institutional differences between the Norwegian monetary policy regime and monetarypolicy in countries with an inflation target.Norges Bank will inform the government authorities (via the Ministry of Finance) if measures otherthan those available to the central bank are required in the event that the krone exchange rate cannot bereturned to its initial range without creating inflation or a deflationary recession. For instance, in theUK the Bank of England reports to the Treasury if inflation deviates by more than 1 percentage pointfrom the inflation target of 2½%. Other inflation targeting countries have chosen various otherreporting arrangements.The Norwegian system allows economic policy as a whole to focus more strongly on movements inexchange rates. The reason for this is the considerable emphasis placed on the consideration of healthygrowth in the exposed sector. This in turn reflects the risk of the Norwegian economy becoming toodependent on oil. In the medium term, growth in the exposed sector is affected to a large degree by theproportion of petroleum revenues included in the Norwegian economy via the government budget.With large and to some extent varying budget revenues, the basis for determining central governmentexpenditure and taxes from one year to the next may easily be impaired. If budget expenditure isallowed to fluctuate in step with oil prices, the result may be abrupt shifts and instability in theNorwegian economy. Changes in oil prices may then quickly influence wage and price expectations,the exchange rate and long-term rates. In that case it will be very demanding to achieve nominalstability. Short-term interest rates will have to be adjusted frequently and sharply and will generallyreflect a high risk premium for the Norwegian krone. It is therefore important that the annual budgetsare anchored in a long-term strategy that takes into account that oil revenues can fluctuate from oneyear to the next. It is an advantage if fiscal policy can also be used to counter fluctuations in demand
BIS Review 105/200010and production. In this way fiscal policy can contribute to ensuring stable operating parameters for theexposed sector. When fiscal policy is given responsibility for stabilisation policy, the government andthe Storting have a firmer basis for their annual budget decisions. The political authorities also placeemphasis on the fact that by using the fiscal budget to stabilise economic growth, they are able todampen fluctuations in short-term interest rates. This is important because, for instance, dwellings areto a large extent financed through short-rate loans, and many Norwegians have owner-occupieddwellings.It is the political authorities, ie the government and the Storting, which formulate the guidelines formonetary policy in Norway. The Norges Bank Act also states that the King makes decisions regardingthe exchange rate arrangement for the krone. The Exchange Rate Regulation is based on thisprovision. The actual conduct of monetary policy is the responsibility of Norges Bank. The Bank hasexplained its interpretation of the Exchange Rate Regulation, and the Bank’s Executive Board makesdecisions concerning the use of monetary policy instruments.Executive and advisory authority is invested in Norges Bank’s Executive Board, which consist of theCentral Bank Governor, the Deputy Central Bank Governor, and five external members appointed bythe government. As in Australia, it is thus a body consisting partly of external members which makesdecisions on interest rates. As in Australia and Canada, by law the political authorities have the rightto issue instructions to the central bank in matters of special importance. However, this right has neverbeen exercised.The Norges Bank Act requires Norges Bank to inform the ministry when, in the opinion of the Bank,there is a need for measures to be taken by others than the Bank in the field of monetary, credit orforeign exchange policy.For example, in a scenario with a sharp and prolonged fall in oil prices, the krone exchange rate mayremain outside the initial range for an extended period. If Norges Bank responds by raising interestrates in order to force the krone back to its initial range, monetary policy could trigger a recession of atype that will undermine confidence in the krone. Similarly, after an appreciation a situation may arisein which interest rates must be set at such a low level to return the krone exchange rate to the initialrange that this results in higher inflation. The basis for exchange rate stability is weakened in bothcases. Hence, Norges Bank cannot with open eyes orient policy instruments in such a way that theyfuel inflation or lead to a deflationary recession.If a situation arises where Norges Bank is not able to return the krone to its initial range without suchconsequences, as already mentioned, the Bank will inform the government authorities that measures
11BIS Review 105/2000other than those available to the Bank are required. This may involve recommendations concerningfiscal measures that make it possible to return the krone exchange rate to its initial range and tostabilise it. In the event of pronounced and prolonged shifts in the economy, fiscal policy and wagedetermination must contribute to restoring balance in the economy. However, if fundamental andpermanent changes have taken place in the framework conditions for the Norwegian economy, it mayalso be appropriate to consider a revision of the guidelines for monetary policy.Monetary policy instrumentsIn theory, Norges Bank conducts its monetary policy through two main instruments: the interest rateand exchange market interventions. However, in Norges Bank’s experience, extensive and sustainedinterventions to influence exchange rates have yielded poor results. Interventions can often lead togame situations in which market operators regard the central bank’s attempts to influence theexchange rate as an interesting opportunity to make a profit. Events in autumn 1992, at the start of1997 and in autumn 1998 show that exchange market interventions cannot stem the pressure on thekrone. This is why Norges Bank’s primary instrument of monetary policy is the interest rate.The interest rate is a powerful instrument for influencing cyclical trends, and thus inflation, inNorway. Long-term fixed-rate financing is far less common in Norway than in Denmark, for instancefor financing dwellings. As a result, interest rate changes have a greater impact in the relatively shortterm. However, the strong impact of the interest rate also places constraints on its use to underpin theexchange rate.The situation in Denmark, with its well-developed bond market, is somewhat different, since here theshort-term interest rate has rather less pronounced effects on the real economy and prices, and cantherefore be used to a greater extent to underpin the exchange rate. Consequently, a monetary policystrategy in which interventions are used to influence the exchange rate will have greater credibility,and the risk of ending up in game situations with the market is smaller than in Norway.Norges Bank does not intend to act in a way that will prompt game situations. The bank maynevertheless use interventions to a limited degree if the exchange rate moves significantly out of linewith what we consider to be reasonable on the basis of fundamentals or in the event of exceptionalshort-term volatility in thin markets. In such circumstances, there is less risk of ending up in a gamesituation against exchange market operators.We have also experienced game situations in which one or more major operators were behind thekrone exchange rate fluctuations at the same time as they took speculative positions in the bondmarket in the expectation that Norges Bank would raise its key interest rate to defend the krone. If wefocus too narrowly on the exchange rate when setting the interest rate, we are liable to end up in agame situation. Speculators have little to gain from such game situations if Norges Bank adopts agradualist approach and avoids abrupt changes in interest rates.In practice, the interest rate is therefore the only monetary policy instrument available in Norwegianmonetary policy. The interest rate can influence the exchange rate directly through the differentialbetween domestic and foreign interest rates, and indirectly through inflation expectations.Higher interest rates normally make it more attractive to hold NOK-denominated assets. An increasein the interest rate will result in an appreciation of the krone, and a lower interest rate will weaken thekrone. However, this relationship presupposes that the market is confident that monetary policyprovides the economy with a nominal anchor. In some situations, interest rate changes may have theopposite effect. A higher interest rate can weaken the krone if it contributes to a deflationary recession,and a lower interest rate can strengthen the krone if it contributes to preventing a deflationaryrecession. The interest rate only has a predictable effect on the krone exchange rate when it affectsprice inflation in the right direction.The interest rate functions in different ways in our two economies. There are also other dissimilaritiesbetween the functioning of our respective economies and between our institutional frameworks whichmay shed some light on the differences between our monetary policy regimes:
BIS Review 105/200012• Denmark has a long history of a fixed exchange rate which inspires credibility;• Denmark’s membership of ERM II provides exchange rate policy with an institutionalanchor;• Denmark has more stable terms of trade than Norway.Moreover, there is strong and well-deserved confidence in the ability of fiscal policy to stabiliseeconomic growth in Denmark.The most substantial changes in the Norwegian terms of trade are due to fluctuating oil prices.Variations in Denmark’s terms of trade are negligible.In this sense the Norwegian economy has more in common with countries like New Zealand andAustralia, which are also large exporters of commodities. A substantial change in the terms of trade
13BIS Review 105/2000translates into considerable changes in these countries’ earnings and balance of payments. Over theyears this has resulted in sizeable exchange rate fluctuations.The exchange rate is a buffer against changes in the terms of trade. While a country like Denmark hasmaintained a stable exchange rate, commodity-producing countries typically experience fluctuations inthe exchange rate in tandem with changes in the terms of trade.In New Zealand, Australia and many other countries monetary policy is oriented directly towards pricestability, and these countries permit short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. This means thatmonetary policy bears the primary responsibility for price stability, whereas fiscal policy is to a greaterextent oriented towards long-term stability in government finances.In Norway, the Government Petroleum Fund acts as a buffer against fluctuations in petroleumrevenues. This makes the Norwegian economy more robust and in the short term less dependent on oil,at least as long as the government budget is running a substantial surplus. The Government PetroleumFund is Norway’s most important shock absorber against shifts in the terms of trade. This explainswhy we have had far greater exchange rate stability than New Zealand or Australia.For the past 15 years, cyclical trends in Norway have been desynchronised in relation to otherEuropean countries. Because of the stagnation in the 1990s, inflation has been particularly low inEurope in recent years. Norway, on the other hand, experienced a long period of economic expansionin the 1990s. Since 1997, price inflation in Norway has been higher than in the euro area countries.This is reflected in the higher level of interest rates in Norway compared with the euro area. Even ifinstruments are oriented with a view to stability in the krone exchange rate against the euro, cyclicaldifferences will result in inflation differentials between Norway and euro area countries.This year we have seen a tendency for the krone exchange rate against the euro to be strong at times.This is due in part to the weakness of the euro, not least against the US dollar and the Japanese yen.On the other hand, the effective krone exchange rate - the krone exchange rate measured against anaverage of our trading partners’ currencies - has not been particularly strong. If Norges Bank were torespond to this situation by using the interest rate to attempt to fine-tune the krone exchange rateagainst the euro in the short term, this would lead to higher price and cost inflation. This would lay thefoundation for subsequent instability in the krone exchange rate.
BIS Review 105/200014The orientation of monetary policy in the past year (and in the future)Projections of future inflation and macroeconomic developments play an important part in theorientation of monetary policy. Norges Bank’s projections are published in quarterly Inflation Reports,which provide an overview of recent price trends and factors influencing price and cost inflation.These Inflation Reports contain a review of the outlook for the Norwegian economy, and the Bank’sprojections of inflation with a two-year horizon. Norges Bank’s assessments are summarised in aleader in each report.If the Bank’s inflation projections, for a given interest rate scenario, do not approach the level ofinflation aimed at by the euro area countries at a two to three-year horizon, this will constitute groundsfor adjusting interest rates. This system has similarities with what Lars Svensson terms “inflationforecast targeting”.In recent years we have attached importance to contributing to a transparent monetary policy. This isin keeping with trends in many other countries. Transparency promotes predictability in the behaviourof the central bank and helps diminish uncertainty for all participants in the economy. It is our hopethat in this way the Norwegian economy will be less exposed to doubt and speculation concerning thesetting of interest rates, with attendant greater stability in the formation of expectations and smoothermovements in long-term interest rates. We aim to create a pattern of continuity and consistency in theimplementation of monetary policy.Developments in financial indicators do not indicate that there is great uncertainty in the marketsregarding developments in the internal and external value of the Norwegian krone. For instance,developments in bond yields show that the risk premium has been relatively stable in recent years. Thepricing of the Norwegian krone in the options market indicates that substantial uncertainty with regardto movements in the value of the krone against the euro is not factored into the price of options.Norges Bank’s Executive Board engages in a broad discussion of monetary policy every six weeks.Any decisions concerning interest rate changes or other important changes in the use of monetarypolicy instruments are normally taken at these meetings. Monetary policy decisions made by theExecutive Board (be they decisions to change key rates or to leave them unchanged) are announced inpress releases at 2 pm on the day of the meeting. Monetary policy decisions usually include astatement of bias, ie the probability that the next change in interest rates will be an increase or areduction. At the same time as the press release, a press conference is held at which a more detailedaccount of the background for the decision is given.
15BIS Review 105/2000
BIS Review 105/200016On 20 September this year, Norges Bank decided to increase its key interest rate, the deposit rate, by0.25 percentage point to 7%. This has brought the overall increase in interest rates this year to1.5 percentage points. This has happened in a climate of interest rate rises in other countries and arelatively weak effective krone exchange rate. Moreover, the past year has seen increased risk thatprice and cost inflation may remain considerably higher in Norway than in other European countries.Norges Bank had no choice but to counter this, in order to satisfy the fundamental preconditions forexchange rate stability. This is why the Bank has raised its key rates.I would like to conclude by once again thanking you for inviting me to give this account of the basisfor Norwegian monetary policy.References:Akram, Q F (2000): “PPP despite real shocks: An empirical analysis of the Norwegian real exchangerate”.

1BIS Review 103/2000Bank of Japan’s November report of recent economic and financialdevelopments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 20 November 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy is recovering gradually, with corporate profits and business fixed investmentcontinuing to increase.With regard to exogenous demand, public investment is decreasing gradually since the implementationof the supplementary budget for fiscal 1999 has peaked out. Net exports (real exports minus realimports) continue to follow a moderate upward trend due to steady developments in overseaseconomies. As regards domestic private demand, business fixed investment is on an increasing trend.The recovery in private consumption continues to be weak as a whole through lack of notableimprovements in employment and income conditions, although there are somewhat positive signs insome indicators. Housing investment is mostly unchanged.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production is increasing. Corporate profitsand sentiment continue to improve, and the number of firms that take positive action, such asincreasing the amount of fixed investment, is increasing, especially in high-growth sectors. Incomeconditions of households still remain severe but regular and overtime payments as well as new joboffers continue to increase in line with the recovery in corporate activities, and compensation ofemployees has stopped decreasing.As for the outlook, public investment is expected to continue decreasing for the time being. While theU.S. economy is decelerating gradually, the expansion in overseas economies is projected to continue,albeit at a slower pace. In these circumstances, the increase in exports is likely to slow down, asinventories of some raw materials and electronics parts are somewhat excessive at present in Asianeconomies. Meanwhile, imports are projected to continue increasing, particularly for those ofconsumer goods, and capital goods and parts. Therefore, net exports will level off for a while. In thecorporate sector, firms still strongly feel that they have excess equipment and that they should reducetheir debts to restore financial soundness. However, it is very likely that fixed investment in high-growth sectors, including those related with information technology services, will increase ascorporate profits continue to recover. Moreover, an improvement in corporate profits will increasehousehold income and this in turn is expected to boost private consumption. However, the pace ofrecovery in household income will be modest for the time being, since firms’ perceptions of excessemployment still persist, and thus significant changes have not been observed in their efforts to reducepersonnel expenses. The increase in industrial production is expected to slow down somewhat for awhile mainly because of the slower rise in exports. Overall, the economy is likely to recover graduallyled mainly by business fixed investment, while the developments in crude oil prices as well as foreignand domestic capital markets, along with their effects on the economy, need careful monitoring. Inaddition, the favorable financial environment created partly by the Bank’s sustaining easy monetarystance and the new economic stimulus package are expected to underpin the economy.1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting was held on November 17, 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on November 17 asthe basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 103/20002With regard to prices, import prices are rising, reflecting an increase in international commodity pricessuch as crude oil prices since April. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstanding the rise in prices ofpetroleum products reflecting the increase in crude oil prices, are mostly unchanged mainly due to thedecrease in prices of electrical machinery. Meanwhile, although prices of petroleum productsincreased, consumer prices continue to be somewhat weak owing to the decline in prices of otherimported products and their substitutes. Corporate service prices are still falling slowly.As for the condition surrounding price development, the balance between supply and demand in thedomestic market is projected to be on a gradual improving trend, while an economic recovery isexpected to continue moderately. In these circumstances, upward pressure on prices is likely to arisetemporarily from the increase in crude oil prices. On the other hand, in addition to the declining trendof machinery prices due to technological innovations and the weakening of semiconductor prices, thedecline in prices of consumer goods arising from the streamlining of distribution channels will exertdownward pressure on prices. Overall, prices are expected to be stable or weak somewhat for the timebeing.In the financial market, the overnight call rate is moving around 0.25 percent.As for interest rates on term instruments, Euro-yen transactions maturing beyond the year-end arerising somewhat while TB and FB rates are declining slightly. The Japan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds have been declining since mid-October and are recentlymoving around the level below 1.8 percent. The yield spread between private bonds (bank debenturesand corporate bonds) and government bonds remains mostly unchanged as a whole.Stock prices remain weak overall and are recently moving around the lowest level since the beginningof this year.In the foreign exchange market, the yen continues to be stable and is currently being traded in therange of 107-110 yen to the U.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is at a high level in parallel with recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce their debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result,credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish. Recently, however, theexpansion in the year-to-year decline seems to be ceasing. Meanwhile, issuance of corporate bondscontinues to be steady. Issuance of CPs is increasing towards the year-end.Money stock (M2 + CDs) grew faster in October compared with the previous month on a year-on-yearbasis.Funding costs for firms basically remain unchanged although the short-term funding rates maturingbeyond the year-end increased somewhat.In this financial environment, the lending attitude of financial institutions and corporate financingconditions remain easy.
1BIS Review 103/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The international role of the euroKeynote speech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the EuropeanBanking Congress, held in Frankfurt on 17 November 2000.*      *      *First of all, I should like to thank the organisers of this European Banking Congress for inviting me tospeak before such a distinguished audience. I intend to deal with the two major topics of today’sdiscussion, namely European integration and international financial market developments, byaddressing the role of the euro as an international currency.The title of this session, “the euro second to one” or “second to none”, is certainly appealing, althoughit might be more apt for a beauty contest than for a cool-headed assessment of the role of the euro. It istrue that, in the past, some economists advocated a Darwinian-style competition among privatelyissued currencies, resulting in the survival of the fittest.However, developments so far have confirmed that the use of currencies, both domestically andinternationally, remains very closely associated with state sovereignty. This holds true for the euro,which has been described by some as “a currency without a state”. I shall return to this aspect later inmy presentation. Given this link to sovereignty, the use of a currency is very much influenced bypublic policies, even in the current market-friendly environment created by increasing globalisation. Itis true that public policies are subject to constant scrutiny by the financial markets, which introducesan element of competition among these policies. I personally see this market discipline as a soundincentive to pursue the right policies. As such, one could consider the international use of the euro asone yardstick among others against which to measure the appropriateness and credibility of publicpolicies conducted in the euro area.I should like to concentrate on these policy aspects in the first part of my presentation. Then, althoughstatistical evidence remains scarce at this early stage of the euro’s development, I should like to reviewbriefly the international use of the euro by the private and official sectors.Does the international role of the euro matter?The first question I should like to address concerns the ECB’s policy stance with regard to theinternational use of the euro. This is a legitimate question, especially as some countries have tended topromote the internationalisation of their currency in the past. Such a promotion policy was motivatedby several factors, including increased income from seigniorage, easier financing of balance ofpayments deficits and enhanced opportunities for the development of domestic financial markets.Nevertheless, these potential advantages should not be overrated. The additional seigniorage revenuegenerated by the international use of a currency remains limited. For the most widely usedinternational currency, the US dollar, seigniorage originating from the use of the dollar bynon-residents is estimated at around 1% of GDP. As for balance of payments financing, theinternational use of a currency may alleviate the external constraint for some time, but it cannot free aneconomy from market discipline. Finally, the development of the domestic capital market can be seenas a precondition as much as the outcome of the international use of a currency.There are also historical examples of countries that resisted the internationalisation of their currency,particularly in view of increased uncertainties in the conduct of macroeconomic policies in general andmonetary policy in particular. For its part, the ECB has adopted a neutral stance. It considers that theuse of the euro as an international currency is and should remain the outcome of economic andfinancial developments and policies inside and outside the euro area. The ECB holds the view that itwould be neither feasible nor desirable to directly promote or hinder the internationalisation of theeuro.
BIS Review 103/20002This should not be interpreted as implying that the international dimension of the euro is irrelevant tothe ECB. Indeed, there is at least one reason to monitor the international use of the euro, namely totake into account potential spillover effects on monetary policy. In particular, one can imagine that theinternationalisation of the euro may have an influence on monetary policy transmission mechanisms.International developments in the use of the euro can enhance the breadth, depth and efficiency of euroarea financial markets and lead to a reduction in transmission lags. It is also possible to imagine thatmonetary aggregates may become more difficult to interpret when part of the money stock is heldoutside the euro area.However, the impact of the internationalisation of the euro on monetary policy should not beoveremphasised. First, economic theory and historical experience suggest that the international use ofa currency tends to change only very gradually over time. Second, the ECB’s monetary policy strategyis sufficiently robust to take into account and accommodate potential implications of the internationalrole of the euro.Apart from its monetary policy implications, the international use of the euro may also provide ayardstick with which to assess the appropriateness and credibility of public policies conducted in theeuro area. Of course, the euro can in part rely on the track record of its 11 legacy currencies. At thesame time, the euro is a new currency used in the second largest economic area of the world. This sizefactor, particularly as far as the euro area capital markets are concerned, may influence cross-borderuses of the euro, both by residents and non-residents. The internationalisation of the euro will beaffected by the soundness and credibility of the economic policies pursued in the euro area.This leads me to touch upon the notion of the euro being “a currency without a state”, which Imentioned in my introduction. In this respect, one has to recognise the uniqueness of the overall policyframework in the euro area. It combines monetary policy conducted at the Community level with othermacroeconomic and structural policies that remain national competencies. I do not see this uniquepolicy framework as a factor which potentially hampers the acceptance and use of the eurodomestically and internationally. Such a framework is consistent with the current level of institutionaland political integration in the Community. Even if it may arguably be improved, it has already shownits effectiveness, based on some basic principles. I should like to recall just three of those principlesthat are of relevance to my presentation today. First, a clear assignment of policy responsibilities, bothin terms of well-defined objectives and appropriate means to fulfil them, is required on grounds ofefficacy, transparency and accountability. With regard to monetary policy, this is ensured through theECB’s independence in defining and implementing the euro area’s monetary policy and relatedfunctions. Second, there is a need for the coordination of fiscal and structural policies that areconducted at the national level. In this respect, and without prejudice to their sovereignty, the MemberStates are increasingly taking into account a euro area-wide perspective when preparing their nationalpolicies. Third, this coordination should be based on best practices through the selection of thoseelements of national policies that are commonly regarded as being most efficient. This approach isbroadly similar to the one used to design the ECB’s monetary policy framework, drawing on the trackrecord of the national central banks.Evidence of the international use of the euro by the private sectorTurning to less policy-related and more factual considerations, I should now like to recall briefly somedevelopments in the international role of the euro since its introduction at the start of 1999. I shallbegin with private sector use and shall then turn to the public sector. At the outset, let me make twopreliminary points. The first is that my overview will only be partial, as statistical information is notavailable for all international uses of the euro. The second is that the flamboyant rhetoric used in somequarters to present the euro as the competitor of the US dollar may have generated false expectationsthat the international role of the euro would develop dramatically from the date of its creation. Asemphasised from the beginning by the ECB, these expectations were unjustified. History teaches usthat the internationalisation of a currency is a gradual process.Starting with the overview of private uses, I would consider that the role of the euro in financing andinvestment operations by non-residents is one of the most interesting aspects. Moreover, it is of direct
3BIS Review 103/2000relevance to today’s audience, which consists of many prominent participants in the internationalfinancial markets.The most complete data are available for the financing side. Statistics on international debt securitiesshow that net issuance by non-residents denominated in euro doubled between 1998 and 1999. It wasparticularly strong in comparison with other currencies. Figures for the first half of 2000 indicatecontinued strong activity in euro-denominated securities issuance, although there was a moderatedecline from the peak reached in 1999. This compares with fairly low issuance of Japaneseyen-denominated paper. Interestingly, euro-denominated debt securities issuance had a variety oforigins, with approximately 75% of borrowing originating from non-euro area advanced economiessuch as the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Japan. The remaining 25% of issuancestemmed from emerging market economies. Moreover, both private and public sector issuers wereactive.Developments have been more subdued in the banking sector, where euro-denominated liabilities intotal cross-border liabilities witnessed a moderate increase, with a share of around 20%. Here again,the euro comes second to the US dollar, in which more than 50% of outstanding cross-border bankliabilities are denominated. The yen ranks third with a share somewhat below 10%.Turning to the assets side, we come to the use of the euro as an investment currency. Unfortunately,statistical evidence is generally limited here. An analysis conducted by the ECB indicates that therewas some growth in the use of the euro as an international investment currency over the course of1999. In the banking sector, the volume of international assets denominated in euro increased onlyslightly, roughly in line with developments on the liabilities side.One might try to examine the link between the role of the euro in international financial markets andrecent trends in the euro area’s balance of payments. Of course, there is no one-to-one correspondencebetween the two concepts. Nevertheless, one can observe a correlation, or co-movement, between theinternational role of the euro in financial markets and the euro area financial account. In particular, theeuro area capital outflows in 1999 are consistent with indications that the euro was used more as afinancing than as an investment currency. Likewise, smaller net capital outflows in the first half of2000 would also appear consistent with a more balanced use of the euro as a financing and aninvestment currency. These findings are still preliminary, but they confirm the relevance ofdevelopments reflecting the international use of the euro.Let me now touch upon some other international private uses of the euro. Examples are the role of theeuro as a payment currency in the exchange of goods and services, as an invoicing currency ininternational trade, as a vehicle currency in foreign exchange markets and as a quotation currency ininternational commodities markets. Despite the scarcity of reliable statistical evidence, a fewobservations can be made. First, the US dollar continues to play a leading role in these areas. Second,rapid changes cannot be expected, as these functions of an international currency are driven by scaleand network effects and therefore tend to develop only slowly over time. Third, the euro has aprominent role in those transactions that directly involve euro area residents. For example, the eurotends to be used for invoicing or payments linked to trade flows to or from the euro area.Rounding off this overview of the international use of the euro by the private sector, I should alsomention foreign currency cash holdings in a number of Central and Eastern European countries, inwhich the Deutsche Mark takes the lion’s share. These cash holdings will be converted into euro as thebanknotes and coins are introduced in a year’s time. The stability of the euro indeed makes it anattractive medium of exchange and store of value for the general public in countries that have a historyof unstable prices. Nevertheless, as confidence grows in the domestic monetary policies conducted inthese countries, this specific international role of the euro should not develop further.Evidence on the international use of the euro by the public sectorNot only the private sector, but also the public sector may use the euro as an international currency.This encompasses the use of the euro for official reserve holdings and as a reference currency forexchange rate arrangements. Statistics related to official reserves were published in the most recent
BIS Review 103/20004International Monetary Fund Annual Report, and indicated that the share of the euro was around 13%at the end of 1999. This is comparable with the weight of the legacy currencies one year earlier. Thefact that stability is prevailing is consistent with the notion that central banks tend to be conservativein managing their reserve holdings.Remaining in the sphere of international official reserves, the International Monetary Fund hasrecently decided on a new valuation method for the special drawing rights (SDRs), which comes intoforce on 1 January 2001. The SDR basket traditionally comprised five currencies of individualcountries, including the Deutsche Mark and the French franc. The weight of each currency in thebasket was determined on the basis of trade and financial data of these countries. In order to reflect thenew economic area resulting from the introduction of the euro, the SDR basket will henceforth includethe euro, instead of the Deutsche Mark and the French franc. Its weight will be based on theimportance of the euro area as a single economic entity. Similarly, the EURIBOR will be substitutedfor the German and French national interest rates in the determination of the SDR’s interest rate. Thesemodifications underscore how the official international financial community is gradually adjusting tothe new reality of the euro.As a last point, let me deal with the use of the euro as a reference currency for exchange rate regimesadopted by third countries. Today, over 50 countries are managing exchange rate arrangements thatinclude a reference to the euro. This involves a variety of regimes, ranging from very tight pegs(ie currency boards) to managed floating policies. Geographically, these countries are located on theEuropean and African continents. This is a difference with the US dollar, which is also used by a fewcountries outside the Western Hemisphere. The intensive trade and financial links with the euro areaare the main factor behind the choice of the euro in the definition of exchange rate policies. For somecountries, the European Union accession process provides an additional impetus to select an exchangerate arrangement based on the euro. I should highlight that the choice of a euro-based exchange ratearrangement is a unilateral decision, and does not involve any commitment on the part of the ECB.However, this use of the euro as a reference currency may be seen as a sign of confidence in thestability-oriented macroeconomic policies of the euro area.ConclusionsSummarising almost two years of experience with the euro, one might consider that it has startedplaying an international role in line with the economic and financial size of the euro area in a rathersmooth manner.As I have highlighted today, developments in the international use of the euro are, of course, onlygradual. Nevertheless, looking ahead, one can expect the international role of the euro to developfurther. An established track record of the Eurosystem with reference to its primary objective of pricestability and continuing integration of financial markets in the euro area will undoubtedly contribute tothe further internationalisation of the euro.
1BIS Review 102/2000David Clementi: The Bank of England- a central bank post-independenceSpeech by Mr David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the Annual LeonardSainer Lecture, 14 November 2000.*      *      *IntroductionIt’s a great pleasure to be asked to give this lecture, the occasion being in honour of Leonard Sainer.One of my first experiences as a young investment banker in the City was working in the mid-1970swith Dick Russell and Michael Smith, then the young Turks of Leonard Sainer’s firm, on the financialreconstruction of a Property Company. We have remained in touch ever since. At the time we wereworking on the reconstruction of the Property Company, the Bank of England kept a fatherly eye onhow the matter was progressing, concerned as it then was, and still is, with systemic risk running fromthe property sector into the banking sector which funded it. I have to say that it never occurred to me,with my roots firmly based in the private sector, that I would one day be part of the Bank of England.Indeed one or two of my friends, Dick Russell and Michael Smith among them, occasionally expresssurprise that I have moved from the commercial world of Investment Banking to Central Banking.They like to ask the question: “Does the Investment Banker know the difference between right andwrong?” To which the answer is: “Of course he does, provided he’s allowed two guesses!”Having arrived at the Bank over three years ago, I am often asked what I actually do there. And theanswer is that I have three main roles. First, I am one of the nine members of the MPC; secondly, Ihave responsibility for the Bank’s work in financial stability; and thirdly, I have day-to-dayresponsibility for the management of the Bank. One way or another, wearing these three hats involvesme in most of what the new Bank of England does - new in the sense that the 1997 changes,incorporated in the Bank of England 1998 Act, were fundamental to the Bank’s activities. Withoutproviding a personalised “this is how I spend my day” account we occasionally read in thenewspapers, perhaps I could say a little about each of these roles.Monetary Policy CommitteeBeing a member of the Monetary Policy Committee is a hugely rewarding experience.The process we go through has been quite well documented elsewhere so let me be brief in mydescription. We are required by the 1998 Bank of England Act to meet at least monthly, although wehave the right to meet as often as we wish. On the Friday before the monthly MPC meeting we meetwith the Economics and Markets staff of the Bank, in what is known as pre-MPC, to go through thelatest data; and this process takes a whole morning. Doing it on a Friday allows us a few days tocommission any additional work we need ahead of the MPC meeting itself. This is held in our maincommittee room under the watchful eye of Augustus John’s portrait of Montagu Norman (Governor ofthe Bank between 1920 and 1944) and starts on a Wednesday afternoon. This meeting is given over toa discussion of the key issues raised by the data presented at the pre-MPC; and of any tacticalconsiderations. The following day, Thursday morning, we meet and after a brief resume of theprevious day’s discussion from the Governor, proceed to go around the table with each memberindicating the factors he or she considers relevant and his or her vote. The policy decision (ie interestrates up, down or constant) is released to the market at 12 noon on the Thursday. The minutes of themeeting, including the individual votes of members, are released two weeks later.Much has been written about the MPC’s constitution and operation, but perhaps I might make a fewobservations. In the first place, whilst there is a good deal of talk about the Bank of England’sindependence, it is important to put this in context. The objective of our Monetary Policy deliberations
BIS Review 102/20002- the inflation target - is set annually by the Chancellor, not the Committee, and it is specified fairlyprecisely. Thus the decision on the policy objective rests with the elected government, its execution inthe form of the technical decision-making rests with the MPC; and in this sense we tend to talk aboutour system as one of “operational independence”.Secondly, as is well known, the Chancellor has set the inflation target objective at 2.5% for each of thefirst three years of operation. Such an explicit target aids accountablility; and plays an important rolein anchoring private sector expectations. Our remit is to aim for this target at all times. We arerequired to regard deviations above and below the target in the same light and the target is thus asymmetrical one. We are obliged to write an open letter to the Chancellor if we deviate by 1% eitherabove or below. The importance of the symmetry of the target is not well understood, but in theworking of the committee it is hugely important. As central bankers, we would obviously like to do“the prudent thing”. And if the 2.5% target had been set as a ceiling, then it would be clearer, at timesof doubt, or when the decision was finely balanced, what the right action to take on interest rateswould be. But since the target is set at 2.5% on a symmetrical basis, the concept of “prudence” cannotbe applied in the same way. The result is that we worry as much about being below the target as we doabout being above it. And I believe this makes good economic sense: the problems of severe deflationare at least as great as severe inflation.The particular indexed measure of inflation the Chancellor has chosen is RPIX, that is the headlineRPI number after excluding - this is the X bit - mortgage interest payments. Some believe that weshould move to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), widely used in Europe and,accordingly, making comparison with Euroland inflation easier. HICP inflation in this country hasbeen running consistently below RPIX by about 1%. This reflects differences in the construction of theindex, in particular the treatment of depreciation of property costs. Some have argued - most recentlythe Engineering Employers’ Federation - that if we moved to HICP, then interest rates couldimmediately be lowered. But this does not follow. If we moved to a different calculation of inflation, itwould seem natural to revise the target at the same time. A 2.5% target for HICP would mean that weare targeting a higher level of inflation than we are at present. In any event, my view is that, as weseek to disseminate the benefits of low and stable inflation to as wide an audience as possible,consistency of the existing index and level is an advantage.Critics of the process often argue that the MPC should have a second target; most commonlyindustrialists argue that this should be an exchange rate target, seeking stability for sterling against ourmajor trading partners. I well understand the difficulties that, in particular, exporters face given thevolatile movements in exchange rates; and the frustration is compounded by the difficulty inexplaining such movements purely in terms of economic fundamentals. Nevertheless it should berecognised that the recent historical experience of the UK in operating monetary policy geared toexchange rate stability has been that a conflict sooner or later emerges between the exchange rateobjective and other policy considerations, so that the exchange rate objective has to be abandoned. Themost recent experience was our membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism between 1990 and1992. Fundamentally, there is a problem in operating monetary policy so as to achieve two targets -which one has primacy? How would the trade-offs be made? My view remains that a single inflationtarget objective is a better, as well as much clearer, framework for monetary policy.My next point relates to the transparency of our process. In almost all committees I have served on inthe past, the process has been one of trying to achieve consensus on the way forward. The MPCprocess, however, involves no pressure to reach agreement. We are each accountable for our views;full minutes are taken and published; our individual vote is publicly recorded. This is counter-intuitivefor anyone from a PLC background. It is impossible to believe that a split in the Board of a majorcorporation, certainly a split that was aired in the press, could exist for any length of time. Either thesplit would need to heal rapidly, or more likely some high-profile departures from the Board wouldensue.But in the MPC a system which permits different views to surface publicly is both refreshing andappropriate. Since economic analysis involves a great deal of peering into the future, it is notsurprising that there should be disagreement. There is, of course, the old joke of putting nine
3BIS Review 102/2000Economists into one room and getting ten views. But it is better to be open about the disagreementsthan try to forge a false sense of consensus. Of course, alongside this transparency and open votingsystem goes a degree of personalisation within the Press. An industry has grown up geared to guessingour personal habits, psychoanalysing our personalities and classifying us into different species of theaviary. And alongside this has gone a demand for even greater transparency which falls only a littleshort of having TV cameras in the Committee Room. All this has resembled at times an economicsversion of Big Brother; indeed I expect the viewing economics community will ask next for the right,through a telephone poll, to vote members off the Committee!Occasionally the differences of view that surface in the Committee arise from different views aboutthe workings of some economic relationship; on other occasions they represent a difference in tacticalviews. There is more than one interest rate path which would give an inflation profile consistent withthe target. And so there can be differences between those who might at any moment prefer to wait andsee - recognising that this might require a sharper movement in interest rates later on - and those whomight prefer a more pre-emptive activist approach to setting rates, what might be termed the MacbethSchool of Economics: “If it were done when ‘tis done, then ‘t’were well it were done quickly”. Thefact that there are different paths to achieve the 2.5% target is one reason why there is no automaticlink between our inflation forecast, which we publish on a quarterly basis, and that month’s interestrate decision.I mentioned that the setting of interest rates requires one to peer into the future. Unfortunately it ismore difficult than that. It also requires policy makers to have a view about what is happeningcurrently. There is often considerable uncertainty about what the current situation is - a particularproblem relating to Q3 as we try to assess the impact of the petrol price crisis in September. Even thepast is uncertain and we regularly receive from the ONS revisions to past data about growth ofdifferent parts of the economy. As I look at the data each month, knowing that some of the dials aremisreading, I am reminded of the saying: that the intelligent man knows that half the data he is lookingat is false; the brilliant man knows which half! More seriously we need to have in our mind a viewabout which data series are reliable and which are particularly erratic. Happily the RPIX data, ourgoal, is easily observable. But, by way of example, wages, which are a key piece of data, are much lesseasy to observe. And as we look at the average earnings data, we need to recognise that, not only is itdifficult to measure and calculate, it will also occasionally exhibit “noisy” features that may obscurewhat is going on in the real economy. Indeed, over the Millennium period, as special Y2K bonuseswere being paid, it was very difficult to determine what represented real “news” about the economy,and what was mere “noise”.Sitting at the controls of the aircraft, trying to pilot a sensible middle course between the extremes ofunsustainable take-off and hard landing, we need “eyes and ears” on the ground. Our network of Bankof England Agents is extremely important in this area. Around the country we have twelve Agencies,in general staffed by long-serving Bank of England people, constantly collecting information at thegrass-roots level from their many business contacts. And the information, which they provide direct tothe MPC on a monthly basis, can often prove helpful: either in helping us unravel inconsistencies inthe data; or, as was the case in the Summer and Autumn of 1998, alerting us to problems in theeconomy before they show up in the official data.Notwithstanding the help of the Agents, problems with interpretation of the data abound. Some ofthese will be discussed in our Quarterly Inflation Report, due to be published on Thursday this week. Ihope you will have the opportunity to read it.Financial stabilityPerhaps I could now turn from monetary policy matters to financial stability; and to the second part ofmy job as the Deputy Governor responsible for this part of the Bank’s work.Go back a little over three years and the Bank had a large department with four hundred and fifty staffsupervising banks. Hard on the heels of the decision to grant the Bank independence, the Governmentdecided in May 1997 to establish the Financial Services Authority bringing together existing UK
BIS Review 102/20004financial regulators and supervisors under one roof. The decision was intended to streamline the UKregulatory framework and, recognising that the distinction between different types of financial firmshad begun to blur, to bring together financial regulation in a single organisation and under a singlepiece of legislation, the Financial Services and Markets Act. In a world crowded with acronyms, thisgave an opportunity for something of a cull, consigning the numerous self-regulatory organisations -or SROs - like SFA, IMRO and PIA to history!However, while you may be able to take financial supervisors (quite literally) out of a central bank,you cannot remove all responsibility from a central bank for the safe-running of the financial 7 system.The Bank stands at the heart of the financial system not only in the implementation of monetarypolicy, monitoring the financial intermediaries that make up the transmission mechanism for policychanges, but also operationally, as a market participant: on a daily basis carrying out open marketoperations or providing final settlement for payment systems across accounts at the Bank; or, in moreextreme circumstances, intervening in the market to support the currency or to provide liquidity to abank in difficulty.Thus, while responsibility for supervision of individual banks has moved to Canary Wharf, the Bankhas retained responsibility for maintaining the stability of the financial system as a whole. The Bank’srole is recognised in the Memorandum of Understanding agreed between the Bank, the Treasury andFSA and published in the Autumn of 1997, which sets out how the three organisations are to cooperatein monitoring the UK financial system. To this end, the MOU established a tripartite StandingCommittee which meets monthly to discuss issues of current concern; and cooperation is furtherenhanced by the fact that I sit on the FSA Board and Howard Davies is a Member of Court.Coordination is also important internationally. The Asian Crisis in 1998 demonstrated how quicklyshocks could pass between markets. One response from the international financial community was theestablishment of the Financial Stability Forum, a body similar in purpose to the Standing Committee.The Forum meets semi-annually, bringing together central banks, regulators and finance ministriesfrom developed and developing countries, to discuss the threats to financial stability. The Bank is anactive participant in the FSF, along with HMT and FSA.Having described the organisational structure, I want to turn now to the four broad areas where theBank is involved in financial stability.The first is the analysis of developments in G10 and emerging market economies and financialmarkets and the potential impact on financial stability. Macro-prudential surveillance is at the core ofthe Bank’s financial stability effort, bringing together detailed knowledge of the macroeconomicenvironment and financial markets to identify potential vulnerabilities in financial systems inaggregate. Recent examples include the volatility of technology stocks, the growing size of telecomdebt or the problems of the Japanese insurance industry. Much of the work is published in the Bank’sFinancial Stability Review which is intended to promote public understanding of financial stability.The most important part of the FSR is an assessment of the global conjuncture and potential risks tothe UK financial system.Emerging market economies have attracted particular attention in recent years. Not only were thesecountries the source of the most recent shock to the international financial system in 1998 but, sincethat time, they have been a major focus in international groups such as the FSF. The work tostrengthen the financial system has centred as much on crisis prevention as crisis resolution. Undercrisis prevention, the accent has been on improved disclosure, establishing new international standardsfor transparency for governments and private sector firms in the publication of economic and financialdata. In terms of crisis resolution, discussion has turned to the role of the official sector, and the IMFand World Bank more particularly, in helping countries that get into difficulty. Many of the crises inemerging market economies have been marked by a sudden withdrawal of private sector capital,including outflows to private sector creditors of official funds intended to stabilise the position andreverse this capital flight. The Bank of England has taken a leading role in discussion with othergovernments and central banks, and with the private sector market participants, to find a more orderlyapproach to crisis situations and to avoid the kind of damaging scramble to withdraw funds fromemerging market economies that marked the Asian Crisis.
5BIS Review 102/2000The second area of Bank involvement is market infrastructure, the payments and settlements systemsthat underpin financial markets. Given the size of payment flows, domestic and cross border, theimportance of robust and reliable systems is paramount. Any failure in payment systems would resultin gridlock and widespread disruption. The Bank has an operational interest, closer to home, in thatpayment systems, especially in the wholesale market, often rely on the transfer of payments acrosscentral bank accounts. Because of this, under the MOU the Bank is explicitly given responsibility forthe systemic oversight of payment systems. In carrying out this responsibility, we take a close interestin the interaction of these systems with other parts of the infrastructure - settlement systems andclearing houses. This interest extends to exchanges and the dizzying process of alliances, mergers andfailed bids that has marked the attempt to consolidate global equities markets, especially in Europewhere, despite EMU, trading is still widely split between markets.The third area of Bank involvement is regulatory policy. Although responsibility for supervision of thebank has passed to the FSA, the Bank retains an interest in the design of the regulatory structure andthe impact that this has on the stability of the system as a whole. The Bank is represented on the BaselSupervisors Committee and has been closely involved in discussions on the new Basel Accord and thecapital requirements to be applied to banks. Clearly ensuring that individual banks are adequatelycapitalised has a direct bearing on the ability of the system as a whole to withstand shocks. However itis only really in a crisis or an economic downturn that it is possible to tell what the full story is. As oneof my colleagues colourfully puts it, it is only when the tide rolls out that you find out who is notwearing swimming trunks!The final area I would like to mention is the Bank’s role in reviewing financing for business in theUK. This is more focused on efficiency and competitiveness than financial stability but, over severalyears, the Bank has built up a leading role in looking at financing conditions for small firms andhigh-technology companies. More recently the Bank has also become involved in the government’sinitiatives under the Social Exclusion unit to look at financial exclusion and the provision of bankingservices to deprived areas. On occasion, the Bank also takes a role in corporate restructuring, holdingthe ring between large debtors and their bank lenders. The Bank in this way provides a kind of ACASfor syndicated lenders, known as the London Approach. Like ACAS, the London Approach isvoluntary, informal and by mutual agreement. It is also less active now than previously, certainly sincemy own first encounter with the Bank in the mid-1970s, hopefully a good sign for Financial Stability.Management of the BankHaving dealt with the policy implications of the changes announced by the Government in May 1997 -the advent of the Monetary Policy Committee and the transfer of line supervision for banks to the FSA- I would now like to turn to the profound impact that the changes have had on the Bank as aninstitution and to the third part of my job, responsibility for day-to-day management of the Bank.With the new responsibilities for monetary and financial stability came a recognition of the need forless generalist and more specialist analytical skills, and in particular for highly trained economists. Atthe same time, in our banking and other operations, as in other financial organisations, the introductionof new technology brought increasing demands for staff with emphasis on IT and not purely clericalskills. These have presented huge challenges for the management of the Bank and its staff. Lookingback over the last three years, we have made changes in many areas, but I would like to pick out fourin particular.Increased efficiencyFirst has been the move towards greater efficiency and a reduction in overheads. At the time of thetransfer to the FSA, the Supervision division was, as I have already mentioned, the largest in the 10Bank with 450 people. However, while the frontline supervisors all moved out, none of the associatedcentral services and overhead costs moved with them. We committed to remove these excessoverheads, setting ourselves the target of taking £20 mn off costs - 10% of total costs - over a five-yearperiod. We are consolidating our property portfolio, shrinking the buildings we use from five down to
BIS Review 102/20006one, our main office in Threadneedle Street, in order to deliver substantial savings in accommodationand maintenance costs. At the same time we have sought to improve the efficiency of our centralservices; and this has required substantial reductions in numbers in some parts of the Bank.Our objective has been, as a public sector organisation, to deliver value for money, to ensure that theBank is cost effective in its operations and comparable to best practice elsewhere. Finding suitablebenchmarks for the Bank, however, is not easy. The Bank employs 2,500 staff which compares withover 15,000 at the Banque de France and also at the Bundesbank. But direct comparison with othercentral banks is made difficult by differences in functions. For example, the Banque de France retainsa network of 211 branches for distribution of banknotes whereas the Bank has closed all but one of itsregional cash centres, moving to a system using commercial banks for note distribution. Wherepossible, individual functions - personnel, finance, property services - are benchmarked againstequivalent functions in private sector firms. However the Bank’s cost effectiveness in all functions,even those where benchmarks are hard to identify, is monitored closely by management and is subjectalso to the scrutiny of the Court of the Bank of England.Corporate governanceThe role of Court and changes to the Bank’s corporate governance arrangements is the second area Iwould like to address. The powers of Court to oversee the operations of the Bank were substantiallyenhanced by the 1998 Act. In particular the Act:(a) requires the Court of the Bank to determine our Objectives and Strategy for the year; and(b) sets up a non-Executive Committee to review the Executive’s performance against theObjectives. This is chaired by our Senior Non-Executive, a position formally designatedunder the Act.So our latest Annual Report for the year to February 2000 sets out the Bank’s ten key Objectives forthe year, includes a long description by the Executive of the Bank’s performance against theObjectives; and finally a section, written by the Non-Executives, commenting on our performance.The aim of the Act was quite plainly to increase the level of transparency of our operations; and toraise the accountability of the Executive to Court as a whole, and in particular to the Non-ExecutiveDirectors appointed to review our performance.Risk controlThirdly, I would like to comment on the enhancements we have made to our risk controls. This is anarea where the private sector has made enormous advances in recent years, much of it stronglyencouraged by the banking supervisors. Risk management has become more sophisticated with moredifferentiation between risks: the separation of credit and market risk; the recognition of operationalrisk as a distinct category; and the importance of reputational risk. Notwithstanding that the nature andsize of our operations are different and smaller than many private sector institutions, the Bank isexposed to many of these same risks.In managing these risks, we have wanted to ensure that our practices are consistent with best practicein the private sector, to the extent that this is applicable to a central bank. We have invested heavily intechnology to allow management of the risks on a consolidated basis and where appropriate in realtime. We have also instituted a number of organisational changes, setting up an Assets and LiabilitiesCommittee which I chair and which reviews at senior level the management of our balance sheet; anda Risk Monitoring Department (based in part on the Middle Office model of the private sector),independent from our banking line management. Above this, like public companies, we have a numberof Board sub-committees, and in particular an Audit Committee, taking reports from the Internal andExternal Audit, looking carefully at our internal systems and controls and our policies and processesfor management of the main financial, operational and reputational risks. Like public companies, and
7BIS Review 102/2000no doubt many of you here who are directors of public companies, we are working hard to ensure fullcompliance with the Turnbull report.Personnel policiesFinally I would like to mention the changes we have made to our personnel policies.I have already indicated that the changes imposed by the 1997 proposals, together with the changesbrought about by a changing environment, placed a heavy demand on the flexibility of our workforce.We have needed to increase the analytical capacity of the Bank, in part by additional recruitment ofeconomists. Indeed we are among the largest employers of professional economists in the country. Wehave also substantially upgraded our programmes under which individuals are able to go back tofull-time education supported by the Bank to obtain the Masters, and in some cases Doctorate degrees,that we need to keep us at the forefront of thinking on economic and financial issues.We have reorganised the rank structure within the Bank. For some time, we had two broad categoriesof staff: officers and officials. Counter-intuitively, the officials were senior to the officers, rather likethe Civil Service of many years ago when Administrative Grades were senior to the Executive Grades.We have merged the officers and officials grading into one structure, taking out several layers whilewe were at it - although I would have to admit that the Bank remains a formidable hierarchy!Along with the flatter rank structure, we have introduced a more discretionary and merit-based paysystem, removing some of the barriers to rapid advancement of the very best people. At the same time,we reformed our benefits arrangements, removing a system that geared benefits in part to length ofservice and replacing it with one geared to contribution to the organisation. In particular we removedsubsidised mortgages, arguing that the Central Bank, now responsible for interest rates, should notinsulate its staff against the effects, for example, of rising interest rates which might affect the rest ofthe country. The approach to the new flexible benefits is modern, offering staff a menu of benefits upto a percentage of their salary; if none of the choices appeal, they can take cash instead.Many of these management issues are dealt with in our Annual Report - and I hope this gives comfortthat the Bank of England is not hiding behind its unique role to limit disclosure. Rather we recognisethat we should play our part in being open and accountable.In aiming to achieve a high degree of efficiency we must recognise that we will never reach anyabsolute goal - but we do want to stand up well in comparison to other organisations in the publicsector. We have set ourselves the goal of seeking excellence as one of the leading central banks in theworld; and at home to stand out as one of the leading UK public sector institutions.Perhaps I could close at this point by thanking you for coming. I have got a few points “off my chest”- and I hope for your part I have made a few points which have been of interest.
1BIS Review 101/2000Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy in NorwayOpening remarks by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank, to Norges Bank workshop on“The Conduct of Monetary Policy in Open Economies”, held in Oslo, on 26-27 October 2000.*      *      *IntroductionI am happy to welcome you to this workshop on “The conduct of monetary policy in openeconomies”. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners of monetary policy from awide variety of countries. The aim is to stimulate exchanges both across countries and betweenresearchers and monetary policymakers on a topic of common interest.Research on monetary policy is an international field. We thus find it tremendously useful to be a partof an international network of researchers and practitioners concerned with monetary policymaking.Contact across central banks does represent an important source of inspiration to the policydiscussions in Norges Bank.Norwegian monetary policyThe papers presented at this workshop address topics that are highly relevant to monetary policy ingeneral and Norwegian monetary policy in particular. Some of you may be familiar with theNorwegian system. For others it may be unknown that Norway has a monetary policy regime that isunique in an international context: it is a system of neither a fixed exchange rate nor an inflation target.Let me explain in more detail:The political authorities formulate Norges Bank’s mandate for the conduct of monetary policy. TheExchange Rate Regulation of 6 May 1994 states that monetary policy in Norway should be aimed atmaintaining a stable exchange rate in relation to European currencies over time.Norges Bank has defined “European currencies” as the euro. What we mean by a “stable exchangerate…. over time” needs to be made more precise. The krone exchange rate has fluctuated in recentyears, in spite of Norges Bank’s active use of instruments, indicating that Norges Bank cannotfine-tune movements in the krone exchange rate. Thus, in its use of the interest rate Norges Bankfocuses on the fundamental preconditions for stability of the krone exchange rate over time.Empirical work on the Norwegian economy suggests that there is mean reversion in the real exchangerate. This implies that higher inflation in Norway than among its trading partners tends to be followedby a nominal exchange rate depreciation. Thus, in order to stabilise the nominal exchange rate againstthe euro, monetary policy instruments must be oriented towards bringing inflation down to the levelaimed at by the Eurosystem.However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a shock that leads to a change in the equilibrium realexchange rate occurs. Examples of such shocks are a large permanent shock to the oil price or apermanent increase in the government expenditure. If such shocks occur, Norges Bank must preventmonetary policy from contributing to higher inflation or a deflationary recession, since that wouldundermine the confidence in the krone. There are, however, some institutional responses that will takeplace if the Bank is not able to return the exchange rate back to its initial range, as defined by themandate, without contributing to inflation or a deflationary recession. I will come back to this issuelater in my speech.
BIS Review 101/20002The base drift problemIf the inflation rate in Norway deviates from the inflation rate in the euro countries, the nominalexchange rate will need to adjust over time. However, some of you may object that stabilising theNorwegian inflation rate at the level aimed at by the euro countries may not be sufficient to stabilisethe nominal exchange rate. The reason is that inflation in both Norway and the euro countries will besubject to stochastic shocks. This means that even if the expected inflation rates in Norway and theeuro countries were the same, the actual inflation rates would deviate. Technically speaking, therelative price levels will be subject to base drift, and so will the nominal exchange rate.Professor Larry Ball has discussed this in a paper on Norwegian monetary policy.Keeping the relative price level constant would require that we target the price level and not theinflation rate. However, in the 1920s Norway experienced that a policy aimed at achieving a specificlevel for the purchasing power of money led to substantial macroeconomic instability. Aiming at aprice level target may in some situations require a monetary policy that leads to a deflationaryrecession, which may be hard to turn due to the zero limit on nominal interest rates. In other situationsit may require inflating the economy. A monetary policy leading to inflation or a deflationaryrecession will undermine confidence in the krone, thereby generating exchange rate instability.We also note that the present exchange rate range has more or less prevailed for more than 10 years,indicating that base drift may not represent a substantial problem in practical policymaking.How does Norges Bank operate?Forecasts of inflation and general macroeconomic development play a large role in the conduct ofNorwegian monetary policy. Projections are presented in the Bank’s quarterly Inflation Reports. If theinflation forecast does not approach the level aimed at by the euro countries in 2 to 3 years for a giveninterest rate path, Norges Bank will consider adjusting the interest rate. In this narrow sense, one couldsay that the conduct of monetary policy in Norway has some similarities with “inflation forecasttargeting”, in Lars Svensson’s terminology.In addition to economic forecasts, we aim to develop tools that can supplement the use of our largemacroeconometric model. At the moment we are working on the construction of simple calibratedmodels that will be presented at this workshop. The calibrated models can be employed, for instance,to test the performance of simple indicator rules.How does the Norwegian system differ from inflation targeting?The institutional arrangement for monetary policy in Norway does differ in some respects from that incountries with an inflation target. Some central banks with explicit inflation targets have to give anexplanation to the Government or other authorities if the inflation target is not being met. Ourmandate, however, refers to an exchange rate target as opposed to an inflation target. If a situationarises in which Norges Bank is not able to return the krone to its initial range, as defined in themandate, without triggering inflation or a deflationary recession, the Bank will inform the authoritiesthat measures other than those available to the central bank are required. One possibility could then beto recommend fiscal measures that make it possible to bring the krone exchange rate back to its initialrange and stabilise it.Some observers have argued that the possibility that such situations can arise creates an uncertaintythat may weaken the credibility of Norwegian monetary policy. However, Norges Bank has declaredthat it cannot with open eyes contribute to higher inflation or a deflationary recession. Financialmarket indicators show no evidence of monetary policy lacking credibility.Although the actual conduct of monetary policy is similar to inflation targeting, there are a number ofinstitutional differences between the Norwegian system and inflation targeting regimes.
3BIS Review 101/20001. Norway has a long tradition of cooperation between the political authorities and the socialpartners. Income and wage determination is fairly centralised, and the social partnersevaluate the effects of wage outcomes on employment.2. In a number of countries that have switched to a monetary policy regime based on inflationtargeting, fiscal policy is oriented towards reducing government debt and deficits. InNorway, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role in demand management.This task is facilitated by the fact that the Norwegian government has greater financial leeway thanmost other countries, due to its oil revenues.Norwegian government authorities receive substantial revenues from the extraction of oil in the NorthSea. Norway is the world’s second largest exporter of oil, and the budget surplus is currentlyapproximately 11% of GDP.Oil revenues increase consumption possibilities. However, it is a challenge to manage these resourcesin a way that increases welfare for both current and future generations. A rapid expansion of thesheltered sector based on uncertain and perhaps temporary increases in petroleum revenues may leadto the situation called Dutch disease.To manage its resources, Norway has created the Government Petroleum Fund, which receivesrevenues from the petroleum sector, transfers the amount necessary to produce a balanced governmentbudget and invests the surplus abroad. As long as the increase in petroleum income is kept outside thedomestic economy, there will be less need for structural change and thus less need for exchange ratesto change.A one dollar increase in the oil price gives an increase in GDP of almost 1% and most of it arrives asincreased budget revenues. With large and varying budget revenues, the basis for determining centralgovernment expenditure and taxes from one year to the next may easily be impaired. If budgetexpenditure is allowed to fluctuate in step with oil prices, the result may be abrupt shifts and instabilityin the Norwegian economy. Changes in oil prices may then quickly influence wage and priceexpectations, the exchange rate and long-term rates. In that case it will be very demanding to achievenominal stability. Short-term interest rates would have to be changed frequently and sharply andwould generally reflect a high risk premium for the Norwegian krone. It is therefore important that theannual budgets are anchored in a long-term strategy that takes into account that oil revenues mayfluctuate from one year to the next. In addition, it is advantageous if fiscal policy can be used tocounter fluctuations in demand and production.Final wordsBy hosting this workshop, we hope to take part in an exchange of new knowledge about the conduct ofmonetary policy. We hope that the workshop will be a fruitful experience for both researchers andmonetary policymakers.
1BIS Review 101/2000I J Macfarlane: Recent influences on the exchange rateSpeech by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to CEDA Annual GeneralMeeting Dinner, held in Melbourne, on 9 November 2000.*      *      *I am very pleased to have been asked to address CEDA’s Annual General Meeting for the third time inMelbourne. When deciding on a topic for tonight, I realised that it would be very difficult to discussthe Australian economy without spending some time on the exchange rate and the various reasonsadvanced for its recent fall. So I have decided to plunge in and devote the whole speech to this topic.Obviously, we have been doing a lot of thinking about it, and I will see if I can say something usefulabout it in the 20 minutes I have available tonight.What has happened?The exchange rate has behaved during 2000 in a way that noone predicted. There used to be someelements of predictability for the Australian dollar in that its broad movements could usually beexplained by changes in our terms of trade (or its close relative, commodity prices) and the differencebetween domestic and foreign interest rates. The relationship was not close on a month-to-month orquarter-to-quarter basis, but it could explain the large swings. This broad relationship is shown inDiagram 1 which compares the predicted exchange rate and the actual exchange rate using an equationwhich has been used in the Bank over the years. (By the way, there is nothing unique about thisequation as several of the large banks active in the foreign exchange market have also used a similarformulation.) What Diagram 1 shows is that, on the basis of previous experience during the floatingrate period, we could have expected a rise in the exchange rate in 2000. Instead, we have seen a falland the gap between actual and predicted is over three standard deviations - the largest in the pastfifteen years. Something therefore has changed, at least for the present.Diagram 1* Shaded area represents +/- one standard deviation from predicted value.Real Trade-Weighted Exchange Rate85951051151252000IndexIndex19971994199119881985ActualPredicted*10595851151251985-1999averageAnother way of making the same point is to say that the Australian dollar has never previously showna significant fall with economic conditions as they presently are. Over the course of 2000, we have hada strong world economy, improving Australian terms of trade (rising commodity prices), a buoyantdomestic economy, a declining current account deficit, a fiscal surplus and rising domestic interestrates. In the past, a significant fall in the Australian dollar has coincided with the opposite - a weakdomestic economy and world economy, and falling commodity prices. It has also usually occurredagainst a background where there has been widespread public criticism of fiscal and monetary policyfor being too expansionary. None of these elements is present on this occasion.
BIS Review 101/20002The comments I have made so far have treated the year as a single development, but I think it ispossible to distinguish two phases. For the first seven months or so, the biggest influence on theexchange rate was the expectation of what was going to happen to Australian and US interest rates.The predominant view was that the strong US economy would mean that US interest rates would risemore than those in other countries (including Australia), and this contributed to a strong US dollar andfalling Australian dollar. Any suggestion that the Australian economy was weakening (or the USeconomy strengthening) led to a fall in the Australian dollar. In the first seven months of the year,virtually all of the large movements in the Australian dollar could be explained this way. For example,on two occasions, a weak monthly retail trade figure caused the Australian dollar to fall by more thanone US cent in a day. Our forthcoming Statement on Monetary Policy (due next Monday) examinesthis in detail.The irony of this situation was that this process actually involved a misinterpretation of the Australianeconomy. The signs of weakness that were seized upon were anomalies; the underlying economyremained very strong, incipient inflationary pressures were starting to appear, and during this periodour interest rates were raised, as it turned out, more or less by the same amount as those in the UnitedStates. Nevertheless, the misinterpretation prevailed and the currency fell. Over the six months fromlate January, the Australian dollar fell by 11% against the US dollar and 8% in trade-weighted terms.The second phase occurred from around mid-year, when it became widely expected by the market thatthe US economy was going to have a soft landing, and that no further increases in US interest rateswere likely. As a result, the market’s expectation of future interest differentials moved in a directionfavourable to Australia. Had the foreign exchange market continued to behave as it did in the first halfof the year, the Australian dollar would have risen, but it did not. It steadied for a while, and then fellappreciably from mid-August. It was this period that convinced a lot of people that some new factormust be at work, which was overwhelming the normal determinants of the exchange rate. It was alsoin this period that the alternative explanations were put forward most volubly.The influencesBefore getting on to some of the newer explanations for the currency’s movements, it is worth lookingat some more conventional explanations.The first of these is the strength of the US dollar itself, which has been the biggest reason behind ourrecent experience. This has affected us in a mechanical sense in that if the US dollar is rising, thecurrency on the other side of the bilateral exchange rate must fall. We have been part of this, as isshown by the fact that the Australian dollar has fallen more against the US dollar than in trade-weighted terms. There has also been an indirect effect in that the rising US dollar has affected theinvestment preferences of many market participants in an extrapolative way which I will discuss later.The US dollar in 2000 has risen against the currencies of all other industrial countries, although its riseagainst the Yen has been relatively small. These two currencies - the US dollar and the Yen - havebeen the strongest currencies in 2000, and they happen to be our largest trading partners and so havethe largest weights in our trade-weighted index.Interestingly, the newer explanations for currency movements are largely based on the assumption thatcountries with strong currencies will have characteristics similar to the United States (see later). ButJapan is almost the opposite to the United States - weak economy, barely positive interest rates,massive fiscal deficit, trade surplus and an economic culture based on conventional manufacturing. Ido not wish to dwell on these differences, other than to note that they show the dangers of coming upwith a general explanation of exchange rate movements which turns out to be only applicable to onecountry or one period of time.The second explanation relies on the well-known tendency for exchange rates to be driven bymomentum. That is - once a trend has been established, for example, by the events in the first half of
3BIS Review 101/2000the year - it tends to continue and thereby to overshoot the level implied by fundamentals. There havebeen many documented examples of this,1 and market participants often place weight on this factorwhen explaining movements in exchange rates. I have no doubt that this has been an important factorover recent months, as it has been on several earlier occasions in our past. A related market rule ofthumb that has appeared this year, but was entirely absent last year, is the one which relatesmovements in the Australian dollar to movements in the Euro. The good thing is that these trends andrules of thumb do not continue indefinitely, and the further the exchange rate departs fromfundamentals, the more likely it is that some unforeseen event will come along to jolt the rate into anew direction.The third conventional explanation gives prominence to Australia’s external position - the currentaccount deficit and the accumulation of foreign debt and other liabilities. This explanation emergeswhenever the Australian dollar is falling, and then goes into hibernation whenever it is rising. Theproblem with this explanation is that our external position has been relatively stable over the pastdecade or more, and so it is difficult to use it as the explanation for an event that only occurred asrecently as this year. Over the past decade, the current account deficit has cycled around an average ofabout 4½% of GDP, and our foreign debt has stayed a little over 40% of GDP. It is true that totalexternal liabilities to GDP has risen, but against this, the ratio of debt servicing to exports has halvedover the past decade, and the current account deficit itself has been declining during the period of thefalling Australian dollar. I think it is very difficult to make the case that our external position hasrecently deteriorated, or that it is the explanation for the falling Australian dollar in 2000.While I am generally sceptical that this year’s events can be explained by a sudden focus on trends inthe current account position, it may be more promising to think about developments from theperspective of capital flows.If, for one reason or another, investors found Australia a relatively less attractive destination for theirfunds, compared with some other destination - eg the United States - we would expect that this willhave implications for the exchange rate. Some will want to assert that this occurred because peoplesuddenly focused on Australia’s current account, but this seems unsatisfactory because the recipient ofthe flows - the United States - is seeing its current account deficit expand to unprecedented size. Infact, as a share of GDP, Australia’s current account deficit is well on the way to being smaller than itsUS counterpart, yet the US dollar has been rising, and the Australian dollar falling. So to make senseof what has been happening, it is necessary to think in terms of capital flows being driven by changesin the perceived returns in the different countries. In the remainder of this talk, I would like to examinethis apparent shift in capital flows, and to think about whether it is temporary or permanent.Attitudes of international investorsThere are two reasons put forward for why overseas investors may now have a smaller appetite forinvesting in Australian assets - the first applies to debt and the second to equity.On Australian debt, whether at the short or long end or whether private or public, current interest ratesare now lower than formerly was the case. For a good part of the past two decades, Australian interestrates were well above US rates, as we struggled to get Australian inflation back to a respectably lowrate. Even when inflation fell, a number of years passed before the fall was finally reflected ininflationary expectations and interest rates. As a result, it was only over the past three or so years thatAustralian interest rates lost their significant premium over US rates (Diagram 2).1 For example, the US dollar in 1989, the Japanese Yen in 1995, in a strengthening direction, and then in 1998 in aweakening direction.
BIS Review 101/20004Diagram 2lllllll246810246810Ten Year Bond YieldsAustralia%%US19981997199419961995199920001993The argument essentially says that, since Australian interest bearing securities no longer contain apremium, investors’ appetite for them has declined, and so the demand for Australian dollars to buythem has fallen. On the surface, this sounds plausible, but we should ask why have rates fallen. Surelythey fell because Australian debt became more attractive to investors. Whereas in 1994 rates of300 basis points above US rates were required to get investors to hold our bonds, they now do sowillingly at rates only slightly above US rates.Clearly, the simple form of this argument has a few logical gaps. However, there does seem to besomething at work here - perhaps due to differing appetites for Australian bonds on behalf of localcompared with foreign investors - because there has been a reversal in recent years of the former highlevels of capital inflow into Australian bonds. In the five years between June 1992 and June 1997,these inflows averaged $4.3 billion per year, whereas over the past two years there have been outflowsof $5.2 billion per year.The second argument, namely that there has been a change in preference by equity investors, is arelatively recent one, but it has been put forward very forcefully. It essentially says that equityinvestment (direct and portfolio) is less attracted to Australia than formerly since we are viewed as an“old economy” because we do not have a big enough exposure to the new growth areas, particularlythe information and communications technology sector (ICT). The contrast is drawn between theUnited States, which is seen as the “new economy”, and other countries, including Australia andEurope, which are seen as the “old economy”.Let me say at the outset, there are two questions at issue - first, do a substantial number of providers ofcapital think this way? - and second, is there economic substance to the contrast between the two typesof economy? There can be little doubt that the answer to the first question is in the affirmative - thisline of thinking is very widespread at present, and therefore has no doubt been an important recentinfluence on our exchange rate.2 The answer to the second is, in my view, in the negative - thedifferences between the two types of economy - “old” as applied to Australia and “new” as applied tothe United States - have been greatly exaggerated and the similarities ignored. This is importantbecause if there is not fundamental economic substance to the view, it will not last - it will be seen as aphase through which capital markets passed. I would like to spend the remainder of my time tonightexplaining why I believe this is so.The thing that stands out about the economic performance of Australia and the United States over thepast decade or the past few years is not the contrast, but the remarkable similarity. For an investor, themost likely place to make money is where there is strong growth and a rapid increase in productivity.The United States is justly proud of its performance in these two areas, but the one comparable2 Net equity flows into Australia in 1999/2000 (only data for the first three quarters are available) appear to have been lessthan in the two preceding years.
5BIS Review 101/2000country in the OECD area that can match it - in fact, exceed it - has been Australia. I have shown thegrowth and productivity figures before, so I will not repeat them again, but will rely on a US source tomake my point.An article in the US Federal Reserve Board’s October Bulletin sets out to explain the remarkablerecent pick-up in US productivity and to contrast it with 16 other OECD countries. It is an excellentand thoroughly researched article which broadly achieves its objectives, but it keeps finding anirritating exception.3 Whether it is growth of labour productivity, growth of multi-factor productivityor the extent of capital deepening, Australia matches or exceeds the excellent US performance, ratherthan sharing the lacklustre performance of the majority of other countries.But proponents of the “new economy” view would reply that they are not interested in the wholeeconomy, they are interested primarily in the ICT part where the United States unquestionably is theworld leader. But only 3.9% of the US workforce is employed in the ICT sector (the comparablefigure for Australia is 2.6%). Why you should make an assessment of a country by concentrating onthe 3.9% and ignoring the other 96.1% is a question I cannot answer. On a similar note, thewillingness to adopt new technology is surely the key to improving productivity, and here there are anumber of indicators that place Australia very high in the world rankings. A recent OECD publication4on this subject finds that, among the 27 or so OECD countries, Australia is:• third highest in ICT expenditure as a percentage of GDP;• sixth highest in PC penetration;• eighth highest in internet hosts per 1000 population;• third best in internet access cost;• third best in secure web-servers for electronic commerce.Not surprisingly, we do not match the United States in most of these measures, but we are almostalways in the top quartile or higher, suggesting that among OECD countries we should be regarded asbeing towards the top end of the range in willingness to embrace new technology.Again, the proponents of the “new economy” view find this reasoning unconvincing. They tend toconcentrate on the production of the ICT sector, and give Australia low marks for not having moreresources in this area. While there is no doubt that the very sophisticated fringe of ICT, as exemplifiedby Silicon Valley, would be an asset to any country, most of the production side of ICT is much morehumdrum. In fact, the country with the highest share of GDP derived from ICT is not the UnitedStates; Korea and Hungary, for example, both have higher shares. The United States has outsourced agood deal of the production to less sophisticated countries with lower cost structures, with the resultthat the United States now has the largest deficit in trade in ICT of all countries.5 This, I think, helpsmake the point that a policy of trying to direct resources into ICT, particularly its production at theexpense of other aspects of the economy, could be self-defeating. It would be all the moredisappointing if such a policy were sold on the grounds that it would be a constructive response to thecurrent fall in the exchange rate.Perhaps the biggest weakness with the “new economy” argument as an explanation of exchange ratemovements can be found in the recent behaviour of the US dollar and US investments. It is frequentlyasserted that the reason the US dollar is rising is because everyone wants to buy US equities,particularly tech stocks, because that is where the high returns are. In fact, anyone who followed thisapproach this year would have been disappointed. Not only were they buying into something with analready high price and low yield, they would have seen the prices fall noticeably over the year - the3 C Gust and J Marquez, “Productivity developments abroad”, Federal Reserve Bulletin, October 2000.4 “The knowledge-based economy: a set of facts and figures”, OECD, Paris, 2000.5 “Measuring the ICT sector”, OECD, Paris, 2000.
BIS Review 101/20006Dow by 5% and the NASDAQ by 16%. (In Australia, the all-ordinaries has risen over the sameperiod.) To the extent that the US investments made positive returns, it would have been only due tothe appreciation of the US dollar itself, not to the assets purchased, which turns the underlyingreasoning on its head.ConclusionThe Australian dollar has shown some big swings in both directions since it was floated in 1983. Thisis the fourth time in that era that the Australian dollar has fallen by more than 10% in trade-weightedterms in a year. On each of the earlier occasions, it seemed at the time that the fall would go onforever, and there were plenty of people who had explanations to support its continuation. However,on each occasion, it recovered and it will do so again this time.The principal reason for the fall over recent months has been the rising US dollar, which has affectedus directly and indirectly. Another reason is to be found in the interaction between the early fall basedon expectations of interest differentials plus the intrinsic tendency for foreign exchange markets tocontinue to go in one direction, ie to overshoot, and to come up with explanations to justify theovershooting. Finally, over recent months, there has been a tendency for markets to judge countriesand their exchange rates by the “new economy model”. Ironically, this is exactly the period whenUS technology stocks have languished.I should now conclude by saying something about the implications for monetary policy. Monetarypolicy will continue to be conducted according to the medium-term principles contained in ourinflation-targeting approach. This means that the exchange rate will be taken into account, along withthe other variables that contribute to our inflation outlook (where this is appropriately defined toexclude once-off factors such as petroleum prices and the GST). On the other hand, as can be seenfrom our current behaviour, we have no intention of departing from our medium-term approach in anad hoc attempt to push up the exchange rate for its own sake.The period ahead will contain many uncertainties, both here and abroad, but we have coped withuncertainty before. Over the past year, we have had the unusual combination of strong domesticgrowth, a falling current account deficit and a declining exchange rate, all of which are conducive tofuture growth. We still have to ensure that the medium-term outlook for inflation stays on track -which means making sure that several temporary factors have only a “once-off” effect and are notreflected in the ongoing inflation rate. If we succeed in doing that, we will be in a good position tocontinue the expansion we have had since 1991.
1BIS Review 115/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The euro - a new currency for EuropeDinner speech delivered by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at theBank of Thailand on 19 December 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests. May I first say that it is an honour to be invited to say afew words to you this evening about Europe’s new single currency, the euro. I have to admit that onewould not normally think of a currency as being a particularly likely or interesting subject for a dinnerspeech.For the euro, however, I think I am correct in saying that this is not the case. Indeed, the euro is acurrency quite unlike any other. It is not a national currency. Instead it is a supra-national currencycreated by a monetary union of 11, soon to be 12, sovereign member states creating the second largestmonetary area in the world. It is also a very new currency, still less than two years old. It does not yetcirculate in the form of banknotes and coins. Not surprisingly, therefore, the euro does indeed attract agreat deal of public attention.It is notable, however, that different observers seem to perceive the euro in very different ways. Somefocus their attention almost exclusively on the exchange rate, overlooking the fact that the ECB’sprincipal aim is to maintain price stability and not a fixed exchange rate. Others seem to consider theeuro purely in terms of a political or economic experiment. They fail to notice that it is already a fullyfunctioning single currency.This only serves to convince me that, even two years after its introduction, there is still a need for theeuro to be explained to the public at large. And, this is perhaps all the more so outside Europe whereunderstanding of European integration and policy-making is, not surprisingly, more limited.Therefore, I very much welcome this opportunity to say a few quite general words to you about whatthe euro is, how it works, and what it means, both for the euro area and for the world at large.*      *      *Let me first say that one should never try to understand Europe’s new currency in isolation or as acurrency which was merely introduced on 1 January 1999. In fact, the euro is just one, albeit animportant, part of the process of creating an economic as well as a monetary union in Europe. Thisprocess began already a decade ago. Similarly, this "Economic and Monetary Union" is itself part of amuch broader process of European economic and political integration. Therefore, in order truly tounderstand the euro one should in fact consider it first in the context of the European integrationprocess that began already five decades ago.From the beginning, the purpose of this process was to bring the countries of Europe and theireconomies closer together and, in so doing, create an area of peace, prosperity and stability. I supposethese motivations are by no means dissimilar to those which lie behind the various other regional linkswhich have since been formed in other parts of the world, including here in Asia.The European experience in working towards this goal has been one of gradual progress, even thoughwith numerous ups and downs. Nonetheless, the main objective remained ever intact. As economicintegration progressed further and further, as we overcame ever more subtle barriers to trade, itbecame increasingly apparent that one substantial barrier to the creation of a truly pan-Europeaneconomy remained. I refer of course to the persistence of exchange rate fluctuations which resultedfrom the existence of separate national currencies governed by independent monetary policies.In short, European policy-makers had to face up to the fact that, over extended periods of time, youcannot simultaneously maintain free trade, unrestricted capital movements, fixed exchange rates andindependent monetary policies. A choice had to be made and ultimately the time arrived when most
BIS Review 115/20002European countries deemed it more advantageous to firm up the European "Single Market" than tomaintain their national currencies.*      *      *I should add that, beyond this more fundamental motivation, there were other important developmentswhich probably influenced the decision to adopt a common currency. The end of the Cold War set newpolitical parameters for the integration of western Europe. Regional integration and the creation of alarge economic area have also come to be seen as even more necessary in order to prosper in anincreasingly globalised world economy.From the point of view of a central banker, the evolving consensus as to the appropriate role ofmonetary policy and of a central bank was particularly important in laying the foundation for a viablesingle currency. Moreover, an increasing awareness that using monetary policy directly to stimulategrowth and employment was not working and was even proving counterproductive, might havestrengthened the perception that, in an already deeply integrated Europe, there was little to lose fromgiving up autonomous monetary policies. By contrast, a good deal could be gained by removingexchange rate fluctuations and by establishing an independent European Central Bank with a clearobjective to maintain price stability.*      *      *But the evolving consensus to which I refer did not just apply to the field of monetary policy. Norwould it be correct to say that consensus on the objective of monetary policy is sufficient for thecreation of a successful monetary union. The euro becoming a reality also depended on the consensuswhich evolved on the need for sound economic policies more generally. This made it possible for allof the countries which have now adopted the euro to develop and agree on the overall economicframework needed to complement and support a monetary union.Like the process of European integration itself, a framework for co-ordinating economic policies hasdeveloped gradually and over a considerable period of time. The result is a flexible framework inwhich national policies are appropriately co-ordinated rather than centralised. And this is indeed quiteappropriate. In a monetary union it is even more necessary than before for economic policies to takenational differences into account.On the other hand, we do see a need to ensure that national policies take into account the sharedresponsibility of participation in the single currency. This is why, in the area of fiscal policy, co-ordination does take quite a strong form with national policies being subject to binding rules. In thiscontext, governments have committed themselves to what is called the Pact for Stability and Growthin order to reduce government deficits to close to balance or even to create surpluses in their budgets.And indeed over the past years, government finance positions in Europe have improved remarkably. Inother policy areas, however, the countries of the euro area continue to co-ordinate their policies inmore subtle ways. They exchange ideas and information; they agree general guidelines andrecommendations; and they regularly monitor and share assessments of each other’s policies. In thisway, economic co-ordination, in all its various forms, promotes and, where necessary, ensures thatnational policies are appropriate and consistent with participation in the single currency. In strictlylegal terms the euro may be a "currency without a state". In practice, like any other currency, it isembedded in a well-developed and comprehensive economic policy framework.Of course, the one area of policy which is now completely centralised is monetary policy. Thecountries which have adopted the euro now share a common currency, a single exchange rate and asingle monetary policy. The responsibility for conducting this policy has been given to theECB/Eurosystem, with a clear mandate to maintain price stability. Like the Federal Reserve System inthe United States, Europe’s central bank is organised as a federal system. In the centre is the ECB,based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The national central banks (NCBs) of the countries which haveadopted the euro are also part of what we call the Eurosystem. Monetary policy decisions are made bythe Governing Council of the ECB. This Council comprises the six members of the ECB’s Executive
3BIS Review 115/2000Board and the Governors or Presidents of the NCBs of the countries which have adopted the euro.Decisions are made on a one person/one vote basis. This reflects the fact that they always have to bemade in the interest of the euro area as a whole. Therefore, members of the Governing Council do notrepresent their country or even their NCB. They have been appointed in a personal capacity. Theirmandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole. The Eurosystem is an independententity. This is enshrined in the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has been ratifiedby all the 15 Member States of the European Union.And let me just say that I am quite proud of our achievements so far. The ECB’s monetary policy andits strategy have worked well, in spite of the initial uncertainties associated with the changeover to thesingle currency. Price stability is being maintained, even if recent price increases have temporarilyexceeded our target, mainly as a result of the almost tripling of oil prices. Moreover, the markets seemto have confidence in the ECB and its policies, as is shown by the level of long-term interest rates. Inthe euro area, these have remained persistently at or below US levels.*      *      *But let me move on, since the euro also has implications extending well beyond the euro area which Ishould also briefly touch upon. As I mentioned earlier, the euro is the currency of the world’s secondlargest monetary area. The euro/dollar foreign exchange market is the largest in the world and around40% of international debt securities issued over the past two years have been in euro. The euro isalready an international currency, second only to the US dollar, and businesses and investors aroundthe world need to take this into account.In this regard, however, let me just say that some of the speculation about the international role of theeuro, and especially the suggestion made by some that the euro would soon rival the dollar, has notbeen particularly helpful. I prefer to refrain from making such predictions. Rather, I believe that theattractiveness of a currency depends crucially on the underlying policies for economic growth in thecountry, or countries, concerned.What I can say with confidence, is that the euro is playing and will continue to play a role in offeringnew and good investment opportunities, including for investors based outside the euro area. In thisregard, the euro is already acting as a catalyst for the development of a fully integrated Europeancapital market. This market will be more efficient and more liquid than the segmented, nationalmarkets which preceded it. Ultimately, however, and I repeat, the extent to which this translates intoactual inward investment will depend on the market’s perception of economic policies and growthpotential in the euro area.And this brings me to another important role of the euro, namely, it acts as a catalyst for economicreform. Among other things, the adoption of a single currency means that euro area governments nolonger have national currencies which they can devalue in times of need to protect inefficientindustries. Instead, other ways have to be found to maintain competitiveness, both within the euro areaand internationally. I believe it is no coincidence that policy-makers across Europe are now focusingmore than ever before on how to overcome the economic rigidities which, in recent years, have tendedto hold Europe back in terms of economic growth. Indeed, I would not even be that surprised if,looking back some years from now, it is as a catalyst for reform that the euro will be deemed to havehad its most profound effect.I should also add that a lot of progress has already been made. In addition to low inflation, economicgrowth in the euro area is higher than it has been for a decade and unemployment is on a cleardownward trend. Budgets have been consolidated and structural reforms are under way. If thisdevelopment continues, I am confident that the euro has a very promising future.*      *      *
BIS Review 115/20004In the meantime, however, another "euro changeover" will occur. One which, for ordinary euro areacitizens, will not only have a profound but also an immediate and clearly perceptible impact on theirdaily lives. I refer to the introduction, in a year’s time from now, of euro banknotes and coins.As any of you who have travelled to the euro area recently will have noticed, even though ourcurrency is now officially the euro, we are still continuing to use our national banknotes and coins forthe time being. In just over a year, however, all this will change. You will then be able to travel some3,000 kilometres or so from Lapland in the north of Finland to Andalucia in the south of Spain withoutneeding to visit a single bureau de change. No doubt, this is one implication of the single currency thatat least the more mobile citizens of the euro area, myself included, as well as visitors from abroad, willvery much appreciate.
1BIS Review 114/2000Bank of Japan’s December Report of Recent Economicand Financial Developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 18 December 2000.*      *      *The Bank’s View2Japan’s economy continues to recover gradually, albeit at a somewhat slower pace due to deceleratingexport growth.With regard to exogenous demand, public investment is decreasing gradually since the implementationof the supplementary budget for fiscal 1999 has peaked out. Net exports (real exports minus realimports), which had been increasing, are starting to level off as inventories of some raw materials andelectronics parts became somewhat excessive in East Asian economies. As regards domestic privatedemand, business fixed investment is on an increasing trend. The recovery in private consumptioncontinues to be weak as a whole through lack of notable improvements in employment and incomeconditions, although there are somewhat positive signs in some indicators. Housing investment isdeclining slightly.Reflecting such developments in final demand, industrial production remains on a rising trendalthough the pace is somewhat slowing. Corporate profits continue to improve, and the number offirms that take positive action, such as increasing the amount of fixed investment, is rising, especiallyin high-growth sectors. Income conditions of households still remain severe, but regular and overtimepayments as well as new job offers continue to increase in line with the recovery in corporateactivities, and compensation of employees has stopped decreasing.As for the outlook, public investment is expected to maintain the current level for the time being, butis likely to start increasing again in the future along with the implementation of the new economicstimulus package by the government. While the U.S. economy is decelerating gradually, the expansionin overseas economies is projected to continue, albeit at a slower pace. In these circumstances, exportsare likely to remain level for the time being mainly due to inventory adjustments in East Asianeconomies. Meanwhile, imports are projected to continue increasing, particularly for those ofconsumer goods, and capital goods and parts. Therefore, net exports will decline slightly for a while.In the corporate sector, firms still strongly feel that they have excess equipment and that they shouldreduce their debts to restore financial soundness. However, it is very likely that fixed investment inhigh-growth sectors, including those related with information technology services, will increase ascorporate profits continue to recover. Moreover, an improvement in corporate profits will increasehousehold income and this in turn is expected to boost private consumption. However, the pace ofrecovery in household income will be modest for the time being, since firms’ perceptions of excessemployment still persist, and thus significant changes have not been observed in their efforts to reducepersonnel expenses.Industrial production is expected to remain on a rising trend, although the pace of increase may slowdown further temporarily.1This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting washeld on December 15, 2000.2The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on December 15 as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
BIS Review 114/20002Overall, the economy is likely to follow a gradual upward trend led mainly by business fixedinvestment, while the developments in overseas economies as well as in foreign and domestic capitalmarkets, along with their effects on the economy, need to be carefully monitored. In addition, thefavorable financial environment created partly by the Bank’s sustaining easy monetary stance and thenew economic stimulus package by the government are expected to underpin the economy.With regard to prices, import prices are rising, reflecting an increase in international commodity pricessuch as crude oil prices. Domestic wholesale prices, notwithstanding the rise in prices of petroleumproducts reflecting the increase in crude oil prices, are declining somewhat mainly due to the decreasein prices of electrical machinery. Consumer prices continue to be somewhat weak owing to the declinein prices of other imported products and their substitutes, although prices of petroleum productsincreased. Corporate service prices are still falling slowly.As for the condition surrounding price developments, the balance between supply and demand in thedomestic market is projected to be on a gradual improving trend, while an economic recovery isexpected to continue moderately. On the other hand, semiconductor prices are declining reflectingsofter international semiconductor prices, and crude oil prices, which had been exerting upwardpressure on prices, are dropping recently. In addition to the declining trend of machinery prices due totechnological innovations, the decrease in prices of consumer goods arising from the streamlining ofdistribution channels will exert downward pressure on prices. Overall, prices are expected to besomewhat weak for the time being.In the financial market, the overnight call rate is moving around 0.25 percent.As for interest rates on term instruments, Euro-yen transactions, TB and FB rates maturing beyond theyear-end are rising somewhat. The Japan premium remains negligible.Yields on long-term government bonds have been on a downward trend since mid-October, havingdecreased to around 1.55 percent temporarily, and are recently moving around 1.65 percent. The yieldspreads between private bonds (bank debentures and corporate bonds) and government bonds aremostly unchanged or decreasing somewhat.Stock prices continue to be weak, having recorded this year’s lowest level towards the end ofNovember.In the foreign exchange market, the yen has been depreciating from the beginning of November, and iscurrently being traded in the range of 111-113 yen to the U.S. dollar.With regard to corporate finance, private banks continue to be more active in extending loans mainlyto blue-chip companies, while carefully evaluating the credit risks involved.On the other hand, the improvement in economic activities has not stimulated corporate demand forexternal funds, since firms’ cash flow is at a high level in parallel with recovery in profits. Moreover,firms continue to reduce their debts as part of their balance-sheet restructuring measures. As a result,credit demand in the private sector has continued to be basically stagnant.In view of this, the underlying tone of private banks’ lending remains sluggish, although the expansionin the year-to-year decline is ceasing. Meanwhile, the amount outstanding of corporate bonds issued isslightly above the previous year’s level. Issuance of CPs is increasing towards the year-end.Money stock (M2 + CDs) continues to grow at around 2 percent on a year-on-year basis.As for the funding costs for firms, the short-term funding rates basically remain flat but the long-termfunding rates are declining slightly reflecting the decrease in market interest rates.In this financial environment, the lending attitude of financial institutions and corporate financingconditions remain easy.
1BIS Review 114/2000I J Macfarlane: Economic growth, inflation and monetary policy in AustraliaOpening statement by Mr I J Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the House ofRepresentatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, in WaggaWagga on 1 December 2000.*      *      *I would like to start by endorsing the remarks of the Chairman and saying what a pleasure it is to be inWagga Wagga for the first hearing to be conducted outside Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra. Like you,Mr Chairman, I think it sets a good precedent for future meetings, even if it does represent a cautiousstart, given that Wagga Wagga is half-way between Melbourne and Sydney and not that far fromCanberra. Perhaps the Committee will be more adventurous in its future choices. I would also like torecord our thanks to the Mayor of Wagga Wagga and his colleagues and to Kay Hull (a member ofthis Committee) for their hospitality earlier this morning.As usual, I would like to start by reviewing the forecasts I put before the Committee at the previousmeeting in Melbourne in May. Starting with economic growth, you may recall that the Australianeconomy grew by about 4½ per cent per annum in 1997, 1998 and 1999, and, as usual, we wereexpecting a modest slowdown in the year to June 2000. The forecast I put forward for that period was4 per cent, and the outcome was 4.7 per cent, continuing our tradition of modest underestimates ofeconomic growth.For the year to June 2001, I said that we had no quibble with the figure of 3¾ per cent contained in theBudget Papers, nor would we quibble with the recent update which puts it at about 4 per cent. It islargely a matter of rounding, and not much should be made of small differences: the figure is meant tosuggest again some modest slowing from past growth rates. I would note that the number for GDPgrowth involves a substantial slowdown in final domestic demand – from about 6 per cent growth toabout 3 per cent – which is mostly offset by a further swing in net exports into positive territory andthe assumption that the inventory rundown recorded over the past year does not occur again.On inflation, the story is a little more complicated. Last time we met, I said I expected the CPI to riseby 3 per cent in the year to June 2000 – the actual outcome was 3.2 per cent. Not a very big difference,but the first time for quite a while that the outcome was higher than forecast. The reason for this wasthe higher-than-expected oil prices. When we look ahead, we should make sure our forecast goesbeyond June 2001 in order to avoid the “once-off” lift to the price level attributable to the GST. At thelast hearing, I suggested that inflation could be in the upper half of the 2 to 3 per cent range once weare well into 2001/2002. Our Statement on Monetary Policy, which was released about two weeks ago,forecasts that inflation would be around 3 per cent by that time. This small increase is primarily due tothe lower exchange rate now prevailing compared with the middle of the year.You are probably tired of being reminded that we are still in the longest expansion we have had forthree decades, but that fact has to be the starting point for any economic discussion. When we receivethe September quarter national accounts in a couple of weeks time, I expect to see them confirm thatthe expansion has continued unabated into its tenth year. During this period, the growth rate hasaveraged 4.2 per cent per annum, and most of the annual rates have been between 3 per cent and 5 percent, with a few outliers above and below this. Over the whole period, inflation has remained low,which, of course, has been a major factor behind the expansion’s longevity. And, in turn, this hascontributed to a fall in the unemployment rate of nearly 5 percentage points to 6.3 per cent.Despite this record, we should not become complacent – we should always be looking ahead to seewhere the risks to the outlook are likely to come from. Not surprisingly for an economy like ours,which is in reasonable balance, the risks are on both sides. That is, while we are comfortable with ourpresent forecast, there are circumstances which could lead to a stronger economy and hence a speed-up in inflation, and others that could lead to a greater slowdown in economic activity than our currentnumbers indicate.
BIS Review 114/20002I will start with the risks to the inflation outlook. Obviously, the current year has not been an easy onein this respect. In addition to the GST-induced lift in the price level – which was easily foreseeableand appears to have gone according to plan or better – we have experienced two upward “shocks” inthe form of the rise in oil prices and the fall in the exchange rate. It is never easy to digest three suchevents in one year, so we have to be especially vigilant to make sure that any rise in prices is “once-off”, and on-going inflation does not rise to the point where it threatens our medium-term objectives.So far, we seem to be on track to pass this test. The GST caused a smaller rise in the Septemberquarter CPI than expected and, on balance, the data on wages suggest that wages are growing in a wayconsistent with our inflation target. But there is still some way to go before we can be confident thatthese temporary factors do not push us off course. If it turned out that the economy was more buoyantthan we think, the chances of the shocks feeding into higher on-going inflation would rise.I will now talk about risks that the outlook for economic activity could be weaker than we currentlyenvisage. But before doing so, I should remind you that our forecasts already embody a slowing inGDP growth compared with last year, and a more pronounced slowing in domestic demand. So we arenot oblivious to the presence of some factors which point to a less buoyant outlook than we have hadover recent years.The first of these risks is the world economy, and the United States in particular. For some time now,most observers have expected lower growth in 2001 than in 2000 for both the world economy and theUnited States, but there is always the risk that the turnaround could be sharper, particularly if there is ashake-out in asset prices. No-one can be sure that, after such a long expansion, the United States canachieve a soft landing, but at present the odds point to this result.On the domestic front, the area of weakness that many people point to is in housing construction.There is no doubt that there will be a big contraction here, but we should remember that it waspredictable (and has been predicted by virtually all forecasters for some time). We have just gonethrough a period when activity in the housing sector was really quite frenzied. At its peak in the Junequarter, investment in dwellings was at its highest level ever as a percentage of GDP. A lot of activityin the housing sector that would normally have taken place this financial year was brought forwardinto last financial year in order to get in before the GST, so the cycle in housing is likely to be morepronounced than normal. The rises in interest rates, no doubt, also played a role, but they were smallcompared to the GST effect.The third risk that some people have focussed on is business confidence. We have to be careful herebecause we have over a dozen surveys of business confidence and they do not all show the sameresults. Even so, it is true to say that business confidence is not as high as it was a year ago and that ithas fallen in recent months. I think the recent fall owes a lot to the realisation that the housing andconstruction sector will be weak, to the fact that a number of businesses have only recently had to faceup to the practical implementation of paying the GST, and to rising petrol prices.What does the foregoing mean for the economy and for monetary policy? Starting with monetarypolicy, our main message is that it will continue to be conducted according to the medium-termprinciples contained in our inflation targeting approach. We think this approach has served theeconomy extremely well, not only in the direct sense that it has maintained low inflation, but in thewider sense that it has provided the preconditions for sustainable growth. We will be looking closelyat all the influences on inflation over the coming year – including the demand pressures in theeconomy, the growth of wages, and the level of the exchange rate – in order to judge how they willcollectively influence the outlook. Monetary policy will then be set accordingly.We will also, of course, be closely watching developments in the real economy, the labour market,financial markets and our exports and imports. There is a wide range of statistics available on analmost daily basis, from the Bureau of Statistics and from other sources, which chart the course ofthese economic variables. You only have to read the daily press to see how much attention is paid tothese statistics. We at the Reserve Bank, of course, follow them in great detail, something we are ableto do because we have a good staff and a lot of experience at examining them. But I want to suggest toyou that this sort of data gazing, important though it is, is only one aspect of assessing likelydevelopments in the economy and, on its own, can at times give misleading signals. The problem with
3BIS Review 114/2000statistics is that, as well as containing systematic information, they also contain a fair bit of randomvariation and sampling error. Sometimes this means that we get a group of strong statistics arrivingtogether or a group of weak ones, which may signify nothing more than the statistical anomaliesreferred to above. If we rely only on these statistics to form our view of the outlook, we run the risk ofregularly swinging from optimism to pessimism and back again, depending on relatively short-termvariation in the data.Obviously, other approaches are needed to augment exclusive reliance on statistical observation and sohelp to identify the underlying direction of the economy. There are many advocates of approachessuch as sophisticated econometric modelling, extensive industry liaison, and examination of leadingand lagging indicators or the forecasts embodied in financial prices. All of these have their merits andcan provide a broader perspective. But there are two other approaches that I would like to remind youof.The first is to go back and examine previous expansions and ask what were the imbalances thatbrought about their demise, and then to see whether those imbalances exist at present. I did this earlierthis year in a speech in Melbourne,1 where I identified a number of domestic imbalances in previouscycles: high inflation, a wage surge, overvalued asset prices, excessive physical investment andexcessive credit growth. Not all of these were present towards the end of earlier expansions, butusually two or more were.In looking at the Australian economy at present, it is hard to see evidence of any of these imbalances.• Underlying inflation is about 2¼ per cent, rising to 3 per cent over the forecast horizon.• Wages are growing at somewhere between 3 and 4 per cent.• The share market has risen over the year, but does not seem overvalued compared with manyoverseas markets. House prices have risen over recent years, but appear to be stabilising atpresent; rises in commercial property prices have been quite restrained.• There has been no evidence of over-investment or over-capacity in plant and equipment orconstruction.• Credit to households is still growing strongly, but appears to be moderating. Credit growth tobusinesses has not been unduly strong at any stage in recent years.Overall, I think it is hard to find signs of the type of imbalances that occurred in the early 1970s, late1970s/early 1980s and late 1980s which led to such unhappy results. Many people would add thecurrent account of the balance of payments to my list, and point out that in the later stages of previousexpansions, fast economic growth led to a widening in the current account deficit. Again, we aredifferent this time in that the buoyant domestic demand growth we have experienced over the past yearhas been accompanied by a decline in the current account deficit.Of course, I have only listed domestic factors that give rise to imbalances and imperil the expansion.As I said earlier in my introduction, the world economy plays an equally important role, but we haveno control, or even influence, over that. It is possible to construct disaster scenarios for the worldeconomy, and no doubt some will, but I am comfortable sticking with the majority in assuming amodest slowdown in world growth or, in current parlance, a soft landing.No two economic expansions are the same; each of the previous ones differed, and the present one hasits own unique features. As a result, we cannot rely only on cyclical comparisons such as I have justpresented, but they are a helpful part of any overall assessment. A second approach, which I think is auseful reality check, is to look at how the present setting of policies is affecting the economy.1“Managing the Expansion”, Address to the Economic Society of Australia (Victorian Branch), Melbourne, 11 February2000.
BIS Review 114/20004On monetary policy, there is a tendency for attention to be focussed on changes in interest rates, evenwhen each change is quite small. It is at least as important to look at the level of interest rates innominal and real terms, and ask whether their present setting involves a significant risk that theeconomy will overheat or contract. As you know, a year ago we thought that the continuation of thethen setting of interest rates would risk the former outcome. That is why we moved to our presentsetting, which we would characterise as being in the neutral zone, i.e. not presenting either of the tworisks to any substantial extent. Because it is in this zone, there is no overwhelming case to move it in aparticular direction at present. Overall, the main point for present purposes is that you could not claimthat the current setting of interest rates is inhibiting the growth of the economy.Another important influence on the economy which is often put under the heading of monetary policyis the level of the exchange rate. I do not wish to spend much time on this subject today because Idevoted a whole speech to it less than a month ago.2 Suffice to say that I do not think there is anyonewho would deny that the current level of the Australian dollar makes our exporting and import-competing industries super-competitive, and hence it is exerting an expansionary influence on theeconomy.On fiscal policy, the need to more than compensate consumers for the imposition of the GST ensuredthat it moved in an expansionary direction between last financial year and the present one. Again, Ithink we can all agree that, even though the budgetary position will remain in surplus for medium-term purposes, the current stance of fiscal policy is not imposing a contractionary influence on theeconomy.Overall, therefore, I conclude that because the economy has not developed the imbalances of the past,it has not been necessary to attempt to remedy them with the sort of counter measures in the fiscal andmonetary areas that were often needed in the past. This is another way of saying that we have, in myopinion, avoided the boom-bust cycle in economic policy, and hence have an excellent outlook for thecoming year.I have no further comments to make on the economy at this stage, but will be happy to answer yourquestions. The only other point I would like to make concerns the economics of banking. In the past,we have often provided to the Committee a paper on some banking subject, such as bank margins orbank fees and charges. On this occasion, there is no special paper, but we have recently finished amajor study, in conjunction with the ACCC, on interchange fees in credit and debit card schemes. Wewill be happy to answer any questions on that study.2“Recent Influences on the Exchange Rate”, Address to CEDA Annual General Meeting Dinner, Melbourne, 9 November2000.
1BIS Review 113/2000Roger W Ferguson: Technology, Macroeconomics,and Monetary Policy in the United StatesRemarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York on 6 December 2000.*      *      *Thank you for inviting me to the Presidential Colloquium at Rochester Institute of Technology. This isa particularly appropriate place to discuss the effects of technological change on the economy andsome of the implications for monetary policy. As always, the views I will be expressing are my ownand are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal OpenMarket Committee.Let me start with a brief review of the extraordinary performance of the U.S. economy over the pastfive years. Since 1995, real gross domestic product has grown, on average, more than 4-1/2 percentper year. This pace is significantly above that in the previous five years, and you have to go back tothe 1960s to find even closely comparable periods of consistently robust economic expansion. In thisenvironment, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 percent, and the underlying rate of price inflationhas slowed, on net, despite very high rates of resource utilization. Even the most optimistic offorecasters could not have anticipated such a favorable confluence of economic events.Productivity Growth and Cost ReductionsSo, what happened? As a policymaker, I’d like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscalpolicies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals of achieving price stability andreining in deficit spending--played some role in creating economic conditions that fosterednon-inflationary economic growth. Our economy has also benefited from past actions by thegovernment to deregulate industries. The removal of unnecessary government regulation started morethan twenty years ago during the Administration of President Ford and gathered momentum during theCarter years. It has altered the business landscape by allowing, indeed forcing, businesses to focusmore clearly on a more competitive marketplace with fewer constraints and increased flexibility.But the dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the rate of productivitygrowth: Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector--a conventional measure of productivity--hasincreased at an annual rate of almost 3 percent since 1995, well above the pace earlier in the decade.Cyclical forces such as the inability of businesses to add to their payrolls as rapidly as they would haveliked in response to the rise in demand have probably played some role in these efficiency gains. But Isuspect that longer-term, structural changes, reflecting the boom in capital spending and the revolutionin information technology, probably have been more important. Let me turn to the evidence on thispoint.Technology Change and Productivity GrowthBob Solow--the MIT economist who won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on the theory ofeconomic growth--once quipped that you can see computers everywhere except in the productivitystatistics. A few years ago that situation began to change, and we now have strong evidence that thefaster productivity growth our economy has experienced is in fact due partly to newer technologies.Research by economists Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel of the Federal Reserve Board staff sheds somelight on the sources of this faster productivity growth. About 1/2 percentage point of the increase inproductivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to so-called "capital deepening," mostof which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communicationsequipment. The high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker
BIS Review 113/20002and thereby boosted productivity. Another 1/2 percentage point of the pickup in productivity growthreflected technological innovations in the actual production of computer hardware and semiconductorsas well as better management--perhaps assisted by these high-tech investments--of the nation’s capitaland labor resources. Oliner and Sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of high-techinvestments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995. This researchsupports the view that fundamental changes are underway in our economy.What’s So Special about this Capital?While it is interesting to note that trend productivity has picked up and that high-tech investments arethe source of the acceleration, by now these are not new observations. Perhaps at this stage it is moreuseful to explore more deeply this positive "shock" to the ability of our economy to produce goods andservices. What is so special about computers and other information technologies that they can havesuch an impact on our economy?Let me highlight three special characteristics of high-tech equipment. First, computers andcommunications equipment depreciate at a very rapid pace. The current best estimate is that computersprobably depreciate about 30 percent annually, although that estimate might be low, while otherequipment probably depreciates at a rate of less than 15 percent annually. Therefore, computers areretired, on average, after three years, and the useful life for other equipment is about seven years.Firms must invest in computers at a faster rate than that for other forms of capital just to maintain agiven level of the capital stock. The rapid replacement of high-tech capital means that technologicalprogress becomes "embodied" in the capital stock at a faster rate than is the case for longer-livedassets.The second feature of high-tech equipment that sets it apart from other classes of capital is thesensitivity of its demand to fluctuations in the cost of capital. Economists have debated for decadesabout the magnitude of cost-of-capital effects on traditional capital goods. A past consensus was thatthere probably was a cost-of-capital effect but that it was small and very difficult to identifyempirically. A somewhat different conclusion has arisen lately when the same basic models ofinvestment are applied to spending on computers alone. The latest research shows that computers arequite sensitive to movements in the cost of capital, and as a result of the 20 percent per annum declinein relative computer prices, the cost of this type of capital fell rapidly in the past decade. Thiscombination of a high price elasticity and a rapidly declining price led to the boom in high-techinvestment.A third characteristic of high-tech investment is the magnitude of "external" or "spillover" effects thatit generates. High-tech equipment generates benefits not only to the owner of the machine but to otheragents in the economy as well. I am thinking in particular about so-called network effects--that is,linking computers together makes possible larger productivity gains than do computers operated asstand-alone units. Although difficult to measure, such network effects certainly have stimulated thedemand for high-tech equipment and have helped to speed up the dispersion of new technologies.Supporting Structural ChangesThe technological changes inspired by investments in computers have enhanced the ability ofbusinesses to reduce their operating expenses. In many industries, investments in informationtechnologies have helped firms to cut back on the volume of inventories that they hold as a precautionagainst glitches in their supply chain or as a hedge against unexpected increases in aggregate demand.Product development costs have probably also been reduced through the use of better computerhardware and software, and new communications technologies have increased the speed with whichfirms can share information--both internally and with their customers and suppliers.This is the intersection of macroeconomics and management. Many business observers now believethat these newer technologies are not only reducing the cost of transforming inputs into outputs butalso decreasing "interaction costs," the costs incurred in getting different people and companies to
3BIS Review 113/2000work together to exchange goods and services. Obviously, the line between "transformation" and"interaction" is not clear, but consultants who have studied this topic believe that these interactioncosts account for 55 percent of all labor costs, with some industries, such as financial services,estimated to have interaction costs as high as 70 percent of labor costs. I cannot verify these numbers,but the general concept seems useful.Largely as a result of the increase in productivity in the recent past, we have experienced a remarkablestability in unit labor costs. During the past five and a half years, unit labor costs for nonfinancialcorporations, which are the most accurately measured, increased an average of 0.2 percent at an annualrate. This compares quite favorably with the experience in the preceding ten years of a 2.2 percentannual rate of increase. If in fact "interactions" account for 55 percent of labor costs, this relatively flattrend in unit labor cost increases is consistent with the concept that the newer technologies areallowing easier, less labor-intensive, interactions. Importantly, given the high rate of depreciation andthe steep declines in costs of high-tech equipment, these savings in unit labor costs are not beingundermined by offsetting increases in unit nonlabor costs.Moreover, given intense competition and the resultant lack of pricing "leverage," ongoing programs toreduce costs have become a key part of corporate strategies to maintain or improve profit margins. Thefocus on cost reduction has worked to head off the development of inflationary pressures in thisexpansion.The Future Path for Productivity ImprovementsBut technological waves ebb and flow, and it is natural to ask whether we can count on such rapidproductivity growth in the future. On this score, I am cautiously optimistic, but I recognize both thatforecasting technology is extremely difficult and that there will be occasional bumps in the road. Letme explain my reasons for caution and optimism.The risk that productivity growth might moderate centers on the high-tech sector, computers andcommunications equipment, and the associated relative price declines. Historical patterns suggest thatsuch narrowly based productivity increases might not continue, and therefore caution is in order.However, there are two reasons to be optimistic. First, the recent burst in productivity growth seems tobe more a product of changing technology than of transient business cycle influences, and as a result,there is less chance of a "payback period" of particularly sluggish productivity growth. Second,computer industry experts, including those in the semiconductor industry, do not indicate that theindustry has exhausted its potential to produce faster and cheaper computers. Similarly, businessleaders suggest that they are still taking advantage of the advances in computing power at lower coststo find new and productive uses of newer technologies.The Macroeconomic Implications of Faster Productivity GrowthTheory teaches us that the step-up in the growth rate of technological change certainly has importantimplications for economic activity and inflation. The main reason policymakers and economists areinterested in the growth rate of productivity is that it helps us to understand the economy’s potential tosupply goods and services. The effects on the economy’s ability to produce goods and services areclear, but theory predicts that a new higher level of productivity growth would also affect the demandfor goods and services. The most immediate effects would be on capital investment, as we have seen.A more rapid pace of technological change raises the real rate of return on new investments--perhapssignificantly. Put another way, a more rapid pace of technological change makes investments in capitalgoods embodying the new technology more profitable. When businesses recognize the newtechnological possibilities, capital spending accelerates to take advantage of the new profitopportunities.The employment and income generated by business spending on capital goods boosts consumerspending and sets off another round of investment spending. Typically referred to by economists as"multiplier-accelerator" effects, such processes would continue as long as the real rate of return on a
BIS Review 113/20004new capital project exceeded the real cost for capital for that project. Through this process, aninnovation on the supply side of the economy generates a comparable increase in aggregate demand.It is important to emphasize that higher productivity growth translates into higher real income growthfor employees. This added income is seen most clearly in the higher wages paid to that growingnumber of workers whose cash compensation is tied to company performance. In addition, for thoseworkers who have been granted stock options, higher profits today and the potential for furtherincreases tomorrow translates into higher stock prices for their company and ultimately an increase intheir overall compensation. But real incomes should increase even for workers whose compensation isnot directly linked to company performance, as profitable business opportunities bolster the demandfor scarce labor.Theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in thegrowth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates. Marketinterest rates must rise in order to maintain equilibrium between the higher demand for investmentfunds and the supply of investment funds. And, indeed, we have seen that market interest rates,particularly for corporate issuers, have risen steadily for the last year or so. Interestingly, rates ofreturn for forms of capital other than computer equipment, including both structures and non-computerequipment, either have not increased or have not risen as much as the rates of return on their high-techcounterparts. It is therefore possible that, during this period, investment flows have been reallocatedaway from firms producing traditional capital goods and toward firms and industries that makehigh-tech goods and services.This somewhat abstract description of the effects of a step-up in the growth rate of technical changebears a striking resemblance to the developments of recent years in labor markets, prices of goods andservices, capital investments, and fixed-income markets. But there’s still an element missing: the stockmarket. A higher rate of technical change that raises the productivity and hence the profitability ofcapital should elevate the value of equities. Since equity prices reflect market expectations of futurecash flow and dividends, any adjustment in profit expectations can and does lead to a resetting ofequity prices. Are stocks today overvalued, correctly valued, or undervalued? I certainly do not know,and I am not aware of anyone who does. As a result, I believe that it would be unwise--and indeedimpossible--for the Federal Reserve to target specific levels of valuations in equity markets.However, equity markets obviously do have spillover effects on the real economy and, thus, need to beconsidered in assessing the aggregate balance of supply and demand. Given the efficiency andforward-looking nature of financial markets, even expected future technical innovations will have animmediate effect on equity valuations. Equity values, in turn, can influence consumer behavior. Asyou know, economists often speak of the "wealth effect," and econometric modeling indicates thatconsumers eventually tend to raise the level of their spending between 2 and 5 cents for everyincremental dollar of wealth. As a consequence, equity valuations can have a noticeable effect onconsumption and on macroeconomic performance. To put a rough number on these influences,simulations by the Board staff using our econometric model of the economy suggest that wealthgenerated in the equity markets over the last four years added about 1 percentage point to the growthrate of real GDP.Of late, equity markets have given up some of their gains. However, economists who have studied thetopic generally think that an impact of a change in stock market generated wealth on consumptionbegins to build in the first year and may take two to three years to be fully felt.Additionally, equity markets are a source of investment capital, and valuations in the stock market areone determinant of the cost of capital for businesses. External financing conditions, including equityvaluations, are important because recent investments have increasingly been financed from externalsources. External funds raised now account for about 20 percent of nominal capital expenditures--close to the highs of the past two decades.
5BIS Review 113/2000Monetary Policy and the "New" EconomyAs I have said many times before, uncertainty about productivity trends poses a major challenge in thedesign and implementation of monetary policy. As you can imagine, it is very difficult to infer the truestructure of the economy through the interpretation of the twists and turns of incoming economic data.How do we know, for example, if unexpected developments are just temporary movements away fromstable longer-run relationships or are manifestations of changes in the underlying economic structure?In many cases, this judgment is difficult to make with much confidence even considerably after thefact. In the meantime, we must bear in mind that the statistical relationships we work with, embodiedin our econometric models, are only loose approximations of the underlying reality. The considerableuncertainty regarding statistical constructs such as the "natural" rate of unemployment or the"sustainable" rate of growth of the economy suggests, in my judgment, the need to downplay forecastsof inflation based solely on those variables. Some fog always obstructs our vision, but when thestructure of the economy is changing, the fog is considerably denser than at other times.What should be done when such uncertainties seem particularly acute? When we suspect that ourunderstanding of the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated, as evidenced by strings ofsurprises difficult to reconcile with our earlier beliefs, I think that the appropriate response is to relyless upon the future predicted by the increasingly unreliable old models and more upon inferencesfrom the more recent past. That means we should weight incoming data more heavily than data fromdecades past in trying to make judgments about the new economy and, of course, act appropriatelywhen the evidence becomes clear.It also is important to be aware of the potential for unanticipated developments to emerge that mighthave implications for policymaking. The rate of growth of our economy has stepped down from theunsustainable pace of earlier this year. During such a period, potential risks emerge more clearly.First, we must be mindful that an unexpected slowdown might occur in the growth of productivity. AsI said, I am cautiously optimistic that the rapid pace of productivity growth can be extended. However,we now know that an unexpected and unrecognized slowdown in productivity growth occurred in1973. The causes are still debated, but we know that the slowdown contributed to "stagflation," whichemerged as employees demanded increased compensation, based on unrealistically high expectationsof productivity growth and gradually rising inflation expectations, and employers granted thoseincreases. To maintain profit margins, businesses then passed on those cost increases through toprices. This passthrough occurred as the rate of growth in the economy subsided. This is the reverse ofthe good news that we have experienced in this expansion.The second risk to good performance is that the investment boom, at least in some sectors, mayovershoot. We are not only in the longest expansion in the history of our nation but also in the longestinvestment boom. Expectations of future returns from capital may not materialize, and companies mayfind that they have over-invested in capital stock. Other investment booms have ended with a pullbackin investment that has slowed growth sharply, and we should be mindful that such an outcome is notimpossible. Indeed, the recent releveling of the stock prices of some high-tech companies may suggestthat we are entering a period of reduced optimism about future profits and less rapid growth inbusiness investment.The third risk is that the capital inflows from abroad that have been funding our domestic investmentsmay dry up. The elevated stock market has reduced household savings. Net government saving hasincreased greatly, in the form of the surplus at the federal, state, and local levels, but as a nation wealso rely on capital inflows from overseas. Capital inflows, as you know, are the counterpart of ourrecord current account deficit. The gap between domestic savings and investment is large andgrowing, and if the inflow of foreign capital reversed suddenly, the consequences for our economywould be noticeable.A fourth risk arises from ongoing adjustments in financial markets to the perception of a riskiereconomic environment. Over the course of this year, commercial banks have tightened their lendingstandards, and quality spreads have increased in the bond market--especially in the high-yield sector.Activity in the IPO market has subsided as equity investors have turned away from riskier ventures.Taking into account also the decline in equity prices since the spring and the rise in the foreign
BIS Review 113/20006exchange value of the dollar, financial markets are imposing more restraint on the economy than theyhave in recent years. A reassessment of risks is a natural and desirable byproduct of financial marketadjustments, and of returning to more sustainable economic conditions. There is always a danger,however, that participants will overreact in such a period of adjustment.I do not today see such an overreaction, but we have to be aware that markets have turned excessivelypessimistic in the past, with negative effects on economic activity. Similarly, although investmentgrowth appears to have slowed, it is still rapid by historical standards and the dollar remains firm.Thus, I do not see, at this stage, evidence of a marked drop off in investment or of a sudden reversal incapital flows. However, it is prudent to be mindful of these risks in this transition period.ConclusionIn conclusion, let me remind you that, while these are challenging times for monetary policymakersand financial market participants, the U.S. economy is enjoying a period of unprecedented prosperity.Our job at the Federal Reserve is to do our utmost to produce a stable economic environment ofmaximum sustainable growth without inflation so that these trends can continue. To produce such anenvironment we must be equally vigilant against the risk of either an extended period of growthunacceptably below potential, or a resurgence of inflation.
1BIS Review 112/2000Padraid McGowan, Ireland - experiences in EMUPresentation by Mr Padraig McGowan, Director General of the Central Bank of Ireland, at the CentralBank of Iceland on 7th December 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen, let me begin by thanking you for inviting me to speak here today. It is a greatpleasure for me to have this opportunity to discuss the recent performance of the Irish economy aswell as some of the challenges for Ireland which participation in Economic and Monetary Union(EMU) presents.Economic performance since 1994The performance of the Irish economy in recent years has been excellent, both in historical terms andby international standards. Since 1994, the economy has expanded at an annual average rate of around8%. Expressed another way, output at the end of 2000 will be around 70% higher in real terms than atthe beginning of the current phase of strong growth. To put this into perspective, the annual growthrate of the Irish economy averaged around 3½% between 1960 and 1993.The buoyant economic conditions of recent years have facilitated a significant improvement in livingstandards - as measured by GDP per capita - relative to the EU average. In Ireland’s case, however,GNP per capita - around 85% of per capita GDP - is a more appropriate measure of domestic livingstandards, given the large profit repatriations of foreign-owned multinational corporations whose scaleof operations in Ireland has expanded significantly in recent years. On this measure, income per capita,although rising, remains somewhat below the EU average. In addition, the stock of wealth in Irelandremains below the EU norm.This strong growth has paid large dividends in the labour market - traditionally Ireland’s Achilles’heel. For many years, Ireland’s employment performance had been quite anaemic, with manycommentators characterising the economic situation as being one of “jobless growth”. Totalemployment actually fell during the 1980s. Since 1994, however, strong economic growth has beenassociated with employment increases of around 4¾% per annum. In overall terms, employment isnow almost 40% higher than in 1994. This large increase in employment has been facilitated bytransfers from unemployment into employment as well as a significant increase in the size of thelabour force. The latter reflects the increase in the population of working age, increased participationand net inward migration. This has resulted in the employment rate for the active populationincreasing by around one-quarter between 1994 and this year.Unemployment has fallen below 4% and, while precise estimates are difficult to pin down, it is nowclear that the economy is operating at or very close to full-employment. For an economy with a longhistory of unemployment problems, the virtual attainment of full-employment is the most encouragingfeature of the recent economic performance. With sustained strong labour demand, the level of long-term unemployment, i.e. unemployed for one year or longer, has fallen dramatically since 1997 to1.4% at present. Involuntary emigration - for so long a symbol of Ireland’s dismal economicperformance - has been eliminated and, for a number of years now, Ireland has experienced net inwardmigration. Since 1994, the population has expanded by around 1% per annum, with net inflows -returning migrants and others - accounting for about two-fifths of this increase.The transformation of the economy which has led to a higher level of economic activity has alsoresulted in a reversal of fortunes for the public finances. A surplus has been recorded since 1997 andthis year, a general government surplus of 3.7% of GDP is currently expected. The improved fiscalposition and the increase in output have resulted in a decline in the ratio of debt to GDP, to around41.5% this year, one of the lowest ratios in the EU. With the increase in output experienced in recent
BIS Review 112/20002years and with nominal interest rates relatively low by international standards, the burden of debt hasfallen significantly.These favourable developments have given rise to a range of issues, some of which are new to us. Therate of inflation has picked up significantly, there are increasing labour market pressures, and a widerange of asset prices have been increasing very substantially for some years. This has been associatedwith a rapid increase in bank lending and an accompanying increase in private sector indebtedness. Inaddition, a considerable infrastructural deficit has emerged which has implications not just foreconomic development but for the quality of life in Ireland. With Ireland’s participation in EMU,monetary policy cannot be used to deal with these developments. I will return to these issues later.Recent Indicators of Economic Performance a1994199519961997199819992000 (f) cGNP6.38.27.49.37.87.88½GNP per capita6.07.76.68.36.66.77¼Employment b3.25.03.63.96.86.34¾Unemployment b14.712.211.910.37.85.64½Inflation (CPI)2.42.51.61.52.41.65½Exports/GNP78.886.387.690.798.9102.4107.0General Gov.

This necessitated arestructuring of the economy and the inevitable demise of some firms and sectors which haddeveloped behind sometimes quite high tariff barriers. Membership of the then European EconomicCommunity in 1973 was a major milestone on this road. However, given the point from which Irelandwas starting in 1973, it was evident that the advent of free trade resulting from membership wouldbring major changes to the trading relations and structure of the Irish economy. Prior to membership,Ireland had a relatively large agricultural sector, which was highly dependent on the adjacent UKmarket. Industry was predominantly small-scale, and was still in the process of adjusting to thelowering of tariff barriers to improve competition and to the adoption of a more export-orientedperspective. In this environment, productivity and living standards were relatively low.

The traditional sectors - typically relatively low skilled relying on local inputs - have declined inrelative importance, and have been replaced by high-technology, largely foreign-owned firms insectors such as computer hardware, chemicals, software and medical instruments. Currently, thesemodern sub-sectors account for almost three-quarters of output and around one-third of employment inthe manufacturing sector. The structural changes in the economy have also been associated withsubstantial change in the destination of exports, mainly from the UK to the rest of the EU.Destination of Total Exports: Percentage Distribution1970198019901999UK66433422Other EU a9324143Elsewhere (Including USA)25252535(a) Countries comprising EEC/EC/EU in the relevant years.Source: Central Statistics Office.Foreign direct investmentThere are a number of factors that lie behind this transformation of industry. First, the regulatoryenvironment for setting up and running businesses in Ireland has been relatively light. Secondly, anemphasis was placed on the rapid modernisation of the telecommunications infrastructure. Finally, andmost importantly, has been the successful industrial policy of encouraging inward foreign directinvestment. A wide range of measures have been used to attract foreign firms to Ireland. These includea low corporate tax environment, the development of the educational and technical skills of theworkforce, a relatively low cost environment and the opportunity to use Ireland as a gateway to thevast EU market.Traditionally, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland has typically taken the form of “greenfield”investment as well as expansions of existing plants. This has had a greater direct impact on output andemployment than would have been the case if it had taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. Inaddition, foreign direct investment has helped to transfer technology, skills and modern managementmethods in a relatively easy way to the Irish economy. The high-technology sectors have imparted a
BIS Review 112/20004new dynamism to business, and have led to a large number of start-ups by former employees of theseforeign-owned enterprises - the software industry being perhaps the best example. It should also bestated that, although there has been a sizeable shake-up of domestically-owned industry in the newfree-trade environment, much of domestically-owned industry has been radically modernised and puton a sound, efficient footing.US Direct Investment Abroad: Irish Percentage Share of EU Total19941995199619971998Manufacturing8.42.910.915.07.0of which:Chemicals6.92.413.017.315.4Electrical & Electronics7.65.418.033.239.2Source: US Department of Commerce.A significant proportion of FDI inflows into Ireland originates in the United States: in 1998, 41% ofall foreign-owned manufacturing firms in Ireland were from the US. Between 1994 and 1998, annualinflows of manufacturing FDI from the US amounted to around 1½% of Irish GDP. Indeed, Irelandreceives a large share of all US FDI. For example, in 1998, Ireland received 7% of all USmanufacturing inflows into the EU, a not insignificant proportion for a country with around 1% of theEU GDP.The success which various foreign multinationals have enjoyed has encouraged others to establishmanufacturing bases in Ireland. As a result, agglomeration economies have developed over time:success has bred success. In more recent years, the manufacturing economy has benefited from what isknown as “distance independence” - transports costs as a percentage of output value have fallensubstantially for high-technology outputs such as software and chemicals. This has significantlyreduced Ireland’s peripheral location disadvantage.A number of implications arise from this policy of targeting high-technology FDI. Firstly, a sharpdichotomy has emerged within the industrial sector between the relatively low value-added traditionalsector which produces largely for the domestic and UK markets, and the more dynamic higher value-added technology sector, which produces primarily for the rest of the EU and US markets. Thisdichotomy is most apparent in the productivity data, with the high-technology sector being anestimated five times more productive than the traditional sector. Secondly, in Ireland, the relativeimportance of the industrial sector has been rising in recent years, albeit at a moderate rate. Thissituation contrasts strongly with the experience of other advanced economies, where the industrialsector has been in relative decline for some time.EU financial supportI should also mention that the various financial support mechanisms of the European Union - theStructural Funds and the Cohesion Funds - have been of assistance in adapting to the new economicstructures and in financing infrastructural development. These supports have averaged around 2¼% ofGDP since 1989, and have been in relative decline during the past six to seven years of strongeconomic growth. Indeed, it has been argued that the impact of the structural fund process on theadministrative and political system has been at least as important as the investment itself. In particular,transfers under the Community Support Framework encouraged the government to raise publicinvestment from its extremely low level in the 1980s. Finally, transfers to the agricultural sector underthe Common Agricultural Policy, which have averaged 3½% of GDP since 1989, have providedprotection to the farming sector from global trends.
5BIS Review 112/2000Experience in the EU single marketThe full implication of the EU single market by the end of 1992 was regarded with some trepidation, ithas to be acknowledged, by a number of commentators on the Irish economy, when this EU initiativewas taken in the mid-1980s. This centered around a concern that the core countries of the EU wouldreap most of the benefits of the new single market, with the countries on the periphery running the riskof becoming economic backwaters. These fears focused on the possibility that positive externalitiesand increasing returns to scale were most likely to be available to the developed, industrial core of theEU. Industries that are characterised by increasing returns to scale - motor vehicles, heavy chemicals,man-made fibres etc. - were deeply embedded in the economies of the countries at the centre of theEU, but were of little significance in most of the peripheral countries such as Ireland. In this view, thedeveloped regions of the EU would therefore benefit from first mover advantage.The counter-argument pointed to the benefits that could accrue to small countries from the much largermarket. Even if, for historical reasons, small countries did not have many sectors characterised byincreasing returns to scale, the opportunity existed for these to operate at an efficient scale in the newlarge single EU market. The removal of barriers to trade and lower transport costs also reduced thenecessity for industry to be located close to the largest markets. Thirdly, less developed regions in theEU were normally characterised by lower costs, and this, ceteris paribus, placed them at an advantagein the development of new sectors and enterprises. Finally, it was evident that the location of newknowledge–based industries characterised by innovation and technology was much less tied tocomparative advantage based on natural endowments. Comparative advantage in these sectors wassomething that could be created and acquired in the right institutional and policy environment. In theevent, the worst fears of the pessimists in the argument of the periphery vis-à-vis the centre have notbeen realised, with the experience of peripheral regions in the single EU market, including Ireland,being generally satisfactory.Ireland and the single monetary policyIreland adopted the euro at its inception in January 1999 and became part of a large monetary union.This was not something fundamentally new in Ireland, however, as until 1979 Ireland had participatedin a currency area with sterling for over one hundred and fifty years previously; the Irish currency andsterling were amalgamated at parity in 1826. With the introduction of the Irish pound in the late 1920s,there was a no-margins one-for-one link between the Irish pound and sterling which prevailed until1979. Coupled with complete freedom of capital mobility, this resulted in virtually the same levels ofinterest rates in Ireland and the UK. Given the high degree of trade integration as well as capital andlabour mobility which existed during this period, it could be argued that this exchange rate regime wasan entirely natural phenomenon; in this regard, Ireland and the UK could have been regarded as anoptimum currency area.In the mid-1970s, the link with sterling began to be questioned following persistent high inflation ratesin the UK coupled with a significant depreciation of sterling which inevitably resulted in broadlysimilar rates of inflation in Ireland. The establishment of the European Monetary System (EMS) - withits primary objective of being a “zone of monetary stability” - provided an alternative to the sterlinglink. Ireland joined the EMS at its inception in 1979, and the link with sterling ended shortlyafterwards as sterling rose against EMS currencies.The experience in the EMS has not always been positive, particularly in the early years, with asizeable appreciation of sterling and the pursuit of pro-cyclical fiscal policies which underminedstability. In August 1986, the Irish pound was devalued by 8%, in part to reverse an unwarrantedappreciation of the Irish pound’s effective exchange rate that had occurred mainly due to a sharpweakening of sterling. For over a decade thereafter, the nominal effective exchange rate for the Irishpound was generally stable, apart from the 10% devaluation in January 1993. This devaluation, in thecontext of the European currency crisis of 1992/1993, was again partly correcting an unwarrantedappreciation in the Autumn of 1992. This was an example of where Ireland was affected by contagionin the international foreign exchange markets.
BIS Review 112/20006From 1994, the Irish economy began to grow strongly. During this period, economic policy wasprimarily driven by the need to meet the criteria for EMU membership. Policies of fiscal prudencewere continued while exchange rate policy was consistent with price stability. In the two years prior tomembership of the euro area the Irish pound was relatively strong. This was consolidated by a 3%revaluation of the Irish pound in the EMS in March 1998.Benefits of EMUIn a small open economy with a high degree of trade integration into the EU and world economies, itis logical for Ireland to be amongst the keenest supporters of EMU. A small economy such as Ireland,which exports a significant part of its output to other participating countries, should stand to derivesignificant benefit. Secondly, the prospect of monetary stability will have a long-term beneficialimpact on investment and growth. Over time, in accordance with the price stability mandate of theECB, inflation is unlikely to exceed 2% per annum for any sustained period of time. As a result,nominal interest rates should not, in general, carry a significant inflation risk premium. In addition,EMU imposes a discipline on participating countries, in the sense that sound fiscal policies andenhanced structural reform assume greater importance in a monetary union. Finally, some positiveeffects resulting from the single currency will become evident in capital and financial markets. Overtime, for example, the development of deep and liquid capital markets will improve the potential forcompanies to raise finance. This will enhance the growth prospects of younger firms, in particular;these are typically innovating firms which bring new technologies to the market. In addition, theincreased efficiency and competitiveness of financial markets in the euro area will facilitate anincrease in corporate restructuring through mergers and acquisitions activity. On the latter point, thereis evidence that this process is already underway.Implications for policy of joining the euro areaFrom an Irish macroeconomic perspective, however, the initial impact of the adoption of the singlecurrency on 1 January 1999 was a significant easing of monetary conditions. While the decline innominal interest rates had for the most part been discounted, subsequent developments in relation toreal interest rates - in the light of Ireland’s higher inflation rate - have led to a further easing ofmonetary conditions. This has been compounded by the decline in the external value of the euro. Thiseasing of monetary conditions has occurred at a time when the Irish economy is performing very wellcompared to the central euro area countries, with strong domestic demand in particular giving rise tosignificant risks of overheating in the economy. With monetary policy now geared towards theobjective of price stability for the euro area as a whole, it cannot be deployed to meet region-specificrequirements. The corollary of this is that, in order to cope with regional or country-specificdifficulties, policies other than the single monetary policy must be employed more vigorously.Fiscal policyIn particular, fiscal policy must assume a greater role in restoring macroeconomic balance. WithinEMU, fiscal policy must be conducted within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, whichrequires the national authorities to ensure that their budget balances are “close to balance or insurplus” over the medium-term. The reason for this is to limit negative externalities resulting from laxfiscal policy by individual countries within the single currency.For Ireland, it is arguably the case that fiscal policy is now more effective than in the past. With bothinterest and exchange rates now given, the effects of fiscal policy are no longer likely to “crowd out”or “crowd in” private sector consumption and investment. In these circumstances, fiscal policy is arelevant policy instrument for Ireland. Despite this, the impact of fiscal policy is subject to a numberof limiting criteria. Firstly, given the high degree of openness of the Irish economy, it is inevitable thatat least part of the impact of fiscal policy will be reflected in external trade developments rather thanin domestic activity. Secondly, given the large exchequer surpluses which have been recorded forsome time now, expectations may impose some constraint on a tighter fiscal policy stance. Finally,
7BIS Review 112/2000given the consensus-based approach to macroeconomic determination, the stance of fiscal policy is, atleast to some extent, somewhat pre-empted in Ireland by commitments made under national wageagreements.Incomes determinationThe evolution of pay in Ireland has been conducted within a partnership framework, encompassinggovernment, employers and unions since 1987, with the first agreement applying from the beginningof 1988. The current agreement - Programme for Prosperity and Fairness - is the fifth suchagreement. The pay terms typically involve a three-year process in which unions accept moderatenominal wage increases in return for income tax reductions. Indeed, these reductions in income taxeshave delivered a not insignificant part of the increase in take-home pay.National agreements were undoubtedly an important feature in restoring confidence andcompetitiveness in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The moderate evolution of nominal pay created avirtuous cycle in which the economy’s competitiveness improved and total employment rose. As Ioutlined earlier, the public finances were put on a more stable footing while, over time, the income taxburden was reduced significantly. In 1988, the standard and higher rates of income tax were 35 and58% respectively; for the tax year which began in April 2000, the corresponding rates are 22 and 44%,and the income level at which the higher rate in particular is applied has been increased significantly.More recently, the usefulness of national wage agreements in an environment of virtually fullemployment has been questioned. The fact that, at present, the wage agreements apply formally toonly around one-third of workers, many of whom are in the public sector, is encouraging thisquestioning.However, for a small open economy where competitiveness is extremely important, one should bewary about dismissing the partnership process. In particular, given the recent acceleration in headlineinflation, the partnership approach may have an important role to play in preventing inflationaryexpectations becoming entrenched in the decision making process and the emergence of a wage-pricespiral. Such an adverse eventuality could set the conditions for a serious loss of competitiveness in thefuture, particularly if exacerbated by a significant strengthening of the euro.Structural reform and competition policyStructural reform is another tool available to policymakers in EMU, although, by definition, thebenefits of any reforms will be limited in the short-term. Nevertheless, policies aimed at improving thefunctioning of both product and factor markets can enhance the business environment and increase theflexibility of markets in the medium-term. Such reforms play an important role in meeting theeconomic objectives of higher growth and employment without creating inflationary pressures, and asa result, in delivering higher living standards.Some reform of markets has been undertaken in recent years. The labour market is one area whereflexibility has been improved. For example, income tax reforms have enhanced incentives in recentyears, while labour market legislation in Ireland is somewhat lighter than elsewhere in the EU. Inproduct markets, the process of liberalisation has been speeded up. In particular, markets which havetraditionally been under direct control of government have undergone significant reform: thetelecommunications sector, for example, has been fully liberalised and this is already having afavourable impact on prices. Elsewhere, however, the pace of reform has been slower, with barriers toentry, in particular, remaining a feature of a number of markets.Prudential standards in the financial sectorThe fourth strand in the range of policies that can be employed in EMU relates to the maintenance of asound financial sector. In Ireland, the Central Bank is responsible for supervision of almost the entirefinancial sector, apart from insurance companies. In particular, credit institutions are required toconform to a wide range of standards that have been agreed at BIS and EU Commission levels. Whatis of importance for us at present is that credit institutions are constrained from over-extending their
BIS Review 112/20008lending to individual, or a group of related, economic sectors. This limits the risk, for example, of anundue concentration of lending to the broad property sector, which has frequently been subject tobooms and busts in many countries, with consequential problems for the solvency of the financialsector.The Central Bank has been active in alerting banks to the risks posed by rapid overall and property-related lending. As part of this process, banks have been required to conduct regular stress tests toassess how fitted they are to cope with various types of shocks including a catastrophic fall in propertyprices. The results of tests so far suggest a high degree of resilience to such adverse developments.Earlier this year, Ireland participated in the World Bank - IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program(FSAP). This entailed an assessment of financial sector vulnerabilities and of the observance andimplementation of supervisory standards and best practices. The FSAP found that Ireland had a soundand highly developed financial system that has been very stable even during periods of internationalturmoil. Banking sector capitalisation and asset quality are high, and profitability levels are higherthan for most European competitors. The assessment also found that the overall framework ofprudential regulation and supervision in the Central Bank is well developed, and shows a high degreeof observation of international standards and codes. The review noted that current developments -financial sector innovation, increased competition, increased cross-border activities associated withDublin’s International Financial Services Centre and sustained rapid credit growth - pose aconsiderable challenge to market participants and supervisors to maintain Ireland’s record of financialstability.In summary, Ireland is now participating in a single currency where monetary conditions are set interms of requirements for the euro area as a whole. Individual countries must operate within thiscontext. This may not always be appropriate to their specific needs. As outlined above, policy-makershave a number of instruments available to tackle macroeconomic imbalances and to respond moreefficiently to regional-specific shocks that will inevitably occur from time-to-time. The effective useof these tools should minimise the impact on the economy of the loss of monetary and exchange ratepolicy.Current problems and issuesAs I mentioned earlier, the greatest challenge within EMU is to steer the economy onto a moresustainable growth path after having experienced very strong growth over the last seven years. Thiswill be no easy task given that imbalances have already begun to manifest themselves.InflationPerhaps the most visible example of current problems is the acceleration in headline inflation whichhas occurred over the last twelve months or so. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) hasaccelerated from its most recent low-point of 1.8% in mid-1999 to the current rate of 6.0%. Whilesome of this increase reflects temporary factors such as indirect tax changes, general inflationarypressures have been evident for some time. The headline rate in Ireland is around 3¼ percentagepoints higher than the comparable rate for the euro area as a whole. It is estimated that, in the contextof the decline of the euro in the foreign exchange markets, the greater exposure of the Irish economyto non-euro currencies accounts for around ½ of a percentage point of this difference. In addition,approximately 1 percentage point can be explained by higher productivity growth in the traded sectorrelative to the non-traded sector. This results in higher wages in the non-traded sector, which whencombined with lower productivity growth in this sector, leads to upward pressure on prices. Takingaccount of these factors implies that the remaining inflation differential vis-à-vis the euro area is about1¾ percentage points. About ¾ percentage points of this is due to Irish indirect tax increases, with theremainder largely attributable to the strength of domestic demand in Ireland.

The virtualattainment of full employment, with the resulting transfer of bargaining power from employer toemployee, has put upward pressure on wages in all sectors. While rising wage levels may ultimatelybe one of the mechanisms which will slow the economy, there is a risk that wage developments arebeing driven by expectations based on the exceptional growth of the recent past. In this context, wagesettlements must recognise the inevitability of a reduction in growth to a more sustainable rate, as wellas the openness of the economy which increases its exposure to external developments. At present,firms in Ireland, particularly those in the indigenous sector, are benefiting from the decline in the valueof the euro against sterling. In this environment, wage increases which were compounded by anysignificant appreciation of the euro could impose serious competitiveness difficulties on these firms.InfrastructureThe strains on the economy’s infrastructure - most notably transportation and housing - have beenevident for some time. In more developed countries, economic development was, generally speaking, amore gradual process. This facilitated improvements in the physical infrastructure to be undertaken intandem with economic growth. In Ireland, infrastructural developments have been unable to match theintensity of economic growth which has occurred over a relatively short period of time, so thatbottlenecks have emerged. In an effort to reduce the infrastructural deficit, the Government hasinitiated a programme of significantly increased expenditure as part of the National Development Plan.However, since the construction sector is already operating at full capacity, it will be some time beforethe benefits of this are visible.Diversification/exposure to sector shocksBy definition, it is difficult for small open economies to ensure a high degree of diversification. As aresult, a shock affecting one sector can have implications for the economy as a whole. In Ireland’scase, it is useful to focus on the two very distinct broad sectors in the economy. The first comprises theindigenous manufacturing sector as well as parts of the agricultural sector. These sectors remain quitedependent on the UK market and are exposed to euro/sterling exchange rate developments.Particularly severe trading conditions could arise if an acceleration of wages in this sector wascompounded by a sudden, significant rise in the euro against sterling. Secondly, parts of the high-technology sector remain particularly exposed to developments in the world economy and the US inparticular. An insight into this exposure is obtained from the fact that, in 1999, ten foreign-ownedenterprises accounted for over one-third of total exports of goods and services.
BIS Review 112/200010Asset price increasesIn the housing market, the rate of increase of prices accelerated sharply in 1996, and with very highannual growth rates being recorded since then, house prices have more than doubled. A number offactors have contributed to this. The demand for housing has risen substantially. This reflectsfundamental factors such as the rise in the population in the household formation age group,significantly higher employment and rising disposable income levels. In addition, the expectation -and now the reality - of lower interest rates resulting from EMU participation have contributed to thesharp increase in prices. On the other hand, the response of supply until recently was quite sluggish.Over the last year or so, however, there has been a significant increase in output, so that somemoderation in the rate of house price inflation is expected.Property Prices: Annual Percentage IncreasesResidential aCommercial bRents c19944.17.62.319957.24.21.8199611.811.18.2199717.217.010.6199822.632.114.6199918.523.816.12000 d13.921.616.2(a) Department of Environment and Local Government, National New House Prices.(b) Jones Lang LaSalle, Capital Values.(c) Jones Lang LaSalle, Rental Value for Irish Commercial Property.(d) Jan.-Sept. 2000, year-on-year.Commercial property prices have followed broadly similar trends to residential property prices withthe rate of increase accelerating from 1996 onwards. Since then, prices have risen by 113%. The rateof increase in rents in the commercial property sector also accelerated in 1996, and while still strong,the cumulative rate of increase has been somewhat lower than for commercial property prices. Theseincreases reflect very low vacancy rates, low nominal interest rates and a high level of businessconfidence.Associated with this acceleration in residential and commercial property prices, and perhaps to someextent driving it, has been a large rise in bank lending. Personal sector credit, which is dominated byresidential mortgage lending, has risen strongly in recent years, although at a slower rate than totalprivate-sector credit. The share of non-housing personal sector credit in total lending has remainedrelatively stable in recent years and was lower at end-1999 than end-1994. Lending to real estate andconstruction activities rose from some 6% of total lending at end-1994 to over 8% at end-1999.

BIS Review 112/200012InvestmentAgainst the background of strong economic growth, investment has increased sharply, rising at anannual average rate of around 14% between 1994 and 2000. As a result, the investment share has risenfrom around 18% to 28% of GNP over this period. Within this sector, building and construction hasexpanded very strongly over the period, rising from about 10% of GNP in 1994 to 18% this year.Tighter monetary conditions in the euro area and a restoration of more sustainable growth rates wouldinevitably reduce the returns on investment. This could raise questions about the viability of some ofthis investment.Investment: Percentage of GNPTotalBuilding and ConstructionMachinery and Equipment199418.410.57.9199519.311.08.3199621.012.58.5199722.914.18.8199825.015.39.7199927.417.010.42000 (f)28.518.010.5Source: National Income and Expenditure Central Statistics Office, and Central Bank forecasts.These developments that I have outlined in relation to property prices, bank credit and investmentinevitably raise concerns about the soundness of the financial sector. The Bank, as the supervisoryauthority, has impressed on credit institutions the need to continue to maintain prudent standards inlending. In relation to mortgage finance, lenders have been requested to adhere to prudent norms inregard to loan-to-value ratios of houses and conventionally accepted income multiple norms. As Imentioned earlier, institutions have also been required to undertake sensitivity analyses in relation toadverse events such as an economic downturn or a sizeable interest rate increase. Institutions areconstrained by sectoral limits in regard to lending to specific sectors - this is a significant constraint onundue exposure to individual sectors. Institutions must also apply prudent loan loss provisioningpolicies. In this regard, the Bank is exploring ways in which counter-cyclical provision policies shouldbe actively pursued by credit institutions.ConclusionIreland’s economic performance has been exceptionally strong over the period since 1994 followingthe uncertainty and turbulence associated with the EMS exchange rate crisis of late 1992/early 1993.Over this period, the growth in Ireland’s Gross National Product has averaged about 8%.Decomposing this growth into its components in a growth accounting exercise indicates that about 4½percentage points of this growth is due to increased inputs of labour and capital, with all otherinfluences accounting for about 3½% of GNP growth. Some part of these other influences thatincrease growth may be due to “new economy” effects associated with structural changes in theeconomy and the contribution of foreign direct investment, mainly from the US. However, the greaterpart of the overall strong growth performance is due to the substantive increase in inputs of capital andlabour in economic activity. This is borne out by the large increase in the employment rate of theactive population, which has risen by around one-quarter since 1994. These facts would suggest thatour strong economic performance has been as much, if not more, a transitional catch-up phenomenonrather than a cyclical one.
13BIS Review 112/2000Nonetheless, with the economy now operating at close to capacity following this protracted transition,economic policy now faces some new issues. As I have outlined, the risks now relate to overheating inproduct, labour and asset markets in a relatively easy monetary environment and being able to copewith country-specific shocks that may arise. In regard to possible overheating, the principal task nowis to decelerate demand growth to a rate that is more in line with the medium-term growth potential ofthe economy. This is currently estimated to be about 4½ to 5% and somewhat less than this furtherout. Monetary policy in EMU is now set by reference to euro area economic conditions and cannot begeared to deal with problems peculiar to particular regions or countries. The principal policyinstruments available to dampen inflationary pressures peculiar to Ireland are fiscal policy, whichshould be set on a prudent, moderately restrictive path, and incomes policy. At the presentconjuncture, it is desirable that incomes evolve in a manner that does not set off a wage-price spiral inresponse to the current, essentially temporary, upturn in inflation. In addition to these policies, acontinuing policy of structural reform and the promotion of competition will help to mitigateidiosyncratic shocks that may arise in monetary union. Finally, in its role as supervisor of the financialsector, the Central Bank will continue to ensure that banks pursue prudent lending policies that do notjeopardise financial stability.While there are risks of excesses arising in the current environment, it should be emphasised that thesevulnerabilities are not critical. As well as the four policy instruments that are available for limitingthese risks, two critical features that could enhance these risks are now absent from the Irish case.Firstly, Ireland has quite limited exposure by way of short-term external liabilities - much of theinflows in recent years have taken the form of long-term direct investment. Secondly, by the sametoken, the absence of a specifically Irish exchange rate also removes a vulnerability that has beenevident in other countries where excesses have threatened to emerge. In summary, after a period ofvery strong economic growth, the authorities in Ireland are now faced with effecting a deceleration ofdemand to the feasible growth rate in the context of monetary union where monetary conditions in theround are relatively easy. This presents a challenge to us where we must rely on the remainingdomestic policy instruments to effect the transition from exceptionally high growth to moderategrowth in as smooth a manner as possible.
1BIS Review 111/2000M R Chatu Mongol Sonakul: National Central Bank and building world peaceSpeech by Mr M R Chatu Mongol Sonakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the27th International Conference on World Peace “Building a Culture of Peace in the New Millennium”,held in Bangkok on 1 December 2000.*      *      *Members of the Professors World Peace Academy, Participants of the 27th International Conferenceon World Peace, Ladies and gentlemen.The history of central banking is normally agreed to have begun around four thousand years ago in theGreece, Roman and other empires up to the middle ages when banks were put up primarily for thepurpose of getting finance for governments to wage war. So the first period of central banking cannotvery well be said to have been in conformity with the topic I’ve been asked to talk about here today,which is entitled “National Central Bank and Building World Peace”.But in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and especially later on when industrialisation began inearnest, there were great needs for finance for the many various industries that sprang up around thattime. Commercial banks and great finance houses became common but the limitations of thetechnology of that period of using precious metals as currency became quickly apparent.Commercial banks began issuing their own paper notes, for the amount of the valuable metals thatthey had in stock being much more transportable. But human nature being what it is, they also beganissuing paper notes equivalent to the value of precious metal which they don’t have in the vaults andthe various currencies issued by the various banks became devalued very quickly.Another aspect to the whole thing is that people do cash in paper notes at times and banks have to holdlarge reserves sometimes up to 30% of their liabilities in order to make sure that they have adequateliquidity that may be used in case of unforeseen events.The first central banks in its relatively modern form were therefore established to provide the functionof being the sole issuer of currencies and the single keeper of reserves as defined by law, notably theBank of England in 1694 and epitomised in a tome in 1873, Lombard Street by Bagehot, Editor at thetime of the Economist, where the concept of the Banking Department and the Note IssuingDepartment was so clearly explained.This gave credibility and value to paper currency and it was also a very much more efficient system inthat the single reserves at the central bank could be used by the many commercial banks whothereupon kept much smaller contingencies, historically sometimes as low as 4 % of liabilities andaccessed the joint “reserves” at the central bank whenever necessary enabling a much more efficientuse of financial reserves than each bank having its own large reserves. Thus was born the term “bankerto the bankers” and “lenders of last resort”.Thus, in this way central banking for the first time really became a cornerstone of the building ofworld prosperity and world peace.Of course the single reserves might be sufficient under normal circumstances but when things get outof hand, it may not be sufficient, and banks do shut down. The government and the central banksthereupon undertook that most important function of building world peace, which is looking after thepoor and the disadvantaged, by putting up deposit insurance schemes, the first being in New York in1829 but the first nationwide schemes being in Czechoslovakia in 1920 whereby at least the smallestand the least knowledgeable depositors are protected.Of course, a better alternative would be to try and make banks less liable to failure. Since banks areoften in an oligopolistic system or at the very least, they are leveraged by the ratio of debt to equity ofaround 12:1, being the inverse of the capital adequacy ratio now defined by the Bank for InternationalSettlements to be at least 8%, and using other people’s money in a way that normal companies cannot
BIS Review 111/20002do - the central bank then underpins the viability of commercial banks by supervising and examiningthem so that sensible decisions are made and fraudulent activities are minimised.Surprisingly, that may not even be the biggest way central banks contribute to world peace. Fornations taken individually, the biggest function deemed to be of the central banking is monetarypolicy. By trading in foreign exchange, in local currencies, by credit extension, by rule making, and bysetting interest rates, the general level of economic activity can normally be influenced by the centralbank.In so doing, central banks used to try to contribute to peace and prosperity by making sure that the lessadvantaged or the more useful activities or social class and such like have better access to funds ingeneral or to the funds of the central bank, and in the extreme case even go so far as financing projectsand infrastructure.In the modern world, it is now normally agreed that each national economy is so vast and complex thatcentral banks could be considered to have done very well if it just keeps the country stable and letgovernment build infrastructure and help the poor and private sector trade and invest to economicallydevelop the nation.The recent trend is that, central banks are now given the sole task of keeping price stability, and isgiven the independence to do that since if they have no independence, government will, at time ask itto do things that are in conflict to that sole function.Thus the modern central bank is really akin to keeping peace in the nation through enhancing stabilityand it’s other people’s jobs to create wealth or turmoil as the case may be, the turmoil being anecessary instrument in coming to the right policies or at time the wrong ones or in an ever worseending turmoil without apparent purpose as is so often the case in emerging markets.But it certainly is not now deemed the function of the central bank to be doing this sort of thing. Socentral bankers can now claim that they are basically trying to create peace and hopefully in a peacefuleconomy, there will be better prosperity than a wildly gyrating one.In a peaceful economy, growing stably at a high but sustainable rate, one cannot expect that there willbe no criminals hidden deep down somewhere inside the society. A new instrument has therefore beenadded to the arsenal of monetary policy and financial supervision in the anti-money launderinglegislations.The first anti-money laundering legislation was issued in 1970 by the US government. The mechanismis generally that cash deposit of more than the minimum stipulated amount would be examined.In the case of Thailand, this legislation was issued in April and became effective in August 1999. Thecentral bank participated fully in the draft and cooperates with its implementation.We have taken the option though that central banks should be trying to put up a good system forpeople to operate in rather than having another prime function of catching thieves and criminals, andin this legislation therefore a new independent government office has been put up dedicated solely tothe pursuit of the articles of the legislation.We sit on the committee under the legislation as I have just said, and cooperate wherever we can tomake sure its execution is effected and effective. This is another occasion where central bankscontribute directly to peace in that criminal activities which by nature are not peaceful is kept to aminimum.Speaking of criminal activities, vote buying in an election is also a criminal activity and althoughlegislation makes it difficult for us to tackle this problem, we cooperate with the Neutral NationalElection Commission in tracking down movement of funds and we have assigned an assistantgovernor to directly coordinate with this Commission.The banking laws in Thailand at present though is that banking activity is secret and this inhibits usfrom doing as much as we could to help in curbing this criminal activity. New legislations, both in thecentral bank act and financial institution act will empower the central bank to have much more abilityto manage the nature of commercial banks and will follow the principle of transparency when we shall
3BIS Review 111/2000be able to do much more for such an important event as a national election and hopefully thencommercial banks would be much less inclined to cooperate in less than virtuous activities.Whilst it is probably true central banks of the modern era spend so much time in trying to stabilisenational events, the biggest single cause of untold misery, poverty, death and famine in the moderneconomy is probably neither disease nor natural events, but it is the ever more frequent financial andcurrency crises and many central banks in many economies have been helpless in this prevention.There are now many international fora to tackle these problems, but all of them now are bent onmaking emerging markets behave themselves better with a better system, monitor themselves betterand monitor what’s going on in the rest of the world, the latter is actually an impossibility.All financial transaction of significance is now computerised. A central bank with any kind ofcompetence will have good access within the nation and understand and manage their own destiny.Given a reasonable government and even minimal legal system, each nation should be able to keeppeace and stability.But international transaction is something else. No amount of computer capability will enable you toaccess the computers of the money centers of other countries, and of the off-shore center of the world.These are vast sum that we are talking about, directed at an opportune moment on markets which arenot yet sophisticated, deep or varied and for political or financial reasons are at the time vulnerablesomehow.In Thailand, for instance in 1997, the amount of non-resident baht moved in that year was 900 billiondollars when our total GNP was only 140 billion dollars.When that kind of money moves against a nation, there is really no way a reasonable defence could bemade. Of course, the important powers of the world say that the country should behave itself better,but one has to ask a question why important powers of the world try to make sure that each countrybehaves itself, yet allows the international monetary system to behave totally as it wishes without dueregard to responsibility or the misery and famine that such events could cost.The obvious answer is that all the major important money centers and funds are in the advancedcountries and the major countries systems being much more diverse is less liable to collapse whenthere are large movements of funds in any particular sector.Banking in Thailand for instance provides 77% of all credit available in the country at this momentwhile in the US it is only 26%.Before you ask, we are of course trying to rectify this, trying to get banking down to 55% of totalcredit by the year 2010, and in the last three years, somehow we have got the debt market which wasbefore then nonexistent to be double the size of the stock market.But it takes life times and generations to change people’s habits and the nature of the country. Theworld monetary system could in fact be monitored quite easily if the superpowers of the world wouldonly wish it to be done. It sends forces to keep peace in other countries, so it could quite just as wellimpose a system , a world monetary system that would significantly reduce this kind of crisis. But theonly crisis which might have affected the superpowers were the LTCM crisis of the 1998 and theAsian crisis of 1997 and it soon became apparent that the suffering could mainly be kept to the poornationsand so it looks as though nothing good is going to happen in the international arena.Let me end my statement therefore by saying that before coming here I looked at the list of speakersand participants and was truly impressed by the diversity and excellence. I have therefore tried to putsome interesting thoughts in the area of national central banking for your perusal.All of us here wish for peace and prosperity in the world. Each of us a little bit or a lot depending onthe occasion can contribute to peace. So I truly hope that whenever the opportunity arise we will doour part to try and put up a better world monetary system at which tasks the emerging countries are sopowerless.
1BIS Review 111/2000Alan Greenspan: Structural changes in the economy andfinancial markets in the United StatesRemarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the America’s Community Bankers Conference, Business Strategies for Bottom LineResults, held in New York, 5 December 2000.*      *      *Good morning. It is a great pleasure for me to join America’s Community Bankers for your winterconference. I would like to take the opportunity today to talk with you about some of the structuralchanges in the economy and financial markets that are challenging both bankers and policymakers.Technological innovation, and in particular the spread of information technology, has revolutionizedthe conduct of business over the past decade and resulted in rising rates of productivity growth.Accelerated productivity has been elevating standards of living, and it has been containing cost andprice pressures, even as the economy operates at unusually high levels of labor resource utilization.Higher prospective rates of return from the application of the newer technologies has led to a surge inbusiness capital spending. And, in recent years, the capitalization of those higher expected profits hasboosted equity prices and contributed to a significant pickup in household spending on houses, durablegoods, and consumption more generally. Also contributing has been the measurable rise in theturnover of existing homes, engendering a marked increase in realized capital gains. For a long time,those who were advancing funds shared the sanguine expectations of those using the funds for rapidincreases in profits and incomes, and credit and equity were available with unusually low risk spreads.During the past couple of years, however, the widespread optimism that was apparent in financialmarkets has given way to some reassessment of risks and opportunities. This process has beenunderway ever since the global financial crisis in the fall of 1998. That episode forced many marketparticipants to recognize the potential for international risks to feed back on US markets. Eventsbrought into sharper focus the possibility that liquidity in many markets can dry up simultaneouslywhen fear spurs risk aversion, and an intense, near-term focus on protecting capital values markedlyelevates the demand for liquidity. Markets largely recovered from that episode, but an imprint was leftin the form of wider credit spreads and more cautious behavior on the part of banks and other lenders.Recently, wariness about risk again has increased as default rates on less than investment-grade bondshave moved higher, debt downgrades have become more commonplace, and many high-flyingdot-com ventures have collapsed. More broadly, equity market analysts have been revising down theirnear-term profit forecasts - with revisions occurring across a range of industries.As a consequence, stock prices this year have given back some of the extraordinary gains posted inrecent years, risk spreads have widened appreciably in markets for lower-rated long-term andshort-term credits, and - as I’ll be discussing in more detail later - banks report that they havetightened terms and standards on business loans.To be sure, our current circumstances are in no way comparable to those of 1998. Financial marketshave continued to function reasonably well, and credit continues to flow, although admittedly withreduced availability to less-than-investment-grade borrowers and at interest spreads sufficientlyelevated to press on profit margins of those lower-rated borrowers. Both lenders and borrowers arereassessing their positions in light of an apparent uptick in domestic risks, but the palpable fear thatdominated financial markets at the height of the crisis two years ago is not now in evidence. Net fundsraised by non-farm, non-financial business are estimated to have risen in November from Octoberlevels, though remaining below the rates of earlier this year.Why then, one might ask, is this process of reassessment taking place now? In large part, it appears tobe the expected byproduct of the economy’s transition to a more sustainable balance in the growth of
BIS Review 111/20002demand and supply. The orders and output surge this past year in a number of high-technologyindustries, amounting in some cases to 50% and more, was not sustainable even in the more optimisticnew economy scenarios. Technological innovation combined with intense competition has resulted insome overreaching. Many firms rushed to gain first-mover advantages of the newer technologies. Thesuccessful creation of industrywide networking standards was expected to allow these firms todominate a particular market niche and, thus, to reap a considerable reward in earnings.Demand for high-tech equipment and fiber optics expanded rapidly, but in some segments of themarket available supply appears to have increased even faster. To the extent that some aspiringentrepreneurs entered the tail end of a short-term boomlet, there was bound to be somedisappointment. In many respects, the situation may be analogous to a phenomenon of which I am suremany of you are all too painfully familiar - the tendency to overbuild in commercial real estate whenlow vacancy rates prompt commercial building starts well beyond the point that, on completion, couldbe supported by the ongoing growth in demand. Problems have even arisen among a number ofwell-established companies whose forays into uncertain newer technologies have come up short.To a considerable degree, then, the current shakeup in some segments of the telecom and otherhigh-tech sectors seems to reflect an inevitable winnowing process as the market begins to draw firmerconclusions about which firms will be able to establish a long-lived market niche and which will not.Of course, these events are not inconsistent with investment in high technology continuing to serve asan engine of strong productivity growth in the years ahead. As one might expect, the cyclicalcomponent of the growth of output per hour has slowed, but during the summer months output perhour advanced at a pace sufficiently impressive to affirm a definitely elevated underlying rate ofstructural productivity growth from the levels of a decade ago.Moreover, despite recent short-term earnings disappointments, many corporate managers appear not tohave measurably altered their long-standing optimism on the future state of technology. At least this isthe impression one gets from the persistent upward revision through most of this year of securityanalysts’ long-term earnings projections. Analysts, one must presume, obtain most of their insightsfrom corporate managers, who are most intimately aware of the potential gains from technologicalsynergies and networking economies. According to IBES, a Wall Street firm, the three- to five-yearaverage earnings projections of more than a thousand analysts, though exhibiting some signs offlattening in recent months, have generally held firm. Such expectations, should they persist, bode wellfor continued capital deepening and sustained growth of structural productivity over the longer term.Admittedly, however, shifts in the growth of structural productivity are clearly visible only inretrospect.The adjustment to a more sustainable supply-demand alignment is occurring in the economy morebroadly, as well as within some high-tech sectors. For some time, growth in aggregate demandexceeded even the productivity-enhanced expansion of potential supply. More recently, though, thepace of expansion of economic activity has moderated appreciably, in part as tighter financialconditions have had some impact on interest-sensitive areas of the economy.Homebuilding has declined over much of this year, though more recently demand appears to havelargely stabilized in response to the decline in mortgage rates that has occurred since the spring. Motorvehicle sales continue to slip, however, reflecting, in part, the unwillingness of households andbusinesses, faced with today’s financial market conditions, to add to the stock of cars and trucks on theroad at the pace observed over the past year. Growth in the demand for consumer durables generallyappears to be shifting down after the rapid gains of the past few years. This softening, in turn, has fedback into reduced demand from a large segment of the so-called old economy that supplies consumerdurable markets.Given the difficulty employers have had with building up their workforces in recent years, it is notsurprising that the easing in demand growth since the spring has been reflected more in hours workedthan jobs. As a consequence, labor markets have remained tight. But the recent increase in initialunemployment insurance claims and the level of insured unemployment may be an early harbinger ofan easing of these conditions.
3BIS Review 111/2000In periods of transition from unsustainable to more modest rates of growth, an economy is obviouslyat increased risk of untoward events that would be readily absorbed in a period of boom. The sharprise in energy prices, if sustained, is worrisome in this regard. As we learned from previous episodes,rising energy prices could engender risks to both inflation and economic activity. If accommodated bymonetary policy, the jump in energy prices could spill over into general inflation and inflationaryexpectations, as was so evident in the 1970s. At the same time, the hike in the price of importedenergy has acted, in effect, as a tax equivalent of roughly 1% of national income. Although there is asyet little evidence of the type of destabilizing inflationary pressures observed in the aftermath ofprevious oil price spikes or of exceptionally large restraint on consumer spending, Middle Easttensions have heightened such risks.The most significant effect to date from higher energy prices appears to be on profit margins, wherecorporate businesses, constrained by competitive market forces, have not been able to raise prices tofully offset energy cost increases. We estimate that owing to the rise in oil, natural gas, and electricpower prices, energy costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy, corporations have increased at a 40% annualrate since the spring of 1999. Apparently, most of the increase has eaten into the margins of domesticcorporations outside the energy sector.With equity prices weakening in response to reduced earnings from higher costs and a more moderatepace of sales, the “wealth effect” that spurred consumer spending is being significantly attenuated.Moreover, high and rising equity prices had facilitated a good deal of financing for newer companies,both in the equity and bond markets. Widened spreads in the high-yield markets reflect, in part, areduced potential for new equity issuance to support debt servicing. Higher costs of capital for thesecompanies likely is exerting some restraint on overall business capital spending.Nonetheless, in the face of the energy price spike and the erosion of optimism in financial markets,consumer confidence, or sentiment, appears to be holding up reasonably well to date, though therehave been some mixed signals of late. And although new orders for high-tech equipment have slowedfrom their torrid pace of earlier this year, order backlogs for such equipment continued to rise throughOctober, and capital deepening and structural productivity growth continued apace.Still, in an economy that already has lost some momentum, one must remain alert to the possibilitythat greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could signal or precipitate anexcessive softening in household and business spending.As might readily be expected, these changing economic dynamics, of necessity, are being reflected inour banking markets. Technological innovations played a key role in rendering decades-old bankinglaws and regulations obsolete. The relaxation of these regulations has, in turn, further reduced barriersto competition and accelerated the modernization of our financial system. That evolution, however,must continue to occur in a manner that preserves the fundamental soundness of the financial systemand, in particular, the nation’s banks. History teaches us that a sound banking system, willing and ableto take deposits and extend credit, is a prerequisite for the long-term health of the national economy.Securities markets alone will never be able to substitute for the extensive and detailed knowledge thatbankers - especially community bankers - bring to the intermediation process.In addition, changes in regulation and supervision induced by technological innovations in informationprocessing are just a small part of the sea change in banking. Far more important is that thesetechnologies have made it possible for banks and other financial firms to adopt business models and tooffer customers a range of products and services that literally would have been impossible only a fewyears ago.What has transpired in the banking industry has been just a microcosm of the sweeping changes in theeconomy at large in recent years - changes that also present both risks and opportunities to banks.Since the mid-1990s, the banking industry has enjoyed an unusually strong and steady growth ofprofits, coupled with an improving asset quality and vibrant loan growth, which reflected, in turn, thegrowing and innovative real economy. Bankers, however, were not immune from the same optimismthat affected equity markets, leading, in some cases, to less-than-realistic assessments regardingborrowers’ ability to repay. In more recent periods, pockets of weakness have emerged, especially in
BIS Review 111/20004large syndicated credits. I believe that these developments are inducing more realistic assessments ofrisks by banking organizations. For some institutions, lapses in risk evaluation have come at some costas asset quality has deteriorated, net charge-offs have risen, and profitability has fallen. Recent reportsby certain large banking organizations point to some further deterioration of asset quality.Fortunately, bankers have generally been well prepared to meet these developments. The industry’sbase of earnings is historically strong and well diversified, and although credit costs as well asproblem and classified assets have risen, they remain historically modest relative to assets and capital.Some bankers attribute the recent rise in problems to the relaxation of lending standards and terms oftwo or three years ago. During that period, supervisors had noted the risks posed by an overlyoptimistic outlook and by a lack of stress testing. However, while supervisors like to think thatbanking organizations are attentive to our every warning, there is nothing like actual loan downgradesand losses to focus management’s attention. One can hope that the practical experience provided byrecent events will translate into better structured transactions and improved risk-adjusted pricing.Indeed, that does seem to be the case.For example, the Federal Reserve’s November Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey suggests thatlending standards and terms have continued to tighten in the wake of weakened borrower conditions.In addition, more than half the institutions indicated that they anticipated further tightening ofstandards and terms before the end of 2001.At the same time, it is important that the response of management to these concerns not be overdone.The rise in the problems that we are observing can in some sense be attributed to the kinds ofoverreaching typically experienced during strong economic periods, when downside scenarios aremore challenging to visualize fully, when the ambitions of borrowers are at their height, and whencompetition for market share is an especially driving force. Though lenders will be viewing newtransactions with greater caution than they did a couple of years ago, both bankers and theirsupervisors should now guard against allowing the pendulum to swing too far the other way byadopting policy stances that cut off credit to borrowers with credible prospects.Despite some isolated pronounced losses at a few large institutions, their effect on earnings so far hasbeen modest in the aggregate. More widespread has been shrinking net interest margins arising from arapid rise in liability costs, with more than a third of the largest bank holding companies experiencingdeclines in these margins of 25 basis points or more compared with a year ago. On the other hand,savings institutions have had less severe margin contractions, and smaller commercial banks havegenerally been able to keep their margins stable. The relatively moderate margin decline for savingsinstitutions may reflect the success of their hedging programs. The more favorable margin trends atsmaller commercial and savings institutions are also probably linked to their relatively higher levels ofcore deposits, which have been less sensitive to rising rates.That said, a growing dependence on wholesale funding is becoming an established trend for large andsmall institutions alike. As loan growth has greatly exceeded that of deposits, liquidity benchmarkratios such as loans-to-deposits have reached historic peaks.Although day-to-day decisions about wholesale versus retail funding may appear immaterial at thetime, the effect of such decisions may gradually transform the overall liquidity and risk profile of aninstitution. It is crucial, therefore, that bank managers take stock of how their balance sheets haveevolved - including the widening menu of choices available to customers on both sides of that balancesheet - and understand the accompanying implications.The freedom to manage your liability structure is still constrained by one remnant of 1930’s erabanking regulation - the prohibition of interest on demand deposits. This is of particular concern tocommunity bankers, of course, given that larger banks are offering interest to their customers throughsweep accounts. Pending legislation modernizing the law would potentially help bolster depositgrowth and open opportunities for other profitable customer relationships without the unproductiveand costly circumventions of the existing statute.Capital, of course, is the key to maintaining stability in the midst of the risks of the evolving financialand economic landscapes. Recognizing that fact, regulators are working toward implementation of
5BIS Review 111/2000capital standards that are more risk-sensitive through the international Basel Capital Accord. Thateffort, however, is largely directed toward the diversity of risks facing the largest banks and willundoubtedly require an even greater level of complexity than the current standards. For those of youwho already view the current capital framework as too complicated, let me offer some encouragingwords. The US banking agencies published last month an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for asimplified capital framework that would apply to banks with less complex risk structures. The noticesets forth very broad options for a less burdensome standard, including the use of a simplifiedrisk-based ratio, a stand-alone leverage ratio, or a leverage ratio modified to capture off-balance-sheetexposures. There are many pros and cons to each of these alternatives, and the banking agencies areeager to receive your views as well as your ideas for other alternatives. We are hopeful that this dialogwill lead to a less burdensome, yet prudent rule for noncomplex institutions.In closing, the transition of the US economy to a more sustainable supply-demand relationship isposing challenges for businesses, banks, and monetary policymakers. How well banks perform underthese conditions will depend on their ability to continuously reevaluate previously held assumptionsand adapt to change. Fortunately, US banking organizations of all sizes have the right tools to thrive inthis environment, in the form of improved risk management techniques, more diverse earnings, andstrong capital bases. I am confident that banking organizations will continue to monitor and respond torisks while meeting customer demands in a way that strengthens our underlying financial structure inthe years to come.
1BIS Review 110/2000The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE: Some thoughts on the coexistence ofaffluence and poverty in the United KingdomText of the St Paul’s Cathedral Lecture by The Rt Hon Sir Edward George GBE, Governor of theBank of England, held in London on 28 November 2000.*      *      *I have to confess that for me, as a banker - even if I’m a central banker rather than a commercialbanker - to be invited to address this audience in the magnificent setting of this cathedral is asomewhat daunting experience. But if it’s a daunting experience, I recognise that it is a great honour,which I very much appreciate; and I welcome the opportunity it gives me to share with you thisevening some thoughts on the age-old question, which continues to trouble right-minded peopleeverywhere - how can we explain, let alone justify or tolerate, the coexistence of obvious affluenceand well-being cheek by jowl with equally obvious poverty and deprivation. It’s a question of verybroad relevance, with personal, local, national and international dimensions. It’s a question to whichgreat minds have applied themselves across the centuries. I should like, more modestly, in my remarksto offer some reflections, based upon my nearly forty years experience of working at the Bank, on therelevance, first, of monetary and broader economic policy to that question; on the relevance, secondly,of the activity of the City financial institutions; and on the relevance, finally, of the work of theinternational financial institutions with which the Bank of England is involved.But let me at the outset identify a common theme that underlies my remarks on all three of these areas.Don’t think that the root of the problem is that people generally simply don’t care. The harsh reality isthat, with the best will in the world, we do not have - personally as far as most of us are concerned butcertainly, collectively - locally, nationally or internationally - sufficient resources to satisfy all ouraspirations. And since those aspirations are continuously increasing as standards do in fact graduallyrise, I don’t suppose we ever will have that capacity. So we are obliged to make choices: if we devoteresources to this or that purpose we will not have resources to devote to this or that other purpose -however desirable in itself that other purpose may be.An absolutely fundamental issue is, of course, how and by whom such collective decisions are taken. Iimagine that, while we could no doubt argue about some of the details, all of us would accept that agenuine democratic process - based on universal suffrage and underpinned by transparency andaccountability, and supported by freedom of speech, including freedom of the press, is a sine qua non.Within that framework, there is plenty of room for ongoing debate about the role of government, atdifferent levels, in striking a balance between protecting the interests of society as a whole and ofparticular groups within society, on the one hand, and preserving individual freedoms on the other. Inthe economic field the debate can become polarised between those who favour free markets, in theinterests of economic efficiency and growth, and those who favour government intervention, in theinterests of social protection. In fact I don’t think I know many people actually involved in publicpolicy issues who do not see general economic prosperity as the ultimate objective; and I don’t knowmany people either who do not recognise the need for government intervention to maintain at least theminimum standards necessary for the effective functioning of free markets. So the real debate it seemsto me is a narrower one: it is about means rather than ends; and the real issues are typically aboutmatters of degree rather than absolute matters of basic principle.Against that background let me talk first about overall economic policy - and its relevance to the issueof poverty.For many years after the second world war in this country, during the 1960s and 1970s, macro-economic policy - overall fiscal policy and monetary policy operating together and with various formsof direct control - was aimed at juggling what were seen as the conflicting objectives of economicgrowth and falling unemployment on the one hand and limiting inflation and maintaining a
BIS Review 110/20002manageable balance of payments position on the other. Essentially the policy levers would be setinitially at go, to stimulate demand and encourage growth and employment, until the evidence of over-heating became intolerable, when the levers were thrown abruptly into reverse, to bring about ajuddering economic slowdown. This was the infamous go-stop economic policy cycle which led to theboom-bust economic cycle. While the objective was no doubt to ensure that we never againexperienced the depression and mass unemployment of the inter-war period, the effect was to induceuncertainty and short-term economic decision-making, with an increasingly damaging impact on ouroverall economic performance. And the situation became progressively worse from one economiccycle to the next as each peak produced higher and higher inflation and each trough higher and higherrates of unemployment - with the peaks becoming progressively shorter-lived. It became a classicexample of more haste less speed.We eventually learned from that experience that there really is no trade-off between growth andemployment and inflation, except possibly in the short term, and that stability, defined as consistentlylow inflation - and achieved by keeping overall demand continuously broadly in line with theunderlying structural, supply-side, capacity of the economy to meet that demand - is a necessarycondition for sustainable growth. We learned that governments cannot sensibly seek to achieve theirsocial objectives - however worthy they may be - by simply borrowing, or “printing”, the money tofinance their expenditures, but need to balance their current receipts and expenditures over theeconomic cycle, borrowing only to finance productive investments. And we learned that the task ofshorter term economic stabilisation was most appropriately left to the operation of monetary policy.That, very broadly speaking, is today’s macro-economic orthodoxy not just across a broad part of thepolitical spectrum in this country but in most of the rest of the world.Now many people were initially sceptical about this change of emphasis - no doubt some still are.Fiscal responsibility, including tight control over all forms of expenditure, for example, on socialsecurity and pension provision, and on health and education - and monetary policy directedspecifically at consistent stable, low, inflation - all sounds somewhat austere. What in particular does itmean in terms of its impact on the poorer sectors of our society?Well I don’t for a moment suggest it is the solution to all our problems. But it certainly has helped usto achieve a significantly better macro-economic performance over the past few years, and that initself has helped in addressing at least some of our social problems.Over the eight years or so since the last recession in the early 1990s retail price inflation - on theGovernment’s target measure - has averaged some 2¾%. That’s a lower rate for longer than anyonecan remember.This much greater degree of price stability is a “good thing” in itself - economically because itcontributes to more rational, longer-term, decision making, but also socially, because it is typically thepoorer, less financially sophisticated, sectors of society - for example those living on low fixedincomes - that suffer most from inflation.But low inflation is not simply an end in itself. The real benefit is that alongside sustained stability wehave experienced the longest period of quarter-by-quarter growth since quarterly records began. Overthe whole period annual output growth has averaged a little over 2¾% which is significantly higherthan the earlier trend rate of around 2¼%. But more even than that, employment has increased steadilyby nearly 2½m people over the same period, so that the number in work is today the highest on record.And unemployment has progressively fallen almost month by month on a claimant count basis (thoughwith a slight setback last month) and the rate of unemployment is just about the lowest rate we’ve seenfor about 25 years in the UK as a whole. And, notwithstanding the legitimate debate about the North-South divide, unemployment is at around its lowest rate in every individual region of the UK for some20 years. It’s not the Holy Grail but there’s no doubt that things are better than they were.But sadly that is not - indeed cannot be - true for everyone. Even in a stable macro-economicenvironment, economic progress depends upon structural change with some industries and individualbusinesses declining while others develop to take their place. That process of structural change is, ofcourse I understand, immensely painful for those businesses that run down and for those people wholose their jobs as a result, even if they are able to find new activity or employment in an economy
3BIS Review 110/2000operating close to capacity. What is more, these structural pressures have been aggravated over thepast few years by the strength of sterling’s exchange rate against both a range of weakening emergingmarket currencies following the financial crisis which started in Asia three years or so ago and againstthe weakening euro. The hard choice - and it is a hard choice - for macro-economic policy, or morespecifically for monetary policy, in this context is could we - or should we - seek to protect thesuffering sectors or failing businesses even if that meant consciously putting at risk the stability of theeconomy as a whole? Few people - even in the suffering sectors - argue that we should - not becauseof insensitivity to the economic and social distress that can result for those communities that are mostaffected, but because of the more extensive damage that it would be likely to cause to the widercommunity.I said a moment ago macro-economic stability depends upon keeping overall demand growthcontinuously broadly in line with the underlying structural, supply-side, capacity of the economy tomeet that demand. There is not a lot frankly that macro-economic policy itself can do directly to affectthe supply side which is obviously crucial in determining the rate of growth we can sustain. Thatdepends fundamentally on the ability of management and the skills of the workforce, though it can beimportantly affected by the whole range of government policies beyond overall fiscal and monetarypolicy. These policy choices are far more complicated than the more technical choices at the macro-economic level - and they are way beyond my area of competence. But they are essential to the presentdebate so let me offer a view, as it were from the sidelines.A key issue in this area concerns the respective roles of government on the one hand and privatemarkets on the other. And there is little doubt that the tide has recently been flowing in favour ofprivate markets - certainly as far as direct government involvement in the processes of production isconcerned. The extreme example is of course the collapse of communism but the global spread ofprivatisation, for example, is part of the same phenomenon. This change may have less to do with asudden dramatic shift in philosophical conviction than with a broadly-based, pragmatic, recognitionthat the incentives of private ownership within a market economy make for greater productiveefficiency and greater sensitivity to changing consumer demands. In other words, whether we like it ornot, the market economy is seen as the most effective mechanism we have for allocating scarceresources to where they can be most productively employed in meeting the needs of consumers as awhole - and in that sense raising the underlying productive potential of the economy.But of course that presumption is not absolute.No one questions the role of government in meeting the collective needs of society as a whole, inrelation to defence or law and order, for example, or in providing public heath and education servicesor social security protection.Nor do many people seriously question the need to constrain purely free market behaviour throughsome degree of regulation of employment practices, health and safety standards, or competition orconsumer protection law. The debate is about questions of degree.All forms of government intervention involve costs - direct expenditures have to be paid for throughtaxation and the costs of complying with regulation are born directly by the private sector, which iswhy of course we hear so much about “red tape”. The net effect of particular forms of interventionmay enhance the capacity of the private sector to create wealth and employment - I imagine that mostpeople would generally regard public health and education services, for example, in this way, or formsof regulation that enable markets to function more effectively. But even then there are questions ofdegree. And other forms of intervention may be more likely to reduce the wealth-creating capacity ofthe private sector by, for example, blunting incentives either to provide or to take up employment.That is not, of course, to say that they are in any sense necessarily wrong, merely to point out that hereagain choices to be made, the difficulty often being to know where to strike the balance betweenconflicting objectives.The question of relieving poverty needs to be addressed within this framework. Our social consciencemay say that we should lean more towards redistribution in favour of the poorer sectors of ourcommunity generally, or in favour of those who are particularly disadvantaged in one way or another -and goodness knows there are endless causes that in themselves are worthy of our collective support.
BIS Review 110/20004But it is important to recognise that in doing so, we could reduce the wealth and income generatingcapacity of the economy as a whole, and so reduce our ability to provide rising living standards to allsectors of society, including rising absolute living standards of the poorer sectors we were seeking tohelp. In other words, in trying to divide up the cake more equally we could, if we are not careful, endup reducing its overall size. The trick it seems to me is to find ways of having our cake and eating it -which some forms of government intervention can, as I say, achieve. But that’s a great deal easier saidthan done. I only thank my lucky stars that I am not a politician!Where then do the financial institutions of the City fit in to all of this? Well, money changers havenever been exactly popular. That is partly because of a perception that while the rest of the communityearn their living making things, bankers simply make money - and what’s more they make money byusing “our” money. But it is partly because of a perception that people who work in the financialservices industry are pretty heartless people anyway.In fact financial intermediation is a critically important component of a market economy. Behind thepopular - or perhaps unpopular - image of erratic and speculative, short-term, financial market trading,which is in fact an important element in the process of price discovery - the essential role of financialintermediation is to gather together our collective financial resources - our savings if you like - and todirect their investment into those activities in which they can be most productivity employed. Thatunderlying activity - based upon expert and objective assessment of prospective profitability relativeto potential risk, clearly can, in itself, make a significant difference to the productive capacity - thesustainable rate of growth - of the wider economy.In addition, of course, financial intermediaries provide essential banking, insurance and other services,without which the non-financial economy would find it impossible to function.Of course it is true that financial intermediaries are motivated by profit. Prospective profitability is themeasure by which they decide how to direct resources to their most productive use, which is, as I say,their essential economic function. Moreover, they are for the most part lending, or investing, oradvising on the investment of, funds which ultimately belong to others, and they have to aim tomaximise the return on those funds in the interest of their customers, as well as on their own account,if they are to stay in business for the longer term.Recent international history is littered with instances in which misallocation of financial resources tonon-productive investment, followed by disruption of the financial system, has resulted in massiveeconomic and consequent social damage. It was a major factor, for example, behind the Asian crisisand its aftermath. As with other forms of economic activity the financial services sector is subject togovernment intervention; indeed because of the sector’s critical importance such intervention - in theform of regulation and supervision of both the prudential behaviour and the business conduct offinancial intermediaries - is more intrusive than in many other areas. And in this case, too, there is aneed to strike a balance between the needs of social protection in its various relevant forms and marketefficiency. Here, too, there are certainly areas where these objectives run in the same direction: marketregulation can, for example, improve user confidence in the market and contribute to its depth andliquidity; and minimum capital and liquidity standards applied to individual financial institutions canprotect not just the depositors or investors with that institution but the stability of the financial systemas a whole. But clearly intervention can - if we are not careful - go too far, imposing excessive costs orreducing effective competition, which can impair the ability of the system of financial intermediationto fulfil its essential purpose. It is a particular - if rather special - case of the general proposition whichI made earlier.Statutory regulation is not, of course, the only means of seeking to reconcile free market and socialconcerns. In many areas - including the financial services sector - dialogue and persuasion can beeffective complements or even alternatives. I am impressed, for example, by the extent to whichsexual and racial equality is increasingly - even if not yet sufficiently - seen as a business issue - wesimply cannot afford, collectively or in the context of our individual business activities, to neglect anysector of the community, if we want to improve our productive capacity. And in the context of thefinancial sector more specifically, I have been encouraged by the progress - through a process ofdialogue in which the Bank of England has been involved - towards a better understanding between
5BIS Review 110/2000the banks and other finance providers on the one hand and small and medium-sized businesses on theother, which is certainly in my view contributing to the more effective functioning of this sector of themarket with positive social as well as economic results. I am hopeful that similar dialogue betweenfinance providers and users can contribute to better outcomes in other areas where there appear to bedeficiencies, including, for example, the financing of ethnic minority businesses, or the financing ofexcluded or deprived communities, where the mainstream financial providers need to work closelywith community development financial institutions. Such dialogue is not only valuable in itself, it canform a useful part of the process helping government to identify better-targeted means of encouraginga closer alignment between social and economic objectives.I am also encouraged that City-based organisations are becoming increasingly directly involved notsimply in a financing context with deprived communities - including those on our own doorstep. TheCity has a long history of charitable and community involvement. But it is my impression that thisinvolvement has been increasing in recent years, with many businesses recognising that it can not onlyhave an important impact on the communities that they are supporting, but a powerful impact, too, onthe motivation and morale of their own staff engaged in community projects. It is to encourage thoseCity organisations already active in this field, and, by drawing attention to it, to stimulate others tobecome more actively engaged, that the Lord Mayor, Sir Howard Davies of the FSA and I havetogether recently launched the “Heart of the City” project, which Andrew Buxton is now directing -and which will culminate in a day of celebration of the City’s community involvement in June nextyear. The positive response we have received from the City - including the churches of the City - andour surrounding boroughs leads me to hope that this might become a regular event.Let me finally, Chairman, turn to the international dimension of all this, where I know only too well,from first-hand experience, that there is deeply-felt concern, sometimes sadly expressed in violentprotest, at aspects of the general economic approach which I have described, particularly as it bears onthe developing world through “globalisation”.The protesters, it must be said, form something of a rainbow coalition. Some - at the violent end of thespectrum - appear to be pure anarchists who are clearly against the present system but offer nocoherent alternative. Others - of whom there appear to be many more - seek to make either the moregeneral point that the present international financial system operates unfairly in relation to poorercountries or does not take adequate account of wider social concerns like poverty or the environment,or they make particular points about the burden of third-world debt or particular development projectswhich they see as having unacceptable social or environmental impact on the countries in which theproject is to be undertaken.Many of these issues are essentially the international dimension of issues that I have touched uponalready in our own domestic context - though the contrast between poverty and affluence at theinternational level is of course even starker. And there is a good deal of underlying sympathy withinthe international official community with many of the points the protesters are seeking to make -perhaps more than they appreciate. As a matter of fact I can’t remember a time when povertyreduction has been higher on the agenda of the international financial institutions. But the same harshconstraint - that we do not collectively have the resources to address all of these problems howevermuch we would wish to do so - applies. There is the same need therefore to make hard choicesbetween alternative means, and the international process for making those choices is inevitably morecomplicated than in our national environment.To take some examples, there is substantial evidence that increasingly free world trade and increasingfreedom of international capital flows are contributing to unprecedented rates of growth in the globaleconomy as a whole and more rapidly rising living standards in almost every region of the globaleconomy. It is certainly possible to argue even so that the free trade playing field remains tilted againstpoorer countries, or that it should be tilted more in their favour: distinguishing between self-interestedprotectionism and “fairness” or equality of competition is not wholly straightforward. But there wouldbe a real cost to all of us, including particularly the poorer countries, if we were to be tempted to throwthe baby out with the bath water and retreat behind trade barriers.
BIS Review 110/20006Similarly we have recently seen all too clearly the damage that can be caused by the volatility ofinternational capital flows - but we need to set that against the positive benefits - in terms of potentialgrowth rates - that had previously resulted from massively greater private sector capital investment inmany of the emerging markets, and which has now resumed. Certainly we need to reform the systemto try to ensure greater stability - and a great deal of effort has been expended on precisely that overthe past few years - by developing standards and codes of best practice by national authorities, forexample, designed to help them to help themselves to take greater advantage of the opportunitiespresented by globalisation. More certainly needs to be - and is being - done, recognising the particularproblems facing different countries at different stages of development. But it would be a terriblemistake to turn the clock back and retreat from “globalisation” into a world of nation states linkedtogether predominantly by official financing. None of the poorer countries themselves are arguing forthat, yet that is what some of the protests seem to imply.And so it is with some of the more specific issues - like pushing for higher labour standards indeveloping countries, which is fine up to a point, but if pushed too far could mean lower activity andhigher unemployment in those countries; or debt forgiveness not tied to programs designed to improvethe lot of the people living in the debtor countries; or the appropriateness of particular developmentprojects and so on - we cannot simply focus on particular aspects of the problem in isolation, we needto examine both the pros and the cons in each case to try to find the best means to what is quite likelyto be an agreed end. And dialogue in my view is likely to be a better and more productive approach tothat than attempts at direct action.Mr Chairman, it is absolutely right that not just the Church but anyone with a sense of humanityshould react against the extent of the inequality that we see around us locally, nationally andinternationally. It is, however, wrong in my view to attribute that inequality simply to the nature of thefinancial system. No doubt that system has its deficiencies which we need continually to address. Butby and large it is the best system that we have - or indeed that we have had. Within it we havecollectively to make all kinds of trade-offs between what may be seen, at least in the short run, asconflicting objectives. In that process we must all be free to follow our consciences and express ourconcerns. But I hope that my remarks this evening may have persuaded some of you at least that thereare rarely - in this field as in many others - obvious and absolute right answers. We are fortunate, Ibelieve, in having a democratic process through which our concerns can be weighed in the balance.
1BIS Review 109/2000Willem F Duisenberg: Hearing before the Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs of the European ParliamentIntroductory statement by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels,23 November 2000.*      *      *As usual, I shall report on recent monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB and on the reasoningunderlying these decisions. In addition, I should like to inform you about the decision taken by theGoverning Council of the ECB last week to publish staff economic projections for the euro area.Finally, I should like to say a few words about the progress report, which has been published by theECB as part of its initiative to improve cross-border retail payment services in the euro area.1.Economic and monetary developmentsAfter the last hearing before this Committee on 12 September, the Governing Council of the ECBdecided to increase the ECB’s main interest rates by 25 basis points on 5 October 2000. The decisionwas taken to ensure that upward pressures on consumer prices would not translate into morepermanent tendencies. It was based on evidence from both pillars of the monetary policy strategy ofthe ECB, notably continued money growth above the reference value and upward pressure onconsumer prices owing to oil price and exchange rate effects in an environment of robust economicgrowth.Let me comment in more detail on the Governing Council’s assessment of the current economicsituation. In the period from July to September 2000, the three-month average of M3 growth stood at5.4%, above the reference value of 4½%. However, some indicators suggest that over recent months amoderation in monetary growth has been occurring.Let me now turn, within the second pillar, to the prospects for economic growth in the euro area, asthese represent a key factor affecting the outlook for price stability in the medium term. The latestestimate by Eurostat for the second quarter of 2000 indicated a real increase in GDP of 0.8%. The paceof new job creation has remained high and the unemployment rate currently stands at 9.0%, a level notseen since mid-1992. Some monthly indicators suggest that some moderation in real GDP growthmight have occurred in the second half of this year, mainly as a result of the negative impact of therecent increases in oil prices on domestic income. However, by contrast with previous periods ofstrong oil price rises, the euro area economy is now less dependent on oil. This should help to preventany sustained negative effect on confidence. There are therefore good reasons to remain confident withregard to growth prospects.On the external side, euro area export growth should benefit further from the expansion of the globaleconomy. Considering these factors together, the growth dynamic in the euro area can be expected tobe maintained in the coming years. Forecasts by international and private organisations currentlyproject euro area real GDP growth in the coming one to two years to be somewhat lower than thisyear’s more than 3%, but to remain at around 3%.The exchange rate of the euro has remained a cause for concern. The depreciation of the euro during1999 and 2000 has added to upward pressures on consumer prices in the euro area. The exchange rateof the euro has now remained out of line with economic fundamentals for a prolonged period of time.The G7 expressed concern about the global repercussions of the current level of the euro exchangerate. In order to support the euro, concerted interventions by all G7 members, on the initiative of theECB, took place on 22 September, and the Eurosystem intervened several times in November.Recent Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation rates have been higher than could havebeen expected only a few months ago. Current inflation reflects the unexpected sharp rise in oil prices
BIS Review 109/20002in recent months. Notwithstanding a possible decline in oil prices, annual HICP inflation rates arelikely to remain above 2% for some time to come.It needs to be recognised that current upward pressures on consumer prices can be alleviated mostsmoothly if economic agents see them for what they are, namely one-off or temporary price increasesresulting from external factors. In this respect, when forming their expectations, economic agentsshould count on the commitment of the Governing Council of the ECB to maintaining price stability,defined as HICP inflation below 2%, in the medium term. Monetary policy will not accommodateinflationary tendencies in the euro area.It will be critical to ensure that the temporary upward pressure on HICP inflation is not followed bymore lasting upward pressure from domestic factors. The interest rate measures taken by the ECB overthe past few months were aimed at containing the emergence of inflation expectations and convincingthe social partners, as well as the public at large, that price stability in the euro area will be maintained.By ensuring that wages continue to grow at a moderate pace in 2001 and, may I add, beyond next year,wage-setters would facilitate the ECB’s task of maintaining price stability. They would at the sametime make an important contribution to maintaining the current strong employment growth in the euroarea.The maintenance of robust non-inflationary growth is a challenge faced in many policy areas, as wellas by the social partners. Many euro area countries have embarked on a path of structural reform,which they now need to adhere to strictly. Increasing the flexibility of labour markets and deregulatingproduct markets will enhance the growth potential of the euro area by allowing for a betterexploitation of the opportunities which are offered, for instance, by the single currency and the newinformation and communications technologies. Reforms are all the more important to help theeconomy adapt smoothly to external shocks such as those currently observed.In many countries, governments also need to press ahead with fiscal consolidation and fiscal reform.Budget deficits in the euro area as a whole are expected to improve this year, but this will mainly bethe result of strong economic growth and one-off revenues from the sale of UMTS licences.Abstracting from these factors, there has been little further progress in the consolidation of publicfinances on average. Moreover, current budget plans for 2001 imply that the average fiscal stance willbe slightly more expansionary next year. For the first time since 1993, the primary balance ratio as apercentage of GDP for the euro area is expected to deteriorate in 2001. This somewhat moreexpansionary stance demonstrates that the reform strategies have, in some cases, been unbalanced.Many countries have enacted reductions in personal and corporate income taxation and social securitycontributions, but have not set ambitious expenditure ceilings. While the tax reforms currently beingimplemented or planned in a number of euro area countries are a welcome stimulus to the supply side,they need to be accompanied by restraint in government spending.The longer-term sustainability of budget positions also needs to be ensured in several countries withregard to the consequences of planned fiscal reforms, such as those of pension systems, and thereduction of taxes. The policy adjustments necessary to create the financial leeway for these reformsshould be prepared now. A loosening of the fiscal stance stemming from an unbalanced reformstrategy not only jeopardises fiscal consolidation but, from a longer-term perspective, also reduces thepotential for positive supply effects of fiscal reform on economic growth.2.Publication of staff macroeconomic projections by the ECBI shall now turn to the envisaged publication of staff macroeconomic projections by the ECB.I have previously stated in my remarks to the European Parliament that the ECB could commence thepublication of macroeconomic projections during the course of this year. I am now happy to informyou that our preparations have been concluded. As was announced on 16 November, the GoverningCouncil has decided to commence publication of its staff macroeconomic projections in the Decemberissue of the ECB Monthly Bulletin. This decision reflects the Governing Council’s conviction - asreflected in practice - that the information and analysis underlying its monetary policy decisionsshould be shared with the public to the greatest extent possible, subject, of course, to the necessary
3BIS Review 109/2000preparation. Provision of this information will further enhance transparency and lead to a betterunderstanding of the single monetary policy.The ECB has decided that the time has come to publish its staff macroeconomic projections, which arealready used as an input into the assessment of the outlook for price stability. These are prepared twicea year by Eurosystem staff as one of a number of inputs into the deliberations of the GoverningCouncil. The projections will be published in the June and December issues of the ECB MonthlyBulletin, commencing in December 2000. Projections will be published for the growth rate of realGDP and its components and for HICP inflation. They will have a two-year horizon, so that theprojections for both 2001 and 2002 will be published in December this year. In order to accuratelyreflect the degree of uncertainty attached to such exercises, the projections will be published in theform of ranges, based upon the average absolute errors made in previous national central bank andEurosystem projections. The projections will be accompanied by a text describing their main features.I should emphasise that we use the word “projection” in order to signal that the published projectionsare the results of a scenario based on a set of underlying technical assumptions, including theassumption of unchanged monetary policy. This is the way forecasts are produced in many centralbanks in order to best inform monetary policy decision-makers. As the Eurosystem’s staff economicprojections are the products of a technical exercise, which assumes, inter alia, that short-term interestrates and the exchange rate will not change over the forecast horizon, it should be clear that the staffprojection will not, in general, be the best predictor of future outcomes, in particular for somewhatlonger horizons. Rather, it represents a scenario which is likely to be falsified in practice, sincemonetary policy will always act to address any threats to price stability.On making this announcement, it is crucial that I explain again the role which staff macroeconomicprojections play in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.The ECB’s primary objective is the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. Given the lags inthe transmission of monetary policy to the price level, monetary policy must be forward-looking.Therefore, all analysis undertaken at the ECB is focused on the risks to future price stability.The analysis underlying monetary policy decisions is organised within two frameworks, which werefer to as the two pillars. The Governing Council’s forward-looking assessment of the economicsituation and the outlook for price stability is based on both a prominent role for money, denoted asthe first pillar, and a broadly based assessment of other economic and financial indicators, labelled thesecond pillar. The projections that will be published by the ECB as from December are, as with anyconventional macroeconomic forecast or projection, derived from analytical frameworks in whichmoney plays only a limited role, if any. Hence such projections, which mostly reflect developments invariables other than money, naturally form part of the second pillar of the ECB’s strategy.The projections help to underpin the forward-looking orientation of monetary policy. They summariseand synthesise a large quantity of information that might otherwise be too unwieldy to form a sensiblebasis for policy discussions. They also provide a platform for the integration of economic analysisunder the second pillar in a coherent and internally consistent way, which seeks to reflect pastexperience and fundamental economic relationships.Twice a year, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Eurosystem undertakes, with the help of aWorking Group on Forecasting, a forecasting exercise which brings together staff from both the ECBand national central banks. The macroeconomic projections produced by these exercises combineanalysis based on a variety of econometric models with expert assessments made by staff. TheEurosystem’s staff projections are therefore not the result of the mechanical application of a singleeconometric model. On the contrary, they combine a variety of different analyses, all of which rely onthe staff’s technical expertise.Although they play a useful and important role, the projections are not a panacea. First, they arealways based on specific assumptions - such as those concerning oil prices or exchange rates - withwhich it is possible to disagree or which can change rapidly, so that the projections become outdated.Second, the final projection depends to a great extent on the underlying conceptual framework ortechniques employed in its production. Third, by their very nature, economic frameworks can only
BIS Review 109/20004provide a summary description of the economy and thus do not incorporate all relevant information. Inparticular, some information is not easily integrated into the framework used to produce theprojections or may change after they are finalised. Fourth, expert views are inevitably incorporatedinto projections and there can be good reasons at any moment of decision-making to deviate from theparticular views or approaches on which they are based.The two-pillar approach chosen by the Eurosystem - including a prominent role for money as the firstpillar - is, to some extent, a reflection of these general limitations of forecasts and projections.I should stress that, because of these limitations, the second pillar of the ECB’s strategy also includesother forms of analysis in addition to macroeconomic projections. First, the ECB’s projections arecross-checked and compared with forecasts produced by others, such as international organisationsand private sector entities. Second, the forward-looking information and expectations embodied infinancial prices and yields is thoroughly analysed and evaluated. This information can also becompared with the staff projections. Finally, any information that is not contained in the staffprojections for practical or timing reasons - such as the latest available outturns of certain data series -must also be incorporated into the overall assessment. Developments in individual indicators are alsoclosely followed outside the framework of the forecasting exercise.It follows from this discussion that the Governing Council does not use its staff projections as themain tool for organising and communicating its assessment. Rather, the Governing Council evaluatesthem alongside - and compares them with - many other pieces of information and forms of analysisorganised in the two-pillar framework. In the context of the ECB’s strategy, macroeconomic forecastsand projections therefore play an important - albeit limited - role.Two important points follow from the role of projections in the ECB’s strategy and the proceduresused to produce projections within the Eurosystem.First, the projections are produced by staff experts and do not embody the policy judgement of theGoverning Council. They therefore represent one input into the policy-making process and not theoutcome of the Governing Council’s deliberations. The Governing Council must exercise a policyjudgement in evaluating the projections it receives, alongside all other analyses, when drawingimplications for policy decisions.Second, since policy decisions are based on a broad range of analyses conducted under the two pillarsof the ECB’s monetary policy strategy - of which the Eurosystem’s projections constitute only a part -one should not expect policy decisions to respond mechanically to developments in the publishedmacroeconomic projections. In this respect, the projections published by the ECB and their role differconsiderably from the forecasts published by some other central banks.One question which has been raised since the announcement is why the Governing Council does notassume full responsibility for the projections to be published by the ECB, whilst of course acceptingfull responsibility for the staff that produces them. Let me answer this question by recalling theGoverning Council’s ultimate responsibility, namely to maintain price stability in the euro area.Within the framework of the Treaty establishing the European Community (EC Treaty), the GoverningCouncil shall be held accountable for the maintenance of price stability in accordance with itspublished definition. The Governing Council is neither responsible for the content of these projections,nor should its performance be judged against them. While macroeconomic projections are a usefulinstrument for undertaking the forward-looking assessment on which monetary policy decisions arebased, the limitations I have outlined imply that such projections cannot be the only tool used by theGoverning Council. The Governing Council should no more assume responsibility for the staffmacroeconomic projections than it does for the content of other analyses that constitute inputs into itspolicy decisions, such as the monetary analysis under the first pillar or the evaluation of developmentsin individual indicator variables or financial prices and yields. Assuming responsibility for one inputinto its decisions would detract from the Governing Council’s true responsibilities, first for monetarypolicy decisions and ultimately for the maintenance of price stability.Given the Governing Council’s overriding commitment to the maintenance of price stability, the onlyforecast for which it could take responsibility would be one that was consistent with price stability.
5BIS Review 109/2000Such a forecast - which, by its nature, would not change over time - would not, in itself, be veryinformative about the Governing Council’s assessment of the prevailing economic situation. TheGoverning Council’s own guidepost for the future was published at the outset in the form of itsquantitative definition of the ECB’s primary objective. This definition serves a different purpose,namely to anchor inflation expectations.Against this background, the published macroeconomic projections should not, under anycircumstances, be seen as calling into question the commitment of the Governing Council tomaintaining price stability over the medium term. The public, wage and price-setters, and all firms andhouseholds should continue to rely on the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability as the “bestprediction” of medium-term price developments, since the Governing Council is committed tochanging monetary policy whenever this is necessary to maintain price stability.The publication of staff macroeconomic projections thus informs the public about an important inputinto the Governing Council’s decision process, which has already been used in the past. Thepublication of projections has to be considered in the context of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.Publication thus changes neither the ECB’s monetary policy strategy nor the role of these projectionswithin it.I am convinced that publication of these staff projections can help to improve the ECB’s presentationand explanation of monetary policy decisions. However, if this is to be the case, the public - and theEuropean Parliament and your Committee - must recognise the limitations of forecasts and projectionsthat I have just described, and the implications these limitations have for the role of staff projections inthe ECB’s strategy.3.Cross-border retail payment services in the euro areaYou may recall that in September 1999 the ECB published a report presenting the views of theEurosystem on how to improve cross-border retail payment services and defining the objectives thatthe industry is expected to achieve by 1 January 2002. In September this year, the ECB published aprogress report. This report concludes that, although most objectives have not yet been fulfilled,substantial progress has been made in preparing the ground for a more efficient handling ofcross-border retail payments. Allow me to give you some examples:i. The banking sector has agreed on straight-through processing standards, which will allow theautomated execution of cross-border payments;ii. The Euro Banking Association has developed a payment system specifically designed forcross-border low-value payments, which commenced operations on 20 November 2000;iii. As from 2002, cross-border payments below EUR 12,500 will no longer need to be reportedfor balance of payments purposes and hence statistical reporting will no longer constitute ajustification for high customer fees.Insufficient progress has been made in the field of customer prices. In too many cases, the payee hasbeen charged with some costs even though the payer had agreed to bear all costs. Two initiativescurrently being developed by the European Credit Sector Associations are intended to address thissituation. First, a multilateral interbank exchange fee is being developed, which, provided that the feeis low, could be acceptable and could indeed contribute to solving the problem of “double-charging”.Second, and more importantly, a “basic” service will be defined which, for payment orders submittedin the correct format, should provide a guaranteed service level with attractive conditions in terms ofprice and execution time. The Eurosystem welcomes the idea of a basic service offer, but the progressreport went one step further by inviting banks to set up a “standard” cross-border payment service witha common name, to be provided by most banks in the euro area. Such a standard service wouldcontribute even more to greater price transparency and, consequently, enhanced competition.The progress report also recognises that the achievement of the objectives depends not only on banksbut also on companies and customers, who should include adequate information in invoices andpayment orders so as to facilitate straight-through processing. The Eurosystem is therefore urging the
BIS Review 109/20006banking industry to launch an information campaign and expects specific proposals by the end of2000. The organisation of such an information campaign would be greatly facilitated if a standardservice with a common name existed.The Eurosystem will continue to closely monitor the progress made by the banking industry withregard to the outstanding issues, as well as developments in customer prices, in order to ensure that thepreparations currently under way do ultimately translate into adequate services for European citizens.All options, including the operational involvement of the Eurosystem, will be retained, in case thesituation has not improved significantly by 2002.
1BIS Review 108/2000David Carse: Environmental issues and their implications for financialinstitutions in Hong KongKeynote Speech by Mr David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,at the Conference on Environmental Risk Management for Hong Kong Financial Institutions, held inHong Kong on 29 November 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,I am pleased to be here to deliver the keynote speech for this conference on Environmental RiskManagement for Hong Kong Financial Institutions.I congratulate the various organisers for putting together the conference, which I understand is the firstof its kind to be held in Hong Kong. If so, it is long overdue. Environmental issues have come verymuch to the forefront of public awareness in Hong Kong in recent years, and cleaning up theenvironment has become one of the Government’s main preoccupations. There are all sorts of goodreasons for wishing to do this, in terms of improving the quality of life and the long-term health andwell-being of the people of Hong Kong. But there is also a growing recognition on the part ofbusiness, both here and elsewhere, that economic growth is inextricably linked with a healthyenvironment. At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, business leaders voted global climatechange the most pressing issue facing the world’s business community. It is all the more disappointingtherefore that last week’s UN summit conference in The Hague on climate change should have endedin failure.At first sight it might appear that banks and other financial institutions, as service companies, have lessresponsibility for environmental protection than other companies, notably those whose industrialprocesses have a direct impact on the environment. However, this would be to ignore the central rolein the economy that banks have as financial intermediaries. While they may not be pollutersthemselves, they will probably have a banking relationship with some companies that are polluters orcould be in the future.This creates a number of risks for the banks, and raises the question of how these risks should beidentified, measured, monitored and controlled. This is primarily a matter for banks’ management todeal with, and I hope that today’s conference will help them to do so. But it is also an issue forbanking regulators, particularly with the increased focus on risk-based supervision. In the case of theHKMA, this is a process whereby we try to assess the extent to which banks are exposed to varioustypes of risk and the quality of the systems used for managing these risks. For this purpose, we haveidentified eight different types of risk: credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, legal,reputation and strategic.Environmental risk straddles a number of these risks. In particular, it is a subset of credit, legal andreputation risk:• Credit risk can arise indirectly where banks are lending to customers whose businesses areadversely affected by the costs of cleaning up pollution or by changes in environmentalregulations. For example, the costs of meeting new requirements on emission levels may besufficient to put some companies out of business. Banks may also find themselves directlyaffected if they find that the value of property that they have taken as collateral is impairedby contamination.• Legal risk can take a number of different forms. Most obviously, banks like othercompanies are at risk if they themselves do not comply with relevant environmentallegislation. But more specifically, they are at risk of direct lender liability for clean-up costsor claims for damages if they have actually taken possession of contaminated or pollution-
BIS Review 108/20002causing property as a result of realising security. There is also the even more worryingprospect that in some jurisdictions the mere act of lending to a company or project whichcauses environmental problems may lead to the lender incurring some liability for clean-upcosts. Banks may protest, with some justification, that they should not be forced into the roleof “environmental police”, but this may carry little weight in some courts.• Reputation risk may arise even in the absence of lender liability, particularly if banks areseen as associated with large-scale projects that are viewed as socially or environmentallydamaging, such as dam projects. The growth of globalised protest movements and the use ofthe internet to disseminate information have greatly increased the risk that individualcompanies will be the subject of concerted campaigns of public criticism.These are the risks, but it would also be wrong to ignore the opportunities that environmentalprotection can provide for banks and other financial institutions. Most obviously, the costs of cleaningup pollution and the need to invest in environmentally friendly technology imply the need for finance,either from the banks or the capital markets. Just to take one small example in the Hong Kong context,the Government’s initiative to persuade diesel taxi owners to switch to LPG taxis creates the chancefor the banks to finance the purchase of the new vehicles. Banks also need to bear in mind that whilethere will be losers from the drive to cut pollution, there will also be winners in the shape of thosecompanies which can exploit the new technologies to curb emissions.Another by-product from efforts to combat climate change will be the growth of emissions tradingbetween companies. Such trading allows companies that can reduce their carbon emissions belowallotted targets to sell their surplus credits to those companies that cannot reach their targets.Admittedly, the immediate future of emissions trading is in some doubt following the Hagueconference, but it still has the potential to become a major commodity market. If so, there willinevitably be a role for financial institutions to broker deals between buyers and sellers of emissioncredits, and perhaps to take positions themselves.Finally, banks and other financial institutions can profit from the growing public awareness ofenvironmental issues by offering “green” investment products.How do banks in Hong Kong measure up in terms of environmental issues? As an internationalfinancial centre, Hong Kong provides a base for a number of multinational banks that have developeddetailed environmental policies and procedures. In the case of local and regional banks, I would saythat environmental issues are less highly articulated. This is why I welcome this conference and theinvolvement in it of the Hong Kong Association of Banks.It is not my purpose in this speech to anticipate the more detailed advice that subsequent speakers aregoing to offer. But I would like to offer a few general recommendations that banks should take intoaccount in dealing with environmental issues.First, banks should keep themselves informed about international and regional initiatives on theenvironment, particularly those that directly concern financial institutions.In this connection, I would draw the attention of those institutions that are not already aware of it tothe work of the United Nations Environment Programme (“UNEP”). This is the main UN institutionthat deals with environmental questions. As part of its work, it has established a Financial InstitutionsInitiative on the Environment which is a partnership between UNEP and leading banking andinsurance companies to promote sustainable development and environmentally sound businesspractices. The basic role of the Initiative is to promote the integration of environmental considerationsinto all aspects of the financial sector’s operations and services.One of the products of the Initiative is a “Statement by Financial Institutions on the Environment andSustainable Development” (which is appended to this speech). The Statement includes a commitmentby financial institutions to contribute towards sustainable development, to adopt a precautionaryapproach to environmental management and to foster public awareness and communication of theirenvironmental policies. Over 160 institutions have signed up to the statement, but none I regret fromHong Kong, except those which have done so by virtue of being part of international banking groups. Iwould therefore urge banks in Hong Kong to consider becoming signatories to the Statement, and to
3BIS Review 108/2000familiarise themselves with the work of the Initiative more generally. You will find that the variouscomponents of the work of the Initiative, including annual roundtable meetings, provide much usefulpractical guidance to financial institutions on how to tackle environmental issues.Secondly, in line with the UNEP Statement referred to above, banks should consider producinga formal environmental policy statement and making this publicly available.Such a statement should represent an acknowledgement by the bank that it must take environmentalimplications into account in its business operations, decisions and processes. This should include itsown use of energy and resources and how it interacts with customers. However, on its own, a policyruns the risk of becoming a “motherhood” statement. Policies should therefore be backed up bymanagement structures and systems, specific objectives, action plans and monitoring procedures toensure that concrete results are achieved. Banks should also issue regular environmental reports thatinform the outside world of their progress in meeting their environmental objectives. This is one areawhere the public sector has taken the lead in Hong Kong. Following the Chief Executive’s 1998Policy Address all Government bureaux and departments (including the HKMA) are now required topublish annual reports on their environmental policies and actions.Thirdly, banks should where appropriate build environmental risk assessments into their creditdecisions.This follows from my earlier comments about environment and credit risk. Of course, detailedenvironmental risk assessment will not be appropriate in all cases. At its most general, environmentalconsiderations are simply part of the process of “know your customer” - in other words, being awareof the nature of his business and industrial operations, and being alive to the possibility that that theremay be an environmental angle. In particular cases, however, more detailed assessment andquantification of the environmental risks will be required. This will be the case, for example, whereland is being taken as security or where the borrower is involved in a high-risk industry such aschemicals. Obviously, the larger the bank’s exposure, the more important the environmental riskassessment becomes. Taken to the extreme, where the bank is involved in the financing of a large-scale project such as the construction of a power plant, a full environmental impact assessment shouldbe obtained from a professional and independent expert.One point that is particularly relevant to banks that finance companies or projects in countries likeChina is that the rules of the environmental game can change very quickly. The authorities in Chinaare getting serious about cutting emissions and pollution, as the requirement by the Beijing MunicipalGovernment on the Shougang Steel Group to cut back its output has shown. The problem in China isthat regulations are not always strictly enforced. But this can change overnight, resulting in majorcompliance problems for the companies concerned and increased risk for the banks that have lent tothem. Hong Kong banks which lend into China would therefore be well advised to keep this in mind.Finally, banks should pay close regard to their own “corporate ecology”.Banks can contribute to environmental protection by the way in which they manage their use ofresources in their own operations. In this way banks can be responsible corporate citizens while at thesame time reducing business costs. The type of measures that can be adopted include saving on energyconsumption, recycling of paper, waste management, purchasing environmentally friendly productsand use of video conferencing to cut down on unnecessary travel. Use of office automation such asemail can also help to reduce the consumption of paper, provided of course that staff can beencouraged not to print out the messages. The important aspect of this, as with other areas ofenvironmental management, is to try to set measurable objectives for green initiatives, to assignmanagement responsibility for monitoring performance and to offer staff guidance and training onhow to achieve the desired results. As noted earlier, the progress should be communicated to theoutside world in the bank’s environmental report.I would like to close by expressing my appreciation for being allowed the opportunity to speak to youtoday on this important topic. Doing the research for my speech has certainly helped to raise my ownawareness of the importance of environmental issues in general and the implications of these forfinancial institutions in particular. I hope that you will find this conference to be useful and
BIS Review 108/20004informative, and that you will pick up lessons and advice on environmental issues that you can takeback with you to build into your business operations and decisions. The need to do this is the keynoteof my speech and the main theme of this conference.

1BIS Review 108/2000M R Chatu Mongol Sonakul: Some ideas for the new government in ThailandStatement by Mr M R Chatu Mongol Sonakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the BritishChamber of Commerce, Bangkok, on 23 November 2000.*      *      *Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce and all the chambers here today, distinguished guests,and ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon.Let me begin by saying that it behoves me, and I have to use that word as a career civil servant whohas taken his duty righteously for the last 35 years, not to comment on the work of the presentgovernment especially during an election period. In any case what they have done is fast becominghistory and we have to take it as facts. A datum from which we will have to operate.In my career, I have been unenthusiastic in commenting about history, and only study it with a view tocreating the future rather than commenting on it. If I wanted to comment on history, I guess I wouldhave continued my dual career as a university lecturer which ended abruptly after the first year of myworking life, since I found the responsibility of turning up regularly on time every week for anythingquite unbearable as well as preferring to be on the implementation side rather than a commentator oranalyst.I shall keep my comments mainly therefore to what the new government should do, be it really a newgovernment or just the old one in a new bottle, and I shall refer only to the present or historicaldevelopments only in so far as it is necessary to understand future recommendations.As this is an after lunch speech, I shall also keep it short and not try to be comprehensive, but onlycomment on things that interest me or I think might be useful to the audience.Let’s start with a simple concept, the Credit Bureau. One of the reasons the NPL could become sohigh, and banks with high NPLs could remain supported by the public, is because in the present lawthe concept is that financial transactions are secret and banks are secret places, looked after and ownedand supervised by responsible people.It would be nice if it were true, but the banking industry is leveraged by a ratio of 12:1 and thetemptation is rather great for the owner to take advantage of other people’s money, people who haveno right to know what is going on with their money even once a year because they are notshareholders but just depositors. The temptation of the supervisors to evade their responsibilities bynot taking the correct action is also great, as rich people are powerful, and bad political systems over along time do not help to make you brave.This philosophy must be changed. We must go on to the philosophy of transparency where offencesand important financial ratios or numbers are publicised, and peer or investor pressure could be usedto reduce the flow of resources to wrong-doers.Back to the Credit Bureau, of course, borrowers are very important in all this. Banks shouldn’t lend tobad borrowers, and banks that lend to bad borrowers are bad banks. But how can banks not lend to badborrowers, if they don’t know who they are? There are, of course, alternative remedies, but the bestinstrument is to have an industry-wide Credit Bureau which keeps track of the credit standing ofborrowers.This is not possible at present because the law does not allow you to disclose clients’ information. TheBank of Thailand has required that prospective borrowers and renewals must sign a form declaringthat they will allow their credit standings to be disclosed, but this is a feeble alternative. It is very timeconsuming and argumentative, with all its consequences. A Credit Bureau Law should be quicklylegislated, where, as a price for a better society, bad debtors can be identified.
BIS Review 108/20002As to commercial banks, good governance should be put in place. Audit committees are now required.Independent directors, not voted upon by the major shareholders, are being encouraged. NPL, relatedlending and fines and penalties imposed must be disclosed by each bank at the end of every month,and are published in the BOT’s web.Directors must devote their time to the bank, cannot be a director of more than three otherprofit-seeking companies, as well as disallowing of borrowing where cross ownership is more thanone percent of the paid up capital of the borrower.Of the 92 people involved, 53 have now complied, and arrangements have been made for most of theothers to comply, with the possible exception of the representatives of the Ministry of Finance whomay find that their representatives are not the sort of people who can devote that much time to thebank because they are not part of the ownership or operation of the bank, but are just governmentrepresentatives. We are looking into this and will discuss with the Ministry when the time is right.The problem in fact is not as innocuous as it looks as state bank remunerations are affected byconsiderations other than just how should directors be rewarded so that shareholders’ value can bemaximised.But all this is being done through sanctions and coercion, and in the New Commercial Bank Act theauthority will be explicit.My last words on commercial banks, the intervened banks might not yet be completely taken care of,but at least the cost of rescue can now be well estimated. The proper financing of the debt burden isprobably one of the first jobs of the new government.Temporary or provisional financing is better than none, but a clear-cut schedule on how the very largedebt should be financed over the next ten or twenty years must be made if investors and tradingpartners are to have confidence or a clear idea of what they are dealing with, and I think that isessential.How central banking will be done is also important. The Bank of Thailand itself is beingrevolutionised. The pay system will change, the promotion system will change and careerdevelopment has been instituted. Risk management supervision will be instituted from the first ofJanuary next year.Simple things such as a letter of transmittal of the supervision team to the manager of the bank will berequired. This may seem trivial, but it will put responsibility firmly on the supervisors, which wasnever possible before because supervision missions went whenever they felt like it and did not tellanybody except the banks. It also makes job control of the supervisors impossible and it is verydangerous to allow people with criminal prosecution capabilities to work in this manner.The most important thing about the new central bank though is probably to keep it really independent.Thailand is now quite a complicated place, a large economy with considerable sophistication. The roleof the central bank in helping finance development and directing among the sectors of the economywill soon no longer be possible.If the central bank could keep the economy stable, that would be a major achievement.But most forces in the country, especially the political ones, are directed towards higher growth ratherthan the sustainability or stable growth, even if in the end stability would probably lead to a better andhigher level of the economy than the roller coaster growth of the past.To do that, the central bank will have to go against the rest of the economy and the government fromtime to time as has been evident in the past year or two. If the central bank is not independent, it willbe very difficult to do this.In my mind, the best model of central banking is one where the central bank becomes a constitutionalbody of parliament just like the Election Commission or The National Frequency Management Board.This doesn’t mean that we have to change the constitution because the constitution differs fromordinary law mainly in so far as it supersedes ordinary law and the procedure for changing its
3BIS Review 108/2000provisions are rather complicated. By ordinary legislation, we could make the central bank a body ofparliament or the senate which is what other new central bank legislations now usually do.This doesn’t mean either that the central bank will be operating monetary policy independent of theeconomic and social policy of the government. The two must be made to intertwine and clearlegislation should be made for the procedures for the central bank at appropriate intervals to agreemonetary targets with the government and then to be allowed to implement its work independently andunimpeded.But I guess there’s no point in talking much about it now. Let’s wait and see what mandate peoplegive during the election. The only obvious thing is that the present Senate seems to be quite qualifiedto take up such an important role as safeguarding the central bank.Let me continue on what the new government has to look at, for instance the general guarantee ondeposit. This general guarantee cuts across all good banking practices. Banks that misbehave are notbeing penalised and those that try to do well are dragged down by those who are capricious with thegeneral guarantee that the government gives.The general guarantee will have to be got rid of sooner rather than later if Thailand is to get back on aneven path. Probably, in order to do this, some kind of deposit insurance will have to be in place andseen to be working.It does look like a long road for the new government, where sequencing and implementation of manydifficult concepts is still needed before full prosperity returns.Let’s start on this road to prosperity as soon as possible.Ladies and gentlemen, let me turn to the general economy because a central bank or commercial banksalone cannot make the country good very quickly.It is quite obvious that world grain prices are on the way down. Between the years 1800-1900 whenthe West was being opened in the United States, grain prices fell over 30% over a span of a century.With genetic engineering, something of a similar nature might happen over the next 20 or 50 years.We have to plan our still agricultural-dominated population for this eventuality.It does not make sense to base strategy on an expansion of production in a falling market. It makesmuch more sense to base strategy on cost reduction and to add value to the final agricultural products.A ton of grain may be worth 10,000 baht, but a ton of biscuits is worth 100,000 baht. But to makebiscuits, you need a brand and you need flavours, things which take a long time to develop and endowto the economy.As to agricultural finance, the most that is available at the moment is crop finance. But you can’t makethe weather to order. The bad year will kill you, and a mechanism must be developed to finance thedisaster of the bad years from the abundance of the good years rather than leaving it to pot luck or tothe effort of individual farmers as at present.Again in the same vein, resources must be made available for farmers to better their productionmethods or change the nature of their farming so that costs can be reduced or farmers can change tomore valuable products needing bigger investments or having larger gestation periods. No doubt indoing this, old debts, being quite considerable and pervasive, will also have to be looked at.In industry, the problems and the roles of the SMEs are obvious. There is no major industrial economywithout SMEs. I would say that over half the SMEs are NPL. And a lot of the owners have abandonedtheir old companies because they don’t need historic records or quota, for instance. They could assumesome other identity and live another life and become SMEs again in a not too difficult way, but it is abig burden on the banks.A lot of SMEs can’t do that because they need past performance records. Efforts to prod these SMEsinto viability are obviously going to need some government assistance. The problem is too big forcommercial banks to handle alone.
BIS Review 108/20004The government has made some efforts in improving the technology, marketing and management ofthe SMEs. How well it has done this depends on who you ask and I am not really in the field of theSMEs well enough to know the generality of what most people are thinking.But in financing, it is quite obvious that the SMEs with NPL have to get some more money or someguarantees, and one or the other must come from the government. This happens to be the one areawhere, for various reasons, there is the least progress. The new government must take a look at thisimmediately and bite the bullet and adopt what might well be necessarily a fairly costly solution.Another important or strategic sector of the economy is probably tourism with Thailand well-situatedin the air routes of the world.But people don’t want to spend 50 weeks in a year or half of their life, whichever the case, and thenspend time in an inhospitable location. We have to clean up, especially the visual environment ofBangkok, and the major historical sites of Ayuthaya, Sri Satchanalai and Chiengmai. Putting theelectric power line for these cities underground, for instance, would be a most expensive investment,but worthwhile, and the new government must immediately begin to adopt long-term solutions likethese.The last area of the private sector which I would like to talk about today is the Stock Exchange ofThailand.The Stock Exchange of Thailand lacks sophistication. It has only just begun to allow short selling,which is essential to allow liquidity in a controlled manner. Derivatives are very rare, and this isanother area which needs development to reduce the various risks associated with the market, but ofcourse, one should only do it under well known rules, and personally I think only to a limited extent,not to the extent that the beneficiaries are mainly the intermediaries as might be the case in a reallylarge, sophisticated market.As to the scale of the market, I have been visiting MSCI and other important players in the world. Itreally is quite easy to improve our market performance. Presently, Thai market requirements aredesigned only to fit the Thai requirements. Requirements that are often self-destructive and unrealleading us into the bubble of 1997.The market in the Stock Exchange has not been much changed from the bubble days. It’s still doingthe same thing, just without the bubble. Realistically, our rules will have to be changed so that it willcomply with and take advantage of rather than be penalised by international norms.In government, the Board of Investment (BOI) is probably a crucial instrument. It’s doing a good jobgiving privileges on an individual project basis. That has its own limitations and faults. It might wellsoon be the time to make operating in Thailand generally viable.The original BOI philosophy, in that these are projects you wouldn’t get if you didn’t give taxprivileges and therefore have no tax loss costs, is becoming more and more untenable. Generally,systems are working better and the economy is getting bigger and bigger and more and moresophisticated; doing exemptions on a project basis, except in very rare cases, will soon hold us back.The new government should take that last hurdle and make the general system acceptable, even ifminimally by lowering taxes and making improvement in civil service performance, probably bymaking the civil service remunerated by output and productivity rather than the tenure system as atpresent.That leads to my comment on the long term initiatives that the government might carry out that wouldhelp in the long run, which I think is the main strategy for real recovery to take place. Without goodlong run prospects, there isn’t much hope to do well in the present.The government will have to be moved more on to the private sector footing. This doesn’t mean justselling state enterprises and such things. But it does mean that the government units that are retainedwould have to work for incentives in terms of output and cost reduction and have to, in general,compete with the private sector for government budget.
5BIS Review 108/2000Generally, the private sector is not necessarily more efficient than the government. The key is thatthose that are not don’t survive and better ones expand. This doesn’t happen in the governmentbecause those that are inefficient just ask for some more budget, and this is forcibly collected.In my own view, large complicated government units are probably not possible in Thailand unless weget some fantastic new government which is very sophisticated and lasts a very long time, say, 10 or20 years, a prospect, which presently one should not plan on. In this case, one should then designgovernment units to be small independent units, independently managed, and the governments thatcome in execute their mandate through budget allocation and legislative changes where necessary.Interestingly, all over the world for a very long time, the concept has been that civil servants have a lotof authority and are not profit-oriented. One should make sure that they have tenure and are wellcompensated with pensions after they leave, otherwise they might try to stock up some assets for theirlater life.The philosophy is going in the opposite direction everywhere now. Civil servants are powerful andimportant and therefore they should not have tenure. For that reason one must make sure that civilservants perform by giving them only limited term contracts, and they will have to performresponsibly and efficiently to get a new contract.I am inclined more towards the latter as one can never make sure of hiring or promoting the rightperson, and therefore one should plan on an easy change of personnel to get the best results.Let me make a controversial statement on the platforms of the various political parties in terms ofspending more and taxing less. We routinely run the general equilibrium model and the inflationtargeting model as well as Market Implied Models or MIME, a technical word that is used for trying tofind things out from people’s normal actions that could be captured in a data system.We also, of course, do single equation estimates as well as pure intuition from graphs and tables andsuch things.Our staff is generally of the opinion that increased expenditure and tax reduction of moderate amountswill not destabilise the economy.This is predominantly because the economy is still very docile with a capacity utilisation stable forquite a while now at 58%. Cost push inflation from the exchange rate and the oil prices are nowsubstantially absorbed or have been passed on, so cost push also is not presently much of a factor.The important thing though is how to make expenditure useful and constructive in the long runwithout too much leakage. The important thing is how to make tax cuts reasonable and directedtowards the areas where people benefiting from the cuts could utilise it for a spate of new investment.If this were to happen the debt to GDP ratio might not increase significantly due to the resultingincrease in GDP over the long term.With abundant liquidity and low interest rates, this is not just a time for a general tax cut for its ownsake, but a program must be designed for it to be directed to where investment could best be made. Ina way, this is not as easy as it seems, because generally we have been over investing and have greatovercapacity.But it’s also not as hard as it might look. There are only a few areas that are really doing well, andbenefits from the cuts could be directed there. The problem is how to make it fairly just, so that notonly the good players that are already there benefit, but new players should be brought in to these allimportant areas.Ladies and gentlemen, I have been giving you some of my thoughts on the economy. Thoughts thatare spotty and veer obviously somewhat to the financial aspects.The new government must be much more comprehensive. But since this is not a party platform butonly some comments to make more apparent the effect of what might happen in the next few monthsin the hope that, as in all things, elucidation and transparency makes for a more stable market, let metherefore not bother you further with my thoughts and stop at this point.
BIS Review 108/20006Let us hope we will have a good new government, with new ideas to bring Thailand into the future andtake Thailand into that most important next level of development, a more comfortable life, and a morestable growth.
1BIS Review 107/2000Lars Heikensten: Monetary policy in SwedenSpeech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the AutumnConference of the Centre for Business and Policy Studies, held in Stockholm on 17 November 2000.*      *      *Thank you for the invitation to talk about monetary policy. If my memory serves me right, this is thefifth autumn conference I have addressed as deputy central bank governor. For me, the annualopportunity of discussing monetary policy with some of our country’s leading economists andeconomic observers has become a very enjoyable tradition.I shall begin, as usual, with a brief account of the past year, taking 1999’s October assessment as mystarting point. Even though our appraisal of inflation at that time was relatively optimistic, theoutcome has been better than we foresaw. Developments in the past year raise questions about theeconomy’s inflation propensity. That topic was already up for discussion at last year’s conference,though the reason then was that several leading observers considered the risks of inflation were beingunderestimated by the Riksbank. A third matter I shall be talking about is our monetary policyguidelines. In the past year we have been criticised for basing repo rate decisions on appraisals that aretoo narrow. Finally, I shall be looking ahead and commenting on our view of inflation in the comingyears.Inflation in the past twelve monthsIn the third Inflation Report last year the Riksbank’s growth forecast for Sweden in the coming yearswas revised upwards. This mainly mirrored a more favourable outlook for international activity; it alsoseemed likely that domestic demand would be stronger than had been expected earlier. Our overallgrowth forecast agreed with most other observers. Some predictions, however, did include an evenstronger increase in household consumption, the reason being that rising asset prices in general and thestock market boom in particular were judged to lead to a markedly increased consumption propensity.Our higher growth forecast was accompanied by little change in the assessment of inflation we hadpresented earlier in the year. Thus, we judged that the relationship between growth and inflation wouldbe more favourable than we had previously calculated. In this respect we differed from many otherobservers and that occasioned a good deal of discussion.The background to our forecast was that inflation’s path had been surprisingly favourable and that,instead of being just a result of occasional factors, this had to do with more fundamental features in theeconomy that would continue to influence inflation up to our two-year horizon.Here is a picture of our inflation assessment last October and the outcome (Chart 1). I have chosen topresent it in terms of UND1X because that is the indicator of inflation on which monetary policy hasbeen focused in the past year. The chart also shows the price of imports and an indicator of underlyingdomestic inflation, UNDINHX. As you will see, we believed inflation would move up gradually in thewake of rising activity. This would be countered by low, even falling, import prices in connection witha stronger exchange rate, lower oil prices and generally strong global competition.Even our inflation forecast was evidently on the high side, at least to date. It is perhaps even morenoteworthy that underlying domestic inflation has turned out to be appreciably lower. This issomething that observers of the Swedish economy cannot ignore, particularly as the past decade hasprovided so many surprises of this sort, though not as dramatic. The main point to consider is, ofcourse, how permanent the changes are likely to be. To what extent should we abandon earlierrelationships and commit ourselves to a continuation of the relationships that have applied in recentyears?
BIS Review 107/20002Why has inflation been low?The first thing to note is that this development has not been confined to Sweden. Inflation in manyother countries has also been unexpectedly low. There, too, the reasons for this are not entirely clear.Some pieces of the puzzle have been identified but not enough to make up a clear picture. Asdecision-makers, however, we cannot simply shrug our shoulders and say we don’t know. Decisionshave to be made and it would not be reasonable to go on acting as though nothing had changed untilsufficiently long time series are available for econometric analyses.Recently I had the pleasure of chairing a central bank seminar that the BIS arranged on just theseissues. My impression was that it has proved difficult to produce definite evidence of any structuralshift in the relationships that govern inflation, such as various versions of the Phillips curve. In manycountries, including Sweden, appraisals of resource utilisation, for example, are now more optimistic.As you are no doubt aware, in the past five years our output gap estimates have in fact been revised anumber of times. One explanation I find fairly plausible is that after the profound crisis in the early1990s we simply misjudged the size of the gap. There is also some support for the possibility thatproductivity has followed a more favourable trend than expected, thereby reducing the risk ofbottlenecks. Total factor productivity, for instance, has been on a rising trend since 1993. Anotherpossibility is that, for various reasons, the labour market is functioning more efficiently. Oneindication of this is that rapidly falling unemployment in recent years has not been accompanied byacute labour shortages. Perhaps I should mention that we have also detected certain changes ininflation relationships. In a box in one of last year’s inflation reports, for example, we found that theimpact on inflation from a given output gap has decreased; one explanation for this could have to dowith inflation expectations being more stable.At the BIS seminar, moreover, two papers provided indications of changes in relationships behind theprices of imported goods. That agrees with the picture we have formed in recent years. Thepass-through to inflation from exchange rate movements, for example, is lower than before. This maybe connected with stronger competition at various levels. It also seems clear that permanent exchangerate adjustments have price effects that differ from and are greater than those elicited by movementsthat are a natural part of today’s flexible regime.In any event, in the last few years there have also unquestionably been favourable effects from thederegulation of electricity and telecom markets. Even though similar changes of equal importance forthe rate of price increases in the coming years are not easy to identify today, both deregulations andgenerally growing competition will presumably be important features in the picture of inflation.Another point worth making is that in a world where monetary policy with a more independentmandate is focused on low inflation in a growing number of countries, low inflation as such is
3BIS Review 107/2000presumably an important factor. That is really what the textbooks teach us to expect, with theirstandard message that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, determined precisely by monetary policy.Inflation expectations that are low and stable clearly help to combat inflation.But I believe the low-inflation policy has wider implications. It is presumably one factor behind therecent improvement in trend productivity in Sweden. Firms today are exposed to considerably strongerpressure to change than they were in the 1980s. The conditions for labour market negotiations havealso changed in ways that may well have positive effects on unit labour costs and thereby on inflation.Another consequence is that measures for strengthening competition have suddenly become politicallyrelevant in ways that were not the case at least when I was working on such questions in the 1980s.Deregulation and the enhancement of competition can now have positive effects that are directlyevident in the form of low inflation and thereby lower interest rates and higher economic growth.Moreover, with the division of responsibilities that now applies in stabilisation policy, fiscal policy isfreer to focus on long-term issues and structural matters.The Riksbank’s way of workingI should now like to comment briefly on how the Riksbank works and on the implementation of ourso-called rule of action. These matters have featured in the general debate in the past year, presumablyjust because inflation and our inflation forecasts have continued to provide relatively weak argumentsfor raising the repo rate even though activity is strong.In simple terms, the Riksbank can be said to formulate monetary policy on the basis of inflation’sforecast rate, in the first place one to two years ahead. If inflation is expected to be above the 2%target during this time horizon, the interest rate is normally raised and vice versa.This rule was formulated with a view to making policy more intelligible, to ourselves as well as toothers. We also believed a rule of this kind would serve as a structure for decision-making and help toenhance confidence in monetary policy. In my opinion, the rule has served these purposes. It hascontributed, not least, to a more structured discussion of monetary policy issues and thereby to adeeper understanding of the choices we have to make.Have we observed our rule? Judging from this chart, I would say we have (Chart 2). The chart showsthe repo rate in practice together with the path indicated by the Riksbank’s inflation assessments. Youwill see that we have followed our forecasts fairly closely and thus adhered to our rule of action.Deviations have occurred, mainly in the early years with the inflation target; I believe they werelargely connected with concern about the exchange rate.The Repo rate in practice andthe rule of action2,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,510,51992199319931994199419941995199519961996199619971997199719971998199819981998TimePercentSource: Jansson and Vredin, The Riksbank (2000) 
BIS Review 107/20004While I accordingly consider that a rule of this kind is of considerable value, I must underscore thatwe never intended to implement it mechanically. What matters is that we secure our objective in thelonger run, really for ever.We chose to focus on the period from twelve to twenty-four months ahead for a number of reasons.One reason for not having a shorter target horizon is the time lag that applies before an interest rateadjustment normally affects the economy and inflation. But effects do arise in the shorter run, forinstance via the exchange rate. We pay less heed to developments more than two years ahead partlybecause forecasting the longer term is normally difficult. Still, although monetary policy is guidedmainly by prospects one to two years ahead, there are normally grounds for paying some attention toforecasts both for the coming year and for the period beyond the two-year horizon.Neither is it reasonable in practice to focus solely on inflation. For one thing, the Riksbank is alsoaccountable for the proper functioning of the payment system in general, for financial stability. Foranother, without prejudicing these two objectives, the antecedents to the Riksbank Act require us topromote other economic policy goals, such as good economic growth and increased employment. Thisamounts in practice to trying to make decisions that avoid major shocks and fluctuations in growth andemployment.Highly respectable reasons can thus be found for deviating from the rule of action. If we decide to doso, however, we must have good arguments and present them particularly clearly. General talk offinancial imbalances, for example, will not do. As I see it, we must be clear about which balances weare referring to and why we consider they threaten the economic future. Another point to bear in mindis that the rule of action with a two-year horizon should normally give us sufficient time in which toadjust the monetary stance.Before turning to my last topic, I can mention that from time to time we are exhorted to be morepragmatic and less tied down by our intellectual framework. It is quite often suggested that we shouldfollow the example of the Federal Reserve in recent years under Alan Greenspan. I find that basicallynaive. Policy principles that are less clear-cut, combined with less transparency about motives and soon, would by no means guarantee a more successful policy in the longer run. Just the reverse, I wouldsay, in the light of quite a few years in the vicinity of decision-making in economic policy.Economic outlook in the coming yearsA suitable starting point for a discussion of the economic future is the October Inflation Report. Ourassessment there assumed that international economic activity will tend to slacken but still remainrelatively strong. We counted on GDP growth in the OECD area being 3.8% this year, followed in thenext two years by 3.0 and 2.7%, respectively. Inflation would remain relatively low, partly in view ofstrong competition in the international markets.Growth in Sweden was judged to be 4% this year, 3.7% next year and 3.0% in 2002. Domesticdemand growth would be relatively high for consumption as well as investment. A damper wasexpected, however, from an appreciation of the krona. A gradual increase in inflation was predicted, sothat two years ahead the rate would be approximately in line with our target.As usual, we identified various risks in our forecast. One was the possibility of the oil price staying ata high level. We also considered that the exchange rate might be weaker than economic fundamentalsin Sweden would warrant in the longer run. Another risk was that of higher wage increases. It wasconceivable that the wage rise would be even higher than the annual rate of just over 4% we hadassumed for the coming two years, due, for example, to far-reaching demands for compensation andparity. The main downside risk - lower inflation than in the main scenario - lay in favourable surprisesof the kind we have seen earlier in the relationship between growth and inflation.So how does this picture from October stand up today? Fairly well, in my opinion.
5BIS Review 107/2000Price movements to date have been broadly in line with the forecast. And as we expected, there havebeen signs that international activity is slackening. This is most evident in the United States but evensome slowing of growth in Europe seems likely in the coming years.In Sweden, too, there are indications that activity has become calmer. Growth still seems to be highbut households as well as firms have become less optimistic about the future. Order books are notgrowing as drastically as before. In general, this is in line with what we foresaw in October. But ofcourse we are keeping a close watch on developments. A more dramatic course cannot be ruled out,particularly in the United States. The oil price remains high and the krona has weakened. So in theserespects, developments are more in line with the risk spectrum than with our main scenario.Share prices, as we all know, have been volatile in the past six months but the fall to date is not amajor cause for concern. As I mentioned earlier, during 1999 and early this year a number of observerssaw rising share prices as a strong reason why the Swedish economy might become overheated. At theRiksbank we were more inclined to wait and see. There is no reason now to adopt a different view andexaggerate the risks of the share price fall. Consumption is being sustained in the first place by astrong development of income that stems from increased employment, a good increase in real wagesand a fiscal stance that is less restrictive than before.There is some cause for concern in the present round of wage negotiations. In a sense, that isinevitably the case when many settlements are being concluded simultaneously and the wage share isapproximately two-thirds of the economy. That means that no other single factor is anything like asimportant as the wage trend for the path of the Swedish economy in the coming years. The picture ofthe negotiations that are now beginning is mixed. The outcome to date has been a positive surprise. Italso looks as though the negotiating parties are formulating their bids on the basis of the inflationtarget. Moreover, the available picture of future wage expectations looks relatively good (Chart 3).Here we see the wage outcome, wage expectations and unfilled job vacancies. It is evidently becomingincreasingly difficult to find the right people for the jobs that are advertised. This presumably makesthe risk of wage drift greater than in previous years. Moreover, the wage demands that have beenpresented are higher than before the previous round of negotiations.Wage outcome, wage expectations Nov-00 andunfilled job vacanciesPer cent and thousands, respectively01234567819941996199820002002051015202530354045Faktisk lön (vänster skala)Arbetsmarknadens förväntningar nov-00 (vänster skala)Kvarstående lediga platser (höger skala)Sources: Prospera Research AB and Statistics SwedenWafe outcome (left scale)Wage expectations (left scale)Unfilled vacancies (right scale)
BIS Review 107/20006When it comes to judging future inflationary pressure, the degree of resource utilisation is the crucialconcept, at least as long as inflation expectations are parked around the 2% target. The next chart isinstructive here (Chart 4). As you know, we estimate total resource utilisation econometrically interms of the output gap. If we take the October estimates as a starting point and project them with theaccompanying GDP forecast, we find that for the first time in a number of years we look like havingfull or more than full resource utilisation in the years ahead. Perhaps the picture exaggerates the risk offuture inflationary tensions. The cyclical position, for example, may be somewhat calmer than wecounted on in October. But even with a growth rate of just over 3%, the Swedish economy would beexpanding more rapidly than we believe it is capable of in the longer run.Let me conclude by underscoring what I mentioned initially, namely that forecasting inflation proveddifficult in the 1990s, in Sweden as well as elsewhere. There have been substantial changes in oureconomies, partly because policy now focuses on stability and competition has become stronger invarious ways. Inflation in Sweden has been a positive surprise in recent years even though activity hasbeen rising strongly, so further positive surprises should naturally not be ruled out. Still, there are nowmany indications that resource utilisation is relatively high and will go on rising. That implies that,little by little, inflationary pressure will grow.We will be presenting a comprehensive assessment of inflation prospects in the December InflationReport. In that context we will also be deciding the repo rate. Recent developments have not alteredthe picture I formed in October. Although it is still too early to specify when, there will presumably begrounds for increasing the repo rate in the future.Econometric estimates of the output gap.Per cent of potential GDP-8-6-4-2024198019841988199219962000-8-6-4-2024PFHPUCSource: The Riksbank
1BIS Review 107/2000Alan Greenspan: Technology and bankingSpeech by Mr Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the sixth annual reception for regulators, sponsored by Women in Housing and Finance,Washington, DC on 20 November 2000.*      *      *I am pleased to join you this evening, and would like to thank Diane Casey, your former president, aswell as Nancy Camm and the current officers for inviting me to participate. Women in Housing andFinance certainly deserves commendation for its twenty very successful years of providing a forum forindividuals, particularly women, from across the spectrum of participants in the financial servicesindustry to exchange views on policies and market developments. More important, I want to applaudthe energy with which your organization is approaching its next decades of service. Clearly, we havewitnessed a rapid evolution of financial markets in recent years, and the likelihood of continuingfundamental change is high. Your work in studying and interpreting these changes will be no lesschallenging in the years ahead than in the twenty past.The remarkable innovations and adaptations that have permeated many aspects of our economy,especially in the most recent years of your history, are a part of the ongoing process of creativedestruction that moves our economic potential forward as new technologies displace the old. Over thepast decade, we have witnessed an acceleration of this process of change, not only in the real economybut in finance as well, with innovations that have swept through the banking, mortgage finance, andsecurities industries. These innovations have brought with them new products and services, and, ofnecessity, evolution in the approaches required of both managers and regulators. The unbundling ofrisk that accompanies the deconstruction of financial products into their constituent parts hasrevolutionized finance, irreversibly transforming the way services are provided, as well as by whom.What is particularly impressive is that, fueled by both computing and telecommunications capabilities,the pace of financial innovation does not appear to be slowing. Technological advance has expandedthe scope and utility of our financial products and - as I noted - has increased the ability to unbundlerisks. It has also promoted the faster and freer flow of information throughout the financial system: weare quickly moving to real-time systems, not only with transactions but also with knowledge.Of course, the process of change poses challenges to the institutions competing to adapt to theevolving needs of businesses and consumers. And it challenges those of us here this evening- policymakers, supervisors, and regulators - who are being pressed to reevaluate how we meet ourresponsibilities.Although the safety net necessitates greater government oversight, in recent years rapidly changingtechnology has begun to render obsolete much of the examination regime established in earlierdecades. Regulators are perforce being pressed to depend increasingly on greater and moresophisticated private market discipline, the still most effective form of regulation. Indeed, thesedevelopments reinforce the truth of a key lesson from our banking history - that private counterpartysupervision remains the first line of regulatory defense.The speed of transactions and the growing complexities of financial instruments have required a focusmore on risk-management procedures than on actual portfolios. Indeed, I would characterize recentexamination innovations and proposals as attempting both to harness and to simulate market forces inthe supervision of banks.The impact of technology on financial services and therefore, of necessity, on supervision andregulation is the critical issue that frames the supervisory agenda as we move into the 21st century. Intoday’s more complex world, the diversity of financial product choices facing consumers andbusinesses is truly astonishing. The complexity, as you know, has provided consumers with morechoice but presented new challenges as well. In modernizing our banking laws and making them more
BIS Review 107/20002consistent with marketplace realities, the Congress ensured that the financial services industry canexpand and innovate with far fewer artificial constraints. How various financial providers choose toexploit these wider opportunities will be among the more interesting dynamics of the years ahead.What will the financial services industry look like in WHF’s 40th year? Given the rapidity ofinnovation and technological change, that is impossible to predict with any certainty. Accordingly,none of us can, a priori, lay out an optimal model either for financial services providers or for financialregulators. For policymakers, supervisors, and regulators, I would only suggest some generalguidelines for the coming years: proceed cautiously, facilitate and participate in prudent innovation,allow markets to signal the winners and losers among competing technologies and market structures,and overall - as the medical profession is advised - do no harm.We are all fortunate to have the opportunity to be a part of this remarkable transformation of thefinancial services industry into one that provides more useful financial products and services to abroader spectrum of consumers and businesses. As I see it, the possibilities for education and debatewill abound in coming years, and you and your colleagues are well positioned to continue to provideleadership in addressing the broad spectrum of issues that will confront us.
1BIS Review 106/2000MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul: Inflation targeting - a new monetary policyapproach for ThailandSpeech by Mr MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Bank ofThailand’s International Economic Conference “Practical Experiences on Inflation Targeting” held inBangkok on 20 October 2000.*      *      *Distinguished panelists,Ladies and Gentlemen,This is the second seminar on inflation targeting organized by the Bank of Thailand. But this is thefirst seminar at international level, with highly distinguished speakers from many famous centralbanks.To set the right tone for the seminar, I want to start with a question: what does the general publicexpect from the central bank?People invariably want the good life: a high standard of living, abundant goods and services toconsume. They also want political freedom, a clean environment, and many other things, but let usconcentrate on the economic aspects in order to keep it relevant to central banking.To give people the good life, the economy has to be generating output at a high level, the highest levelin relation to its capacity. The economy will also have to generate enough jobs to accommodate thenew workers entering the labor force yearly. For many Asian countries where the demographic slant isheavily towards the younger ages, the number of new workers entering the labor force each year issubstantial. Therefore, the level of output has to grow to provide adequate employment.The people can rightly expect the central bank to have an important role in this: giving them the goodlife.But they do not stop here. People also want the good life to continue, avoiding the excessive boom andbust cycles and, of course, avoiding unnecessary crises. They invariably want more and more of bettergoods and services.This requires the economy to not only simply produce at a high level, but also to make adequatecapital formation to generate a high growth rate. There are many factors other than investment thataffect growth - things like productivity, innovation and education. But they are outside the realm ofcentral banking. Within the area of central banking, however, the general public can rightly expect thecentral bank to provide them with an environment conducive to growth, without the excessive boomand bust cycles and avoiding crisis whenever possible.What else do the people expect? People also expect a fair distribution of opportunity and income.Central banks generally do not have a direct hand in providing equal distribution of income, much lessopportunity. This responsibility generally lies with the overall machinery of government.Nevertheless, high inflation, if it exists, does have an adverse effect on real individuals’ income,especially those in the lower brackets who are less able to renegotiate their pay. Therefore, while thecentral bank does not have direct power to enforce a fair distribution of income, if the central bankfails to do its job properly and this results in high inflation, it can make the situation worse.Next, the general public also wants the country’s exports to be competitive. Here we are talking aboutthe export of goods and services, inbound tourism included. Again, the competitive edge of businessdepends on many factors outside the scope of central banking: marketing know-how, research anddevelopment, and technology included. And when one looks at competitive advantage of firms at theinternational level, things like quotas, trade protection and trade negotiations do add complications tothe equation.
BIS Review 106/20002But there is one factor that cuts across all considerations and that is inflation. If the inflation rate in acountry far exceeds those in its trading partners, it will erode that country’s competitiveness over time.Therefore, the central bank can affect the country’s export competitiveness, and the public can rightlyexpect the bank to guard against this.Finally, the people invariably want transparency. They want to know how the central bank views thesituation, how it acts and how it can be held accountable for its action. They will also want to seewhether the central bank is capable of looking ahead into the future.…How can the central bank in an emerging economy like Thailand best deliver to the people all that theyexpect? My answer is inflation targeting.The best environment that the central bank can provide for the economy to attain a high level of outputand steady growth is one with price stability. Under inflation targeting, the Monetary Policy Board hasto look ahead 18-24 months and adjust its stance today to influence the outcome of the future. Thiswill help minimize the boom and bust phenomenon. The floating exchange rate regime will also helpprevent imbalances from building up excessively, hence minimizing the risk of major crises.In terms of transparency and accountability, inflation targeting is probably the best tool ofcommunication. While the general public may have difficulty understanding and keeping track ofmonetary growth targets, it fully understands inflation, the index of which is calculated and announcedby an independent agency, in the case of Thailand the Ministry of Commerce. The regular publicationof inflation reports will also help inform and educate the public much better than in the past.In the case of Thailand, inflation targeting is the best tool to ensure high output, sustainable growth,export competitiveness, prevention of a worsening of income distribution and a transparent andaccountable central bank. The Bank of Thailand last year announced our explicit intention to controlinflation, and the range of 0 to 3.5% of core inflation was announced in 23 May 2000. Since thebeginning of the year, we have seen the yield on 10-year bonds drop from 7.91% per annum to 6.1%.While other factors may have helped toward this reduction of long term borrowing costs, I am surethat public confidence in our commitment to control inflation was certainly one of the importantfactors.…The first seminar we organized concentrated on the principles of inflation targeting and laid the overallgroundwork. In this seminar, we will go deeper into its implementation, its relevance to emergingeconomies, and the problems that it may face in the environment of large public debt overhang. Weare very fortunate indeed to have with us eminent speakers, most of them from countries that havesuccessfully applied this technique. I therefore strongly urge the audience to take advantage of thepresence of the experts by asking questions and airing your concerns to the fullest extent possible. Ivery much hope that by the end of the seminar, you will all become convinced.
1BIS Review 104/2000T K Alweendo: Prospects for growth and employment in NamibiaAnnual speech by Mr T K Alweendo, Governor of the Bank of Namibia, held in Windhoek on15 November 2000.*   *   *1.IntroductionThis year’s subject matter is growth and employment or unemployment, depending whether you are anoptimist or a pessimist. Some of you may be surprised by the choice of a topic. It is true that“Prospects for growth and employment” can be regarded as a topic that does not fall within theprimary responsibilities of the central bank.Conventional wisdom strongly suggests that monetary policy in itself can do little to generate growthand employment. This may sound surprising as it is within the domain of the central bank to influencethe quantity and price of money in the society. The problem, however, is to do so without creatinginflation, which in the longer run will harm growth. Although this question of a possible trade-offbetween inflation and growth has been debated for a long time, the compromise seems to be thatmonetary policy is most conducive to high employment and growth when price stability is maintained.Available evidence from both developed and developing countries does not support the view thatmonetary policy can accelerate growth and reduce unemployment at the cost of a higher inflation rate.Why should this topic of growth and employment then be of concern to the central bank? The simpleanswer is that growth and employment prospects are the single most important issues on any economicpolicy agenda.The objective of this speech is limited to taking stock of what we know today and indicating what inour view should be the main elements in future strategies. We have to acknowledge that empiricalevidence strongly suggests that there is not a clearly identifiable single set of variables that eitherpromotes or inhibits growth. My main contribution will be to support current efforts to stimulateeconomic growth; to reiterate the need for the main stakeholders to fulfil their respective roles; and toemphasise that we all have to work together.The ultimate objective of economic policy in any society is to ensure a satisfactory level of thecitizens’ welfare and to improve it over time. Opportunity to work is a fundamental basis for privatewelfare and the lack thereof may often lead to personal and social ills. Economic growth andemployment should therefore, in the case of Namibia, be closely linked to poverty reduction. Povertyis not only an assault on human dignity and deprivation of material good, but also often associatedwith lack of security and access to basic services including health, education and sanitation. Inaddition, poverty may have several economic consequences and be in itself an impediment to growth.2.A review of conventional growth strategiesLet me first review some of the theories related to economic growth. Development economists haveover the years established several theories in an attempt to explain dispersion in output growth amongcountries that have similar resource endowments. Theories explaining such growth patterns have beenclassified into two main groups: neo-classical or exogenous growth theories and modern orendogenous theories.The earliest exogenous theories attributed output growth to increases in factor inputs such as capital,labour, land and natural resources and a residual called “technological progress”. The endowment ofhuman and natural resources, size, and geographical location, no doubt, are very important elements inthe growth process. These theories received a lot of attention in the earlier growth literature. However,
BIS Review 104/20002technological progress has in more recent discourse been identified as a fundamental determinant ofeconomic growth.ChartGrowth theoriesEndogenous growth theories, on the other hand, have emphasised the role of improvements in humancapital, financial intermediation, external trade and institutions as very crucial complementary factorsin economic development.Most recently, in the wake of the poor growth performance of developing countries, the IMF and theWorld Bank have developed some stabilisation cum growth models to stimulate the economicperformance of developing countries. They take into consideration the interaction among stabilisation,adjustment and growth. Critics have focused on the long-run relevance of these models for economicgrowth. However, evidence is beginning to emerge to support the existence of a long-run relationshipbetween price stability and economic growth giving credibility to the Fund-World Bank efforts.Policymakers in many developing countries are beginning to appreciate the importance of policies thatare targeted at reducing the price level, with a view of stimulating economic growth and development.These experiences offer important lessons for Namibia.ChartFactors influencing growth in Namibia FACTORS INFLUENCINGGROWTH IN NAMIBIA•Positive impact on growth:–Financial factors–Trade(cid:127)Non-mineral exports–Human capital(cid:127)Negative impact on growth:–Price levelGROWTH THEORIES(cid:127)Neo-classic (orexogenous):–capital–labour–land and naturalresources–“technologicalprogress”(cid:127)Modern (orendogenous):–human capital–financial intermediation–external trade–institutions(cid:127)IMF/World Bank:–stabilisation–adjustment–growth
3BIS Review 104/2000In a recent study, the Research Department at BON tested the relevance of some of these factors to thegrowth process in Namibia. Using a simple model based on quarterly data for the period 1990-99, ourempirical results attest to the significant impact of financial factors proxied by the level of financialdepth and real credit to the private sector on the growth of output. Both exports and the real exchangerate representing the trade factor, also turned out to be positively related to the real GDP. This studyrevealed that when exports were decomposed into two components, minerals and non-minerals, thepositive contribution of the non-minerals component was quite astounding. Another thing that struckus was the impact of the human capital factor, proxied in our model by the primary school enrolmentratio on real GDP growth. The result turned out to be strongly correlated to real GDP growth,demonstrating the effect of human capital development on the growth process in Namibia. Asexpected, the price level, though significant, turned out negatively related to GDP growth.3.Growth and employment trends in NamibiaIn reviewing recent trends in Namibia, we find that real GDP growth for the period 1980-99 averagedapproximately 2.7%. For the period 1980-89, average GDP growth was about 1.3% compared to the4.2% recorded for 1990-99. However, real GDP growth slowed down to 3.8% for the years 1995-99.1ChartReal GDP and per capita growth (1980-99)The performance of per capita real income was more striking. After relatively large fluctuations in thepre-independence period, real GDP per capita recorded an average growth of about 1.9% between1990-99. Thus both real income and per capita real income have shown consistent declines since theperiod after independence. It is this fall in general living standards that represents our challenge.The Namibian economic performance since 1994 has not been sufficient for providing jobs for alabour force that grew by more than 3% annually. We have also registered a decline in total factorproductivity. This last factor is very worrisome since it implies that for every unit of capital invested inthe economy, less and less output is received in return. This is being held accountable for the flow ofsavings outside the economy where returns are higher. The combination of a declining productivityand outflow of savings keep growth below the potential for the nation.1These growth rates are based on revised national account figures for 1993-99, which will be publicised shortly.REAL GDP AND PER CAPITAGROWTH-4-2024681019801981198219831984198519861987198819891990199119921993199419951996199719981999-20-15-10-505101520Real GDP GrowthReal Income Per Capita (growth)[RHS]
BIS Review 104/20004In relation to the First National Development Plan (NDP1) period, growth fell below the target rate of5%, which was considered reasonable to significantly address the problems of income inequalities,poverty and unemployment in the country. Unfortunately, no major strides were made in this regard aseconomic growth remained weak and hence unemployment surged during this period.ChartRelative contribution of primary, secondary and tertiary sectorsLooking more closely at growth on a sectoral basis, primary industries, consisting of agriculture,fisheries and mining, performed rather sluggishly during the period. In particular, the share of miningto GDP declined by 5 percentage points over the period due mainly to a secular decline in commodityprices. The main commodity that has continued to dominate mining is diamond and its fortunes andmisfortunes directly translate into growth or stagnation in the economy.ChartContribution to GDP by the manufacturing and construction sectorsManufacturing and construction are the two main sectors that have contributed steadily to outputgrowth in the secondary sector, particularly in the last decade.

5BIS Review 104/2000in 1999. The performance of construction has shown a rather irregular pattern since 1983. In the mostrecent years, construction has been sluggish, due mainly to high interest rates following the globalfinancial crisis that engulfed most economies from 1997.The dominant sub-sector in the tertiary sector is general government. The activity of this sub-sector isfollowed by wholesale and retail, transport and communication, hotels and restaurants and community,social and personal services, in that order. The ratio of general government to GDP, of some 22% overthe last five years, is quite substantial. This has given vent to the fears in certain quarters that thisexpansion might not be in the long-run interest of the economy, particularly if it crowds out privatesector role.ChartDevelopment in income and demand 1990-99The trends in income and demand developments have not been encouraging either. Gross NationalIncome lagged behind GDP for a greater part of the 1990’s reflecting a decline in the country’s termsof trade.ChartPrivate and public consumption DEVELOPMENTS IN INCOME ANDDEMAND 1990-99-4-20246810121990199119921993199419951996199719981999Real GDPReal Gross National Income GROWTH INPRIVATE AND PUBLIC CONSUMPTION-20-15-10-505101520251990199119921993199419951996199719981999Govornment conummptionPrivate ConsumptionReal GDP)
BIS Review 104/20006The incomes of households followed the developments in Gross National Income, as the share of wageincome remained relatively stable. Private consumption suffered for a greater part of the 1990’s underthe weight of falling real incomes and rising real interest rates. On the other hand governmentconsumption represented a disproportionate share of GDP. It has been observed that amongdeveloping countries, the share of government consumption in GDP, which is currently put at about30%, is the highest.Unemployment trendsThe labour market in Namibia is characterised by an excess supply of unskilled labour and, at thesame time, a lack of skilled labour. Available data suggest that the unemployment rate rose from 33%in 1994 to 35% in 1997. Lack of data precludes us from making sufficient observations on theunemployment trends in the economy since then, but whatever little evidence there is, points to thefact that the unemployment situation has worsened. Government remains the main employer of labour.This has resulted in a burgeoning public sector wage bill. Although available statistics show thatsectors such as finance and transport are making necessary efforts, the overall situation remainsdifficult and requires a structural policy thrust.4.Factors that impacted on growth and developmentIn attempting to reduce the reliance of the economy on primary exports, the government objective hasbeen to promote sustainable economic growth through a strategy of diversification sinceindependence. The promotion of manufacturing activities, development of the agricultural sector, thefishing industry and tourism have been identified as having the most potential to provide impetus forthe diversification strategy under the First National Development Plan.The government introduced specific measures targeted at promoting growth, development and jobcreation. These measures included the enactment of the Foreign Direct Investment Act 1990, whichprovides generous tax breaks and other concessions to investors and the export processing zones(EPZ). A further measure is the disproportionate allocation of national expenditure to education andhealth.As we all know, Namibia is blessed with a significant supply of natural resources, such as diamonds,uranium, zinc and natural gas. Unfortunately these natural resources, particularly diamonds anduranium, have been susceptible to exogenous influences in the form of demand or price shocks.ChartComposition of exportsCOMPOSITION OF EXPORTS0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%1990199119921993199419951996199719981999Mineral exportsNon-mineral exports
7BIS Review 104/2000The share of minerals in total export declined from about 65% of total exports in 1990 to about 50% in1994. Following an increase in subsequent years, the share fell to 49% in 1999.Apart from demand and price shocks, Namibia is also susceptible to other natural shocks, whichinfluence growth. Recurrent drought spells, for example, caused agricultural output to decline by over40% in the last three months of 1995. As nearly 70% of Namibians derive their livelihood directly andindirectly from the land, these droughts have caused declines in agricultural exports and farmers’incomes.ChartSaving and investmentLet me now turn to savings. As the saying goes: “To have more tomorrow you have to have lesstoday.” To provide funds for investment at the national level there needs to be a healthy level ofsavings. For a greater part of the period after independence, investment has lagged behind savings. Atan annual average of about 25% of GDP for the period 1991-99, the savings rate ranks among thehighest in Sub-Sahara Africa. Given the savings-investment gap, Namibia has witnessed a constantoutflow of capital and a matching current account surplus for a greater part of the period underconsideration. Gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP hovered around 21% for theperiod.Both private and public investment has been on the decline, though this has been more pronounced forprivate investment. Two important factors that have contributed to the decline in private investmentare the slowdown in government investment and the high interest rates that emerged after the financialcrisis in the middle to late 1990s. The increasing savings-investment gap has remained a source ofconcern for policymakers particularly in the face of high domestic unemployment.Technological progress, as mentioned earlier, enhances growth, as it makes it possible to producemore with the same quantity of resources. This boosts the potential level of output of the economy.The unprecedented growth experienced in the United States in the last couple of years is said to havebeen spearheaded by technology related sectors. It is important to note, however, that the pace oftechnological change is likely to depend on the quality and relevance of education that a countryprovides to its citizens.Education has been identified as one of the priority sectors and a lot of resources have been allocatedto this sector since independence. The budgetary allocation to the two Ministries of Education hasincreased from about 18% of total expenditure in 1990 to about 24% in 1999. This is quite asubstantial amount bearing in mind that low-income countries spend on average 13% of their nationalbudget on education.

BIS Review 104/20008Despite the sizeable budgetary allocation to the education sector, a consensus seems to emerge thatsuggests that the output from our education system is not commensurate with the input. Our schoolsdropout and repetition rates are the highest compared to other similar countries, such as Zimbabwe,Mauritius and Botswana. For example, the rate of grade repetition in Namibia is as high as 25%compared to an average of about 5% for these countries.ChartShare of total public expenditure on education, 1990 and 1999What should also be of concern is that a breakdown of the total education budget into type ofexpenditure reveals worrying trends. The personnel costs of the primary education budget accounts forabout 88% whilst personnel costs of the secondary education accounts for about 73% of totalsecondary budget during 1999/2000.If we accept the argument that human capital is essential for economic growth, then there could be acase for re-evaluating the type and quality of education we are providing. This is necessary, not onlyto ensure consistency with the long-term development needs of the country, but also to increase socialreturns on our investment in education from the current low levels, as reflected in the high level ofunemployment, especially among our youth.5.Main elements in future strategyLooking now into the future, the question is what Namibia can do to bring the economy on a path ofsustainable and healthy growth. As I have already emphasised the point, investments in physical andhuman capital must continue.However, it is far from obvious that high initial investments and savings are sufficient preconditionsfor growth. The relatively high saving ratio in Namibia has not been transformed into high investmentand growth. As mentioned, one important explanation has been low and declining factor productivityin the economy. Public investment will remain important, but investment opportunities must also bemade available to the private sector.Although our present knowledge strongly indicates that investment is probably the factor closestcorrelated with growth, it is crucial to identify other relevant factors that will trigger investment andgrowth in Namibia. Advances in production efficiencies and technology are such important factors,but so is the complicated interplay between economic and political factors.

9BIS Review 104/2000Let me start with sound macroeconomic policies. Sound macroeconomic policies basically mean asustainable fiscal balance and a supportive monetary policy.The pressure on the public finances has been growing in recent years and the budget deficit has beenedging up and public debt has increased as a result. Among the new challenges that will affect thebudget, is the reduced SACU receipts over the next few years. As our fiscal policymakers are aware,bold measures are needed to make sure public finances are put on a sustainable path over the mediumterm. These will include reduced expenditure on recurrent expenditures, especially on personnel costs,and a broadening of the tax base. This should not increase the general tax burden, but rather contributetowards its reduction. The announced review of the tax system and the introduction of a medium termbudgetary framework will undoubtedly contribute to a more efficient tax system and strengthenedexpenditure control.Turning briefly to monetary policy, we believe that the peg of the Namibia dollar to the rand and ourmembership in the Common Monetary Area (CMA) have contributed to securing broad financialstability. Our objective is to expand the role of the CMA in the direction of a true regional monetaryunion. Recent initiatives have strengthened the role of the smaller members in information exchangeand in providing input into the monetary policy making process in the CMA.Also within the domain of the central bank is our payment system reform project, which is aimed atestablishing an automated payments system that is able to link up with regional and global systems.This would facilitate foreign trade and make monetary policy and supervision more effective. Thebank is also committed to the steady liberalisation of exchange controls within the CMA. We hope thisinitiative will contribute towards attracting foreign portfolio investments and foreign directinvestment.My impression is that the government is eager to support general growth-oriented policies. We arealso blessed with a high degree of political stability and our basic institutional structures are broadlyup to good standards. However, it is important to recognise that there are severe limitations on whatauthorities alone can do to promote sustainable growth. We must recognise that it is individuals, firmsand markets that are the most important factors for generating economic growth. Namibia needsindividuals with knowledge and ideas to create new concepts and innovations and entrepreneurs thatcan convert these ideas into successful businesses. Physical, legal and financial infrastructure mustsupport and facilitate this conversion.But that is not enough. Also social attitudes that encourage creativity and reasonable risk-taking bynew and established enterprises must be built. Recent development strategies are emphasising the roleof “social capital”, meaning the networks and relationships in social interactions that both encouragetrust and mutual support in a society - be it schools, health institutions, rural villages and towns thatwill eventually filter through to a national level. These are factors that economists may have somedifficulties to relate to and to analyse, but I believe that they nevertheless are important in the wholeprocess.The role of governmentDevelopment and growth policies contain many elements, but a statement in WB’s ComprehensiveDevelopment Framework can serve as a summary:“Structural elements (which) include honest, competent governments committed to the fight againstcorruption; strong property and personal rights laws supported by an efficient and honest legal andjudicial system; a well-supervised financial system that promotes transparency; and a strong socialsafety net.”Namibia has in most of these areas come a far way, but there will always be room for improvements.It should be an achievable goal for Namibia to reach international standards in all these areas.Although it is difficult both theoretically and empirically to establish a clear relationship betweengrowth and income inequality, this is a problem that must be addressed within a comprehensivegrowth strategy. If we have a situation in which significant low-income groups are unable to acquire
BIS Review 104/200010skills necessary to participate in economic activities, the society suffers a substantial loss in humancapital. The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, recently stated that:“Societies cannot thrive when significant segments perceive its functioning as unjust”. He wasreferring to the changes new technology is bringing about in the US. This statement has morerelevance for characterising our post-apartheid economy.Economic empowerment of those previously disadvantaged must be addressed in a fair andtransparent manner in order to build a foundation for prosperity and growth. The same is true withgender equalities. We can come some way with public disclosure, incentives and moral suasion, but inmy opinion it is not likely that these measures will yield sufficient results in a reasonable length oftime. A suggestion I would like to make is that we should come up with a privatisation strategy thatnot only addresses how to deal with potential problems that privatisation may cause in the short run,but also to address the empowerment of previously marginalised groups within our society. Thepotential for growth of such an initiative is large, but the process must be transparent, open and fair.Our future growth strategy must also address the HIV/AIDS problem. This is not only a problem inrelation to human suffering, but will also have a macroeconomic dimension in terms of reducedproductivity and availability of productive human capital, skill shortages, and reduced saving andinvestment. It is estimated that annual real GDP growth may be reduced by more than 1 ½ percentagepoint; other estimates that are even more pessimistic. Again, this is not only the sole responsibility ofthe government, but the private sector, in particularly employers at all levels, must also contribute.The role of the private sectorThe private sector has to be recognised as a key stakeholder in the development and growth process, asprivate investment plays a pivotal role for future growth. The views of the private sector have to beheard and taken into account by policymakers.On the other hand, we must also expect the private sector to be fully committed to the long-termdevelopment of the country. There are many ways this commitment can be displayed. Disclosure ofcorporate social investment in such areas as on affirmative actions, marginalised communityempowerment and general skills development could perhaps be used as one indicator of thiscommitment.It is sometimes argued that the wage structure in Namibia does not reflect the low level of productivityof the unskilled labour force and that uncompetitive wages have contributed to the unemploymentproblem. In fact, sketchy evidence indicates that unit labour cost in Namibia may be higher than inmany other countries in the region, with the exception of South Africa. We must appeal to the labourunions that they should not only be concerned with the interest of their employed members, but alsotake macroeconomic considerations into account in their wage negotiations. Problems associated withwage inflexibility, strained labour relations and regulations on hiring and firing may have a bearing onour competitiveness and growth potential.The role of the financial sectorThe function of financial intermediation is also central in the growth process. It is therefore importantto improve the functioning of money and capital markets in Namibia. The growth process would befacilitated if financial instruments and prices would be available over a sufficiently wide spectrum ofmaturities to satisfy the market players with regard to saving preferences and financing needs.In this connection, the efforts made by the Bank of Namibia and the Ministry of Finance to developmore efficient markets for government securities are important. Such markets are not only importantfor an effective management of public debt, but well functioning markets for government securitieswill also provide a basis for raising funds through the issuance of securities by the parastatals andprivate sector. The creation of a broader market for securities would channel investable funds by localinstitutional investors into productive investments in the Namibian economy. This should contribute tolower interest rates, as one would expect that the interest rate premiums in relation to comparableSouth African government bonds should narrow over time.
11BIS Review 104/2000I would also like to believe that in the future we should be more active in investigating and addressingperceived “market failures”. In this connection, we have to consider structural policies that can addressthe limited competition in a large part of the financial sector. The authorities and representatives fromthe sector should investigate joint actions for decentralising geographically financial services.We must also recognise the fact that the traditional financial institutions and markets cannot beexpected to cater for all financing needs, particularly by smaller and inexperienced future investors.The role of the financial parastatals will therefore continue to be an important alternative.6.Prospects for the economyI will now share with you an effort we have made to forecast economic performance based onavailable information and broadly on present policies.ChartProjected growth in GDP 2000-10Unfortunately, the near-term prospects for economic growth are not very bright, as GDP growth forthe present year will not be significantly different from last year’s rate of about 3%. Despite thepresent gloom, however, the recovery in the growth of the economy in the medium term will be that ofa balanced, diversified growth as both the mining and non-mining sectors are expanding. Economicprospects for the next five years are particularly positive as GDP is projected to grow on average at arate slightly below 5% per year between 2001 and 2005. For the ensuing five years beyond 2005,growth is expected to fall to an average of around 4%.The balance of trade deficit is forecast to deteriorate during the first half of the decade as the terms oftrade will continue to deteriorate. This is further compounded by the envisaged reduction in SACUrevenue. Consequently, the current account of the balance of payments will become negative for thefirst time since data were recorded. The current account deficit, together with persistent capitaloutflows, yield a balance of payment shortfall for the large part of the forecasting period, implying thatthe internal reserves of the country will be falling. At the end of 1999, the level of reserves was equalto an import coverage of 8.3 weeks. It should be the authorities’ objective over the next ten years toincrease this coverage.

BIS Review 104/200012ChartBalance of payments projections 2000-10Public financePublic finance projections are based on the assumption that the budget deficit for the next ten yearsremains at a level of not more than 4% in relation to GDP. Revenue from mining is expected to rise inthe first half of the decade, but this positive trend is likely to be offset by the declining SACU receipts.Although the magnitude of the fall is still being investigated, preliminary evidence suggests thatrevenue from this source could shrink by as much as 15% over the next ten years. Governmentexpenditure is forecast to remain stable at the level witnessed during the past two years.ChartBudget deficit forecast growth 2000-10The consequence is a budget deficit continuing at the present level and an upward trend in the overalldebt position of government. Although the ratio of debt as a proportion of GDP should still be withinmanageable limits during the next ten years, the pace of its expansion will raise some concerns.

13BIS Review 104/2000The lack of continuous employment figures makes projections on employment a very difficult task.From the labour surveys in 1991 and 1997 one can, however, deduce some general conclusions.During this period, productivity increased substantially in the primary sector while the increase wasquite modest in the non-primary sector. Assuming unchanged productivity growth rates in both theprimary and non-primary sectors, total employment has been projected to grow by 2.7% on average toa level of about 500,000 people at the end of the tenth year period. Using the past average growth inthe economically active population of 2.4% gives rise to a figure of 751,000 people that will beeconomically active at the end of the tenth year. Thus, the result is only a marginal reduction in therate of unemployment and underemployment from 35 to about 33% at the end of year 2010.ChartEstimated employment and unemployment in 20107.ConclusionAlthough these employment projections should be treated with caution due to the fact that the they arebased on limited data, and also that the impact of HIV/AIDS could significantly alter the picture, themessage is clear: notwithstanding the improved prospects in economic growth during the next tenyears, employment outlook remains gloomy. A continuation of present policies is therefore notenough.The government must continue its effort to expand the development potential of the economy throughpursuance of sound macroeconomic policies. We have in this connection touched on a number ofimportant challenges, such as improved efficiency in public spending, particularly in the educationsector, broadened tax base and tax structure review, including the EPZ arrangement. A comprehensiveprivatisation strategy must also be established.I hope that this presentation has shown that it is not the lack of ideas and good proposals which havehampered growth in our economy. Notwithstanding some misfortunes and limitations in the factorspromoting growth, I also feel that our ability and willingness to act has been part of the problem. As anation and individuals we have been too slow when it comes to implementation. Let us all, individualsand institutions, take personal responsibilities and accept the challenge to promote economic growth,lest we will continue to be marginalised economically. It is only when we all work together as a nationthat our country can take up its rightful economic position alongside other nations. We are nowstarting a new century and we should therefore work hard in order to make a difference.

1BIS Review 103/2000T T Mboweni: Economic growth, inflation and monetary policyin South AfricaSpeech by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the business conferenceof the Bureau for Economic Research, held in Stellenbosch on 17 November 2000.*      *      *1.IntroductionIt should by now be well-known that the mission of the South African Reserve Bank is to achieve andmaintain stable financial conditions in our country. This objective is spelled out in both theConstitution of the Republic and in the South African Reserve Bank Act. In these acts it is recognisedthat only by protecting the value of the currency can balanced and sustainable economic growth beachieved. It is believed in the Bank, and indeed in most countries of the world, that the potential foreconomic growth and creating job opportunities can only be fulfilled under stable financial conditions.By achieving this primary objective the Reserve Bank will make its contribution to sustainable highereconomic growth in South Africa.Some economists and other commentators on monetary policy in South Africa seem to think that theReserve Bank is applying an over-zealous monetary policy stance to achieve its primary objective ofprice stability. They argue that the Bank is obsessed with inflation at the expense of economic growthand job creation. At the current level of the inflation rate, this implies that an inflation rate of 8% is toolow to be treated as a serious concern. The Bank should therefore provide more liquidity to the moneymarket, allow the interest rate on repurchase transactions to fall and in this way encourage theeconomy to grow more rapidly. In the Bank we believe that it would be a big mistake to shift the goalof monetary policy away from controlling inflation to promoting economic growth.2.The determinants of economic growthEconomic growth is basically determined by three factors, namely:(i) the quantity of capital and labour available in a country;(ii) the quality of capital and labour; and(iii) the ingenuity of people in combining the available production resources in the creation ofgoods and services.Output will rise if more production resources are put to work, or where a given supply of labour andcapital is utilised more productively. Nowhere does the aggregate stock of money or the aggregateprice level form part of the determinants of any production model for sustained long-term economicgrowth.Government policies, including monetary policy, affect the growth of domestic output to the extentthat they affect the quantity and productivity of capital and labour. For example, government policiesthat restrict commercial activities for fear that these activities may cause undue environmental orecological damage, raise the cost of doing business and make firms less productive. Obviously theremay be good reasons to have such policies, but they can harm productive activity and economicgrowth.Monetary policy is only one element of overall macroeconomic policy, and can only affect theproduction process through its impact on interest rates. There are two main channels of monetarypolicy. One is through the effect that interest rate changes have on the exchange rate of a currency, andthe other is through the effect that interest rate changes have on demand. Therefore monetary policyhas an impact on economic activity and growth through the workings of foreign and domestic marketsfor goods and services.
BIS Review 103/20002Economic growth involves the allocation of production factors to productive use and this allocation ofresources takes place in markets. In a modern economic system, markets for goods and services, andfor production factors, function more efficiently because of the existence of money as a medium ofexchange. Without such a medium of exchange, barter trade would take place and most modernmarket arrangements would simply cease to exist. Money allows markets to allocate economicresources to sectors of economic activity in a highly efficient and cost-effective way.In a market economy, exchange values are expressed in terms of money prices which are determinedby the forces of supply and demand. When a good or service is in short supply, or when demandincreases relative to the supply of a good or service, the price will rise. This signals to suppliers thatthey must shift resources in response to the change in relative prices, or to buyers that they musteconomise on their purchases. The productive allocation of resources needs clear signals about relativeprice changes.This is where monetary policy really comes into the picture. Sound monetary policy makes pricesignals clearer. In an environment of overall price stability, it is much easier to detect changes inrelative prices. Bad monetary policy clouds the picture. When prices are always in a state of flux, it ishard to make out whether a particular price change is signalling a change in relative scarcity orwhether it is simply part of an inflationary process where all prices keep on rising.The uncertainties that inflation creates make the problem worse. The mere possibility of inflationcreates uncertainty about the true meaning of changes in the prices of individual goods and services.This uncertainty could lead to the misallocation of resources, which would reduce economic growth.This problem is nowhere more serious than in the capital market. Inflation uncertainty raises the riskpremium that investors require and increases the cost of capital, thus lowering fixed capital formation.Lower investment means lower future growth and less future income.If producers and consumers feel confident that the average price level will remain stable, they can bemore certain that price changes indicate true shifts in demand and supply. Obviously a monetarypolicy that maintains price stability can improve the efficient functioning of markets. This promotesthe full and productive employment of resources. As Alan Greenspan once stated, a monetary policythat prevents inflation from being a factor in the decision making of businesses and consumers, is amonetary policy that best promotes economic growth.Empirical evidence shows that high inflation has a negative correlation with economic growth. Incountries where inflation is high, economic growth is normally low. Many economists are thereforeconvinced that inflation is undesirable and should be avoided at all costs. Recent economic researchhas cast some doubt on this argument. In principle, there is likely to be a reversal somewhere in theinverse relationship between inflation and growth as there are no grounds for believing thatcontinuously declining prices, i.e. deflation, are good for growth.Stanley Fischer of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that the inverse relationship wouldhold, even at low rates of inflation. Another study by Barro confirmed this inverse relationship, butfound that it was relatively weak. Increasing inflation by 1% led to only a small reduction of less than0.03% in growth, according to Barro. A range of other studies found no effects from inflation ongrowth. Sarel, a researcher at the IMF, came to the conclusion that: “When inflation is low, it has nosignificant negative effect on economic growth: the effect may even be positive. But when inflation ishigh, it has a powerful negative effect on growth. The structural break is estimated to occur where theaverage annual rate of inflation is 8%.”Despite this uncertainty about the negative correlation between inflation and growth at inflation ratesbelow 8%, there is still no evidence of a positive correlation between inflation and growth over anylong period of time. In any case, if the inflation rate is close to 8%, it still seems wise to follow apolicy countering a general increase in prices, because it could easily move to levels above 8% andaccelerate further.In South Africa the 1970s were a decade of high inflation compared with the 1960s. Inflation hadaveraged 2.6% per year between 1960 and 1970. In 1974 inflation moved to higher than 10% andaveraged 10.2% per year from 1970 to 1980. If inflation was good for growth, one would have
3BIS Review 103/2000expected faster growth in the 1970s than in the 1960s. This did not happen. Quite the contraryhappened. Economic growth slowed down from 5.7% per year in the 1960s to 3.4% in the 1970s.There were broadly similar slowdowns in growth and accelerations in inflation in other parts of theworld during the 1970s. In the 1980s inflation in South Africa accelerated to 14.6% per year, andgrowth fell back further to 1.5%. By contrast, most of the advanced countries brought inflation undercontrol and their economic performance generally started to improve. A striking example is the UnitedStates, which now seems to be cruising along a path of strong and sustained economic growth withlow inflation. In South Africa inflation slowed down to about 7½% between 1993 and 1999. Althoughthere were many other factors conducive to higher economic growth over this period, it seems to bemore than pure coincidence that the growth in domestic production averaged 2½% per year.3.Other major disadvantages of inflationApart from the negative impact that inflation has on growth and wealth creation, inflation also affectsincome distribution and worsens inequality in a number of ways. Inflation can have a direct impact onincome distribution where wage increases are below the inflation rate or where marginal tax rates arenot adjusted to take account of nominal adjustments in wages. Inflation can indirectly also affectincome distribution by slowing output growth and hence job opportunities. What is more, the rich caninvest their surplus income in assets such as real estate and tradeable securities, and in many instancesbenefit from non-taxed inflation-induced capital gains. The poor are usually not able to do this andmay see their saving at banks being whittled away by high inflation.A perhaps even more important argument against an artificial stimulation of the economy through thecreation of money, lower interest rates and higher inflation, is that in a globalised economicenvironment this may lead to the withdrawal of foreign capital. If non-residents start expecting adepreciation in a country’s currency, they will probably immediately react by withdrawing the fundsthat they have invested in such a country. Foreign investors can do this easily now that world financialmarkets are better integrated. If large amounts of capital are withdrawn this could even lead to anexchange rate crisis with a sharp rise in inflation.Inflation has many other disadvantages which, all in all, can only lead to the conclusion that thecentral bank must always carefully monitor economic developments to maintain price and financialstability. No country can afford to move out of line with the inflation rates in the rest of the world.4.Monetary policy and business cyclesIf it is so obvious that excessive money creation does not contribute to sustained economic growth,why do we hear from supposedly well-informed opinion makers that monetary policy is too tight andthat it is putting a lid on real economic growth? My considered view is that some of thesecommentators often expect more from monetary policy than it can deliver. They tend to confuseshort-term accelerations in output growth with long-term sustainable economic growth.This confusion arises because monetary policy affects aggregate domestic spending, and under certaincircumstances a rise in spending can push output higher. Such an increase in output will show up ingrowth in the short run that will be higher than the potential growth rate of the economy.Such a short-term growth acceleration can be attained when there is an under-utilisation of resources.If there is a great deal of slack in the economy, then increased spending can raise the level of output.However, both the level and the growth rate of production are limited by the supply and quality ofproductive resources. If the employable resources are of poor quality, then output cannot increaseunless there is a strong increase in the productivity of the resources already being used. At fullutilisation of productive capacity, and here one recognises that in our modern technology-driveneconomy some resources are simply not employable in the short run, higher spending will lead tohigher prices but no increase in output.
BIS Review 103/20004Under some circumstances, faster monetary growth and lower interest rates can increase demand. Thisin turn can lead to higher sales and output with little change in prices. Under slightly differentconditions, increased demand leads to inflation with little or no boost in output. The impact that achange in monetary policy will have on spending and production is uncertain at best. Determiningwhether such a change would affect production instead of inflation will depend to a large extent on thestage of the business cycle.Everyone involved in economic analysis will immediately agree that it is extremely difficult todetermine the business cycle stance. The Reserve Bank compiles business cycle indicators for thispurpose, but usually it is only possible to determine where the economy is in the business cycle a longtime after the event because there is a delay in the compilation of statistics. Moreover, clear trends areneeded in information before deductions can be made about turning points in the business cycle.Even if we were able to determine accurately the business cycle stance and the extent that theproduction capacity of the economy is being used, it is still doubtful that monetary policy would beuseful in active business-cycle management. Changes in monetary policy instruments have a long andvariable lag before they have an effect on economic conditions. These lags and the fact that theirlength could change over time prevent any effective fine-tuning of real economic activity. To beeffective, changes in monetary policy would require a forecast of the business cycle stance in the next18 to 24 months. If it is difficult to determine the current business cycle stance, one can safely assumethat it is even more difficult, if not impossible, to forecast accurately whether there will be surplusproduction capacity or excessive demand conditions in the economy in two years’ time.Monetary policy affects prices not only through the impact of changes in the money stock onaggregate demand, but also through inflation expectations. A major advantage of a medium tolonger-term monetary policy approach is the credibility that it gives to the actions of the monetaryauthorities. By operating over a longer time frame, it creates a basis for its own success because of itseffects on inflation expectations. The active business-cycle management of monetary policy is usuallyless credible.5.Monetary policy and inflationSo far I have indicated that low inflation can make a significant contribution to growth and prosperitythrough its effects on resource allocation in a market-based economic system. This conclusion doesnot mean much if monetary policy cannot achieve and maintain low inflation. Fortunately, evidenceand opinion largely agree on this issue.One of the few topics that macroeconomists generally agree on is that inflation is first and foremost amonetary phenomenon. Inflation results from a long-term expansion of the money supply which isgreater than the economy’s ability to increase the production of goods and services. Furthermore, thereis widespread agreement that the supply of money is determined in the long run by central banks.Thus, the South African Reserve Bank can regulate its own balance sheet and the growth in the moneysupply, achieve low inflation and maintain it. In fact, the Bank is expected to do just that.An important indicator that the Reserve Bank should have available in pursuing the objective of pricestability is estimates of the stock of money supply over time. To this end, the Bank’s ResearchDepartment meticulously consolidates the balance sheets of banks at the end of each month. Theconsolidated deposit liabilities of the banks, along with the value of notes and coin in circulation, aresummarised in the monetary aggregates labelled M1A, M1, M2 and M3.In the past, the change in the broad monetary aggregate M3, relative to a pre-announced desired orguideline rate of change, was used for policy making. This approach to monetary policy making wasbased on the assumption that there was a fairly stable short-run relationship between changes in M3and changes in nominal aggregate spending. Unfortunately this relationship became less reliable overtime. As a result the Reserve Bank started to monitor a wider variety of economic indicators and, fromthe beginning of this year, shifted to formal inflation targeting. At present, monetary policy decisionsare anchored directly to the achievement of a specified average inflation rate of between 3 and 6% in2002.
5BIS Review 103/2000It is important to note that monetary policy decision making is not an exact science, and possibly neverwill be, even with the most accurate macroeconomic measurements imaginable. This is why the Bankcannot base a policy decision on the deviation of a rather uncertain inflation forecast from a targetedfuture rate. But neither can policy decisions be a matter of sweeping, broad impressions based uponanecdotal evidence and partial information. What the members of the Monetary Policy Committee ofthe Bank do is to make the best professionally informed analysis they can of all the sources ofinformation at their disposal, relating to every important market in the economy. Then they constantlyreview and modify their judgements, in the light of new information as it becomes available.Policy decisions are highly complex and the Monetary Policy Committee does not take them lightly.Decisions are definitely not two-dimensional and take far more factors into consideration than aninflation and growth perspective. The committee uses a vast array of official economic statistics andfinancial market data, and all the publicly available and some private surveys and commentaries, tomake a decision about the monetary policy stance. What is more, the Bank openly releases the facts asthey are available to us, as well as the analyses made by the Monetary Policy Committee and by theresearch staff, regularly through the statements of the committee and in the publication of theQuarterly Bulletin and the Annual Economic Report. All policy decisions are nevertheless alwaystaken with a view to achieving and maintaining financial stability.6.Concluding remarksSome commentators have rather dated views that monetary policy decisions should be aimed atmaximising economic growth in the short run. I believe that the primary role of monetary policy is topreserve the purchasing value of the rand by keeping inflation low. This is also the mandate given tothe Bank. To achieve this mandate, a medium to long-term approach to monetary policy formulation isfollowed in the form of inflation targets. Such a well-defined objective of monetary policy provides aclear understanding of the objective of monetary policy so that our economy can operate efficiently.This will promote a return to full employment and strong economic growth.Price stability is an essential ingredient in the recipe for maximum sustainable economic growth, and itis the only contribution that monetary policy can make. There is no more important task for the SouthAfrican Reserve Bank than pursuing a policy aimed at preserving the value of the rand.
1BIS Review 102/2000Lars Heikensten: EMU - cohesion or diversity?Speech by Mr Lars Heikensten, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riskbank, to The SwedishInstitute of International Affairs, Stockholm, on 10 November 2000.*      *      *First a word of thanks for inviting me to speak. I greatly appreciate the opportunity of talking aboutmatters to do with European integration to an audience outside the circles in which I normally move.This is all the more stimulating given that there is little more than a month to go before Sweden takesover the presidency of the EU Council of Ministers.I intend to begin by saying something about the history and principles behind the European MonetaryUnion and how they can be related to our theme today: cohesion or diversity. Although EMU wasfully launched so recently, I must then comment on what has happened to date, as regards economicdevelopments as well as the economic policy cooperation. I shall then briefly conclude with my viewof the future for EU’s economic policy cooperation.Political as well as economic grounds for a monetary unionLet us bear in mind that none of the things we are discussing today are entirely new. Commoncurrencies were in use more than a century ago and some of them were valid throughout the continentof Europe. A joint standard and a rapidly growing economic exchange were already seen as naturalgoals around the turn of the 19th century. The Great War broke that trend, however, and both theScandinavian and the Latin monetary union were dissolved.The EEC, predecessor of the European Union, was established after World War Two primarily as aproject for peace. Political integration was the objective, to be achieved in large measure witheconomic means. When the Treaty of Rome, which established the EEC, was signed in 1957, therewas already talk of a need to supplement the economic integration with a monetary union. When theseideas found expression in the 1970 Werner Plan for economic and monetary union, monetary andfiscal policy cooperation were equally prominent. According to the Plan; EMU would become acatalyst for the development of a political union without which it cannot ultimately survive.The currencies of Europe had already been linked up by the Bretton Woods agreement on internationalmonetary cooperation. The Werner Plan extended this with the prospect of a single monetary policyand, in time, a single currency. In the present context it is worth noting that the Plan’s primary thrustwas for increased economic coordination, above all the notion of harmonising the member countries’stabilisation policies in order to avoid tensions. Pierre Werner, prime minister of Luxembourg, and thecentral bank governors on his committee proposed an economic policy centre that would controlnational budgets, regional, structural and social policies. The whole process would be crowned by thesingle currency.When the Bretton Woods system collapsed and the oil crises erupted, national considerations put astop to the Werner Plan. With the advent of the EU’s internal market in the 1990s, however, the issueof a common currency was revived. National currencies came to be seen as the last major barrier to theinternal market’s full impact, which would pave the way to even greater European integration.To a large extent, the driving force behind the Werner Plan and the Maastricht Treaty was political.Experience has taught us that institutionalised economic cooperation can be an antidote not just totrade conflicts but even to war. A common currency is a strong political symbol that can rendercooperation durable in the daily economic round. Instead of being just a topic for solemn speeches ontelevision, European cooperation with a single currency could be something real that people carryaround in their purses and pockets.
BIS Review 102/20002But the Maastricht Treaty was, of course, also backed up by the strong economic forces that laybehind previous attempts at monetary union. By reducing exchange risks for firms, a single currencyfacilitates cross-border trade and investment. It also helps to integrate capital markets, rendering themlarger and deeper, which aids the supply of corporate capital in Europe.These considerable effects are accompanied by others that we ought not to underrate. In the presentsituation, moreover, they are likely to be enhanced by the internet and other new informationtechnology. Not the least of these is that the monetary union eliminates the psychological barrier thatdifferent currencies raise when we try to compare prices in different countries. The result is greatertransparency and stronger price competition. Price differences in Europe today are twice as large as inthe United States. The price of a small car, for example, can vary more than 50% between EU memberstates.Risk of countries getting out of stepHowever, the road to greater cohesion is not necessarily smooth. In a monetary union, forces are atwork that may cause member states to develop in different directions instead of converging.Discussions about EMU often raise the topic of asymmetric shocks, a technical term that stands forsomething quite simple. The conditions for the countries involved differ initially as regards theireconomic structures, for example the corporate sector, the level of technical development, wagebargaining systems and competitive pressure. Economic shocks will therefore affect them differently.Problems may also arise if economic policy in one country is markedly different from the generaldirection. In Sweden, for example, the economic differences from the EU countries in the 1970s and1980s were in large measure a consequence of self-imposed stabilisation problems.If a shock does hit a single country, a monetary union eliminates the possibility of mitigating itseffects by adjusting the exchange rate. Neither can this be done by implementing a national interestrate policy. Instead, wages and prices need to be as flexible as possible so they adjust and counter theimpact of the shock. Wage formation is accordingly of major importance for enabling the countries ina monetary union to harmonise their business cycles without being hit by unemployment.Another type of problem in a monetary union can come from differences in the construction of fiscalpolicy. A national currency and interest rate are no longer available as clear indicators of marketconfidence in a country’s economic policy. This means that a part of the forces which previouslytended to discipline pressure for fiscal expansion and counter unduly large budget deficits no longeracts. That applies in particular to small countries, in that their mistakes can be concealed, at least for atime, in the overall development of the monetary union’s exchange rate and interest rates. Theopposite applies if the large countries commit economic policy mistakes - the consequences are liableto hit the entire union.In theory, perhaps problems of this kind should not be all that grave. If a euro country’s budget ismarkedly underbalanced and money is distributed to the inhabitants, they ought to be prudent enoughto set aside some income to cope with the strains that are bound to come when, sooner or later, thegovernment finances have to be consolidated again. But things don’t work like that in practice, at leastnot sufficiently so. Short-term budgetary expansion therefore normally leads to increased consumptionand that in turn is liable to result in higher inflationary pressures throughout the euro area. All elseequal, the end result will be that the ECB is forced to tighten its stance a little more. In that way, a lessdisciplined policy in one or more member states to some extent hits all the countries in the union. Inthe extreme case, it is conceivable that a country might deliberately refrain from managing a debtproblem and, when the crisis becomes acute, try to shift the payments onto the other countries.Problems of another type have come to the fore with the past year’s weakening of the euro. When themood is negative, every potential problem gets an airing regardless of its weight in practice.Difficulties in small countries, for example in connection with inflation being considerably higher thanin the core countries, can then be presented as a threat to the whole, with consequences for the euro’sexchange rate.
3BIS Review 102/2000Rules and processes for promoting cohesionAll the problems and risks I have mentioned were essentially well-recognised and thoroughlydiscussed before the EMU was formed. Various rules were therefore constructed to prevent what iscalled destructive diversity.The Maastricht Treaty, for instance, includes rules to prevent excessive government debt beingdumped onto others. This is explicitly prohibited by the ban on government financing in the centralbank. The Treaty also rules out privileged access to bank loans as well as bail-outs by other countriesor the EU as a whole.The most important concrete instrument for promoting cohesion is, of course, the EU’s convergencecriteria for EMU participation: low inflation, low interest rates, a stable exchange rate and balancedgovernment finances. Much has been said and written about these criteria. I have already suggestedthat perhaps it is not just these criteria as such that are the key to a monetary union that functionsproperly, although the part they have played in disciplining policy in a number of member statesshould not be underestimated. But I do believe they have had the important effect of contributing to agreater consensus than before on issues of stabilisation policy. The Maastricht Treaty’s institutionalrequirements concerning formal central bank independence and the legal infrastructure of the financialsector have also contributed to the consensus that has been achieved and which I believe is central forthe proper functioning of EMU.A remarkable degree of economic convergence throughout the EU was achieved in the second half ofthe 1990s. If one excludes Greece, the gap between the highest and lowest rates of inflation among EUcountries narrowed from 10 percentage points in 1990 to 1% point in 1997. In 1995 the gap in thepublic finances extended from a deficit of almost 8% of GDP in Sweden to a deficit of 2.3% of GDPin Denmark. By 1997 the gap had narrowed to a 0.1% surplus in Denmark and a 3.0% deficit in Spain.The EMU process also led to more similar levels of interest rates. In many countries the instrumentalrate moved down from 10% in 1995 to Stage Three’s initial rate, which practice was set already on22 December 1998 when all the future euro countries lowered their instrumental rates to 3%.To ensure that the fiscal goals enshrined in the convergence criteria would continue to guide policy inthe monetary union, in 1997 the EU member states concluded the Stability and Growth Pact. ThisPact’s best-known requirement is that a general government deficit is not to exceed 3% of GDP andthat if it does, sanctions will be applied. I should like to remind you, however, that the Pact is alsointended to promote a balanced development of government finances over the business cycle. All EUmember states are required to present annual stability programmes (in the case of non-euro countries,convergence programmes) that are first discussed in the Economic and Financial Committee and laterin the Ecofin Council.In addition to these processes for testing that every country adheres to the rules, Broad EconomicPolicy Guidelines are drawn up annually. This document can be said to represent a common generalapproach to economic policy - a budget statement for the EU area.Last but not least, there are processes for guiding countries along the road towards creating moreefficient markets for goods, services, capital and labour. These are complex issues and the memberstates tend to differ considerably in their initial positions as well as their attitudes. But an intensedialogue has now started on structural issues at extraordinary Council meetings, such the comingmeeting in Stockholm, as well as in more regular processes such as the Luxembourg process for betteremployment policies and the Cardiff process for more efficient product markets.The EMU to dateIt must then be asked, of course, how well this framework is working now that EMU is a reality. It iscertainly too early to draw definite conclusions about these matters but I can offer some observations.The first point worth noting is that we are now reaping the benefits of the convergence process and ofthe consensus on stabilisation policy that has, in fact, been established. Europe is now experiencing an
BIS Review 102/20004economic upswing in which macroeconomic conditions are more stable and inflation expectationslower than for many decades.Since the move to EMU, there have been no clear signs of asymmetric shocks that might hit aparticular country or group of countries, although the Asian crisis and the subsequent unrest did affectthe member states somewhat differently. And we do not know what would have happened during thetempestuous autumn of 1998 if Stage Three had not been well on the way. Perhaps exchange ratedevelopments in Europe would have been considerably more dramatic and disruptive. It will berecalled that the Swedish currency’s deviation from a reasonable long-term level was considerablygreater than that of, for example, the Finnish markka.Inflation’s convergence in the run up to Stage Three has been checked, however, and recently thespread has even become wider. This is hardly surprising in itself, neither is it a major problem. Theprocess known as catching up means that countries with a below-average level of prosperity initiallywill benefit from technological and organisational advances elsewhere and accordingly grow fasterthan the rich countries, which in turn can lead to higher inflation. Furthermore, countries with strongexport-led growth can experience upward wage pressure in other sectors, too, leading ultimately tohigher inflation. So there are reasons why growth rates as well as rates of inflation can diverge in amonetary union without this being unnatural or a problem for either the countries in question or theunion as a whole.It seems fairly evident that elements of this kind of “more innocuous” inflation are around at present.The clearest example is Ireland, with catch-up effects and a number of years of exceptionalproductivity growth. But even there the picture is not unambiguous and when inflation now increasesin a number of member states, questions arise about the formation of stabilisation policy.This is definitely not a problem that can be tackled with measures of monetary policy. The function ofmonetary policy is to maintain price stability in the union as a whole, a mandate that seems to begenerally supported and understood. Neither is there any cause to criticise how monetary policy hasbeen conducted in practice. There has been a clear endeavour to counter the upward price tendency. Inmy opinion, however, it would have been an advantage if management of the exchange rate had beenclearly assigned to the central bank, instead of the leaving the responsibility to so many.As regards fiscal policy, experience has not been entirely positive. As I mentioned earlier, in StageThree of EMU the Stability Pact is monitored with annual stability programmes. This process hasworked fairly well in exerting peer pressure on countries with large deficits: no country has yetexceeded the Pact’s lower limit. But assessments of individual countries have tended to differ withoutthere always being factual grounds for this. Neither has particularly good use been made of the goldenopportunity that Europe’s present economic upswing provides for faster budget consolidation.Countries should now be making the most of the chance of quickly turning a deficit into a surplus butthat is not happening. This may prove to be unfortunate further ahead and it runs counter to the spiritof the Pact. Peer pressure has evidently not been strong enough. Examples of short-run considerationsgaining the upper hand in this respect were evident when the dramatic oil price rise led severalcountries to cut petroleum taxes or subsidise oil-intensive industries, which is hardly sustainable in thelonger run for either the economy or the environment.Before concluding I should also like to say something about financial stability in the EU area. As Iindicated earlier, EMU is leading to more integrated financial markets. In the absence of nationalmonetary policies, this accentuates the need of joint systems and standards for financial oversight. Italso increases the need of readiness for the joint management of financial crises. Work in this field isnow in progress in a variety of fora.Concluding remarksInternationalisation in general, with growth in trade and factor mobility, has brought the EU memberstates closer together and increased their interdependence. Politically motivated changes such as theinternal market and the new monetary union have served to promote this trend.
5BIS Review 102/2000As regards government finances, various processes, including a system of sanctions, have been set upto test national policies. This is because of the risk that individual member states would otherwise beable to pursue a policy that could harm the others. Processes have also been established in other policyareas to highlight key issues in the European debate, to point to good examples and to exert peerpressure. This should not be belittled: we know from Swedish experience that comparative analysisand in-depth debate can push things in the desired direction.So what should we expect in the future? I have briefly touched on a number of situations wherecooperation and coordination could lead to a better EU policy. However, even if there are rewards tobe earned from coordination, it will probably be some time before the EU member states aresufficiently mature to take further big leaps. Ultimately it now boils down to the sensitive issue of howmuch power should be placed in European rather than national hands. But there is no doubting thestrength of the tension between the single monetary policy and the remainder of economic policy thatis still handled at national level. In this tension lies the seeds of continued economic policycoordination in Europe.
1BIS Review 102/2000Willem F Duisenberg: The euro and the single monetary policySpeech by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the10th anniversary of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, Amsterdam, 10 November 2000.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,It is a great pleasure for me to be invited to the 10th anniversary of the Amsterdam Institute ofFinance. I wish to express my warmest thanks to the organisers for their invitation. This Institute isrightly famous for providing top-level courses in finance. I think that such a mission is indeed of greatrelevance today, as financial instruments and techniques are constantly evolving, and dynamiceconomies require professionals to update and obtain further qualifications throughout theirprofessional lives.Now, I should like to talk to you about the first two years of experience with the euro and the singlemonetary policy.The new monetary regime introduced in January 1999 with the start of European Economic andMonetary Union has proved to be a success in many respects. The operational framework throughwhich the Eurosystem provides liquidity to banks has functioned very well. The ECB’s monetarypolicy strategy has been firmly established, widely explained and is being increasingly understood.The ECB has taken and shall continue to take the necessary decisions to ensure the maintenance ofprice stability over the medium term. Moreover, the introduction of the euro has acted as a catalyst forrestructuring and enhancing competition in Europe. The euro is one of the reasons behind the currentpace of economic growth on our continent. Finally, capital markets in Europe have clearly benefitedfrom the establishment of Monetary Union.Allow me to elaborate further on these issues. The single monetary policy relies on an efficientoperational framework, which has been implemented without major difficulties. It has proved tofunction very smoothly. It has, indeed, managed to clearly signal the monetary policy stance, bysteering short-term market interest rates and by providing liquidity to the banking system in anefficient manner. A key element of the functioning of the operational framework has been theTARGET payment system which interlinks the 15 national real-time gross settlement systems and theECB payment mechanism by providing a uniform platform for the processing of cross-borderpayments in real time. This is a great technical achievement which has made it possible to create asingle interbank market interest rate across the euro area. In September 2000 70% of the value ofpayment instructions/orders/transactions through gross settlement systems in Europe were processedthrough TARGET.Let me now turn to the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. A close understanding of the framework ofour analysis is indispensable in order to fully grasp the policy pursued by the ECB.The first element of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy is the published definition of price stability.Price stability has been defined as “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of ConsumerPrices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%”. The ECB has also stated that price stability is to bemaintained over the medium term. The definition is intended to securely anchor inflation expectations.Moreover, it provides a clear yardstick against which the ECB’s monetary policy can be heldaccountable for the achievement of its primary objective.In order to take appropriate decisions with regard to this objective, the ECB monitors a broad set ofindicators. First, a prominent role has been assigned to money as the so-called first pillar of thestrategy. The assignment of such a prominent role to money is justified by the available econometricevidence. This evidence suggests the existence of a stable relationship in the euro area between thebroad monetary aggregate M3, the price level and a small number of other euro area-widemacroeconomic variables. The important role assigned to money has been signalled by the
BIS Review 102/20002announcement of a reference value of 4½% for the annual growth rate of M3. The first pillar consistsnot only of a detailed analysis of deviations of M3 growth from the reference value for the informationthat they contain about the outlook for price stability, but it also embodies a thorough analysis ofmonetary developments, including careful monitoring of the components and counterparts of M3.In addition to a thorough analysis of monetary developments, a comprehensive assessment of a widerange of other economic and financial indicators constitutes a further basis for monetary policy. Thisassessment encompasses an analysis of, inter alia, cost and price indices, the exchange rate, realeconomic indicators, and financial markets indicators. In brief, the role of this second pillar is toprovide information about the prevailing economic situation and on the nature and magnitude of risksto price stability, which are not made apparent from an analysis of the monetary aggregates in acomplete or timely way.Some commentators have regarded this strategy, based on the assessment of two sets of indicators, asunclear and overly complex. I have two responses to such criticism.First, new methods and new strategies are not always fully understood from the outset. The learningand familiarisation process can take some time.Second, I would stress that the two-pillar structure of the ECB’s strategy has been adopted for a goodreason. Both pillars have well-defined, important and complementary roles. The first pillar consists ofapproaches to the price determination process which assign a prominent role to money. The secondpillar comprises analytical frameworks which focus mainly on real economic variables. Bothapproaches are valid and can be useful to analyse different aspects of the economic environment in amanner which assists monetary policy decisions.This broader approach, prompted by the adoption of the two-pillar structure, is particularly proficientin coping with the uncertainties inherent in modern and complex economies. We should recall thatthese uncertainties may have been compounded by the regime shift associated with the transition toStage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. The changeover to the single currency may havealtered the way expectations are formed in the euro area. It may thus have changed the effects ofmonetary policy on financial behaviour, consumption, investment and wage bargaining. Or, tosummarise, it may have changed the very nature of the monetary transmission mechanism in the euroarea. In such an uncertain environment, monetary policy analysts must use a “full-informationapproach” and carefully cross-check the signals sent from different types of indicators.Moving to more general issues associated with the introduction of the euro, there is no doubt that thisregime shift is acting as a powerful catalyst for economic growth and restructuring in Europe. Severalforces are at work. The introduction of the euro combined with the Single Market has increased the“economic” size of the market. Price transparency has significantly improved both across countriesand over time. The macroeconomic horizon of investors has been, so to speak, “cleared” by theprinciple of price stability and the rules of fiscal discipline. Moreover, the single currency provides animpetus for the development and the integration of financial markets in Europe. This in turn willcontribute to a more efficient allocation of savings across Europe.The development and the integration of capital markets in Europe have been fostered for some timenow by financial liberalisation, globalisation and technological innovation. The introduction of theeuro is giving this trend a significant boost in Europe. The single currency has removed the exchangerate risk barriers between the countries of the euro area; it is facilitating the standardisation of debtinstruments and widening the range of investment opportunities. Corporate bond issuance hasincreased significantly since the introduction of the euro. There are indications that the focus of issuersis shifting in some respects from country-specific to sector-specific risk assessment.In the banking sector too, the changeover to the single currency seems to have intensified the trendtowards consolidation. Although most mergers have been domestic, they have often been instigatedand influenced by euro area-wide market developments and the integration of financial marketsfollowing the introduction of the euro. Moreover, there is no doubt that the introduction of the eurohas encouraged the internationalisation of banking activities. In particular, the rapid integration of the
3BIS Review 102/2000wholesale banking and capital markets, as well as large-value payment systems, has already createdcloser links between banks at the euro area level.Overall, these new economic and financial conditions in Europe are creating new investmentopportunities, encouraging industrial restructuring and promoting sound competition betweeneconomic agents in a new, enlarged market. For sure, the beneficial effects of this new environment oneconomic structures will only be felt gradually, but there is no doubt that these effects are deep andlasting.Meanwhile, other economic policies are needed to accompany this restructuring process. This is not todeny that important progress has already been made. Over recent years, wage settlements have beenrelatively moderate, public finances have improved, deregulation and liberalisation have been initiatedin a number of sectors, and there are signs that labour markets are gradually becoming less rigid.Employment grew by 1.8% in 1999 and by over 2% in the first half of 2000, and since the start ofMonetary Union, the unemployment rate in the euro area has fallen by 1.5 percentage points.However, further efforts are required in order to create the best conditions for turning the currentupswing in economic activity into a period of sustained growth in an environment of price stability.With regard to fiscal policies, the overriding objective for governments should be to shelter theirbudgets not only from normal cyclical fluctuations, but also from unexpected shortfalls in revenuesand interest rate increases. In the current favourable economic conditions, it is crucial that anyloosening of fiscal policy be avoided and that further progress along the path towards fiscalconsolidation is made. In parallel, governments’ budgetary policies also urgently need to addresslonger-term issues, such as the structural reform of social transfer systems.Significant reductions in unemployment can only be reached through resolute measures to improve thefunctioning of labour and product markets. The successful experience in some countries of the euroarea has shown that such reforms can rapidly provide important benefits for the economy and forsociety.Finally, looking at the process of regulatory reform, although a good deal of deregulation andliberalisation of previously sheltered sectors has taken place, there is still plenty of scope for furthermeasures to increase the level of competition and stimulate entrepreneurial initiative.Let me now shift the focus from structural to more conjunctural issues and briefly discuss the currenteconomic situation. The first message I should like to convey is that there is good reason to remainconfident that strong growth will be sustained in the euro area. Euro area real GDP has been growingat an annualised rate of around 3½% for four consecutive quarters, including the second quarter of2000. Some monthly indicators, which extend into or cover the third quarter of this year, point to somemoderation of these high growth rates. In particular, the pace of growth in industrial productionappears to have declined somewhat and some survey data showed signs of moderation. At the sametime, however, confidence remains high, underpinned by positive factors such as high employmentgrowth. The extended period of high and rising oil prices has certainly increased the uncertaintysurrounding the sustainability of recent growth trends in the world economy. However, by contrastwith previous periods of strong and prolonged increases in oil prices, the world economy is now lessdependent on oil and inflationary pressures are still being contained. This should help to ensure thatthe impact of high oil prices on growth remains moderate over the medium term. All in all, the outlookis for the continuation of robust growth in the foreseeable future.Turning to monetary developments, M3 growth has been deviating from the reference value of 4½%since the beginning of 1999. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 covering theperiod from July to September stood at 5.4%. Over recent months, however, a moderation in M3dynamics has taken place, as is visible in shorter-term growth rates. For example, the seasonallyadjusted and annualised growth rate of M3 stood at 3.6% in September.At the same time, the recent increase in the growth rate of loans to the private sector should not beoverrated. This was considerably influenced by the financing of the payments for UMTS licences bytelecommunication companies. This does not imply high risks to price stability in the medium term aslong as the proceeds are used, as expected, to redeem government debt.
BIS Review 102/20004In sum, recent developments seem to indicate that, following the series of interest rate increases by theECB, monetary developments are currently settling down at a more moderate pace of growth.As for the developments in consumer prices in the euro area, annual HICP inflation rose to 2.8% inSeptember, compared with 2.3% in August. This increase mainly resulted from the acceleration inenergy prices. A contribution was also provided by the higher year-on-year change in prices ofnon-energy industrial goods in the HICP to 0.8%, from 0.6% in August 2000. This, in combinationwith the slight increase in the annual rate of change in processed food prices, led the rate of annualHICP inflation excluding energy goods to increase to 1.6% in September 2000, from 1.5% in August.Owing to developments in energy prices and the decline thus far in the euro, consumer price inflationmay remain above 2% for longer than was expected some months ago. It is important to recognise thatthese are temporary price increases resulting from external factors which monetary policy cannotcounteract. The ECB, like all other central banks, is not able to influence consumer price inflation inthe short term owing to the time-lags of monetary policy. Moreover, such first-round effects do notinfringe upon the ECB’s objective of price stability, since the latter is to be fulfilled in the mediumterm. In order to ensure the maintenance of price stability precisely over the medium term, it is,however, crucial that longer-term inflation expectations of economic agents do not increase. In thisrespect, the past decisions to increase ECB rates should have contributed to maintaining confidence inprice stability over the medium term.This confidence should also continue to guide the wage formation process in the euro area. At thecurrent juncture, it is of paramount importance to avoid second-round effects of the increase in oilprices materialising. I am confident that a protracted period of robust economic growth and pricestability lies ahead, provided that all policy areas fulfil their respective tasks.
1BIS Review 101/2000Klaus Liebscher: The prerequisites and key challengesfor participation in the euro areaLuncheon speech by Dr Klaus Liebscher, Governor of the Austrian National Bank, at a conference ofthe Austrian National Bank and the Joint Vienna Institute, held in Vienna, on 7 November 2000.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen!I am glad to have this opportunity to personally thank you for your participation and all speakers fortheir active involvement in this year’s East-West Conference, which centers on topics that are crucialfor the future economic development in the transition countries and, ultimately, for the people living inthese countries. It is a pleasure for us to continue the tradition of offering our annualEast-West Conferences as a platform and a meeting place for the debate on issues relevant to transitioncountries in order to help better answers to the challenges ahead to be developed.Since the very inception of transformation, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank has had the uniqueopportunity to be an active partner for central banks in transition countries. At the same time, theOesterreichische Nationalbank has been actively participating in another historic project, therealization of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the introduction of the euro.The establishment of the euro as the single currency in 11 sovereign countries of the European Unionat the beginning of 1999 was certainly not a purely economic move, but rather another very importantpolitical step in the process of European integration that began more than half a century ago.…The creation of EMU can certainly be considered a success. Soon after transformation had begun, acommon agreement was reached between the Member States of the European Union in the Treaty ofMaastricht to build EMU. In the second half of the nineties, this decision markedly shaped economicand financial developments in the European Union, as it led to an impressive process of disinflation, tonominal and real convergence within the EU as well as to a process of consolidation of publicfinances.Right from the start of Stage Three of EMU, a unified, deep and liquid euro area-wide money marketwas successfully established, and the area-wide market has displayed considerably less volatility thanthe 11 individual money markets before. Moreover, the euro has received widespread acceptance inthe bond markets. To give but two figures, 30% of the outstanding volume of international debtsecurities were denominated in euro at the end of June 2000, and the euro-denominated issuancevolume was roughly comparable to that in USD in the first quarter of 2000. Both sovereign andcorporate borrowers are making use of the favorable financing conditions created by the introductionof the euro.The EC Treaty established a clear institutional framework for the euro area’s monetary policy. ThePresident and the Vice President of the ECB plus the other four members of the ECB Executive Boardand the Governors of the national central banks of the 11 countries participating in the euro area formthe Governing Council of the ECB, which is responsible for monetary policy decisions. The Treatyenshrines the maintenance of price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy.The Governing Council of the ECB has decided that price stability should be defined as a year-on-yearincrease in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%, and thatthis objective has to be achieved over the medium term. If the Eurosystem’s track record is measuredagainst this clearly defined target, it can be stated that the objective of price stability has been reached,and I am convinced that it will be attained in the future, as well. With consumer prices in the euro area
BIS Review 101/20002increasing by just 1.1% in 1999, inflation has come down to one of the lowest levels in the past50 years.During the course of this year, inflation increased to 2.2% year-on-year in the period January toSeptember and to 2.8% year-on-year in the month of September, owing mainly to external factors. It isobvious that influences by the price development of raw materials, in particular oil, and by exchangerate developments cannot be remedied by monetary policy alone or even in the short term - and that isprecisely one of the main reasons why our definition of price-stability relates to the medium term.Moreover, as it is imperative to contain upward pressure on prices in the medium term, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB has gradually raised the interest rate on the main refinancing operations by a totalof 2.25 percentage points to 4.75% since November 1999. These measures aim at avoidingsecond-round effects on wage-bargaining and price-setting at the national level and at fosteringconfidence in the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.…The euro area is one large, relatively closed currency area which has replaced eleven smaller opencurrency areas, and the euro is one of the key currencies of the world. This explains why theEurosystem has no exchange rate target. However, the development of the external value of the euro istaken into account in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, which is based on two pillars. Thefirst pillar consists in the analysis of the monetary developments, with an announced reference valuefor the growth of M3. The second pillar comprises the analysis of other economic and financialindicators which may signal inflationary risks, and the exchange rate is precisely one of theseindicators.In particular, in so far as the strengthening of the USD against the euro has contributed to the recentacceleration of inflation in the euro area, it is certainly a reason for concern which has to be addressedadequately. Looking at the main underlying causes, the high rate of domestically based real growth inthe United States seems to have been one of the main underlying factors of that strength. However, itis also important to bear in mind the historic dimension of the euro area as a common Europeanproject, and the adequate approach to evaluating the exchange rate of the euro against the USD iscertainly a long-term one.…How can we turn the current expansion in the euro area into a prolonged period of non-inflationarygrowth? There is no doubt that this is a challenge for both society as a whole and policymakers. Whatit takes is people who are prepared to act as entrepreneurs and are willing to take risks. What it takesare policymakers who set incentives and push for continuous economic reform and adjustment.Existing regulations have to be checked continuously in terms of their adequacy, and adaptations haveto be introduced as timely as possible, while paying due attention to social needs. In particular, it isimportant that the current economic expansion should be used to enhance the fiscal consolidation.…How does this experience translate to countries in transition? What is the relevance of this experiencefor them ?Obviously, there is a consistent need of economic reform in all societies. While those reforms whichcan be characterized as transition-specific will sooner or later come to an end, “completing transition”- the theme of this conference - should not be mistaken as “completing reforms”, as reforms will neverbe complete and the need for further adjustments will always arise again.Constant reform efforts are the key to achieve a path of sustainable high real growth. Maintaining afaster pace of average real growth than in the European Union is a minimum condition for keeping thecatching-up process going in the transition economies. We all need and benefit from this catching-up
3BIS Review 101/2000process, both in Europe as a whole and on a global level, as we cannot afford the persistence or evenwidening of the existing gaps between poor and rich countries. Moreover, a balanced and consistentpolicy-mix will be of crucial importance also for the transition countries in their catching-up andintegration efforts. In that respect, I am glad that this conference provides an excellent opportunity toreview the policy challenges the transition economies face in the most important fields of economicpolicy.…Let me briefly touch these fields, which range from microeconomic reforms over macroeconomicpolicies to integration policies.Firstly, structural reforms are the key to long-term success. Existing productive capacities have to bereshaped, and new ones have to be built, above all in the service sector. In particular, financialservices, which were practically non-existent when transition started a decade ago, have to bestrengthened further. Developing structures and institutions of financial intermediation is theprerequisite for ensuring the high level of productive real investment necessary for high real GDPgrowth. More broadly, structural convergence is a conditio sine qua non for successful transition and itis an indispensable basis for sustainable macroeconomic stability.Secondly, in the field of macroeconomic policies, I would like to underline the importance offormulating and implementing stability-oriented, sustainable and consistent fiscal and monetarypolicies. To keep the accession process manageable even now that the Union is negotiating with acomparatively large number of countries, it will be essential to key the pace of negotiations asobjectively as possible to the further progress of the candidate countries toward fulfilling theconditions for EU membership.This involves two aspects: first, the speed of enlargement must not compromise its quality, andsecond, differences between the countries in the two former groups of candidates must be taken intoconsideration if there is a factual reason to do so. An overly ambitious approach which is notadequately underpinned by developments in the real economy may lead to losses in credibility or eventurn out to be counterproductive to stability and to the long-term catching-up process. From my pointof view, it is clear that adequately designed stability-oriented policies facilitate structural change. Inthat way, prudent efforts towards stabilization and structural change can reinforce each other and willfoster the catching-up process.…Turning to monetary policy, I am convinced that a sound stance and conduct can best be achieved ifthe central bank is fully independent. Central bank independence - ie institutional, personal andfinancial independence - is a basic building block any country that intends to join the European Unionhas to put in place. Moreover, I am sure that price stability should be regarded as the primary objectiveof monetary policy in transition countries, as well. However, in most transition countries that objectivecan only be defined in concrete terms by taking into account the specific characteristics of thetransition process and, in particular, the fact that structural convergence is a longer-term process aswell. While steering a clear course towards disinflation, a cautious approach to monetary policy,especially in setting explicit targets, is called for.…The Central and Eastern European countries which are involved in accession negotiations with theEuropean Union are confronted with the basic question of how Economic and Monetary Unionfeatures in the overall context of enlargement. As far as we can judge today, we see the economic andmonetary policy integration of the candidate countries proceeding in three steps. In a first step, the
BIS Review 101/20004candidates will accede to the European Union, then they will participate in the ERM II, the exchangerate mechanism of the Union, and finally, they will introduce the euro as their national currency.Let me make very clear that fulfillment of the Maastricht convergence criteria is not a prerequisite formembership in the European Union. Still, a reasonable degree of macroeconomic prudence is essentialin the run-up to EU accession, as stability-oriented policies facilitate structural change and foster thecatching-up process in Central and Eastern Europe.In this context, it is important to underline that there are no institutional constraints on exchange ratepolicies during the preaccession period. Any exchange rate regime is feasible during this stage,provided that it contributes to and is embedded in an overall set of policies that is sound andeffectively geared toward stability. What really matters is not the exchange rate regime as such, but theconsistency and soundness of the policy mix as a whole. Experience shows that stability-orientedpolicies underpinned by wide-ranging structural reforms contribute substantially to limiting exchangerate variability.Not only institutional and legal aspects as well as the principle of equal treatment, but also economicconsiderations strongly suggest the step-by-step procedure I have sketched out. Adopting the euro tooearly could place severe strains on such countries’ economies, and perhaps even trigger substantial andlasting disturbances. Such a course of action would be in the interest neither of the current euro areamembers, nor of future members of the euro area.…A number of Central and Eastern European transition countries have already achieved a high degree oftrade and financial integration with the European Union and have reached quite close convergencewith these countries. As a next step, this economic integration has to be deepened and complementedby institutional integration. Finally, the efforts of these countries to become members of the EuropeanUnion will further enhance their integration into the world economy.Personally, I am convinced that both the economic preparations during the preaccession period as wellas the accession itself will boost structural reforms and developments, thus reinforcing the dynamicstructural adjustments that we have witnessed as a consequence of transformation in general and tradeliberalization under the Europe agreements (ie the EU association agreements) in particular.Companies seem to have started already to take into account the perspective of EU enlargement fortheir investment decisions. Moreover, the adoption of the acquis communautaire and the process ofinstitution-building for an effective implementation of this acquis will harmonize and improve theinstitutional and legal setup in these countries.…Before concluding, let me come back to an important issue I already touched briefly - central bankindependence. What does the European Union mean by “central bank independence”? Basically, it isindependence from other authorities, in particular political authorities, in the conduct of monetarypolicy and, more broadly, in the performance of all the tasks that are related to the ESCB, theEuropean System of Central Banks, in which the central banks of all EU Member States participate.Central bank independence is essential for the credibility of the European System of Central Banksand for the effective conduct of a stability-oriented monetary policy. Independence has three maindimensions - the institutional, the personal and the financial dimension.• Institutional independence primarily means that central banks are prohibited from seekingor taking instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of aMember State or from any other body. Likewise, rights of third parties to approve, suspend,annul or defer central bank decisions on ESCB-related tasks are incompatible with the EUTreaty. The same is true of any rights to censor such decisions on legal grounds.
5BIS Review 101/2000• Personal independence is about ensuring tenure for members of the ESCB’s decision-making bodies by minimum terms of office and giving protection against arbitrary dismissal.To make this latter aspect more concrete, a central bank governor may be relieved fromoffice only if he or she no longer fulfills the conditions required for the performance of his orher duties or if he or she has been guilty of serious misconduct, with the possibility of appealto the European Court of Justice.• Financial independence, in essence, denotes that central banks have to be in a position toavail themselves of the appropriate means to ensure that they can properly fulfill theirESCB-related tasks.Those applicant countries which engaged in accession talks with the European Union in 1998 alreadydealt, in detail, with the issue of central bank independence during the membership negotiations lastfall, when the chapter “Economic and Monetary Union” was on the agenda. Progress in the candidatecountries on this issue is being monitored very closely by the European Union at large and by theEuropean System of Central Banks in particular.…Let me draw the conclusion that the key challenge facing the applicant countries in the next few years,consists in strengthening their market economies and their competitiveness by firmly pushing aheadwith structural reform and by subsequently adopting the Community acquis in the process. Only onthis basis will the EU candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe be able to attain durableand sustainable macroeconomic stability, and only by taking these steps will they ultimately be able tofulfill, in a lasting manner, the prerequisites for participation in the euro area.Thank you very much for your attention.
1BIS Review 100/2000Murray Sherwin: Institutional frameworks for inflation targetingSpeech by Mr Murray Sherwin, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the Bankof Thailand Symposium “Practical experiences on inflation targeting”, held in Bangkok, on20 October 2000.*      *      *IntroductionGovernor, distinguished guests, fellow central bankers, ladies and gentlemen. It is always a pleasure tofind an opportunity to visit Thailand and this is no exception. Thank you, Governor, for the invitation.It is also a considerable honour to be invited to address this symposium on the subject of inflationtargeting. The subject of today’s deliberations is an important one and I applaud the Bank ofThailand’s decision to convene this public symposium to air the issues. That decision is in the besttraditions of transparency which characterises inflation targeting central banks.I have been asked to discuss institutional frameworks for inflation targeting. Inflation targeting hasattracted increasing attention around the world over recent years. We have seen this approach tomonetary policy spread from the small, open, OECD economies to a number of the emergingeconomies - in Eastern Europe, Latin America and now in Asia. The concept first emerged in my owncountry, New Zealand, in the late 1980s. In our case, it gained a formal institutional structure with thepassage of a new charter for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1989.Inflation targeting arose in New Zealand in an environment that will seem rather familiar to many ofour Asian friends - at least in some important respects. It was developed in a very small, openeconomy that was adjusting to a newly-opened capital account, a newly-floated exchange rate, andnewly-deregulated financial markets. It was developed with the recognition that a more traditionalstructure for monetary policy, perhaps one focused on targeting particular definitions of moneysupply, was likely to prove inadequate in this newly deregulated and rapidly evolving environment.While many other countries have now adopted inflation targeting, each country brings its own history,traditions and institutions to these decisions. For that reason, we find a variety of institutionalstructures are utilised.My comments today obviously will draw heavily on the New Zealand regime. And while I willattempt to generalise the lessons we have learned, and to draw from the experience and structures ofother inflation targeting central banks, it is important to highlight up front that there are few fixedpoints for the architects of a new inflation targeting regime to fasten on. We are still learning andadapting as we go. So too are other inflation targeting central banks.ContextThese are awkward times for small, open economies as they struggle to find monetary and financialstructures that will facilitate growth, prosperity and stability in a world characterised by increasingopenness to trade and capital flows and, it seems, increasing volatility. The events of 1997 and 1998demonstrated how rapidly stresses in one economy can be transmitted to others. They also underlinedjust how important are strong institutions, strong balance sheets - in both the public and the privatesector - and strong risk management practices to ensuring robustness in the face of shocks.Dr Grenville, our next speaker, will deal with the issues of inflation targeting in a world of volatilecapital flows. I see that as a key component of our discussions today because we know that we have tobe able to devise structures that enable us to live in such a world. The evolution towards more opencapital accounts and greater capital mobility is being driven largely by technological developments.
BIS Review 100/20002Those new technologies bring us all enormous advantages and are fuelling extraordinary growthinternationally.The challenge we all face is how to gain the advantages of the new technologies without beingswamped by their other consequences - such as the enhanced mobility of capital, of goods, ideas,skills, people and resources generally. Amongst other things, this requires us to find institutional andpolicy structures that enable us to take advantage of the new technologies while acquiring theflexibility to adapt rapidly and without undue stress to new developments and shocks.The institutional structure employed for the conduct of monetary policy is just one of the factors thatpolicymakers need consider in thinking about these issues. Trade policy, prudential regulation,accounting and audit standards, legal structures and bankruptcy provisions - amongst other elements ofpolicy - are all very important and should not be overlooked in the design of robust institutionalframeworks. But today we are here to consider just monetary policy.What is inflation targeting?First, a couple of definitional points to help locate the discussion we will be engaging in over the restof the day. What is inflation targeting?A substantial study of inflation targeting was published in 1999 by Ben Bernanke, Thomas Laubach,Rick Mishkin and Adam Posen.1 In their book, they described it in the following way:“Inflation targeting is a framework for monetary policy characterised by the public announcement ofofficial quantitative targets (or target ranges) for the inflation rate over one or more time horizons, andby explicit acknowledgement that low, stable inflation is monetary policy’s primary long-run goal.Among other important features of inflation targeting are vigorous efforts to communicate with thepublic about the plans and objectives of the monetary authorities, and, in many cases, mechanisms thatstrengthen the central bank’s accountability for attaining those objectives.”In providing that definition, the authors of this study take some care to describe inflation targeting as aframework as opposed to a rule. In other words, inflation targeting fits somewhere between theextremes which feature in the “rules versus discretion” debate which raged in monetary policy circlesin earlier years. Inflation targeting is not “automatic” in the sense of a Friedman-like rule by whichgrowth in the money supply is governed in order to achieve the ultimate goal of price stability. But nordoes inflation targeting allow the central bank full discretion to take decisions in any ad hoc orunconstrained fashion. Rather, inflation targeting can be described as a form of “constraineddiscretion”. To quote Bernanke et al again, “By imposing a conceptual structure and its inherentdiscipline on the central bank, but without eliminating all flexibility, inflation targeting combinessome of the advantages traditionally ascribed to rules with those ascribed to discretion.”Of course, even within an inflation targeting regime, countries can choose the nature or extent ofdiscretion they wish to leave with their central bankers. Such flexibility is one of the prime attractionsof the inflation targeting approach.In New Zealand, the development of inflation targeting owed a lot more to the Harvard BusinessSchool than to the Chicago monetarists we are sometimes accused of following. The Reserve Bank ofNew Zealand was just one of a number of state agencies in the process of undergoing reform in thelate-1980s, and the guiding principles for those reforms came from the text books on corporategovernance rather than from those on monetary policy. The key concerns were for organisationaleffectiveness, with state agencies generally required to:• establish clear objectives;• provide for clear divisions of responsibility between the key decision makers;1Bernanke et al, 1999
3BIS Review 100/2000• provide for clear delegations of decision-making power which are aligned with theestablished responsibilities;• specify clear accountabilities so that those given the authority to make decisions may be heldfirmly accountable for the quality of their decisions; and• ensure transparency, so that all can see what decisions have been taken, by whom, againstwhat objectives, and for what reason.Applying those principles to the central bank, we can see how the inflation targeting framework fallsout fairly naturally. In the case of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand:• The objective is clear - we must deliver inflation outcomes of between 0 and 3%.• Also clear is the division of responsibility - it is the Governor who is solely charged withdelivering the agreed inflation objective.• To that end, the Governor has decision-making authority required to undertake the taskdelegated to him - ministers are not consulted on monetary policy matters in the normalcourse of events. Indeed, to preserve the independence of the central bank, ministers are notinformed of our periodic monetary policy decisions until just ahead of the publicannouncement and well after the decisions have been formally committed.• Having assigned the Governor the responsibility and authority to make decisions in line withthe specified objective, we have a board of directors whose primary task is to monitor theGovernor’s performance and thereby to hold him accountable for the quality of his decisions.Ultimately, the board could recommend the Governor’s dismissal should they feel that he isnot diligently or competently pursuing the objective established for him - although, ofcourse, there are intermediate courses of action available to the board before reaching such adrastic conclusion.• And finally, our framework demands a high degree of transparency. For example, the formaltarget for monetary policy is established in a published agreement. The Bank is obliged topublish formal statements laying out how monetary policy has evolved and why, andpointing the way forward for future decisions. A Select Committee of the Parliamentroutinely reviews the Bank’s conduct of policy in a public hearing. And while the Actprovides for the government to over-ride the agreed policy targets agreement in certaincircumstances, it also requires that to be done in a public process.Specific issues of institutional formLet me deal with a selection of the more specific issues which emerge in the design of an inflationtargeting regime. This is necessarily just a small subset of the issues we could discuss, but hopefully Ican shed some perspectives on some of the more significant institutional choices.An independent central bank?Inflation targeting and central bank independence tend to go hand in hand although it is certainlypossible to conceive of structures where that is not the case.The case for central bank independence is well understood and well covered in the literature on timeinconsistency. In essence, the public, and particularly its elected representatives, are likely to faceincentives which bias them in favour of tolerating the risk of increased inflation. That bias emerges asa consequence of the long and variable lags associated with monetary policy decisions. The benefits oflong-run price stability lie in the future. The costs that may be associated with attaining or preservingprice stability are borne up front. And faced with the immediate imperatives of political life, ourdemocratic representatives face pressures to defer the immediate investment in future price stability infavour of the immediate benefits of lower interest rates and/or faster growth.
BIS Review 100/20004An independent central bank specifically charged with maintaining price stability, effectivelyempowered and resourced to do the job, and held accountable against the achievement of thatobjective, is a fairly logical response to dealing with that inherent inflationary bias by institutionalisinga contrary bias in favour of long-run price stability.A common and understandable concern about the concept of an independent central bank is that it isinconsistent with the traditions of democratic parliamentary structures. We normally expect theauthority of the state to be exercised by our elected representatives rather than by central bankbureaucrats.So how can we overcome that inconsistency?In our case, we have an Act of Parliament that spells out the medium term objective of the centralbank in language that is quite broad and uncontentious. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is obligedto pursue “stability in the general level of prices”.But what is meant by “stability in the general level of prices”? That is not defined in the Act. But theMinister of Finance and the Governor are obliged to agree an operational target and to publish that in aPolicy Targets Agreement (PTA) covering the five-year term of the Governor. In effect, this is theGovernor’s employment contract.2We find this an important mechanism. It confers a degree of democratic legitimacy on the inflationtarget by openly committing the Minister and his government to the inflation target.Just as importantly, the government can over-ride this agreement where it feels there is good reason -perhaps in some situation of crisis or unusual shock. That is provided for. But there are rules to becomplied with. The over-ride must be published and must be tabled in the Parliament for debate. Anysuch over-ride can persist for no more than one year without again being subjected to Parliamentaryscrutiny.As usual, there are alternative models available. In our case, we have instrument independence - inother words, the central bank has wide discretion in how it goes about achieving its inflation target.But we do not have goal independence - we do not establish for ourselves the target for monetarypolicy in the way, for instance, that the US Federal Reserve Board or the European Central Bank areempowered to do.We feel very comfortable with a structure that requires active government participation in establishingthe goal of monetary policy. Indeed, we believe it is an important provision reinforcing the legitimacyof the central bank’s task. But it is clear that both models are viable and can operate effectively in theirparticular circumstances.Before leaving the subject of central bank independence, I should touch on one other importantquestion - the funding of the central bank. We, like other central banks, have traditionally generatedsubstantial profits through seignorage - issuing bank notes to the public and investing the proceeds ingovernment bonds. Under our old structures, those profits were applied to the administration of theBank at our own discretion with the residual surplus turned over to the government.It was clear at an early stage of our reforms that such a comfortable arrangement was never going tosurvive. But how to have an independent central bank while still imposing some reasonable degree ofexternal financial constraint? Clearly the usual governmental process of annual appropriations was notsuitable since this could provide a very direct route by which the independence of the Bank could bequickly undermined.2Note that the RBNZ Act does not specifically oblige us to operate an inflation targeting regime. In principle, the PTAcould specify some other intermediate target, eg a monetary aggregate, nominal GDP or even, at a stretch, the exchangerate. The significant constraint is that the intermediate target chosen must be consistent with some reasonable definitionof “stability in the general level of prices”.
5BIS Review 100/2000This dilemma has been resolved, satisfactorily in my view, by a five-year funding agreement in whichthe Bank and the Minister agree on the quantum of funds that the Bank will be able to spend on itsown operations. Any spending over that cap must be drawn from the Bank’s reserves, andunder-spending of the agreed limit may be added to reserves.Our non-executive directors also play an important review role in monitoring the efficiency of ourspending and internal management processes, just as they do in scrutinising the Governor’s monetarypolicy decisions.Decision-making structuresAs noted, the design of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act drew heavily on the principles ofeffective management. In that framework, it is not surprising that the Chief Executive - the Governor -is assigned all of the key decision-making powers of the central bank. While this is not a uniqueprovision, it is not that common. More often seen are arrangements where the key monetary policypowers are assigned to a board or a committee. The Federal Reserve Board’s Federal Open MarketCommittee, the Bank of England’s new Monetary Policy Committee, the Swedish Riksbank’sExecutive Board and the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Board of Directors all provide alternativestructures.In the New Zealand case, the single decision-maker model reflected a concern to retain clearaccountability - if there is any fault to be found with the decisions of the central bank, there is nodoubt about whom is to be held responsible.This is one area which is currently under review in New Zealand. Professor Lars Svensson ofStockholm University has been appointed to review a number of aspects of our monetary policy,including decision-making and governance structures. (I should note that, in commissioning thisreview, the government has specifically ruled out any change to the independence of the central bankor to the concept of a single, price stability target for monetary policy.)In preparing its submission for the Svensson review, the non-executive directors of our board, who arecharged with monitoring the performance of the Governor, have looked at whether they shouldrecommend the adoption of a committee-based decision making structure in place of the current singledecision-maker model.The potentially negative features of a single decision-maker model include:• Exposure to single person risk.• Decision-making may be captured by a single train of thinking and result in inferiordecisions.• A public perception may develop that a single individual, the Governor, has excessivepower. If such a perception were to develop, the “legitimacy” of the central bank’soperational independence may come under question.• A single decision-maker may be insufficiently in touch with what is actually happening inthe economy, or may have only a partial view of developments, thus resulting in inferiordecisions.After careful deliberation, our non-executive directors have chosen to recommend the retention of thecurrent single decision-maker structure. Their reasoning relates primarily to a preference for thegreater clarity of accountability inherent in the current structure. Also important was a sense that thesingle decision-maker facilitates greater coherence and consistency in communication of monetarypolicy issues than is likely with committee structures, and greater effectiveness in the management ofthe organisation. Also, they felt that the risks of the current structure were significantly mitigatedwithin our framework by such provisions as:• A rigorous process for appointing a Governor in which the Minister of Finance must makethe appointment from candidates nominated by the board.
BIS Review 100/20006• Constraints on the Governor’s decision-making authority which are inherent in the RBNZAct and in the Policy Targets Agreement.• The monitoring of the Governor’s performance by the board to ensure that the Governor actsin a collegial manner, and has proper regard for the wide range of advice and input which isobtained from sources internal and external to the Bank.• The transparency provisions which ensure a close external scrutiny of the Governor’sdecisions including, importantly, by financial markets.Further, the non-executive directors have recommended some changes intended to strengthen theboard’s scrutiny of the decision-making processes and thereby reduce further any risks inherent in thesingle decision-maker model.Another consideration which emerged during the consideration of alternative decision-makingstructures related to concerns about potential conflicts of interest where external appointees areinvolved in monetary policy decision-making and the limited pool of available expertise andexperience suited for such a task in a small country like New Zealand.Overall, I doubt that there are many general principles or lessons from international experience thatcan be applied in this area. In many cases, it seems that the formal differences between a singledecision-maker and a committee structure are less obvious in practice than they are on paper.Moreover, it seems that some of the more interesting approaches to committee structures, such as thatof the Bank of England and the Riksbank, are still evolving and settling down. For that reason it maybe too soon to draw firm conclusions about the preferred decision-making structures.Single or multiple goals?The New Zealand framework quite deliberately and explicitly directs monetary policy towards a singleobjective - price stability. This approach stems from an understanding that, in the medium-term,monetary policy affects only the price level; it is not possible to engineer a higher trend rate of realgrowth merely from monetary expansion.The charters of some other central banks are broader, typically requiring monetary policy to placesome weight on other objectives of economic policy such as growth and employment.In the New Zealand case, we felt that having a single price stability objective was helpful in providingclarity of purpose in the earlier stages of a significant disinflationary process. It also supports a clearaccountability framework and fits with what we think monetary policy is able to achieve.But this is not to say that we see no connection between monetary policy and real variables such asgrowth and employment. On the contrary, maintenance of medium-term price stability we see as animportant part of the environment required in order for resources to be allocated to where they can bestbe used. That, of course, is what achieving real growth and maximum employment is all about.Moreover, the way in which monetary policy is conducted in pursuit of price stability can also matter.Just as price stability is conducive to growth, so too is an environment of “monetary stability” inwhich interest and exchange rates are sufficiently stable to act as effective allocative mechanisms.In our case, as inflation has settled at low levels, we have come to devote considerably more attentionto the nature of the trade-offs we may face in our day-to-day monetary policy strategies. In particular,we have been looking more closely at issues relating to the variability of inflation, on the one hand,and the variability of output, interest rates and the exchange rate, on the other hand. With a longertrack record of successfully maintaining price stability comes a better anchoring of the public’sexpectations about future inflation risks. From that comes the possibility that we can be more relaxedabout short-term variations in inflation, particularly where looking through such short-term inflation“noise” enables us to deliver a degree more stability in interest rates, the exchange rate and, possibly,output.
7BIS Review 100/2000Again, in this area we find that the differences in practice between the New Zealand model, with thesingle goal of price stability, and other inflation targeters with a broader mandate, may be rathersmaller than a casual reading of the respective charters might suggest.ConclusionsWe now have a decade of experience with inflation targeting in an increasingly diverse range ofcountries and circumstances. There seems little doubt that inflation targeting is proving to be aneffective framework for monetary policy within these diverse settings. It seems especially welladapted to small, open economies with flexible exchange rates - providing the essential nominalanchor for monetary policy at a time when some of the more familiar guideposts have become lessreliable.The core characteristics of inflation targeting relate to the public announcement of a target forinflation, explicit acknowledgement that low, stable inflation is monetary policy’s primary long-rungoal, transparency about the objectives of policy and the rationale for monetary policy decisions, andstrengthened accountability for the achievement of the goals of policy.The institutional framework for inflation targeting is important - to be effective, inflation targetingmust assist in shaping decisions and behaviour. Well-designed institutional structures can beinfluential in shifting incentives and conditioning decision-making. But that does not mean that thereis a particular formula or set of institutional arrangements that can readily be picked up andtransplanted.No doubt, the Bank of Thailand is bringing its own perspectives to these issues, and adapting theexperience and practice of others to find structures that best suit local conditions.I wish them well in that endeavour.ReferencesBernanke, Ben S; Laubach, Thomas; Mishkin, Frederick S; Posen, Adam S 1999. “Inflation targeting.Lessons from the international experience”.
