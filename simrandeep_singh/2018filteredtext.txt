year almost day since swedish riksdag take decision strengthen riksbank’s position and, part work, create riksbank executive board responsibility conduct monetary policy independently.1 a well reason celebrate, anniversary also give u cause pause reflect been, heading. my intention today perform position exercise. a general reflection monetary policy internationally sweden find environment many way differ one experience long time. it merely question change economic activity. structural shift economy change underlie trend also create uncertainty “new normal” future. it sometimes say debate change make le impossible riksbank keep inflation high level 2 per cent. we therefore either relate exist inflation target freely simply low it. i think line reason misdirected. there doubt possible get inflation pick up, do different ways. the challenge create right amount inflation orderly manner reasonable precision. this challenge face monetary policy context new environment play role. ∗ in particular, i would like thank björn andersson assistance write speech. i would also like thank charlotta edler, jesper hansson, per jansson, tomas lundberg, ann-leena mikiver, åsa olli segendorf, cecilia roos-isaksson, marianne sterner, ulf söderström anders vredin valuable comments. 1 the bank estate realm, late rename sverige riksbank, found 22 september 1668. the inflation target announce press release 15 january 1993. the press release specify target 2 per cent inflation would begin apply 1 january 1995. the riksdag approve swedish gov-ernment’s proposal strengthen riksbank’s position 4 march 1998. the change come force 1 january 1999. 2 [13] in moment i look closely new environment discus property characterise monetary policy need relate go forward. lastly, i also intend provide overall picture might characterise way forward. but that, allow say something bring u here. where come i speak early 2018 year celebration. another anniversary, one give cause kind celebration, also ten year since collapse investment bank lehman brothers. the problem international financial markets, escalate long time, come head. confidence financial system evaporate financial crisis upon us. much happen ten year since then. the action central bank period manage direct crisis 2008, even though many problem stem there. it accurate describe action reaction interconnect series crises, or, like, crisis consist several phases. these have, turn, form backdrop different phase monetary policy sweden go through. upturn cut short sovereign debt problem 2011–2012 an effect severe crisis 2008 shutdown global trade, bring swedish economy sudden halt. to support economy, riksbank quickly low repo rate a, time, historically low level 0.25 per cent. around world, central bank government make herculean effort kick-start financial system reverse trend. a situation credit market improve global trade pick up, recovery occur rapidly expect sweden. from mid-2010, riksbank begin raise repo rate towards normal level. but 2011, recovery stutter unease link problem heavily burden public finance several european country start affect credit market ever-increasing degree. measure institution eu ecb help stabilise situation, weak confidence low demand among household company subdue european developments. this, turn, lead slowdown swedish economic activity, despite relatively high domestic demand. gdp fell 2012 riksbank low repo rate number steps. focus inflation maintain confidence inflation target produce result something provoke head-scratching around world year inflation remain relatively high level begin with, despite major economic slowdown 2008. in hindsight know inflation gradually fell happen early sweden country – 3 [13] discount effect interest-rate changes, inflation fell around 2 per cent 2010 around 1 per cent 2012. when inflation fell late 2013 early 2014, despite bright economic signals, become necessary riksbank focus bring inflation back target. this particularly urgent bear mind long period low inflation begin leave mark inflation expectations. to bring inflation help anchor inflation expectation target, riksbank cut repo rate 0 per cent 2014 gradually –0.5 per cent follow years. a way make monetary policy expansionary, also begin purchase government bond start 2015. at point, ecb begin buy asset large scale stimulate demand bring inflation. there concern swedish krona might strengthen significantly euro result would prolong period below-target inflation. monetary policy need protect economy development. today, observe extremely low interest rate riksbank’s asset purchase contribute economic activity grow ever stronger. employment rise growth normal level four years. inflation, show rise trend since 2014, around 2 per cent last year long-term expectation anchor target. the start new chapter? doe mean sound all-clear? a know, guarantee forecast business. economically, thing look good, least due increasingly high demand abroad. it take decade, seem though global economy finally recover enough after-shocks financial crisis start new chapter. the u central bank begin normalise monetary policy. in europe, recovery occur slowly reach stage ecb reduce rate asset purchases. however, global inflationary pressure still modest new outcome swedish inflation weak expected. for riksbank, question remain vigilant. a prerequisite inflation continue develop line target economic activity remain strong impact price developments. monetary policy therefore still need remain expansionary. but everything go expected, time start normalise monetary policy come closer. the assessment make february probably time slowly start raise repo rate second half year. but turnaround require considerable caution, opinion. a regard riksbank’s hold government bonds, present overall strategy normalisation christmas.2 in brief, state riksbank shall continue reinvest redemption coupon payment repo rate 2 see article “the riksbank’s strategy gradual normalisation monetary policy” december 2017 monetary policy report. 4 [13] reach suitable level. thereafter, reinvestments also scale back. when happens, bond hold decrease. what environment look like go forward economically, thing look relatively good everything go expected, monetary policy internationally sweden gradually slowly move close normal situation. but kind environment monetary policy conduct go forward? and normal situation actually look like? these question come increasingly focus recent years. it would probably mistake take grant map use crisis use get bear current situation. to begin with, important properly evaluate experience gain last decade integrate lesson learn economic thinking. structural change may also influence underlie trend economy i would like give three example change which, way other, influence swedish monetary policy future. low interest rate average to start with, note find environment interest rate much low before. “you’ve make bed must lie it”, someone may object – central bank create environment? it true policy rate cut significantly support economic activity return inflation targets. but fact cause policy rate fall extremely low level central bank need adapt general downward trend interest rate around world, trend begin long time financial crisis 2008. decline trend real interest rate global level return interest expenditure adjust inflation important household companies, make decision save investment. in words, real interest rate matter. by change nominal policy rate, central bank affect real interest rate near term thus demand economy. this possible, take time company adapt price change policy rate interest rate economy. but price adjusted, real interest rate also reset. in long term, therefore, monetary policy major effect real interest rates. in time perspective, structural factors, demographic long-term growth rates, affect developments. one strike feature recent decade downward trend real interest rate around world. various explanation put forward this, include demographic trends.3 one theory attract major attention decline sign secular stagnation, different factor drive save dampen propensity invest. this lead chronic 3 a detail description decline global real interest rate feasible explanation find speech swedish economics association 2017. 5 [13] condition “excessively low” demand economy, contribute last decline real interest rates. others think necessarily question secular stagnation, situation can, example, good describe deep recession follow excessively high debt accumulation many countries. an environment low average repo rate the major question expect go forward. for small, open economy like sweden's, interest rate global level important affect domestic rates. with free movement capital, difficult real interest rate deviate great deal global level long run, even difference demographic trend long-term productivity growth naturally play part. it true enough real interest rate sweden exhibit similar downward trend real interest rate internationally. this significance monetary policy imply riksbank’s repo rate low average. and low repo rate average mean margin zero minus rate decrease – i come back implication moment. how long low real interest rate last? the answer naturally depend believe important driving-forces behind developments. but regardless whether believe permanent phenomenon cyclical explanation, low interest-rate environment probably last time come. even interest rate rise near term, towards low average level previously. many central banks, include riksbank, adjust assessment long-term policy rate levels. our current assessment repo rate will, long run, 2.5 4.0 per cent.4 but probably take long time reach level. high interest-rate sensitivity among household one effect decline interest rate sweden is, know, increase household indebtedness. see last twenty years, debt relation disposal household income almost doubled. currently, aggregate household debt almost twice level income. for around quarter million households, debt 6 time great income higher. high indebtedness link rise house price a debt consist mortgages, grow indebtedness reflect development house prices. price detach semi-detached house triple last 20 years, price tenant-owned apartment increase even fast rate. the rapid price increase depend several factors, addition low interest rate level. the population income increased, drive house demand new house construction lag behind, apart recent years. the abolition property tax also 4 see article "the repo rate long run” february 2017 monetary policy report, sverige riksbank. 6 [13] factor might explain grow indebtedness, fact increase number household home.5 the rate increase lend household still high level. the riksbank’s assessment future development overall household debt rise quite high rate recent years, due subdue house price growth. but debt still expect increase rapidly disposable income. so debt-to-income ratio continue rise. high indebtedness make household finance sensitive interest rate adjustment when monetary policy gradually start normalise interest rate rise, happen backdrop high indebtedness among household high house market valuation. in addition, many take variable-rate mortgage short interest-rate fixation periods. take together, mean household finance sensitive adjustment interest rate before. disposable income, income minus borrow costs, affect great extent interest rate adjustment debt high, factor equal. calculation show interest-rate rise 1 percentage point significantly great direct effect household disposable income mid-1990s. in sense, households’ interest-rate sensitivity greater.6 the interest question whether household adapt consumption correspond degree consumption also change great extent. it need necessarily so. for example, interest income offset effect high interest expenditure. if household also plan advance scenario interest expenditure take great share income, consumption may necessarily affect great extent. but research find point potentially play major role least certain group households.7 more specifically, show highly indebted household variable-rate mortgage adapt consumption great extent household interest rate change. this may due interest rate adjustment affect disposable income great extent, i described. but may also due highly indebted household react give change income households. you would expect case household high debt opportunity others maintain consumption borrow more. 5 see sverige riksbank (2011), the riksbank’s inquiry risk swedish house market, hansen, s. (2013), explanation development household indebtedness since mid-1990s, memorandum 1. fi-nansinspektionen. 6 see article “how household affect rise interest rates?” december 2017 monetary policy report, gustafsson, p. et al (2017), how household cashflows consumption affect high inter-est rates? staff memo, sverige riksbank. 7 see, instance, flodén, m. et al (2017), “household debt monetary policy: reveal cash-flow chan-nel”. sverige riksbank work paper series 342. sverige riksbank. 7 [13] great interest-rate sensitivity create uncertainty impact monetary policy how total consumption affect interest rate gradually raise towards normal level difficult know. interest expenditure increase, household relatively large extent. but total effect also depend happen economy otherwise regard income employment, house prices, expectations, etc. it difficult include factors, calculation show expect give interest-rate increase subdue consumption mortgage holder mid-1990s.8 at least certain groups, monetary policy therefore great impact real economy previously. this could justify slow rate hike case similar economic situation previous years. for group households, hand, impact rate hike great. there hence intrinsic tension here. the riksbank one policy rate adapt aggregate demand economic outlook general, inflation develop. high interest-rate sensitivity extent affect impact monetary policy will, words, source uncertainty. it will, all, challenge situation number year interest rate rise – albeit slowly – debt high ever before. the supply labour great from household consumption demand side economy, i would like go labour market supply side third final example transformation economic landscape. migration reform behind labour force participation various structural change mean swedish labour market differ considerably structure mid-1990s, ten year since financial crisis alone, great deal happened. one change number person disposal labour market grow significantly. since 2006, number person labour force age 15–74 increase half million.9 this mean share working-age population participate labour force high almost thirty years. several factor lie behind this. the working-age population increased, much result sweden’s substantial intake refugees. various reform recent decade also increase incentive participate labour force make profitable work continue work advance age. relatively good health level education also seem contribute rather large increase labour force participation rate among old people.10 we also remember increasingly strong economic 8 see finocchiaro, d. et al (2016), “macroeconomic effect reduce household debt”, economic review 2016:2, sverige riksbank. 9 see flodberg, c. löf, m. (2017), “labour supply increase surprisingly rapidly”, staff memo, sverige riksbank. 10 laun, l. palme, m. (2017), “the recent rise labor force participation old worker sweden,” report 2017:18, institute evaluation labour market education policy. 8 [13] situation recent year probably make attractive participate labour force. monetary policy cannot solve structural challenge great labour supply high labour supply basically positive lead high employment long term – beneficial least light challenge face regard grey population. high labour force participation long term raise economy’s output potential, mean wheel turn quickly without risk overheat rise prices, monetary policy ultimately need subdue. but prerequisite positive effect increase labour supply also lead high employment. a take time labour market adapt rapidly increase supply, likely increase will, part, result high unemployment near term. high demand economy facilitate adjustment. but extent great labour supply lead high employment long term determine labour market work match job-seekers vacancies. this particularly true group vulnerable position labour market, example person bear outside europe. we strong labour market recent year labour force also employment historically high level. the expansionary monetary policy contribute development. but sign match job-seekers vacancy work well. the decrease unemployment recent year has, all, among bear sweden. for group, unemployment low level. unemployment among bear abroad, hand, decrease extent significantly high begin with. a great supply foreign-born labour create condition long-term high employment, important labour market function efficiently supply labour fully utilised. with grey population, also become increasingly urgent demand labour area health social care rises. despite economic situation continue strong labour force employment expect increase future, riksbank’s assessment unemployment expect fall much year ahead. so, keep unemployment – bring significantly current level – measure need within policy area monetary policy. i mean monetary policy exhausted. there scope make even expansionary need be. but monetary policy cannot expect able solve structural problem labour market. what need carry u before say word way forward monetary policy new environment, i would like dwell moment question expectation monetary policy. the fact 9 [13] emerge period question has, sense, bring head. monetary policy recent year focus bring inflation target, consideration circumstance economy basically take back seat. i think primarily risk various negative side-effects low level interest rates. this experience carry u go forward. and significance monetary policy. confidence inflation target cannot take grant for long time, riksbank express concern risk pose economy household indebtedness rise house prices. and period 2014, risk periodically influence rate-setting. a always, however, economic outlook inflation prospect direct focus monetary policy. but riksbank make use flexibility inflation target help subdue debt accumulation house price increase extent. this do keep repo rate marginally high justify outlook inflation alone. flexible inflation target mean practice aim bring inflation back target quickly possible deviate 2 per cent. but precondition able flexible expectation inflation still return target long run. the inflation target nominal anchor swedish economy long easy assume inflation expectation automatically stay around 2 per cent. but, development 2011 shown, long-term inflation expectation immune influence. a long period sub-target inflation cause expectation creep 2 per cent. it therefore become increasingly urgent riksbank focus reverse trend bring inflation target. this turn require major monetary policy effort long period time. an insight gain recent year therefore need highlight confidence inflation target cannot take granted. the main task monetary policy maintain nominal anchor economy expectation demand place monetary policy take starting-point. but condition confidence anchor jeopardised, monetary policy certain amount scope allow deviation inflation target take back seat favour considerations.11 this might, example, question help mitigate risk associate high indebtedness rise house prices. but, important, monetary policy cannot expect solution manage risk stem fundamental problem relate function market incentive indebtedness, house construction employment. other policy area need rectify problems. 11 see, example, speech swedish economics association 2016 detail this. 10 [13] reform need house macroprudential policy area a result sweden’s crisis early-1990s, comprehensive change make economic policy order come term deficiency become clear crisis. we adopt float exchange rate framework fiscal policy would ensure public finance sustainable. the change create stability swedish economy considerable benefit, least financial crisis. sweden advantage able tackle economic slowdown fiscal policy hamper major deficit monetary policy. the late crisis also start point change economic policy areas, primarily mitigate risk financial imbalance create problem economy whole. but difference sweden still, ten year crisis, really manage fully implement changes. the concrete example reform base lesson learn crisis macroprudential policy establish separate economic policy area. over last ten years, intensive effort make around world define implement macroprudential policy. sweden make progress need done. at end last year, finansinspektionen, main responsibility macroprudential policy, give go-ahead government introduce tough amortisation requirement. this is, itself, positive development. but regulatory framework make macroprudential policy flexible need put place measure implement quickly necessary. macroprudential policy specifically focus reduce risk associate household debt. but riksbank’s assessment combination different measure require several policy area reduce risks.12 above all, fundamental cause rise indebtedness need deal with, something difficult without first tackle swedish house market inherent imbalances. this course easy task. but nevertheless urgent one. a i mention earlier, interest rate low average period ahead, sometimes much low monetary policy able meet inflation target. the financial side economy need robust enough cope period without macroeconomic development expose large risks. the way forward structural change experience last ten year thus significance monetary policy go forward. but mean concrete terms? 12 see financial stability report 2017:2, sverige riksbank. 11 [13] the main direction determine international development to begin with, important bear mind swedish economy dependent development abroad. just before, main direction swedish economy follow international developments. i already discuss significant global level interest rate interest rate sweden hence monetary policy. in addition, economic outlook inflation prospect will, large extent, influence happen abroad, especially rest europe. one special circumstance economic activity normalisation economic policy different phase euro area unite state come period. this strange give development last ten years. but swedish economic activity strong euro area, normalisation home look though might start early euro area, accord forecast. in words, probably u central bank slightly ecb. this special situation affect impulse abroad regard economic activity inflationary pressures. inflation rise different ways. lately, price pressure abroad subdue upturn inflation largely domestically driven, primarily via price increase service sector. the combination wage price development domestic sector inflationary impulse abroad determine monetary policy design influence domestic demand exchange rate desire direction, inflation ultimately stay around target. to extent, course le complicate monetary policy inflationary pressure rise abroad domestic sector way use – risk imbalance may also mitigated. complementary monetary policy measure may norm a i mention earlier, environment low real interest rate probably last quite time come, mean policy rate central bank average low level. this may, turn, limit scope central bank tackle economic downturn cut policy rates. say, example, repo rate average around 2.5 per cent, is, low bind riksbank’s assessment long-term level. that provide much leeway zero. a shown, possible low rate way zero clear may le scope rate cut previously. discussion ongoing among central bank significance low interest rate monetary policy scope monetary policy act economic slowdown increased. one conclusion complementary monetary policy measure type use many central bank recent years, purchase various assets, may become common future. other feasible measure monetary policy toolbox loan directly company via banks, foreign exchange interventions. 12 [13] the new environment also affect policy area another possibility policy area use actively stimulate economy time recession. in international debate, has, example, say limitation impose monetary policy low interest-rate environment mean fiscal policy may need contribute stabilisation policy great extent before.13 i think, start with, important point monetary policy exhaust result policy rate low far practically possible. a i mentioned, several tool monetary policy toolbox use need be, order stimulate economy. that said, obviously feasible tool policy area well. and reasonable evaluate cost benefit use different tool economic policy efficient effective possible economy whole. but various tool use matter responsible different policy area regard fiscal policy, course riksdag government determine grind conducted. price stability still basis monetary policy in conclusion – decade emerge characterise crisis deep, long-lasting recession. in perspective, difficult describe future bright – refer back question title today’s seminar. a always, uncertainty factors, riksbank’s assessment economic outlook still good sweden abroad. for monetary policy, question ensure inflation continue develop line inflation target. monetary policy therefore need remain expansionary strong economy impact inflation swedish krona appreciate rapidly. in near term, also need pay particular attention current downside risks. when normalisation monetary policy way, happen environment is, many ways, different one operate last ten years. i give example today. what imply concrete term actual design monetary policy something riksbank continue ponder. but new environment set challenge monetary policy, policy area well. how face challenge course decide factor bright future practice. i therefore assume policy area similar fashion consider structural measure necessary. a know, discussion ongoing, sweden abroad, need comprehensive change way monetary policy conducted, that, among things, good adapt “new normal” environment. it interest discussion every reason revisit, least parliamentary review commission make progress work. for time being, worth note discussion principle centre 13 see, instance, blanchard, o. summers, l. (2017), rethink stabilization policy: evolution revolu-tion? nber work paper series, no. 24179. national bureau economic research. 13 [13] modification exist framework. the start point still best way

bank regulator shift focus toimplementation revise standards. give considerable attention basel iiireforms, easy forget core mandate basel committee respect itswork supervisory practices.4 so morning, allow share think three area respect bankingsupervision: i. the next phase – beyond review capital liquidity rules; ii. bank supervision craft; iii. supervisory challenge opportunities.the next phase5 a many u familiar, basel iii framework second pillar pertain riskmanagement supervision include account risk capture pillar 1. indeed,the basel committee devote considerable attention various piece

next phase centre “full, timely andconsistent” implementation globally. this important reduce risk regulatory arbitrage. everyjurisdiction region course different degree openness,

alternative standardise approach market risk,or sa-mr short. this simplify alternative make easy supervisory authority toimplement market risk rule le complex banks.for simplify approach fit-for-purpose, take account differingconditions across broad range jurisdictions. this especially emerge marketeconomies le complex bank systems. in respect, forum basel’sregional consultative group

asia’sperspectives international forums. central bank well international organisationssuch international monetary fund (imf) asian development bank (adb) shouldalso weigh lend insight economic surveillance work. this allow regionalconcerns sufficiently factor global rule-making evaluation process. the craft supervision11 rule standard cannot replace judgment. good supervisory instinct technicalcompetence require discover, scrutinize evaluate key risks. this do ifbanking supervisor see role mere compliance function. an effective bankingsupervisor must able ass bank’s understand risks, business practice aswell judge corporate governance culture.12 the need consistency rigour also mean supervisory judgment anoperational matter. have formal supervisory decision-making forum importantcomponent good supervisory process. for example, mas, bank supervisionheads come together regular meet guide supervisory review decisions. a anintegrated supervisor, i also chair management financial supervision meet well aregulatory action meet oversee broad scope supervisory policy andenforcement action respectively, across banking, insurance capital market activities. inother words, supervisory practice require much think policy consideration therules regulations. this also exchange fellow regulator supervisorycolleges helpful important too.13 i early mention rule regulation risk proportionate. this trueas well bank supervision. it impossible supervisor review inspect 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech financial institution charge wide deep extent give finite resource time.this neither feasible desirable.14 it logical effective differentiate supervisory intensity accord riskprofiles bank. in recent years, ma also move towards great use thematicreviews inspections. this mean inspect peer group institution time aspecific risk area. we find peer group approach also facilitate good identification ofvulnerabilities, allow industry benchmarking well share best practices.15 an effective supervisory process also involve preparedness take toughenforcement actions. it practical reality amount regulation supervisoryreviews catch possible potential misdemeanour excessive risk-taking. to so, afinancial regulator would regularly extensively intrusive point bankwould find hard function. ultimately, bank’s board management must responsiblefor business conduct risk management. 16 hence, far effective supervisory process work alongside strong andeffective board management banks. if fail violation bypass oursupervisory reviews, enforcement action must meted accordingly.17 this supervisory philosophy underscore commonly describe four linesof defence 2015 bi occasional paper, well 2015 basel committee’s guideline oncorporate governance principle – describe role (a) boards, management andbusiness units, (b) risk compliance, (c) internal well external audit, (d) theregulator.challenges opportunities18 much report innovation fintech space, disruption broughtabout technology practically every aspect economic social activities.19 recent technological development also present regulator newchallenges opportunities. for instance, foray hitherto non-regulated entity intovarious aspect payment financial service could necessitate change aninstitution-based regulatory approach towards activity-based framework. but sametime, also allow regulator “right-size” regulation traditional evolvingbusiness model accord risk activity poses. i cite two examples:virtual currency first emerge 10 year ago. since then, observe anincrease number initial coin (or token) offer singapore. a financialregulators, ma regulate virtual currencies. but regulate activity thatsurround virtual currency pose specific risks. an example would anti-moneylaundering/combating finance terrorism (aml/cft) requirement haveimposed intermediary provide virtual currency services. we assess ifadditional regulation require investor protection.another example wave new payment service enable newtechnology. consumer increasingly make receive payment digitalpayment platforms, fall outside exist regulatory frameworks. in recognition ofthe risk digital payment platform pose system whole arenot adequately secure, ma issue new payment service bill (psb). this willstreamline regulation payment remittance service provider singleregulatory framework, calibrate whether entity offer one, part theretail payment value chain. it also seek enhance user protection facilitate theadoption electronic payments. 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech 20 regulation stifle innovation. the reality innovation always moveahead rules. the key understand whether particular innovation new businessmodel simply regulatory arbitrage. if so, deal directly bringingthat activity within regulatory ambit even ban altogether. another consideration iswhether innovative business model purposeful create incoherence inconsistencyof treatment. in case, review regulatory policy may necessary. there noone-size-fits-all supervisory answer. it simply mean regulators, need keep abreastwith technological developments. only then, exercise thoughtful judgment. the fact thatmany financial regulator include ma allow regulatory sandbox set uphighlights preparedness allow innovative financial model first test within definedparameters.harnessing technology strengthen supervision21 there grow area technology use directly relevant financialsupervision – regulatory technology (or regtech). this use advance technologysystems algorithm enhance risk management regulatory compliance.22 many financial institution embrace regtech, as:predictive analytics use stress testing;artificial intelligence machine learning-powered system identify money launderingrisks; andcognitive compute behavioural algorithm detect suspicious trade possiblemisconduct.23 on supervisor’s end, ma develop ‘suptech’ improve sharpenour surveillance analytical capabilities. since year ago, set dedicatedunit suptech within data analytics group.24 the aim make great use technology “smart tools” guide financialsurveillance supervision functions. to so, build infrastructure data analyticsprojects important. we put place ma private cloud. this serve thefoundation provide compute power data analytics project mas. there numberof ongoing system-enhancement project around data storage, accessibility usability. butimportantly fully benefit insight broad set high-frequency real-time data, inboth structure unstructured formats, supervisor also need acquire strong

institutions, law enforcement agencies, sector agency asin telecommunication power, well fellow regulator give often cross-bordernature cyber threats.to foster exchange cyber intelligence region, ma collaborate thefinancial service – information share & analysis centre (fs-isac) establish apac 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech regional intelligence analysis centre. this centre singapore provide

bank england royal society encouragement arts, manufacture commerce (rsa) 6 march 2018 all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 2 2 i delight discus final report rsa citizens’ economic council “building public culture economics”. this culmination two-year project, work around 250 citizen number organisation across country, include bank england. i would like congratulate matthew taylor, chief executive rsa, reema patel, kayshani gibbon tony greenham rsa leader project, terrific work pull together. it impressive, progressive ambitious agenda economy economic policymakers like me. of course, citizen already crucial stake economy. a economist often divide world neat institutional package – companies, governments, trade unions, charities. while useful organisationally, name veils, part legal, part social. behind veil lie ultimate owner – citizens, whether workers, customers, shareholders, stakeholder voters. institution executive gatekeeper citizen democracies. ultimately, citizen policymakers, economic otherwise, accountable. those u policy game need never lose sight that. despite ownership rights, nonetheless rsa’s contention citizen present engage economy, economic policy, fully would desirable. they make case move deliberative democracy, one citizen great say matter economic financial. this big contention. nonetheless one i – citizen someone work one institutional veils, bank england – fully accept. more that, bank make stride towards increase citizen engagement economy understand economic policy. in follows, let first say word aim objective programme citizen engagement, like rsa propose – “ends”. i turn “means” – practically could done, indeed done, improve citizen engagement economy economic policy. for reason familiarity, i focus bank england initiative one example public engagement, although rsa’s recommendation cover range policymaking functions. the end so could hope achieve increase citizens’ engagement issue economics finance? my short answer question great deal. economics, economic policy, face “twin deficits” problem – deficit public understand deficit public trust.1 twin deficits, fiscal external trust understanding, carry danger economy economic policy. close would, i believe, deliver significant benefit society, individual policymakers sit twixt two. here’s why. let’s take public understand economy. a public would first admit, high high would wish. on economic financial matters, often yawn 1 haldane (2017a). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 understand deficit part general public. that public yawn prospect engage issues. to contrary, survey regularly show significant majority recognise importance economic financial issue everyday lives. around 80-90% say would like economic financial issue cover comprehensively school curriculum.2 it would wrong, however, think public engagement benefit public. just important improvement policymakers’ understand everyday economic issues. there wide body evidence, draw wide variety settings, benefit combine insight expert non-expert source make sense complex world, forecast uncertain future.3 harvest insight non-expert audience appears, uncertain settings, especially valuable provide diverse perspective different insights. if turn understand trust, picture many similarities. trust lie heart social contract institution societies, policymakers citizens. but nature trust appear change rather fundamentally recent past. society individual undergo rachel botsman recent book call “trust shift”.4 where trust institutionalise anonymised, today socialise personalised. this shift gear trust consequences. public institution stripe one casualties, measure trust fall steadily recent past.5 most central bank escape shift sands, particular since global financial crisis. for us, age innocence, least era take public trust given, may over. that matters. credibility trust secret sauce central banking. they enable shape expectation way stabilise economy financial system. an economy financial system without trust, history tell us, cease system. an economic financial policymaker without credibility, history tell us, cease function policymaker. removal veil, breach social contract, leaf economy financial system vulnerable. there single measure, quick fix, close twin deficit general public. the supply chain secret sauce, build restore trust understanding, long arduous. nonetheless, seem clear increase engagement policymakers wide society necessary ingredient manufacture. from spheres, medicine, know trust understand build everyday engagement. for bank england, scar financial crisis still healing, case continue build foundation strong. 2 haldane (2017a). the rsa call benefit improve “agency” among citizens. 3 tetlock gardner (2016). the rsa call benefit improve “efficacy” policymaking. 4 botsman (2017). 5 see, example, edelman trust barometer. the rsa call benefit improve “legitimacy” policymaking. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 the mean if case strong, best citizen engagement achieved? the rsa report provide nice framework address question. this base “ladder participation” model, devise originally sherry arnstein late 1960s.6 the ring engagement ladder are, ascend order: inform; consult; involve; collaborate; empower. a move ladder, increase degree citizen engagement decision affect them. the rsa stop short recommend top rung, propose various initiative increase citizen involvement collaboration. arm framework, i think far bank england far climb citizen engagement ladder. truth told, i suspect first 300 year life, bank england scarcely foot first rung. it saw little need even inform wide public economy policy. trust among public anonymised, institutionalise given. when tempt step rung, bank quickly contract acute form vertigo. over past 25 year bank take significant step engagement ladder, part response public’s trust shift, part reflect bank’s wide policy responsibilities. these step transform bank “informs” “consults” public view policies.7 one simple diagnostic rise bank’s publication count. seventy year ago, bank publish precisely one speech year. today, rarely day pass without multiple publications. then, bank utter publically few 5,000 word per year. last year, utter excess 4 ½ million. over past two decades, would exaggeration say genuine revolution central bank communications. perhaps even importantly, revolution central bank attitude towards public engagement. this revolution has, luck, increase public’s understand economy economic policy. but question mind also enhance significantly central banks’ understand economy. have ascend ring engagement ladder, panorama economy much enhanced. look back past five years, look forward next five, bank take step towards secure foothold next ring engagement ladder. this increase extent “involve” “collaborate” wide set citizens, well “informing” “consulting” them. from potentially long list, let highlight four example go that. 6 arnstein (1969). 7 haldane (2017b). a number excellent historical example give kynaston (2017). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 (a) layer communication there natural temptation among technocrat communicate language understand fellow technocrats. this tendency deep sociological roots, probably date back hunter-gatherer past. at time, language mean bond bind people; social glue. it still is. language also, however, barrier understand and, hunter-gather past, source tribal conflict. these linguistic barrier apply everywhere everyone. but seem especially troublesome among economic financial tribe, stand relative others insularity.8 central banker immune primordial tendencies. they, too, sometimes use tribal language technocracy. and sometimes serve barrier understand blockage trust. my “stylised fact” (itself piece technical jargon) around 95% word central bank utter inaccessible around 95% population. (imagine speak 4 ½ million word 4 ¼ million fall deaf ears?) if conduct semantic analysis central bank text, find i err side generosity fractions.9 when someone say “spoken like true central-banker”, come bury andy praise him. but thing changing. the bank make big effort simplify demystify word challenge idea thinking. the bank’s staff blog, bank underground, one example challenge. last year, record millionth hit. recently, bank begin issue publication “layered” format, cater different audiences: one-sentence, one-graphic version time-poor; 60-page chart-tastic technical text masochist. a best tell, open bank’s view far-wider audience. the number website hit increase markedly since publication first layer inflation report november last year. recently, try pinpoint precisely benefit layer communication boost public’s understand trust. this involve conduct so-called “randomised control trial” two group – group expert (students study economics university) group non-experts.10 both group randomly split give layered, others un-layered, bank england content inflation report. this enable direct assessment impact layer understand trust. it would tad disappoint layer impact. and thank heaven small mercy that, expert non-expert groups, layer boost report trust understand scores. what interest much layer seem help. in sample, boost understand economy monetary policy come layer inflation report large 8 haldane turrell (2017). 9 haldane (2017b). 10 haldane mcmahon (forthcoming). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 boost understand come study advance degree economics. that’s depress statistic u study economics, great news everyone else. (b) educational programme a second strand bank’s engagement strategy education. you could see initiative help meet citizens’ self-expressed desire firm educational foundation matter economic financial. to help dig foot foundation, bank visit around 200 school year give talk lecture use newly-enlisted ambassador army, help partner, charity speaker schools. the bank also run two school competitions, recent announce last week partnership financial times.11 the significant bank’s educational initiative take place classroom itself. we developed, conjunction we be futures, classroom material use personal, social, health economics (pshe) component curriculum. we involve consult teacher design refine materials. they rolled-out school 27 april. the bank would like see pshe and, within that, economics become compulsory part curriculum, echo view parent pupils. i recently write department education say that.12 (c) regional tour a third strand regional engagement. the bank had, past 90 years, network regional agency dot across uk.13 they bank’s eye ears, play key role collect intelligence economy financial system, largely companies. that intelligence fee directly bank’s policy deliberations. last year alone, bank’s agent meet 8,000 companies. recently, extend agents’ reach include charities, community groups, trade union wide civil society. on engagement ladder, example bank “involving” “collaborating” citizens, practical day-to-day basis across part uk. last year, i extend regional programme, separate set visit design engage with, listen to, quiet voice society, voice otherwise drowned-out medium cacophony – voice charities, community voluntary groups, local councils, trade unions. and i seek voice part country may otherwise always get hear – under-performing part thrive city well communities, town city struggling. this regional focus engage le well-performing part uk line another rsa’s recommendations. 11 detail available

england press release announce “this andy deep hang stoke” scan. so i open crowd-sourced alternative suggestions. let give one two concrete example regional engagement help understand economy, hide corners, quiet voices. when uk gdp return pre-crisis peak 2014 economist tell world economy “recovered”.16 around 30 second talk “recovery” charity nottingham 2016, i put straight. the language recovery resonate no-one room. this experience repeat tv, month late referendum debate, questioner newcastle put straight one participant tonight’s panel memorable line “that’s bloody gdp, ours”. 14 http://www.visualscribing.com/ 15 geertz (1998), thank grace blakeley institute public policy research. 16 the date real gdp return pre-crisis peak change different vintage ons data originally think occur 2014. in late vintage ons data, 2013. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 when i return desk nottingham plot gdp regionally well nationally, something surprise emerge numbers. in fact, gdp pass pre-crisis peak two region uk – london south-east. no region uk fact experience “recovery”, whether nottinghamshire anywhere else. my “recovery” narrative, true national level, rightly fall sceptical ear regional level. although bank’s policy operate national level, important context others communicate economy. a second example come i visit south wale towards end last year. at time, inflation pick result fall pound referendum, take 2% target. but modest inflation overshoot historical standards, commensurately modest costs. or i thought. but people south wale describe everyday consequences, cost seem anything modest. their personal inflation rate run close 10%. for some, make stark choice “heating eating”. this make concrete benefit inflation target monetary policy support people’s everyday lives. a third example would narrative – word – i knit together various regional visit structural impediment growth communities, town city across uk. my deep hang has, date, unearthed, six impediment – “big six”. they schooling, house shopping, finance, job transport. these problem central banks’ tool help solve. but structural plan economy worth salt need

(english translation base japanese original) 1 i. development economic activity price a. recent development outlook economic activity home abroad i would like start speech look development global economy affect japan's economy. since autumn 2017, improvement economic sentiment noticeable worldwide (chart 1). the global purchase managers' index (pmi) show remarkable improvement manufacture activity particular, business fix investment trade volume increasing. one factor underlie improvement economic sentiment that, advance economy remain robust, cyclical factor continue moderate recovery production resource manufacture sectors, bottom 2016 amid wan concern slowdown emerge economies, especially china. the cultivation potential demand utilize new technology -- internet thing (iot), artificial intelligence (ai), autonomous drive -- also contribute improvement extent (chart 2). look global economy two perspective real gdp growth rate inflation rate, development describe follows. until 2016, economy remain phase sluggish growth coexist low inflation. in 2017, move phase improve trend growth rate become evident inflation rate remain low. look ahead, global economy likely shift phase inflation clearly accelerate continue relatively high growth various downside risk point out, following, materialize: (1) risk monetary policy normalization unite state europe exert downward pressure global economy; (2) risk deceleration chinese economy; (3) geopolitical risk surround north korea middle east. one key point time whether global economy reach phase rise inflation high growth i mentioned, avoid situation economy stalling, major economy begin see change monetary policy stances, phase achieved, happen. next, i would like turn development japan's economy. support moderate growth global economy, japan's real gdp continue mark positive growth 2 eight consecutive quarter since first quarter 2016. the annual real growth rate 2017 stand 1.6 percent, high level since 2013 (chart 3). the breakdown component period show private business fix investment export major drive force growth. with regard outlook, fiscal 2018, japan's economy likely continue grow pace range 1.0-1.5 percent, exceed potential (chart 4). this business fix investment increase, reflect improvement corporate profit business sentiment, export rise back robust growth global economy. these positive development transmit strongly household rise wages, lead acceleration pace growth private consumption. meanwhile, highly likely economic growth rate fiscal 2019 decrease range 0.5-1.0 percent, reflect factor (1) effect consumption tax hike schedule october 2019 (2) deceleration business fix investment due peak olympic games-related demand. now, i would like talk effect schedule consumption tax hike. the hike impact gdp growth rates, mainly due change household spending, follow two major channels: (1) front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike (2) decline real income. at present, negative impact hike project growth rate fiscal 2019 likely small rate fiscal 2014, last hike take place. this increase consumption tax rate small recent tax hike reduce tax rate apply items. in addition, consumption tax hike schedule take place middle fiscal year, technical factors; namely, front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior hike offset fiscal year, decline real income could occur second half fiscal year. b. recent development outlook japan's price next, i move recent price development japan outlook. 3 look recent development consumer price index (cpi), year-on-year rate increase cpi item le fresh food january 2018 0.9 percent. however, note contribution energy item significant, 0.5 percentage point, term rate increase item le fresh food energy, directly reflect domestic supply-demand conditions, rate stand 0.4 percent year-on-year. although rate indicate continue moderate increase, level still low, mainly background firms' wage- price-setting stance remain cautious far. a outlook, i would like first take look bank's baseline scenario. accord outlook economic activity price (outlook report) release january 2018, inflation expectation project rise firms' stance gradually shift toward raise wage price economy still grow pace potential output gap continue improve. it also indicate that, consequence, inflation rate likely continue uptrend increase toward 2 percent. with mechanism operating, inflation rate -- specifically, term median policy board members' forecast year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) -- project rise around 1.8 percent fiscal 2019, exclude direct effect consumption tax hike (chart 4). in contrast baseline scenario, i consider possibility year-on-year rate change cpi increase 2 percent fiscal 2019 low point. this difference price outlook reflect discrepancy view overall effectiveness current monetary ease policy function policy's transmission channels. i elaborate late i explain conduct monetary policy. ii. conduct monetary policy in follows, i describe bank's monetary policy. i would like first explain current framework present view policy measure necessary achieve bank's price stability target. 4 in january 2013, bank set price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi, aim achieve target early possible time. the bank also announce strengthen policy coordination government release joint statement, two entity work together overcome deflation early achieve sustainable economic growth price stability. under circumstances, bank introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) april 2013. since september 2016, conduct monetary policy framework qqe yield curve control. this current framework monetary policy consist two major component (chart 5).1 the first yield curve control bank control short-term long-term nominal interest rate thereby encourage decline real interest rate -- calculate nominal interest rate minus expect inflation rate -- achieve highly accommodative financial condition stimulate economic activity prices. the bank set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year japanese government bond (jgb) yield around 0 percent. it conduct purchase jgbs achieve targets, thereby encourage formation optimal shape yield curve achieve 2 percent price stability target. the second component inflation-overshooting commitment. under commitment, bank continue expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase observe cpi (all item le fresh food) exceed 2 percent stay target level stable manner. with commitment, bank aim increase credibility among public achieve 2 percent price stability target rule possibility change direction monetary policy early stage achievement target come sight. in view, monetary policy framework lead high inflation, mainly four transmission channel (chart 6). the first highly accommodative financial condition 1 in addition two major components, bank conduct purchase risky asset -- namely, exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) -- part monetary policy. 5 -- accompany decline real interest rate decline nominal interest rate risk premia -- bring improvement output gap. the second improvement output gap push observe inflation rate. the third rise observe inflation rate result high inflation expectation adaptive expectation formation mechanism, raise observe inflation rate. and fourth channel bank's strong commitment achieve 2 percent price stability target directly raise inflation expectations, prompt rise observe inflation rate turn. earlier, i describe outlook prices, i mention possibility year-on-year rate change cpi increase 2 percent fiscal 2019 low. this i still lack confidence four transmission channel i explain operate effective extent whereby inflation rate push reach 2 percent, even though year pass since bank's adoption qqe yield curve control. of course, positive effect monetary ease likely strengthen gradually, give improvement output gap continues. at point, however, view momentum rise inflation strong enough reach 2 percent fiscal 2019.2 to illustrate this, i plot relationship output gap inflation rate graph (chart 7). in period adoption qqe lead introduction qqe yield curve control, slope trend line become somewhat steep line's level rise (chart 7, red line left-hand panel) compare early period (black line panel). these development suggest ideal change economy take place, imply effect second channel -- is, improvement output gap thereby push observe inflation rate -- 2 for inflation rate increase 2 percent go forward, i consider essential achieve widen output gap exceed 2 percent, well rise expect inflation rate great observe 2013 2014. this view base projection price development derive (1) estimate so-called hybrid new keynesian phillips curve take expect inflation rate, observe inflation rate, output gap, consumption tax dummy explanatory variable (2) apply projection output gap -- deduce forecast majority bank's policy board member real gdp growth -- expect inflation rate. 6 enhanced, third fourth channel begin operate follow rise inflation expectations. take look development since october-december quarter 2016, bank introduce qqe yield curve control, however, slope trend line become gradual line's level decline slightly, although change regard subject margin error due limit sample size (chart 7, green line left-hand panel). this suggest possibility that, although first channel operating, three channel yet full extent.3 in words, current monetary policy framework, supply-demand condition tighten further, yet affect firms' overall price-setting stance toward raise prices.4 it also note rise inflation expectation remain moderate, partly reflect moderate pace increase observe inflation rate. short-term inflation expectation increase somewhat, due mainly rise crude oil prices, recover level see period mid-2014 mid-2015, expectation shift increase flat. medium- long-term inflation expectation remain somewhat weak (chart 8). i would note inflation-overshooting commitment effective stop decline inflation expectations, sufficient clearly increase inflation expectations. on basis understanding, i believe monetary ease necessary achieve price stability target early stage. specifically, bank purchase jgbs yield jgbs maturity 10 year long broadly low further. with view reinforce inflation-overshooting commitment, bank also add commitment that, term median policy board members' 3 these fact also confirm estimate phillips curve time-varying parameter (chart 7, right-hand panel). 4 the output gap estimate bank's research statistic department become positive october-december quarter 2016 increase 1.35 percent july-september quarter 2017. have say that, widen output gap necessary affect firms' overall price-setting stance toward raise prices, view fact average output gap range 2.5-3.0 percent past year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food energy) exceed 2 percent basis exclude effect consumption tax hikes. 7 forecast present outlook report, delay time achieve price stability target due domestic factors, bank take additional ease measures. i would note low yield jgbs maturity 10 year long promote business fix investment house investment great extent financial side. this low jgb yield also expect synergy effect government's fiscal policy provide tax support firm positive stance toward make fix investment raise wages. these development increase pace improvement output gap, thus enhance dynamism rise inflation rate first second transmission channel i explain earlier. among many option additional monetary ease measure yield curve control, low yield jgbs maturity 10 year long best point, view, consider balance positive negative effects. strengthen inflation-overshooting commitment aim increase transmission effect high inflation expectation observe inflation rate -- words, increase effect third fourth transmission channels. the rise inflation expectation 2013 attributable bank's decision introduce inflation target policy. it also attributable initiative take achieve policy; bank announce strengthen policy coordination government release joint statement, two entity take concrete action implement flexible fiscal policy bold monetary policy well growth strategy. in order influence inflation expectations, essential policy coordination government aim achieve price stability target firmly ensure entities' concrete actions. the bank, part, promote powerful monetary ease back clear strong commitment achieve price stability target. iii. reason importance achieve maintain price stability target a global economy continue grow moderate pace, federal reserve course raise policy interest rate european central bank move toward exit monetary easing. under circumstances, speculation, especially 8 overseas, japan's monetary policy might also shift tighten near future, might least make slight adjustment toward exit monetary easing. however, inflation environment japan differ substantially unite state major country europe. i believe that, japan, still long way go consider change monetary policy stance. let first look price development japan well unite states, policy rate hike proceeding. chart 9 compare development inflation rate exclude fresh food energy japan unite state since 1995. the bold black line indicate inflation rate 2 percent gray band show recession periods. in unite states, inflation rate le around 2 percent 1995 present. on hand, contrast unite states, inflation rate japan move negative territory time period latter half 1998 early 2013. in 2013 onward, inflation rate turn positive, mainly due introduction qqe, remain distant 2 percent. such difference price development japan unite state often compare existence absence anchor stabilize ship ocean. the inflation rate generally fluctuate volatility shock macroeconomics market conditions, crude oil price changes. in unite states, however, inflation rate return close 2 percent even major shock global financial crisis follow failure lehman brothers. this people's inflation expectation firmly fixed, ship anchored, around 2 percent.5 in view, reason incremental policy rate hike possible unite state far inflation expectation judge anchor well. in japan, hand, firms' households' mindset form prolong deflationary environment mid-1990s, economic activity assume inflation 5 for implication inflation expectation anchored, see ben bernanke, "inflation expectation inflation forecasting: speech monetary economics workshop national bureau economic research summer institute, cambridge, massachusetts," federal reserve board (july 2007). 9 become rational. in words, japan lose anchor inflation expectation stick deflationary equilibrium.6 the bank, bold monetary ease policy, aim shift economy stick deflationary equilibrium enter inflationary equilibrium inflation expectation anchor around 2 percent. however, i explain far, improvement inflation rate enough still halfway accomplished. if direction monetary policy change without deep consideration situation, risk economy fully return deflationary equilibrium. after introduction qqe april 2013, inflation expectation rise steadily toward 2 percent. however, momentum weakened, stem consumption tax hike fall crude oil prices. subsequently, headwind -- is, slowdown emerge economy instability global financial market -- lead sluggishness inflation expectations. this experience suggest that, stage 2 percent price stability target yet achieved, inflation expectation susceptible negative economic shock economy could easily return deflationary equilibrium.7 that reason necessary carefully conduct current monetary policy give full consideration risk economic activity prices.8 go back 6 see jam bullard, "seven face 'the peril'," federal reserve bank st. louis review, vol. 92, no. 5 (2010): 339-52. base japanese u.s. data 2002-2010, bullard discus possibility u.s. economy time fall

point require due attention, particularly regard assessment economic development fiscal 2019. the first point consider that, since recent consumption tax hike fiscal 2014, rise real disposable income strongly link increase real consumption. it note that, next consumption tax hike schedule october 2019 cause similar effects, improvement aggregate demand make sufficient progress. i also would note possibility that, tax hike take place anchor inflation expectation yet function effectively, people's inflation perception might change and, mainly due decline consumption, inflation expectation might become sluggish again.9 that is, possibility tax hike could increase downward pressure price channel output gap inflation expectation (chart 10). the second point possibility risk development overseas economy materialize fiscal 2019. if risk materialize, japan's economy slow degree lose support firm growth global economy. in view, particular attention pay risk u.s. monetary policy normalization put downward pressure global economy, potential impact global economy large risks. 9 a impact tax hike inflation rate inflation expectations, one possibility decline aggregate demand push observe inflation rate, low inflation expectation turn. another possibility rise price accompany tax hike raise inflation expectations. early episode tax hike april 1997 april 2014 suggest inflation rate initially rise follow hike decline aggregate demand decreased, thereby cause fall inflation expectations. 11 follow burst bubble 1990s, japan experience prolong period economic stagnation aggravate

shake strong tremor. on 16march 2008, jp morgan offer buy investment bank bear stearns. and time. bearstearns deep trouble: share price fall two-thirds since begin thatyear; bleed money; basically shut fund market. at time, thefailure bear stern consider major event. no one know big quake still tocome.it happen half year later, 15 september 2008, another investment bank failed:lehman brothers. it push financial system close abyss. trust evaporated, marketsdried up, around globe, bank send reeling.all all, big financial crisis decades. it drag real economy, whichfell call great recession. in euro area, economic output go byalmost 4.5% 2009, unemployment jump quarter 9.6%. three yearslater, reach 12%. in italy, instance, output fell 5% 2009, whileunemployment peak almost 13% 2014.these figure alarming, tell u little people lose jobs, homesand future. take suffer account, crisis turn tragedy.as causes, i admit story i’ve tell far simple. of course, thefailure single investment bank cause mayhem. the full story much long andmuch complex.however, one deny bank play crucial role. it become obvious posea huge risk financial stability economy. but it’s inescapable truth thatwe need banks. or, precise, need service provide.why need bankswho investor turn need money start expand business, sheneeds hedge risk want acquire another company? who saver turn hewants deposit money? who family turn need loan buy home? here ineurope, would likely turn bank. bank provide vital service theeconomy. without them, economy would work.all lead u crucial question: ensure bank reliably serve economy?long take granted, become holy grail bank regulation supervision.and become ultimate goal relevant reform undertake sincethe crisis. and much done. we revamp global standard capital andliquidity – basel iii. rule bank much strong before. and sameis true supervision. just think european bank supervision, set 2014. allthis help make bank resilient, reliably serve economy.but one thing neither rule supervisor do. they cannot prevent andevery bank failing. and view, even try to. the possibility failure isinherent kind business, core element well-functioning market economies. 1 / 9bis central bankers' speech no, job supervisor keep individual bank alive. we, particular, must lowerour standard cater weak bank. it would also wrong assume bank,even weakest, need time sort out. it would wrong assume localeconomy need grow year bank recover. the result would beweak bank stagger on, zombie-like, barely able survive good times. in short: suchsupervisory forbearance distort market weaken entire bank system.supervisors would become part problem.obviously, shouldn’t overdo either. if justified, bank always reasonable time tocomply new rule standards. think, instance, transitional phase baselframework. but standard weakened.all lead u interest conclusion. obviously, problem bank fail duringthe crisis. but take long-term view, i would argue also problem many weakand under-capitalised bank viable business model fail. they notfail prior crisis – even though probably – could fail thecrisis either.but let bank fail create huge problem road. let’s discus whybanks able fail, often able so.why bank must able fail (but often allow to)why past bank often allow fail? the answer simple: failureof bank trigger financial earthquake.banks engage maturity transformation: accept short-term deposit make longer-termloans. bank depend public trust. if trust disappears, may suffer bank run. and thatcan affect stability whole system. this happen bank highlyinterconnected – either directly indirectly. the failure one bank may trigger failure ofother banks.such contagion occur bank expose other. when bank default itsdebt, creditor bank suffer direct financial losses. but contagion also subtle. thefailure bank may cause investor depositor wonder health banks.trust evaporate fund source dry up. even sound bank might find inthe midst liquidity crisis. this happen financial crisis.either way, bank’s failure infect entire bank system. and respect banksare consider risky others. i talk bank big, complex,interconnected, cannot easily replaced. their failure disrupt financial stabilitybig time. such bank systemically important. if fail, financial system grind ahalt. and that: flow credit stops, investment consumption stall, job aredestroyed. the social cost huge.to prevent happening, government repeatedly bail systemicallyimportant bank public money. even medium-sized bank bail fear ofcontagion. but short-term gain preserve financial stability come great cost thelong term.the belief bank would bail whatever cost create bad incentives. bank gotused implicit costless government guarantee, kick thing go wrong.sound prudent management often consider le important. bank could boost theirprofitability invest risky assets. that way, could reap high returns, know thatthe risk would bear others, taxpayers. 2 / 9bis central bankers' speech and neither shareholder investor provide necessary check balances. theylacked incentive monitor banks’ risks. they often expect outsized returns, know thebanks would need take equally outsized risk earn returns. but didn’t care toomuch; investor live world profit gain loss wereimposed many.funding cost systemic bank low, allow grow even larger, makingthem “too big fail”. at end day, bank investor little incentive act asustainable forward-looking manner.so bank must able fail reason i mentioned.making bank fail againwhen’s right time?against backdrop, aim regulatory reform make bank moreresilient. they also aim make bank fail again. but don’t get wrong here. failure theleast desirable option, course. above all, need healthy well-functioning banks.but still, sometimes bank fail. and ensure orderly manner, aeuropean resolution mechanism devised. it define tool institutional set-up. it form second pillar bank union alongside european bank supervision.but again, resolve bank last resort. thus, new framework becomesapplicable long bank fails. it require banks, instance, draw recovery plans. inthese plans, bank set would overcome severe crisis use ownresources.now, recovery plan draw go good. when time tough, newframework offer tools, include early intervention measures. supervisor usethem see bank get trouble. the idea intrusive makethe bank officially aware supervisor’s serious concerns. this help get bank back ontrack.early intervention measure important tool prevent bank failures. in practice,however, challenge use them, two reasons.first, overlap standard tools. to give one example,asking bank capital plan either standard supervisory tool early interventionmeasure. this overlap challenge often prevent u apply early interventiontools. we bind use least intrusive tool, always standard one. we alwayshave take account cost benefit measures.assume supervisor, early intervention measure, ask bank draw capitalplan. the bank might require disclose request market show thesupervisor seriously concerned. this might erode trust bank and, bad case,trigger bank run. this would bring crisis supervisor want prevent inthe first place. if early intervention measure harm bank good,supervisors might oblige apply measures.instead, could ask thing, frame standard tool. in case, bankwould still draw capital plan, would probably need disclose requestto markets. hence, standard supervisory tool consider le intrusive thanthe early intervention tools.so overlap two tool removed. there clearly define set 3 / 9bis central bankers' speech standard tool early intervention measure clearly define escalation processleading one other.the second reason challenge use early intervention measure thosemeasures define bank recovery resolution directive, brrd. and thebrrd eu directive, transpose national law. the ecb must thus exerciseits power base national transpositions; vary country country. thiscreates uncertainty inconsistency. what thus need harmonise legal basis fromwhich apply early intervention measures.now, let’s go one step further. imagine bank get serious trouble. in scenario,there one tool help create bite breathe space bank authority tosort thing – moratorium. a moratorium allow authority suspend activity ofa bank short period time. in sense, freeze time.a moratorium help manage crisis orderly manner. it give bank itsshareholders time find solution. this particularly useful sudden liquidity crisis.however, practical problem. moratorium part european toolbox. in somecountries exist; others, don’t. and case, harmonised. we needharmonised, short-term moratorium euro area countries.if, instance, cross-border bank get trouble, supervisor bank’s home countrycan impose moratorium. but bank subsidiary country courtcould impose moratorium? what bank subsidiary country moratoriumcannot impose all? this serious stumble block crisis management europeanlevel. this obstacle removed.let’s return bank assume nothing help situation go bad toworse. at point, bank declare “failing likely fail”, use bite ofjargon. this mostly do supervisors, intrusive thing do.declaring bank “failing likely fail” far-reaching consequences. it difficult decisionwhich require delicate balance act.as long reasonable chance bank recovering, “failing likely fail” decisionwould put undue financial burden shareholders. but decision put toolong, cost imminent failure start mount up. this would hurt creditor depositors.in extreme cases, might even become threat financial stability. so, “failing likely tofail” decision must neither take early, late. and case, must take withgreat care.there four general case call “failing likely fail” decision. some thesecases quite clear-cut objectively assessed. others bite le clear-cut –particularly refer thing likely might happen near future. thus,there room discretion determine whether bank fail likely fail. afterall, bank fail way, case different, decision need accountfor differences. we need take fact account ass case case, andnot single yardstick. in short, must proportionate.imagine bank breach capital requirements. then ask severe breach isand whether might temporary. if it’s marginal breach could heal withina reasonable period time, might proportionate declare bank “failing likely tofail”.we also need take account bank depend markets. so react? abank trouble might quickly lose trust markets. this could lead bank run, whichrequires supervisor act differently. 4 / 9bis central bankers' speech so, sum up: “failing likely fail” decision take automatically base onexpert judgement. at time, take case case proportionatemanner. all all, difficult decision supervisor take. and i assureyou take lightly.how resolve bankimagine declare bank fail likely fail. what happen next? well, thatpoint resolution authority take over. in europe, single resolution board, srbfor short.the srb answer two basic questions. first: measures, private orotherwise, could restore viability bank? if answer question “no”, thesecond question is: bank resolve liquidated?and answer question depend number things. the objective always beto ensure financial system disrupted. if bank perform critical functions, theseneed continue one way another. in addition, measure need take prevent thebank “infecting” bank market general. and finally, public fund thebank’s insure depositors, instance, need protected. so, crucial conduct wecall “public interest test”.if goal meet liquidate bank, that’s happen nationalinsolvency law. and something weak spot, law still differ significantlyacross euro area. a minimum level harmonisation thus call for. in particular, thetriggers “failing likely fail” decision liquidation need aligned. if not,banks deem fail likely fail accord european rule might deemedas national insolvency laws. this obviously huge stumble block theharmonised treatment bank failures.if liquidate bank potential disrupt financial system therefore publicinterest test positive, bank resolve european level instead. the srb hasvarious tool disposal lay relevant legislation. all toolsensure bank fail orderly manner without disrupt financial system. and thisis overarch goal.who foot bill?ladies gentlemen, i talk decision declare bank fail likely tofail. and i talk happen decision taken. the next thing i talkabout money. bank failure costly. so foot bill?“not taxpayers” first important answer i give you. after all, mainobjective new framework spare taxpayers. instead, owner andcreditors bear losses. i already explain reason behind this. but doesit work practice?the first thing mention bank hold equity thecrisis. this mean bank large buff absorb losses. and loss areborne provide equity, shareholders. so, high equity mean theowners bank bear large share loss incurred. at time, failure becomesless likely.and bank fail need resolved, bail-in. the bail-in one thesrb’s resolution tools, ensure burden failure indeed bear ownersand creditor bank. the bail-in establish might call hierarchy loss-bearers. 5 / 9bis central bankers' speech first line shareholders, follow holder subordinate debt, follow othercreditors.the question is, course: much bail in? and answer is: everything! well, intheory. in practice, safeguard: single resolution fund, srf. the srf isfinanced bank 19 euro area countries. it set 2016, 2023, shouldamount €55 billion.in resolution, srf contribute 5% bank’s balance sheet. but doso shareholder creditor bear loss amount least 8% bank’stotal balance sheet. so, shareholder creditor bear large part loss first,and bank industry whole step srf.the basic idea bail-in quite clear. but, often case, devil detail.however, i spare particular discussion turn three general questionsrelated bail-ins.a bail-in ensure loss bear owner creditor bank, tookthe risk earn return. so first question is: aware – notmade aware – risk taking? for sometimes case retail investor areamong bail in. these professional investor ordinary people whowere try build fund retirement, instance. for people, bail-in afinancial loss; personal tragedy.we must avoid tragedies. but must way line basic idea ofbail-in. and much question consumer protection financial education. in termsof consumer protection, need disclosure requirement clear easy tounderstand investor aware risk taking. in term financialeducation, must ensure investor basic understand finance, inparticular relationship risk return.in areas, i see lot room forimprovement europe.and there’s do. we could set minimum threshold €100,000 invest insubordinated debt instruments. this would help steer retail investor away riskyfinancial endeavours. here, would need european approach, course. if countrywere go way, market relevant financial instrument would become toofragmented.the ecb welcome current proposal foresee introduction non-preferred seniordebt instrument general depositor preference rule. this would facilitate bail-ins.the second question is: happen single resolution fund run money? what ifthere’s major crisis, €55 billion enough cover losses? well, asituation would need common european backstop srf. and need quickly, andin case 2023, srf reach target volume. european leaderscommitted set srf, stick commitment. thebackstop could take form direct credit line european stability mechanism thesrf. the important thing provide solvency liquidity support.and third final question: public support fail bank really become thingof past? “almost” answer question. and rule publicsupport bank fact trigger “failing likely fail” decision.there exceptions, however. one know precautionary recapitalisation. itallows government recapitalise bank use public funds. but scope kind stateaid narrow. 6 / 9bis central bankers' speech first, available solvent banks.second, use cover capital shortfall identify adversescenario stress test.and third, precautionary temporary nature. in words, must notbe use cover loss bank already incur likely incur.i highlight one issue relate role ecb. with regard firstcondition, ecb confirm whether bank question solvent. it somediscretion here, european legal framework offer specific definition solvency.so crucial consistent definition solvency – definition cover apoint time take forward-looking perspective. even bank solvent today, might notbe near future.in end, european commission grant deny permission precautionaryrecapitalisation, state aid rule apply. among things, entail burden-sharing.shareholders, well holder hybrid subordinate debt, must contribute reducingthe capital shortfall. this ensure burden failure still bear take therisk reap return.spotting problem keep mount upgiven limit time have, i give brief overview resolve bankentails. it gruesome complex event, one best avoided, costs.to avoid failure, bank supervisor must spot problem early address quickly.since crisis, stress test become important tool help u this. stresstests basically ass bank would fare various hypothetical scenario involve differentfuture path economy financial markets.usually, baseline scenario, thing develop expected. and anadverse scenario, don’t: inter alia, gdp, unemployment property price arestressed two year ahead scenario. so see key idea stress test toassess bank would cope go get tough; it’s purely hypothetical, course.stress test allow u make consistent assessment. each bank apply samescenarios calculate impact way. this mean result becompared across banks.and stress test provide glimpse bank’s risk management action. how quickly itprocess scenario ass impact [the state of] bank? this importantinformation quality governance. but main focus stress test capital. dothe bank enough capital absorb loss either scenario? and crucial questionthat follow is, course: don’t?well, let’s take brief look upcoming stress test. this year, european bankingauthority, eba short, conduct stress test involve large bank eu. this testincludes 37 bank euro area directly supervise ecb. to obtain fullerpicture, will, parallel, stress-test remain large bank euro area, usingthe scenario method eba.in respect capital shortfalls, stress test pass-or-fail exercise. the bank nothave meet certain thresholds. instead, supervisor decide case-by-case basiswhether bank capital shortfall, take account individual risk profile theirindividual capital needs. 7 / 9bis central bankers' speech at end day, stress test may deal hypothetical scenarios, result canhave real consequence banks. they inform work supervisors, informmarket expectation result published, case eba’sstress test. they also moment truth banks.more generally, stress test help supervisor bank spot remove weak point inbanks’ resilience early on.if done, problem quickly mount up. a current example bad loans, use amore technical term, non-performing loans, npls short. bank euro area carry totalof €760 billion loan balance sheets. and issue.having large stock npls balance sheet prevent bank job. theyhave hard time finance economy. ecb internal research show bank highstocks npls indeed lend le others.it thus important bank resolve npls quickly decisively. and forthe sake economy great good. fail deal npls also hurt banksthemselves. high level npls require constant attention. and take time energy. sogetting rid npls would enable manager staff use time productively. theycould improve business models, shore profit make bank resilient.so, fail deal npls hurt economy course hurt banks. that’s weconsider npls top priority. get rid npls restructuring, work sell themrequires joint effort banks, politician supervisors. bank put place rightstrategies execute them. politician improve judicial legal system allow aswift resolution npls.and supervisors? well, last year publish guidance deal npls. on thebasis guidance, scrutinise banks’ strategy provide feedback. so arekeeping close eye bank address problem.and today, publish addendum guidance. this addendum help ensurethat npls remain problem past deal with. to end, lay outhow expect bank provision new npls. more specifically, refer exposure arenewly classify non-performing 1 april 2018. the addendum bind document,but specify expectation thus serve start point dialogue eachbank.conclusionladies gentlemen,rest assure i exhaust topic speech. but i may well exhaustedyou. so i conclude quickly painlessly.first, bank important economy, particularly europe. that said, might begood add bite capital market mix; topic another day.second, bank must able fail. if not, economy suffer long run.but bank fail, must orderly manner. if not, financial stability suffer theshort run. the new european resolution framework help make orderly failure possible.third, failure least desirable outcome, course. we need bank profitable andresilient first place. strong regulation supervision bit. in end,however, bank ensure lead long healthy lives. 8 / 9bis central bankers' speech and three message long speech come end.thank attention. 9 / 9bis central

look colorful prosperous light kurfürstendamm, conclude story tell u much cherish peace much think sound economic development mattered. let add me, too, personally, germany familiar place. a young boy late 1960s, i bring beautiful hansestadt hamburg. it period father take west berlin first time. my second visit 1988, when, i mentioned, imf hold annual meet west berlin i attend japanese delegation. so, third visit. but visit special first one capital city unite germany. iii. origin japan's economic ordeal the two central banks, bundesbank bank japan, reputation tough inflation fighters. however, policy priority start diverge 1990s. our 3 mission become focus end deflation bring japan's economy back track sustain growth. this topic i want talk about. let begin background difficulty japan faced. i think root cause japan's economic ordeal burst asset bubble early 1990s. slide 1 look magnitude burst asset bubbles. a see leave panel, cumulative capital gain bubble year japan amount 450 percent nominal gdp. the burst bubble result brutally large swing opposite direction, cumulative capital loss equivalent almost minus 230 percent nominal gdp. in unite states, epicenter global financial crisis, correspond number 300 percent minus 100 percent, respectively. in cases, economic impact destructive. in japan's case, toll almost exclusively bank sector, often compare invincible armada bubble era. slide 2 show cumulative credit loss experience japanese banks. this figure climb constantly reach almost 100 trillion yen, correspond 20 percent japan's nominal gdp. during decade japan's financial crisis, 180 financial institutions, include internationally active ones, go under. the bank sector broken. this mean loss credit intermediary function, badly need time support economic recovery. when japan's economy overcome aftermath homegrown financial crisis 1990s, strike another major shock, trigger u.s. subprime loan problem accentuate collapse lehman brothers: global financial crisis. the leave panel slide 3 show parallel shift gdp downside take place japan. this also case major economies, include u.s. economy. although gdp recover pre-crisis levels, reason precisely know, return original trend japanese economy many advance economies. on contrary, german economy, see right panel, exceptional revert original trend rather quickly high growth rates. the difference may interest topic explored. 4 therefore, financial crisis root cause japan's ordeal. but country's problem compound factors; namely, deflation demography. slide 4 show japan's potential growth rate solid red line determinant bar different colors. the protract period deflation last almost 15 year homegrown financial crisis 1990s prevent firm invest capital, capital input remain sluggish corporate strategy deflation sit cash. meanwhile, labor input negatively contribute since 1990s result shift demographics. this much japan's age society, birth rate remain low baby boomer reach retirement age. a solid red line graph shows, potential growth rate japan decline trend, come around 4 percent late 1980s almost 0 percent bounce back 0.8 percent recently. what chart imply that, order elevate japan's potential growth rate, need raise three determinants: total factor productivity (tfp), labor input, capital input. another way express need raise labor productivity labor input order elevate japan's potential growth rate. slide 5 provide decomposition japan's gdp growth rate labor productivity growth rate change number employ persons. it quite obvious chart decline labor force forecast next decade must offset improvement labor productivity japanese economy maintain positive growth. what chart suggest that, country like japan, country shrink population, improve labor productivity number one policy priority. an interest question regard japan's situation compare germany, economy know face similar demographic challenge sooner later. slide 6 compare economic performance japan germany last decade, 2006 2016, contribute factors. the average annual economic growth rate germany 1.5 percent, twice high japan's growth rate 0.6 percent period. the improvement labor productivity le equivalent economies. the major difference appear term labor input. while labor input decline japan, show positive growth germany. 5 slide 7 show case. while hour work employ person decline economies, fall unemployment rate increase labor force participation rate pronounce germany japan far period concerned. but challenge lie ahead economies. the right panel slide 8 show japan already turn call "population onus society," work age population decline fast pace total population. a leave panel suggests, forecast follow germany, albeit le conspicuous manner, come decades. the decline work age population may partially offset increase number foreign workers. this seem typically case germany, see panel slide 9. even japan, number foreign worker climb recent year one million backdrop acute labor shortage. even decline work age population inevitable, negative impact labor input mitigate raise labor participation rates. in regard, japan make tangible achievement recent years. slide 10 offer international comparison labor force participation rates. the low leave panel show japan's labor participation rate woman age group past two decades. you see woman age group 25-34 year (typically young work mothers) work today ever before, offset overall decline work age population. the labor participation rate age group climb 77 percent 2016, result, notorious m-shaped curve largely corrected. an international comparison show low right panel reveal japan's participation rate woman 2016 generally high unite states, although high germany sweden. thus, two supply-side determinant economic growth, labor input uphold raise labor participation rates. what determinant, labor productivity? slide 11 provide u insight. the leave panel compare level labor productivity g7 countries. if place u.s. productivity level benchmark 100, japan's productivity level around 70 percent u.s. level. the german 6 productivity level stand high g7 economies. thus, japan catch u.s. productivity level, close gap amount 30 percent. a matter fact, right panel show japan achieve one high productivity growth rate among g7 country 2000 2015. this suggest remain room catch up, actually catch up. we know manufacture company competitive global standard. so, mainly service industry need accelerate catch-up process, possibly wide use information communication technologies. iv. bank japan's monetary policy now let talk monetary policy. the bank japan sit watch japan's economic difficulties. in fact, nation's central bank, go all-out struggle. slide 12 show problem japan policy rate reach 0 percent early 2000s long central bank major economy face problem. this mean room bank japan reduce short-term policy rate. japan face zero-lower bind ahead industrialize economies. when room policy rate cut exhausted, introduce number new monetary policy measure describe today unconventional monetary policies. the bank japan originate quantitative ease first employ forward guidance. we literally inventor various sort new form monetary policies. the late version new policy call yield curve control (ycc). slide 13 show outline policy. it intend facilitate formation thus shape yield curve consider appropriate maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent. under ycc, operational target interest rate. the novelty two target rates. the short-term policy interest rate set minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year japanese government bond (jgb) yield around 0 percent. we buy necessary sufficient quantity jgbs maintain rate targets. i think policy quite effective. the leave panel slide 14 show japan's yield curve generally stay low unite state germany. a comparison german 7 yield curve reveal that, short rate low germany, long-term rate keep low japan germany. the right panel compare 10-year bond yield major economies. while u.s. treasury rate move presidential election november 2016, drag german bunds rate direction, jgb yield remain low level ycc. i turn economic inflation development japan show monetary policy work quite effectively. slide 15 provide bank japan's late economic inflation outlook. a see table, japan's economy forecast grow 1.9 percent fiscal 2017 1.4 percent fiscal 2018. this well japan's potential growth rate, estimate around 0.8 percent. therefore, output gap expect improve positive territory. this suppose exert upward pressure prices. however, inflation front, consumer price index (cpi) inflation rate remain weak expect reach 1.8 percent fiscal 2019, still fall short price stability target 2 percent. in meantime, economy never good balance recent past. a see leave panel slide 16, corporate profit climb record high levels. the labor market tight unemployment rate, show middle panel, way 2.7 percent, imply full employment. meanwhile, job open rates, show right panel, rise historically high levels. so, question price weak macroeconomic fundamental favorable. a matter fact, may common question ask economy unite state euro area. my answer question japan that, backdrop acute labor shortage, corporate firm japan try absorb wage cost pressure without pass sale prices, measure labor-saving capital expenditure, streamline business processes, away excessive unnecessary services. in cases, labor productivity improve exert downward pressure inflation. a matter fact, see leave panel slide 17, macroeconomic perspective tell u labor productivity steady upward trend recently, real wage move almost sideways. thus, gap them, label real wage gap, declined, 8 see right panel. this mean real wage increase catch improvement labor productivity. in sum, i think weak inflation japan high productivity, regard supply-side shock. assume wage eventually catch labor productivity improvement wage gap revert zero time, expect inflation rate pick accordingly. i think matter time start witness inflationary pressure gather momentum. to extent good thing happen economy, i think need overly frustrate low inflation. we patient continue current monetary policy without easing. v. lesson japanese experience what lessons, any, japanese experience euro area, face similar challenge range low inflation demographics? i wish i could offer full answer, mission overcome deflation bring economy back track toward sustain growth fully completed. so, i'll offer three interim suggestions. first, definitely need avoid financial crisis. we learn financial crisis inflict last damage economy. therefore, essential soundness financial system maintain adequate regulation supervision. it important operational safety net, include deposit insurance system resolution framework prevent failure financial institution develop systemic crisis. in regard, completion basel iii regulatory reform begin follow onset global financial crisis significant achievement. second, monetary policy alone cannot achieve ultimate goal overcome deflation bring economy back track sustain growth. monetary policy must pursue tandem growth strategy, structural policy broadly. monetary ease raise potential gdp increase capital stock well labor input, thus affect supply side. moreover, accommodative monetary condition mitigate frictional cost might otherwise accompany necessary structural reforms. what japan euro area hand golden opportunity 9 upgrade economies. we miss chance promote much need structural reforms. third, central bank need maintain credential deflation fighter much inflation fighter show clear unequivocal commitment battle deflation. should lost, experience suggest credential would extremely difficult recover. i sure policy maker euro area, include bundesbank, recognize precisely point therefore require advice me. the cumulative wisdom build year address challenge collectively fully utilize guide economy right direction. close remark one summer day late 1960s, i live hamburg, father drive border deutsche demokratische republik (ddr). at border middle meadow, bundeswehr border guard approach say ''look boy, also beyond germany—auch drüben ist deutschland.'' what germany achieve since truly admirable wirtschaftswunder (economic wonder). i understand embark ''industrie 4.0'' initiative create yet another wirtschaftswunder. in five decade since boyhood germany, social economic environment country change quite dramatically. today, average japanese person life expectancy 15 year long people 1960. an average japanese worker today work 50 hour le per month compare 1960. similarly, germany, life expectancy today 13 year long german worker work 70 hour le compare 1960. this big change people two countries, whose common virtue use diligence 1960s. but necessary bad thing, people time enjoy life. it also mean time get know even better. 10 i father, fully retire one enjoy long life. when i visit new year holiday, tell still regularly exchange update family history alten kameraden (old comrades) fifty year since day germany. old friendship never dies. i know responsibility generation inherit friendship germany, foster pas generation come. thank technological innovation, learn lot easily other's history culture days. in addition, travel become far easier, enable ''seeing believing'' many people. thus, i believe relationship germany japan enter new stage beyond traditional sphere, economic cultural interaction become everyday affair, make geographical distance le meaningful. i would like conclude speech even express sincere hope friendship develop ferne gefährten (distant companions) call enge gefährten (close companions). this conclude speech evening. ich danke ihnen für ihre aufmerksamkeit.

if rate structure remainsnear historic lows, valuation persist. but rises, asset valuation need bereassessed. the second relate question is: risk shift ratestructure occur i adequately compensate risk?low interest ratesi go use rate structure us, particularly yield u 10-year treasurybond illustrate shift rate structure (graph 1). 1 / 14bis central bankers' speech a aware, wake financial crisis sharp decline global growth andinflation, monetary policy rate round world reduce historically low levels. in anumber country (australia one notable exception), policy rate low itseffective low bound, case even negative territory.in part reflect low level policy rate slow nominal growth post crisis, long-termbond yield also decline historically low levels. 10-year government bond yield somecountries, include germany, japan switzerland negative various time inrecent years. in 2015, us$14 trillion sovereign paper negative yields.for past decade, yield structure u low time previously. letme put context current excitement 10-year yield u reach 3 per cent. inthe three decade prior 2007, low point yield 3.11 per cent.all go say live period unusually low nominal bond yields. howlong period last?one way think question ask whether see realisation atail event historical distribution interest rates. while tail event last quite along time, think tail event, would expect yield revert back theirhistorical mean point. you also wouldn’t change assessment distribution offuture realisation interest rates.on hand, might case yield structure shift permanently lowerlevel (say) secular stagnation result structurally low growth rate majoreconomies foreseeable future. if case, would change assessmentof future interest rate outcomes.i don’t know answer question, material implication asset pricing.1 2 / 14bis central bankers' speech a i say earlier, price many asset could broadly validate believe low ratestructure stay. this low rate structure mean rate withwhich discount expect future return asset low hence asset price ishigher give flow future earnings.the current constellation asset price seem base view global economycan grow strongly, associate earn growth, strong growth lead anymaterial increase inflationary pressure.you might want question long benign conjuncture could last. current asset pricingsuggests (average) expectation market participant last quite whileyet.it also worth point possible move high interest rate occur alongsidehigher expect (nominal) dividend even high real growth. if occur itwould necessarily imply asset price adjust. it would depend upon relativemovements earn expectation interest rates; is, numerator denominatorin asset price calculation.how might know whether distribution interest rate shifted? one think theinterest rate distribution anchor neutral rate interest. i talk theaustralian context last year. a i say then, empirically neutral rate interest difficult toestimate. it even hard forecast. the factor affect often slow moving. butsometimes aren’t, notably around time onset financial crisis 2007–08, estimate neutral rate decline rapidly significantly. currently, adebate u whether neutral rate interest bottom shift up. thisraises question degree speed movement neutral ratein u might translate globally.all question highlight inherent uncertainty future evolution interestrates. one might decide interest rate go continue remain low longer, istruggle see one hold view great certainty. yet appear tobe little, any, compensation uncertainty fix income markets. most estimate ofthe term premium 10-year u treasury around zero, even negative (graph 2).investors receive additional compensation hold asset duration.2345 3 / 14bis central bankers' speech that is, one different view longevity current rate structure. but, partreflecting different view longevity well unusual nature currentenvironment, significant degree uncertainty future. yet many financialprices obviously offer compensation uncertainty.low volatilityit’s term structure interest rate compensation uncertainty low.measures imply volatility indicate compensation uncertainty path manyother financial price also low, low time. this true acrossshort long time horizons, across countries, include australia, across asset classes, andacross individual sector within market (graph 3 4). i discus possibleexplanations this, draw material publish rba’s february statement onmonetary policy, also discus recent short-lived spike volatility equity markets.6 4 / 14bis central bankers' speech 5 / 14bis central bankers' speech imply volatility derive price financial options. just term premium measurescompensation uncertainty future path interest rates, imply volatility reflectsuncertainty future price asset(s) underlie financial option. the certainan investor future value underlie asset, high risk tolerance, thelower volatility implicit option’s price be.thus, one interpretation recent low level volatility market participant beenmore confident estimate future outcomes. this consistent observedreduction variability many macroeconomic indicators, gdp inflation, adecline frequency magnitude revision analyst make theirforecasts variable (graph 5). give importance variable input thepricing financial assets, it’s surprise great investor certainty future valueshas turn give investor certainty future value asset prices. 6 / 14bis central bankers' speech a see three graphs, similar degree certainty future presentin mid 2000s, high degree confidence ‘great moderation’ wasgoing deliver robust growth low inflation number year come.monetary policy also important input price financial assets, reduction theperceived uncertainty around central bank policy set may also contribute lowfinancial market volatility. monetary policy set relatively stable recent years, andwhere central bank adjust interest rate purchase assets, changeshave tend gradual clearly signal advance. central bank also madegreater use forward guidance policy tool attempt provide certainty thepath monetary policy.but central bank might act gradually provide guidance, market doesn’t tobelieve guidance come pass. there number instance past wherecentral bank forward guidance didn’t come pass. in view, important themarket clear understand central bank’s reaction function. that is, thecentral bank likely adjust stance policy macroeconomic conjuncture evolves. ifthat sufficiently clear, forward guidance obviously large additionalbenefit, run risk add noise sow confusion.hence explanation low volatility could assumption stable macroenvironment together understand central bank reaction function, rather 7 / 14bis central bankers' speech effect forward guidance per se.the low level imply volatility could also reflect great investor willingness take financialmarket risk. this consistent measure suggest demand derivative protectagainst uncertainty declined. it also consistent indicator increase investorappetite financial risks, narrow credit spreads. this increase risk appetitemay part reflect low yield environment recent years; protection uncertainty notcostless, detract already low returns.there also increase interest sell volatility-linked derivative investorsto generate additional return low yield environment recent years. effectively, somemarket participant sell insurance volatility. they earn premium incomefrom buy insurance whilever volatility remain low expected, topay volatility rises. in recent years, steady stream premium income tobe had. (this even i risk neutral seller insurance risk-averse buyer, inwhich case, expect value insurance positive.) but payout, itcame, large. i come back shortly discuss recent developments.this reduce

curve.corporates also term debt. some corporates issue debt maturitiesas long 50 years, interest least two reasons. firstly, 50-year bond start totake equity-like features. secondly, many corporates don’t even last 50 years.the australian bank also avail opportunity term fund forrelatively little cost. the recently implement net stable fund ratio (nsfr) furtherincentivises this. a colleague christopher kent note couple day ago, theaverage maturity new issuance australian bank increase five year 2013to six year currently (graph 10). a issuers, materially reduce rollover risk. thebanks

recovery continue play currently anticipated, one would expectthat monetary stimulus unwind, would see least short-end yield curvesrise.8 13 / 14bis central bankers' speech at time, factor behind low structure interest rate aredifficult understand completely raise question durability. i discuss someof today. in particular, i find puzzle little compensation duration inthe rate structure. while explanation interest rate may remain low aconsiderable period time, minimal compensation uncertainty whether ornot actually occur. at time, equity price embody view future thatrobust growth continue without generate material increase inflation. again, littlepriced risk may turn true.the ongoing improvement global economy, together fiscal stimulus u hascaused investor question views. if interest rate continue rise without similarrise expectation future earn growth, one would expect see repricing otherassets, particularly equity markets. such repricing necessarily mean major derailingof global recovery, indeed consequence recovery, may dampeningeffect.at time, need alert effect rise interest rate structure onfinancial market functioning. the recent spike volatility one example this. in view, thatwas small example could happen follow large sustain shift upwardsin rate structure. the recent episode primarily confine retail market. the largeinstitutional position predicate continuation low volatility regime remain inplace. that said, i expect volatility would move high structurally past thishas turn wrong. but i think high probability prove correct thistime.see kozlowski j, l

to, 2% medium term. our monetary policyhas therefore evolve line outlook price stability consistent manner overtime.the unprecedented challenge face pursuit price stability mandate lead u tointroduce complex multi-dimensional monetary policy package. the transmission ofunconventional instrument financial conditions, and, road, economicactivity price developments, surround high degree uncertainty. this beg thequestion: monetary policy conduct environment?over past 50 years, number economist work academia central bankshave argue gradual adjustment monetary policy stance optimal approach topolicy conduct world uncertainty. follow seminal work brainard, case forgradualism make context uncertainty inherent economic data, model andparameters, notably time unconventional monetary policy. in absence perfect orcomplete knowledge way market participant react announcement ofmonetary policy adjustments, way uncertain reaction transmit ourobjective, may optimal adjust policy cautiously small step had11 7 / 13bis central bankers' speech perfect knowledge.more generally, policy calibration exercise view one centralbank decide speed approach give target level instrument orinstruments, rather iterative interactive process central bank learn fromthe market much market learn implementation central bank’spolicies.it feedback loop central bank market alike learn nature andstrength monetary policy transmission mechanism. in process, change theinstrument(s) impact uncertain ex ante respect induce adjustment inthe yield curve financial price and, consequence, respect likelihood ofachieving objective. market adjustment know observed, canonly work implication might achievement objective theyhave materialised.in conditions, brainard rationale gradualism apply great force: ascarefully prudently possible, least good reason believe thedegree uncertainty direction size market reaction atypically large. presenttimes, policy define multiplicity instrument interact way veryimperfectly known, characterise abnormal amount uncertainty.gradualism doctrine, pragmatic approach generally suitable situationscharacterised significant uncertainty impact available policy instruments. a moreaggressive monetary policy response, however, warrant clear evidence ofheightened risk price stability, i.e. establish degree inflationpersistence likely high risk disanchoring inflation expectations. in case, aforceful, frontloaded monetary policy response weak excess inflation may becomenecessary signal central bank’s commitment objective, thus nudge inflationexpectations towards objective make le backward-looking.for example, confront risk disanchoring inflation expectation tooprolonged period low inflation, govern council state may 2014 would “actswiftly” “unanimous commitment use also unconventional instrument withinits mandate” needed. this follow month late announcement battery ofnon-standard measure i already mentioned. in addition, late 2015, signal ourdetermination bring inflation back policy aim “without undue delay”, justify anaggressive recalibration stimulus time.let turn concrete example gradual approach. our app evolvedgradually, subject

nevertheless, today’s perspective domestic inflation pressure stillsubdued substantial degree monetary accommodation remain necessary pricepressures build inflation converge sustainably towards aim.we must patient, persistent prudent policy. patience need takestime underlie inflation dynamic gain momentum support durable convergence ofinflation towards aim. persistence need recovery inflation predicatedon substantial degree monetary policy accommodation. and prudence essential becauseof uncertainty transmission unconventional monetary policy measure wayto normalisation.this lead question monetary policy evolve govern counciljudges criterion sustain adjustment path inflation met. theanswer question essentially already indicate forward guidance clearsequencing policy measure communicated.once govern council judge criterion sustain adjustment met,our net asset purchase end. only one instrument currently contribute tothe economic expansion inflation convergence expire. the monetary support thatwill still necessary accompany inflation along path towards durable convergence willcontinue provide remain instruments: reinvestments policy interest ratesthat expect remain

an address lesetja kganyago, governor south african reserve bank, national asset liability management conference london 2 march 2018 challenge emerging-market central bank good morning, lady gentlemen, thank opportunity address challenge face emerging-market central banks. since recent global financial crisis, central bank face mount challenges. not forefront save global economy collapse; also see ‘the game town’ restore economic growth. central bank also begin play pivotal role ensure financial stability general. with additional responsibility expectations, independence central bank become increasingly questioned, financial regulation consider primarily political nature rather technical. the economic dimension independence also importance, particularly emerging-market economies. my remark today focus two dimension independence consider extent emerge market increase resilience recent years. page 2 11 political independence the case central-bank independence base time inconsistency argument politician promise low inflation tempt go high growth expansionary monetary policies. an independent central bank, clear mandate maintain price stability without concern electoral cycle, better-placed focus achieve price stability. the problem cede enormous power unelected official democratic society solve distinguish goal independence operational independence. in many countries, central bank grant latter form independence. this distinction accord neatly inflation-targeting framework, goal monetary policy – inflation target – set law elect government, central bank implement monetary policy achieve inflation target without political interference. pressure central bank use monetary policy stimulate growth new. it generally accept among central banker monetary policy affect cyclical growth, ability determine longer-term potential output limited. since global financial crisis, see potential output estimate many country revise downwards. and need structural reform clear many country too, focus monetary policy sustain growth recovery. concert central-bank action probably successful prevent full-blown global depression, ability bring growth recovery le certain. there were, times, excessively high expectation monetary policy could achieve respect growth, failure respect potential undermine credibility legitimacy monetary policy general. in event, recovery take time, see return ‘normal’ growth rate sustainable basis. we yet see massive expansion balance sheet high level liquidity generate low interest rate page 3 11 quantitative ease ultimately lead high inflation feared. while unlikely, remain risk. the global crisis originate financial sector subsequently require rethink role central bank respect financial stability. prior crisis, responsibility often explicitly part central-bank mandates. since then, much changed. and differ approach among countries, tendency increasingly locate responsibility within central banks. a financial-stability mandate become complex deal issue independence, fit neatly ‘goal versus operational independence’ dichotomy. what constitute financial-stability goal le clear-cut case monetary policy. in addition, policy available achieve maintain financial stability often require cooperation coordination various regulatory authorities, including, times, fiscal authorities. a challenge central bank ensure monetary-policy independence undermine process. this particularly case event conflict compete objectives. furthermore, macroprudential policy – example cap loan-to-value loan-to-income ratio criterion loan eligibility – often visible distributional dimension, financial-sector lobby interest group usually strong. a consequence, central bank unwittingly thrust squarely political realm. a responsibility financial stability increases, central bank could become increasingly politicized, case monetary policy. macroprudential policy often liken take punchbowl away party starting. such action never popular. if independence maintained, central bank need foster political consensus underpin independence. this require even great transparency accountability case monetary policy. central bank also need courage political back make tough calls. there always danger unhappiness central-bank action financial-stability field could undermine credibility legitimacy respect core mandate price stability. page 4 11 the issue independence also relate central-bank balance sheets, bring great scrutiny wake global financial crisis. the balance sheet advance economy expand dramatically follow extraordinary monetary-policy measure undertake economies. a i elaborate little later, action also implication balance sheet central bank emerge markets. it generally agree central bank concern incur loss make profit balance sheets. these regard part broad government budget constraint. furthermore, central bank profit motive act broad interest economy. however, central bank incur continuous loss may ultimately require recapitalization government may consequently bring great political scrutiny. these issue could divert attention core mandate. the south african experience perhaps instructive – although unlike problem face emerge markets. the south african reserve bank record loss five consecutive year 2010, mainly attributable reserve-accumulation activities. a capital flow emerge market expand search yield intensified, many central bank attempt ameliorate impact currency buy reserves. in south africa’s case, step reserve accumulation – influence currency, rather add consider suboptimal level reserves. whatever motive, impact profitability same. with interest rate low bind advance economy typically significantly high emerge markets, sterilization activity conduct loss. country differ treat losses, prefer approach often depend legal framework institutional structures. it can, however, instance raise question central-bank activities, often see ‘losing taxpayers’ money’ put independence risk. page 5 11 monetary-policy independence while political dimension independence remain ongoing challenge, issue monetary-policy independence emerge market come fore recently. this backdrop appear turn point global financial markets, follow extend period low volatility low interest rate advance economy absence inflation pressures. for time now, world anticipate interest-rate normalization unite state (us) particular. to date, happen slow measure pace, well communicated. over past weeks, global financial market react prospect tighter-than-expected monetary-policy set us. there widespread market reaction sharp drop u equity price large spike vix. after initial bout volatility, market appear stabilise somewhat, remain vulnerable change sentiment perception risk. it seem, however, prolong period easy money highly liquid market may come end, raise concern spillover emerge market who, usual, innocent bystanders. the current turbulence global financial market couple return volatility way reminiscent so-called ‘taper tantrum’ 2013. after number year interest rate zero bind quantitative easing, world suddenly face prospect withdrawal stimulus. the mere suggestion federal reserve system (fed) consider reduction quantitative ease hit financial market hard. long bond yield ratchet us, raise fear nascent growth recovery would reversed. in event, feed allay fear excessively tight policy cycle and, reality, tighten occur since moderate well communicated. but similarity taper tantrum, important difference well. at stage, u look tighten policy. today, cycle synchronised. there expectation aggressive tighten cycle u previously price in, interest-rate increase page 6 11 expect unite kingdom. in addition, european central bank begin gradual withdrawal stimulus. monetary policy japan is, however, expect remain highly accommodative. a important difference that, number false starts, growth recovery advance economy appear entrench broad-based. this positive emerge markets. there also tentative sign inflation may rise well, likely fiscal expansion u also expect provide impetus. wage growth us, surprisingly subdue despite tight labour-market conditions, recently show sign increase contribute much recent bout volatility markets. this time seem different, monetary-policy tighten appear clearly countercyclical. the market overreaction time taper tantrum 2013 mark effect number emerge markets, main beneficiary capital flow generate highly liquid conditions. long bond yield emerge market increase currency depreciate capital flow begin reverse. monetary policy generally tightened, although difference time degree. accord eichengreen gupta1, country hit hard wide fiscal current-account deficit open capital markets. south africa fell category, along brazil, india, indonesia, turkey – together give dubious title ‘the fragile five’. since then, however, emerge market adjust significantly resilient. but resilience currently put test. 1 eichengreen, b gupta, p. 2013. ‘tapering talk: impact expectation reduce federal reserve security purchase emerge markets’. world bank work paper no 6754 page 7 11 one clear lesson 2013 episode emerge market immune monetary-policy development advance economies. this raise question whether small open economy (and emerge market are) conduct monetary policy independently development advanced-economy financial markets. the traditional mundell–fleming model teach u monetary policy cannot conduct independently exchange rate fixed. however, flexible exchange rate expect provide insulation cross-border spillovers. furthermore, perfect exchange-rate flexibility would obviate need reserves. this view world change since then, good reasons. very country allow exchange rate float freely nowadays. in past years, issue monetary-policy independence insulation property flexible exchange rate reconsidered. there little doubt country immune spillover development major advance economies. the question is: extent, all, emerge market insulate external shocks? the well-known ‘trilemma’ tell u that, free capital mobility, independent monetary policy possible exchange rate floating. however, sheer scale financial globalisation recent year lead rethink trilemma. hélène rey2, example, posit existence global financial cycle strongly relate monetary condition u change uncertainty risk aversion. it argue that, credit cycle capital flow respond global factors, may inappropriate prevail cyclical condition many economies. this imply that, countries, global cycle lead excessive credit growth economy boom excessive contraction downturn. in words, condition advance economy determine domestic financial condition small economies, domestic policy rates. 2 rey, h. 2015. ‘dilemma, trilemma: global financial cycle monetary policy independence’. national bureau economic research work paper no. 21162. page 8 11 a obstfeld, ostry, qureshi3 point out, number reason would expect monetary policy constrain financial integration pertains. for example, substitutability domestic external finance could limit effectiveness domestic policy interest-rate change credit extension asset prices. they also note that, even observe divergence short-term rate indicator insulation, likely great co-movement longer-term rates. much depend extent long-term rate influence real variables. for rey, therefore, trilemma exist. rather, dilemma – call ‘an irreconcilable duo’. that is: independent monetary policy possible if, if, capital account managed, directly indirectly, via macroprudential policies. these could include capital control macroprudential policy insufficient. in words: flexible exchange rate ensure independent monetary policy capital highly mobile. this rather significant conclusion emerge market mean that, condition free capital mobility, monetary-policy independence possible, irrespective prevail exchange-rate regime. but view without critics. for example, obstfeld et al. gita gopinath4 agree dilemma view may overstated. however, evidence suggest although trilemma life on, appear exist strong form. they show country exchange-rate flexibility le sensitive change global risk le prone economic boom-bust cycles. and although independence absolute, le loss independence case country fix exchange rates. in words: choice exchange-rate regime matter, expect complete independence flexibility. the trilemma may weakened, still applies. furthermore, extent country conduct independent monetary policy also depend underlie resilience global spillovers. it generally accept 3 obstfeld, m, ostry, j d qureshi, m s. 2017. ‘a tie binds: revisit trilemma emerge market economies’. international monetary fund work paper wp/17/130. 4 gopinath, g. 2017. ‘rethinking macroeconomic policy: international economy issues’. a paper present conference ‘rethinking macroeconomic policy iv’ peterson institute international economics. page 9 11 emerge market also become resilient since taper tantrum: macroeconomic fundamental generally improve domestic financial market develop further. in particular, real policy rate generally higher, inflation within target range inflation-targeting emerge markets, fiscal current-account deficit generally narrowed. for example: select sample non-oil-exporting emerge markets5, current-account deficit percentage gross domestic product (gdp) narrow significantly since 2012, average 0.7% 2016 compare 2.2% 2013. in south africa’s case, deficit narrow wide level almost 6% gdp 2013 current level 2.3% gdp. the deficit so-called ‘fragile’ country also show sizeable contractions. a group, therefore, great ability withstand impact exogenous shocks, include sudden stop high interest rate advance economies. an indicator increase resilience fact that, since crisis, number emerge market make considerable progress develop deep accessible domestic-currency-denominated bond markets. they long suffer often refer ‘original sin’. south africa good example this. prior crisis, although south africa well-developed domestic bond market emerging-market standards, non-residents hold 9% total rand-denominated government debt. today, stand around 40%. this development see reduce emerging-market dependence foreign-currency debt. it also see mean reduce exposure external shock increase resilience. however, insulate emerge market completely. a sudden stop reversal flow would impact bond yield exchange rate. the ability absorb exchange-rate change would differ country country. country low level foreign-currency indebtedness would le sensitive 5 argentina, brazil, egypt, india, indonesia, malaysia, mexico, pakistan, philippines, poland, south africa, thailand, turkey page 10 11 balance-sheet effect large exchange-rate changes. furthermore, also imply bond yield become sensitive global factors. nevertheless, evidence local-currency credit spread much le correlate across country foreign-currency credit spreads, global factor explain significantly le variation local-currency spread foreign-currency spreads.6 in similar vein, work shakill hassan7 south african reserve bank show low correlation south african short-term rate global rates, correlation increase long maturities. yield short end south african term structure highly responsive domestic factor affect domestic monetary-policy stance. by contrast, long-term yield highly responsive change global bond-market developments. a indicator increase resilience level foreign-exchange reserve – something would close heart attendee conference. a i’ve mention earlier: despite increase exchange-rate flexibility, need reserve disappeared. we see that, time, foreign-exchange reserve hold increase quite markedly emerge markets. this true even exclude china, large hold reserves. since 2005, reserve hold sample emerge market refer early (excluding china) increase 178% year 2017. it generally agree primary motive reserve accumulation precautionary, insurance speculative attack time crisis. accord research conduct international monetary fund8, strong empirical evidence reserve reduce likelihood balance-of-payments pressure emerge markets. reserve could provide mean respond exogenous shocks, could calm even prevent disorderly markets. central bank have, however, tend accumulate rather use reserve – phenomenon sometimes refer ‘the fear lose reserves’. 6 du, w schregger, j. 2016. ‘local currency sovereign risk’. journal finance 71(3). 7 hassan, s. 2015. ‘speculative flows, exchange rate

well-regulated financial sectors. conclusion in conclusion, would appear that, long last, recovery global financial crisis track. it difficult path, number false start disappointments. no doubt, road go forward without difficulties. the recovery expect bring new challenges, emerge market particular. it inevitable monetary-policy normalization advance economy happen, era high global liquidity come

disconnect temporary, cyclical forceslinked crisis main driver. but still uncertain persistent effect ofthese force might be.second, degree slack uncertain. even slack receding, estimate thesize output gap make caution. strong growth may lead higherpotential output, crisis-induced hysteresis may reverse condition strong demand.and effect past structural reforms, especially labour market, may showingup potential output.for example, three-quarters employment growth recovery come olderworkers half women. this part past labour market reformshave encourage group enter workforce response high growth. ifsubstantially worker draw labour force, would possible labourmarket strengthen without generate wage pressures.in environment, policymakers cautious past theassumptions underpin forecast – simple policy rule base around estimate ofthe output gap long useful guide actions. the severity crisis mean thatwe cannot rely exclusively traditional historical relationship determine quickly realdevelopments pass nominal ones.the key issue need examine wage dynamics, pass-through prices, thepossible risk inflation outlook.wage growth trend upwards euro area whole, rise 0.5 percentagepoints trough mid-2016. but consistent weaken relationshipbetween slack inflation, adjustment wage recovery far beenatypically slow.that said, analysis suggest that, cycle advances, standard

convergence: headline inflation course reach aim ameaningful definition medium term. the second confidence: need sure thisupward adjustment inflation sufficiently high probability realised. the thirdcondition resilience: adjustment inflation self-sustained even without additionalnet asset purchases.as i said, successive round projection give u comfort inflation rise path isconverging toward

adjustment path ofinflation, remain place.at present, policy stance make three main elements: flow net assetpurchases, stock outstanding bond principal reinvestments, forwardguidance future path key policy rates. but evident relative importance thedifferent element evolve time, three key ways.first, net asset purchase remain necessary validate stimulus alreadypriced key index financial condition inflation path depends. thereafter,when progress towards sustain adjustment path inflation judge sufficient,net purchase come end. at point, next forward guidance, appropriatefinancial condition

regulation long effective, itself, guarantee financial stability. a result, central bank adapt policies, complex term objective instruments. monetary policy face problem know “zero bound” interest rates. basically, situation keynes coin “liquidity trap”: interest rate close zero cease effective monetary policy instrument. this lead development new instruments, so-called “unconventional monetary policy”, mainly include quantitative easing, private public-sector financial asset purchases, explanation signal monetary policy apply future, namely “forward guidance”. the outcome large increase – four- fivefold – balance sheet main economies’ central banks. in case eurosystem, ecb balance sheet account 12% euro area gdp crisis stand approximately 40%, around €4.4 trillion. supervisory policy, part, face challenge macrofinancial instability context highly interconnect market global level. in area, response three-pronged. first, strengthen microprudential regulation, new basel iii accord, include great capital requirement strict framework systemically important financial institutions. second, development new instrument, macroprudential policy, address systemic risk procyclical behaviour financial system whole. and, third, great international coordination regulation, necessary give reality globalise financial markets. notable term coordination creation financial stability board and, case european union, activation bank union, begin ssm single resolution mechanism. the new monetary policy i shall turn challenge central bank face. the first is, evidently, identify understand “new normal”. one question economic policy discussion focus whether advance economy new situation secular stagnation, “new normal” characterise low growth, low inflation low interest rates. we see how, despite low unemployment rate close gap potential real output, inflation rate remain persistently low. a series factor account behaviour. some transitory, insufficient increase employment, impact deleveraging process economies. but 5/7 also factor structural nature, include effect globalisation technological progress, demographic factors. in event, stress policy apart monetary policy. in particular, fiscal policy structural reform key role play support demand, boost real interest rate raise productivity potential growth. regard monetary policy, central question this: extent macroeconomy “new normal” lead new “conventional model” monetary policy? in particular, consider whether management central bank’s balance sheet become entrench permanent part normal instrument monetary policy. estimates, subject major uncertainty, suggest real interest rate inflation remain low levels, mean nominal rate also low, thereby limit effectiveness monetary policy instrument. against background, central bank likely retain use unconventional monetary policies. analysis policy lead debate, yet inconclusive, effectiveness, optimal size central bank balance sheet impact might term financial stability medium- long-term fiscal situation. true, recovery gain momentum, provide translate sustain adjustment inflation towards target, need monetary policy support economy tend diminish. the u federal reserve already begin reduce balance sheet gradual predictable pace, ecb slow pace increase balance sheet. this reduction stimulus extend monetary policy headroom act effectively face possible future crises. the monetary policy normalisation strategy slow tend apply predictably, close scrutiny impact economic growth inflation financial stability. it worth recall that, 2013, market rather hastily interpret statement federal reserve, clarification correction give rise bout turbulence, owe different forecast speed expansionary monetary policy would abandon softened. that episode provide lesson central bank apply unconventional policies, two respects: monetary policy correct slowly, correction predictable markets. in sum, predictability clear communication strategy important prevent adverse market reactions. financial regulation supervision the second area i would like mention concern challenge financial regulation supervision. a i said, crisis lead overhaul financial regulation, centre three main areas: strengthen microprudential regulation; development macroprudential regulation; stepping-up international coordination. these new regulation provide scenario great security financial sector. if learn anything recent year always risk another crisis. but i believe good prepared. the new regulation impose great capital 6/7 requirement financial institution strict supervision, include new instrument early identification financial risks. the main challenge regulatory policy fully implement reform approve closely monitor impact financial sector, and, appropriate, calibrate new regulatory framework. along general challenge, i would highlight two element bear regulatory policy management. firstly, interrelatedness monetary macroprudential policy. generally, policy complementary. but, year expansion prior financial crisis demonstrated, economy’s cyclical position accumulation financial risk may become decoupled. financial imbalance thus build up, yet inflation contain real economy appear show sign overheating. central bank policy strike balance order achieve dual objective economic financial stability. here important institutional structure ensure synergy consistency monetary prudential policies. the second condition factor fact globalise financial market reality, require permanent international coordination effort management financial policies. coordination need tackle contagion across different market jurisdiction and, also, prevent regulation distort mean regulatory arbitrage, competitive low regulatory standard across jurisdictions. forum financial stability board, basel committee european single supervisory resolution mechanism gain importance. a third pillar, european deposit insurance scheme, still define remain subject political negotiations. the challenge financial technological innovation finally, i shall refer challenge pose financial technological innovation. since year 2000 witness proliferation technological change re-shaping global economy. this start internet, incipient turn century, follow electronic trade, mobile phones, artificial intelligence big data. technology introduce new type service products, challenge traditional commercial model economic sectors. in case financial system, considerable scope improve efficiency quality service application new technological processes. we see new technology incorporate traditional functions, instance payment made, automate management risk price financial consultancy. the financial sector adapt new reality. traditional bank take new technology board, occasionally strategic alliance new technology firms. new company also incorporate sector, range small start-ups large firms. the new firm must, however, win confidence consumer investors, 7/7 something traditional financial institution secure long period time, anchor strong regulation financial supervision. from standpoint regulators, fintech challenge affect prudential consumer protection policies. from prudential perspective, regulator must strike balance catalyse innovation efficiency new technology provide, maintain sound regulatory framework. the guide principle apply regulation type financial services. in respect, presence fintech increases, might useful put great emphasis regulation services, instead place institution provide services. turn consumer protection policies, vital investor consumer understand new service function attendant risks, including, example, credit, cyber-security privacy-protection risks. here strengthen information financial education policies. we mindful banco de españa need step effort area. indeed, last week approve reform whereby, directorate general operations, market payment systems, new associate directorate general financial innovation market infrastructure create assume competency areas, centralise new structure function previously assign different unit bank. this associate directorate general face two family problems. first, question arise emergence new agent new operator financial markets, provide service already exist (but different way), service exist, namely new type financial services. a regard new market players, two group problem posed: one hand, refer matter competencies, i.e. agent operator subject demand regulations; other, investor consumer protect alert new risks, respect former operator products. the second family matter new associate directorate general banco de españa must face concern new technology application financial markets, something which, time continuous innovation, obviously great importance. thank attention. urjit r patel: bank regulatory power ownershipneutralinaugural lecture dr urjit r patel, governor reserve bank india,

fraud.temptation engage fraud level employee employee always present, banks(or corporations), public sector private sector. the question whether isadequate deterrence face employee undertake fraud enough incentive formanagement put place preventive measure preempt frauds. in case banks, threepotentially powerful mechanism could induce discipline frauds:1. investigative/vigilance/legal deterrence: criminal investigation fraud andattached penalty serve effective deterrence report investigationare expedient penalty adequately severe relative gain fromfraudulent activity.2. market discipline: fraudulent activity net loss bottom-line; thiscase, bank investor would impose deterrence, e.g., uninsured creditor might “run”on bank induce liquidity problems, shareholder might “exit”, effectivelyraising cost capital induce solvency questions. in anticipation suchdisruptive outcome might cause loss control, management boardmembers may put place governance mechanism prevent reduce

right reasons,a fair bite time. indeed, rbi data bank fraud suggest handful case overthe past five year closure, case substantive economic significance remainopen. a result, overall enforcement mechanism – least – perceive tobe major deterrent fraud relative economic gain fraud.it fair say case private sector banks, real deterrence arise market andregulatory discipline, confluence. a private

problem:“one emerge risk financial sector increase trend fraud commercialbanks financial institutions. during last five financial years, fraud increasedsubstantially volume value terms. during period,

credit loan growth cycles, follow soon withrepayment problems. rather resolve stress credit problem swiftly, banks–eitherthrough loan-level “fudges” refusal recognise true asset quality credit – haveallowed promoter charge enterprise soft landing. this soft land hascomprised even bank lend keep account artificially full repayment onpast dues, protract control promoter fail assets, effectively grant theability divert cash assets, often outside jurisdictional reach.the rbi clamp failure recognise asset quality non-performing asper norm require banks, whose “divergence” exceed 15% true non-performing asset per norms, disclose divergence. this restore marketdiscipline practices, especially case private sector banks. however,ultimately also need framework place time-bound resolution underlyingstress asset limit discretion bank delay recognition stress, ever-green“zombie” living-dead borrowers, poorly allocate credit.to end, i wish present clarify rationale behind rbi’s revise framework promptrecognition resolution stress assets. the framework release last monthremains somewhat under-appreciated term importance. so let lay out.prompt recognition resolution stress asset – revise framework1. the bank regulation (amendment) act, 2017, subsequent authorisation give bythe government india therein, empower reserve bank issue direction thebanks resolution stress assets, include refer asset insolvency andbankruptcy code 2016 (ibc). the reserve bank take step last year thisdirection, focus reference ibc certain large value stress accounts,covering approximately 40% bank sector’s overall exposure stress assets. 5 / 8bis central bankers' speech 2. the revise framework resolution stress asset release reserve bank onfebruary 12, 2018 step towards take initial step natural conclusion andlaying steady-state approach. the steady-state approach aim ensure earlyresolution stress asset transparent time-bound manner maximumvalue could realise lender also recognise potential ongoing concernvalue stress assets. a explain below, approach positive step towardsstrengthening credit culture economy, borrower banks.3. various special scheme resolution, introduce rbi pre-ibccontext, make resolution process drive asset-classification consideration oflenders. in particular, forbearance embed scheme make easierfor bank resolve asset become end little resolution achieve throughdeployment schemes.4. the revise framework substitute pre-ibc scheme away withforbearance since delay resolution. the framework rely instead biggeststructural reform credit system country several decades, viz., ibc, animportant part resolution. by employ ibc lynchpin, framework intendedrightly ensure resolution plan stress asset dictate also, fact,primarily, asset viability considerations.5. it must stress revise framework would allow lender absolute flexibility putin place credible resolution plan, pre-ibc schemes, subject meetingcertain implementation condition (the condition necessary alleviate concernsrelating ever-greening unviable assets).6. in particular, respect account aggregate exposure great rs. 2,000 crores,the resolution plan would require implement within 180 day date ofdefault, fail would refer ibc. this threshold would broughtdown gradually period two year enable ibc infrastructure install inparallel require capacity handle cases. it must emphasise ibc isa resolution framework, whereby account sufficient time (180 day thedate default plus 270 day ibc) effective resolution.7. it must also underscore revise framework:change ownership

borrower over-borrow andinstead manage good various business risk might lead default.there also great incentive lender implement efficient turnaroundplan get quick upgrade case restructuring. further since noforbearance asset classify npas, revise framework encouragebanks reduce slippage npa early recognition stress timelyaction, possibly even borrower get financial difficulty.in words, ibc along rbi’s revise framework help break promoter-bank nexus lead crony capitalism attendant npa/credit misallocationproblem ever-greening suit borrower lender earlierframework. in turn, prevent erosion

program, get thisyear’s work done.those hope join workforce may feel excitement nervousnessabout uncertain future. at least macroeconomic situation face positive one. theeconomy create 283,000 job past 12 months, unemployment rate aslow 40 years.however, may still leave wonder future. we hear story peoplestruggling get foot door, overqualified underemployed, thechallenges build stable career “gig economy.” meanwhile, automation anddigitalization disrupt entire industry threaten make job obsolete.given backdrop, i use time today talk canada’s labour market—why thecentral bank pay close attention it, role monetary policy play itsperformance. i also take risk speculate little lie ahead you—onthe future work.labour, economic supply potential outputlet start bank canada—whose central objective target low stableinflation—cares much labour market. simply put, inflation drive bythe balance demand supply economy, labour market heart thatbalance.when demand le supply, inflation tend fall, vice versa. when supply anddemand roughly balance, inflation tend stabilize around level people’sinflation expectation lie—in canada’s case, target 2 per cent annual inflation.to maintain balance, central bank need understand element make upsupply demand. at top list supply labour. the people available work,and productive are, great contribution labour make supply. inevery economy, demographic force immigration determine available workforce.a complementary role supply growth play investment. investment spend expand orimproves economy’s capital stock—the machinery equipment available workers, aswell infrastructure roads, port information technology networks. new investmentcan give exist worker update tool raise productivity. or, mean expansionof firm, accompany new job creation. both channel raise economy’spotential output.canada reach phase economic cycle investment usually take asthe lead engine growth capacity-building process become central. i think 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech phase cycle “sweet spot,” rise demand actually drive creation newsupply. with many company operate near capacity limits, grow sale furthermeans increase investment, lead creation new job increase aggregatesupply. obviously, phase worth nurturing.by far potent form business investment creation brand new companies.new firm apply late technology novel ways, sometimes create completely newindustries. a successful new firm exploit new technologies, grow rapidly. theirsales growth chart sometimes look like hockey stick, leave side eiffel tower.you imagine creation numerous new company might affect overallperformance economy. each firm see hockey-stick growth add disproportionately tothe overall productivity economy. indeed, historically, large share economy’s gainsin productivity new job creation come young companies.this period slow productivity growth usually associate slow rate newcompany formation. we are—at long last—finally see encourage sign data.this follow long lacklustre stretch wake global financial crisis periodof high oil price exceptional canadian dollar strength 2010 2013.importantly, process rapid growth generate high income people spend everysector economy, benefit everyone. however, newly create economic growth isdisruptive, sometimes destroy exist company job along way. this may soundlike today’s issue, characteristic economic growth time. it aptlydescribed long time ago joseph schumpeter “creative destruction.” i say aboutthis process minutes.however, none highly desirable economic growth happen unless peopleavailable fill newly create jobs. accordingly, healthy, well-functioning labour market iscritical, particularly stage business cycle. there many way measure labour market health. we start unemployment ratebecause intuitive commonly report indicator. it also low beensince 1976 statistic canada start track way, good.but unemployment rate tell whole story. to illustrate, imagine someone whosecompany close back 2010 give look work month year ofunemployment. this person long participate labour market countedas unemployed. but could still pull back workforce right opportunitycame along represent potential source new supply.furthermore, analysis labour market complete without consider impact ofdemographics, specifically, impact baby boom generation. the first baby boomersbegan enter labour market early 1960s fuel labour force economicgrowth next 50 years. this demographic support fading. immigration helpprovide important offset, also everything develop untappedsources labour supply within exist population.breaking numbersafter look much wide range labour market indicators, bank conclude thatthere remain degree untapped supply potential economy. this important, itmeans canada may able economic growth, large economy, andtherefore income per person, without generate high inflation. so, let turn deeperanalysis issue. 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech young people represent one source untapped potential. yes, unemployment rate forpeople 15 24 age group decline around 11 per cent. however, youth notparticipating workforce much 10 year ago.traditionally, labour force participation rate decline recession rebound duringperiods economic growth. but population group see participationrates recover great recession, yet occur young canadians.some argue concern, reflect increasingly popularchoice remain school get education. in case true, i certainly agree.school enrolment increase last decade. however, full story complex.for one thing, many student historically choose work go school sametime. i sure many student room part-time job, earnmoney also gain valuable work experience. i know i did. however, current participationrates student groups—males females, 15 19 year old 20 24 year old—areall pre-crisis levels. further, young people school high labourforce participation rate student do, rate low thecrisis.because drop youth participation coincide crisis great recession, i cannotbelieve everything see today simply represent people choose stay theworkforce. clearly, good part decline tie economic cycle, shortage ofopportunities. other forces, include demographics, may act well.the key point youth represent important untapped source potential economic growth.if youth participation rate return close level crisis, 100,000additional young canadian would jobs.an even significant source economic potential high labour force participation bywomen. while 91 per cent prime-age men participate labour force, rate forwomen 83 per cent.history suggest gap narrow. consider quebec, where, 20 year ago, prime-age female participation rate 74 per cent. the provincial government identify barrierskeeping woman workforce act reduce them, particularly low costof child care extend parental leave provisions. within years, proportionately moreprime-age quebec woman job woman rest canada. today, quebec’s prime-age female participation rate 87 per cent.if could simply bring participation rate prime-age woman rest canada thelevel quebec, could add almost 300,000 people country’s workforce. the recentfederal budget introduce new measure direction.there’s more. employment rate among indigenous peoples—one young demographicgroups canada—remain well rest country. and, senior deputygovernor carolyn wilkins point speech last month, technological advance arebreaking barrier keep million canadian live withdisabilities workforce.finally, much could do speed integration workforce grow numberof recent immigrants. this would allow important contribution workforce increasemore rapidly time.put together, much stretch imagine canada’s labour force couldexpand another half million workers. to put think experiment perspective, 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech could increase canada’s potential output much 1.5 per cent, $30 billion peryear. that’s equal permanent increase output almost $1,000 per canadian every year,even factor possible investment productivity gain would come withsuch increase labour supply. clearly, prize worth pursuing.the role monetary policythe central bank role implement specific policy aim break barrier tolabour force participation. however, mean role play all. the bankcan certainly use monetary policy help bring stronger, good function economywhile still pursue inflation-targeting goal. this particularly important current phaseof economic cycle, demand prompt investment pull people theworkforce.statistics canada data show job vacancy rise quickly, reach record470,000 last autumn. and hear business leader many vacancy aregoing unfilled cannot find worker right skills. to company lookingfor many skilled worker surely sign strong economy. it show need moretargeted education, well on-the-job train program employer tailor fill aspecific need.but another important way fill job vacancy process economist call labour marketchurn. basically, churn describe way people switch job good match skill andexperience. churn fall sharply recessions, people le likely take achance new opportunity company incline hold onto skilled workers.however, period strong growth rise wages, often see people alreadyemployed become will leave current position switch higher-paying job.when one person take step, leaf open need filled. a period ofjob switch follows, people move good employment. ultimately, people havebeen outside labour force see opportunity draw back in.of course, never perfect match worker jobs. the regional nature ofour economy mean perfect job match person’s skill experience might bethousands kilometre away. further, still many barrier prevent worker inone province move job another province.labour market churn highly complex process difficult predict. so creation ofnew economic supply investment prompt strong demand new firm creation. butit clear likely significant economic benefit associate allowingthe economy find way higher, productive economic equilibrium, happenwithin inflation-targeting regime. we cannot know advance far capacity-buildingprocess go, obligation allow occur.this bank careful explain cannot take mechanical approach topolicy context, even though believe interest rate likely move high overtime. in fact, describe risk-management process. if economy build moresupply usual, put downside risk inflation; less, create upside risk toinflation, job balance risks.of course, issue watch closely. my colleague, deputygovernor tim lane, list many progress report speech last week. the issuesinclude heighten uncertainty future u trade policies, change inflation dynamics,wage behaviour impact interest rate economy, give high level householddebt. in situation, remain cautious consider future policy adjustment anddependent incoming data guide assessments. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech the future workso far, i talk untapped potential today’s economy. let say afew word future work, theory history suggest may store.we start call fourth industrial revolution. the integration ofdigital technology virtually every part life get started. like revolution inhuman history, expect cause significant dislocations. and like economicprogress since begin time, involve creative destruction.the first industrial revolution saw introduction steam engine lead first factoriesand urbanization. this spawn luddite movement—textile worker fight thetechnology threaten livelihood.in second industrial revolution, electricity internal combustion engine change theway good could move around globe. country begin specialize more, internationaltrade become key connect supply demand.in third industrial revolution, advance compute power communication technologyled breakthrough way information could stored, process transmitted. theassociated advance global logistics enable even great specialization production—thedevelopment global supply chains—making world even dependent trade toconnect supply demand.importantly, revolution cause hardship people industry disrupted.yet, enormous gain productivity advance new technology spawn formthe basis modern economy.whenever groundbreaking technology arrives, predictable pattern follows. the technologydisrupts exist industries, lead job losses. government can, do, placesafety-net policy cushion blow people directly affected. and, i mention before,new company exploit technology create new type job entirely newindustries. the hockey-stick growth productivity gain help boost income, flowsthroughout entire economy. this turn increase demand every sector economy,creating new job opportunity raise live standards.let give example canada’s history. at confederation, 151 year ago, half ofworking canadian employ agriculture one form another. a new technologiesdisrupted farming, few people need farm, yet farm output continue expand.the technology create new opportunity move cities. by 1920s,only one-third canadian still involve agriculture. by 1950s, figure downto 15 per cent and, today, le 2 per cent. and, yet, agricultural output thantripled past century.here start fourth industrial revolution, new application create job wereunimaginable year ago. when u kids, dream wewould create 3-d printer, 3-d print invent yet. ten year ago,there smartphone app developers, cloud compute engineer social mediamanagers.it human nature focus negative. so, think autonomous vehicles, forexample, people tend dwell job begin disappear trucker taxi drivers.clearly, government need support people bear brunt technological change.at time, need remember positives—all new job create andthe people need build vehicles, write software, maintain 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech fleet built, redesign construct roads, coordinate traffic on. whatis more, truly creative entrepreneur think new way apply technology, forexample, boost independence productivity many people live disabilities.beyond this, also need remember income-generating effect new jobs. thehigher income generate create demand, new sector also othergoods service throughout economy, include ordinary thing house andhome renovations. this income-generating effect likely one factor behind canada’s strong jobgrowth last year sector manufacture construction—jobs requiredskills far remove require sector economy beingdisrupted.the bottom line this: throughout history, technological advance always lead risingproductivity live standards, always create job destroyed.this understate pain disruption cause individuals—we owe towork hard create pathway forward, participate evolve economy.conclusionit time conclude.the bank canada plenty reason care state labour market. it hasbecome good deal healthy past year so, still see slack remaining.we expect see increase investment—both exist brand new companies—as well aslabour market churn create supply high productivity employment. however,these uncertain process entail upside downside risk inflation, monetarypolicy remain particularly data-dependent balance risks.of course, watch issue state labour market evolution ofsupply. yet, even unknowns, good reason optimistic canadianeconomy. these excite times. new opportunities, new technology new industry areall wait right around corner. the student today one shape thefuture, tool develop imagination ingenuity. i cannot wait see howit turn out.i would like thank russell barnett help speech. 6 / 6bis central bankers' speech salvatore rossi: which new frontier banking?speaking note mr salvatore

profitability, much rules. the current weakness inbank profitability, particularly europe, depend macroeconomic cyclical factors,which unfavorable past years, also new requirement term capitaland liquidity, regulators’ response excessive risk-taking pre-crisis era.i don’t think bank sector could ever back double-digit return past 20years. it may rather converge “new normal” low-

know much collective effort was. many today work hard institution comply new rule shore risk management. we accomplish lot. but, let’s face it, job still done. winston churchill said, “all men make mistakes, wise men learn mistakes.” so, wise conference like one, continue reflect go wrong. that i please here; i would like thank organizer invitation. the expert speak give u insight genesis crisis subsequent lessons. my intention push conversation forward spark discussion three area i believe unfinished business: 1. understand role monetary policy financial stability—if one thing learn since turn century, price stability guarantee financial stability. 2. keep policy current risk system evolve—leverage liquidity important usual suspects, tricky part may understand risk stem interconnectedness ecosystem change rapidly. 3. be ready thing go wrong—being well prepare help keep financial damage minimum, especially people take risk first place. central banks, along authority financial system participants, strong role play areas. monetary policy cannot let start role monetary policy financial stability. monetary stability—low, stable predictable inflation—is heart solid

regulatory safeguard global macroeconomic imbalances. that said, crisis make clear economist previously suspected: price stability alone enough ensure financial stability could, circumstances, contribute buildup financial vulnerabilities.6 central banker course already aware vulnerability could build via traditional channel monetary policy work asset price credit markets. but learn hard way another channel—the risk-taking channel—could powerful amplification mechanism. in fact, evident low interest rate encourage people borrow also make risky investment get good returns.7 hindsight

shifting. we learn crisis that, trouble complex brew, financial innovation usually key ingredient. financial innovation slow since crisis. it often help improve financial system, yet also carry risks. that’s risk management need become nimble. a couple area worry right now, need concert attention. both relate interconnectedness trust system. my first concern one i know share many relation activities: cyber risk. in fact, recent survey conduct risk.net find disruption information technology lead list top 10 operational risk 2018.16 when come cyber risk, many operational risks, connected. now, new technologies, cloud computing, may safe legacy systems. yet cyber risk heighten way increase number point access core part financial system grow sophistication launch cyber

system ccps, work contain respond cyber risks. the system underpin financial transaction economy highly interconnected, cyber attack one could quickly propagate cause major disruptions.17 the cost might stop there. household business typically think system operate smoothly behind scenes. however, trust core system could undermine participant felt information asset vulnerable. that work payment canada six large canadian bank reduce chance serious cyber event, mitigate impact recover quickly event materialize. my second area concern relate rapid pace financial innovation. such innovation bring low cost increase range investment strategies. exchange-traded products, example, offer investor relatively easy access illiquid, complex strategies. the issue strategy rely derivative 15

line need sharpen focus consumer investor protection, market integrity. these foundational element sound financial system support trust. plan thing go wrong the last area i want highlight readiness: need prepare thing go wrong. it impossible rid risks, undesirable well. a modern economy advance people work hard will stick neck out. that mean risk materialize. that said, system able withstand

executive board european central bank, tothe schweizerisch-deutscher wirtschaftsclub, frankfurt main, 19 march 2018.* * *the euro area economy recover even fast expected. many people hopingtherefore monetary policy soon become “more normal”.in context, procedure exit purchase programme link aprecondition: inflation move line objective sustainable way. we havebecome confident inflation right track. so it’s question time wereach goal. however, move direction still need expansionary monetarypolicy.but mean specific monetary policy measure remain completelyunchanged. the gradual exit purchase programme confront us, however, withcertain problems: one hand, abrupt end could lead excessive market reactions.on hand, effectiveness purchase programme decline time; sideeffects increasing. to mitigate risks, need credible exit scenario.background adjustment purchase programmefirst, let u look back adjustment purchase programme. in october last year, thegoverning council decide reduce purchases. on 8 march year, councilconfirmed net purchases, currently amount €30 billion per month, madeuntil end september 2018. if necessary, purchase extend beyond untilthe govern council see sustainable correction inflation line definition pricestability medium term.the purchase programme adjust expect high price pressure basedon euro area’s strong broad-based economic growth. it economy growncontinuously 18 quarters, relevant indicator point continue strong growth.according projection make ecb experts, economy expect grow evenslightly fast short term previously expected. annual real gdp increase 2.4%in 2018, 1.9% 2019 1.7% 2020. compare december 2017 projections,the prospect real gdp growth 2018 revise upwards; outlook twoyears thereafter remain unchanged.overall, risk growth prospect euro area regard balance.there global factor could cast shadow strong growth outlook.first, new trade measure announce u administration. ecb estimate indicate thatthe first-round effect propose measure euro area likely slight, even inthe event retaliation u trade partners. the after-effects however could stronger.second, development foreign exchange financial markets. in respect, iwould like point though recent volatility stock market little impact onother asset class euro area.the strong economic growth also impact labour market. the increase inemployment since mid-2013 – almost 7.5 million job – offset total number job lostoverall crisis. the unemployment gap – measure labour market overcapacity –now seem close , although revise downwards, employment 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech euro area high ever been.in short, monetary policy successfully boost demand return slack resourcesback productive use. in view this, path inflation should, medium term,approach inflation objective below, close to, 2%. and inflation acceletating, albeitmore slowly would like, clearly expect october, decide toscale back purchases. the increase trust inflation right path alsoinfluence reaction future.two additional factor play essential role here: first decline impact ofour net purchase time. the hold become steadily important thegrowth. the second factor relate link output inflation.in past, highly expansionary policy need counter economic downturn toensure inflation remain consistent definition price stability. headwind reducedthe effectiveness monetary policy resisted.for example, deleveraging cause great inclination save, general uncertaintydampened investment long period low inflation threaten de-anchor inflationexpectations. in addition, deflation real risk.these negative factor ease ongoing recovery. deflation fear beendispelled. and assumption that, circumstances, policy unchangedmonetary policy unduly expansionary.in addition, there’s fact effect asset hold balance sheet becomegreater time: size portfolio grows, additional effect givenpurchase volume. a asset hold high, become much le widely hold thanat start purchase programme. in way, relative share purchase themarket thus effect purchase billion euro spend go up. in otherwords, small purchase volume today effect high purchase volume inthe past.as asset hold go up, need reinvest, toincrease gross purchase – i.e. net purchase addition reinvestments. and thisis happen environment reduce new borrow euro area countries.even low volume net purchases, eurosystem retain significant marketpresence. it calculate around €167 billion cumulative repayment madebetween march 2018 february 2019.for reasons, need adjust monetary policy stance. we position toadapt monetary policy strengthen upturn future, without seriously harminggrowth inflation. and long recovery continues, le economy depend onspecial monetary policy measures.the second factor behind decision is: quickly strong demand impact inthe form rise prices?the euro area mean advance economy robust output growth andinflation rate historical levels. it would much cover various attemptsmade economist explain this. frankly, i find none particularly convincing. however,i believe factor keep u fulfil task medium term. wemight need bite long reach goal, reach it.let briefly mention theoretical explanation. the relationship slack inflation, thephillips curve, become flat change output hardly effect inflation. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech there various reason this. long period low inflation keep wage increasesdown, wage link inflation certain extent. in addition, job insecurity, digitalisationand high unemployment lead trade union prioritise employment wages. and thecrisis lead slack labour market – i.e. involuntary part-time temporary work– absorb wage pressure increase.in practice, see positive signs: fact, difference overallunemployment rate broad measure slack labour market decline somewhatover past two years. the proportion enterprise manufacture service saythat labour shortage limit output never high. the result strongerwage growth, contribute increase inflation. several measure underlyinginflation apparently pass turn point.i say word “apparently” monetary policymakers cautious judgements.the estimate slack economy differ widely often corrected. model results, ascomplex may be, treat requisite caution. in end, assessmentsbased experience continue essential part monetary policy decision-making.monetary policy decision therefore base model results, alsotake account balance risks. there time lack action much moredangerous take action resolute action reasonable thing do. forexample, purchase programme necessary avert risk deflation. however, thereare also time balance risk change fundamentally thus monetarypolicymakers act carefully.future challenge face monetary policyso let’s turn attention future. i believe condition gradually end theasset purchase programme place. however, ecb’s govern council todecide exact time move.i’m go talk possible time today. let instead touch riskswe face implement monetary policy come years. these risk likely togrow long asset purchase programme continues.the first risk relate subside deflationary headwind i already mentioned. could itbe monetary policy suddenly expansive? in short, uncertainty andimprecisions involve measure slack inflationary pressure, might find ourselvesbehind curve without realise it. a result long variable lag monetary policy,we could end inflation rate consistent mandate.this would require sharp correction monetary policy stance year come. yet acorrection interest rate would pose risk financial sector. bank could hit hard asfunding cost rise fast interest income outstanding loans.but may also case impact factor already felt, inflationcould turn high expect course year. we would find behindthe curve – realise – would adjust forward guidance.this forward guidance put place stabilise market expectation enhance theeffectiveness asset purchases. we indicate interest rate rise onlywhen well past horizon asset purchases. prolong asset purchase push outmarket expectation rate rise push interest rate expectation across entirecurve. of course, effectiveness forward guidance also rely credibility.1 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech in effect, forward guidance promise react short-term data outturn future soas persuade market expect interest rate remain low. but offer guidance thatextends far future, risk unduly tie hands.this particular risk present since, i mention earlier, future increase interest ratesneed gradual. move late could result policy remain loose long. the timewill come year make gradual adjustment monetary policy stance line withour confidence achieve objective; market expectation appropriate regard. weshould certainly reflect length degree wish pre-commit ourselves.the second risk monetary policy relate side effect low interest rates. ourmeasures considerably improve finance condition household firms, haveunblocked flow credit.yet easy finance condition may encourage investment project profitable atlow interest rates, loan risk turn sour interest rate rise. indeed, bank andinvestors may tempt “search yield”, without adequately recompense therisk take on.our mandate deliver price stability. ensure financial stability risk adequatelycontained role bank supervision macroprudential policy. while noevidence present asset price bubble euro area, notable localisedpockets, commercial real estate, sign “search yield” behaviour.the financial crisis show risk interfere smooth operation monetarypolicy effect banks, remain key part monetary policytransmission mechanism euro area. we therefore bear mind risksmay make hard u implement monetary policy.there also longer-term risk monetary policy. through low interest rates, monetary policymay indirectly permit inefficient firm remain business, may become so-calledzombie firms. this blunt productivity-enhancing function downturn bring about“creative destruction”, whereby inefficient firm force business, free resourcesto move efficient firm boost aggregate productivity. indeed, evidencethat creative destruction weak recession previous downturn thatzombie firm weigh productivity growth euro area countries.productivity growth play important role conduct monetary policy. high productivitygrowth spur investment, expectation high future income encourage consumer tospend today. thus slow productivity growth require monetary policy low interestrates would otherwise necessary stimulate economy. give interestrates currently low, stock purchase considerable, would restrict abilityto respond future downward risks.i explain economic risk are. but also legal risk ecbregarding treaty obligations. article 127 require “act accordance principleof open market economy … favour efficient allocation resources”. in words, weshould much necessary fulfil price stability mandate. and beaware potential side effect run expansive policy long.an important principle open market economy price formation market theinteraction private sector agents. it interaction ensure correct pricing,and interaction take place result asset purchases. and also appliesto credit risk.of course, large stock asset holds, eurosystem become big player the23 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech market, big ever before. we sometimes buy bond institutional investors, aspension fund insurance companies, could push price need pay giventhe grow scarcity. we avoid situation whereby liquidity condition certain marketsegments unnecessarily make challenge unwarranted extension thepurchase programme.so mindful exert undue influence price formation.another potential complication relate public sector purchases. a key safeguard wehave set purchase operate so-called “blackout periods”, buyaround date new issuance. this facilitate price formation ensure article 123 ofthe treaty – monetary finance prohibition – fully respected.conclusionthe economic recovery euro area good expect employment hasrisen strongly. both wage underlie inflation appear turn corner.all condition place sustain adjustment inflation towards aim. so it’s justa question time now. more haste, le speed, however.the improve inflation trajectory mean gradually scale back net purchase andkeep monetary policy sufficiently accommodative continue support convergence ofinflation towards aim.we continue monitor development economy set policy way remainsconsistent price stability objective.in so, must also take account balance risks.if withdraw monetary policy stimulus early fast, asset price could collapseand yield rise sharply, negative spillover effect economy.if asset purchase programme continue long, side effect increase. and wenourish market belief exit might permanently postponed, potential cliff-edge effectscould exacerbated.we pursue credible prospect exit keep risk contained. see mersch y., “economic policy need humility”, speech conference “banking financialregulation”, bocconi university, 9 october 2017.bartelsman e.,

dismiss them. their core technology already impact. bring crypto-assets regulatory tent could potentially catalyse innovation serve public better. indeed, crypto-assets help point way future money three respects: - by suggest money payment need adjust meet societies’ change preferences, particularly decentralise peer-to-peer interactions; - through possibility underlie technology offer transform efficiency, reliability flexibility payments; - by question raise whether central bank provide central bank digital currency (cbdc) accessible all. 27 in eu, revision 4th aml directive bring

networks.28 people increasingly form connection directly, instantaneously openly, revolutionise consume, work, communicate. yet financial system continue arrange around series hub speak like bank payments, clear settlement systems. crypto-assets attempt create financial architecture peer-to-peer transactions. even current generation answer, throw gauntlet exist payment systems. these must evolve meet demand fully reliable, real-time, distribute transactions. second, technology underlie crypto-assets, particularly distribute ledger, can: - increase efficiency manage data; - improve resilience eliminate central point failure, multiple party share replicate data functionality; - enhance transparency (and auditability) creation instant, permanent immutable record transactions; - expand use straight-through processes, include “smart contracts” receipt new information, automatically update appropriate, pay. these property mean distribute ledger technology could transform everything people manage interaction public agencies, include tax medical records, business manage supply chains. third, crypto-assets raise obvious question whether infrastructure could combine trust

thank much opportunity speak today. it great pleasure able share denmark's experi-ences low interest rates, well view future issue monetary policy. exceptionally easy monetary policy play fundamental role support economic recovery past decade. now, con-tinued robust global upswing expect accompany normalisation interest rates. this development welcome long time coming. but withdrawal monetary stimulus also reveal whether vulnerability accumulate part financial sector. further, show robust economy high finance costs. in following, i focus three key messages: first, i talk global growth. my main point long-awaited global upturn gain strength, growth likely attain pre-crisis levels. second, i discus effect low rate unconventional mon-etary policy. central bank balance sheet expand substantially. in denmark, banks' earn pressure, although im-pact overall profitability limited. and finally, pace time policy normalisation require care-ful calibration. international spillover major central bank inev- 1 march 2018 page 2 9 itable, especially small open economies. the final implementation regulatory reform effective macroprudential policy framework essential contain financial stability risks. 1. long-awaited global upturn gain strength, pre-crisis growth rate likely unattainable slide 2: global economy strengthen after long period disappoint outturns, global growth strength-ening. forecast revise up. strong broad-based global growth increase trade support pri-vate consumption high investments. indicator consumer manufacture sentiment point towards continue cyclical upswing come years. although may tempting, policymakers cannot spend time compla-cently enjoy long-awaited recovery. one reason cyclical upswing exactly … cyclical. continue high growth me-dium-term give potential growth still deem low pre-crisis level many countries. the mantra international institu-tions change accordingly. previously, remind waste good crisis. now, waste good recovery. imple-mentation structural reform rebuild fiscal buff crucial sustain growth prepare next downturn. this espe-cially true, give monetary policy push limit. thus, monetary policy cannot rely upon provide much stimulus, cycle turn sooner expected. a regard structural reforms, progress mixed. in denmark, currently reap benefit past reform increase struc-tural supply labor. this contribute balance upswing, compare boom associate overheat mid-2000s. so, structural initiative unlikely affect cyclical outcome short-term, i certainly agree important sustain re-covery. slide 3: low growth rate expect go forward but also consider whether realistically expect growth rate advance country pre-crisis level again. this unlikely, due demographic change, among things. a recent study dan-marks nationalbank point reduction gdp per caput 0.3 percentage point 2050, due age population. obviously, excuse. continue step increase productivity page 3 9 enhance flexibility labor market important. however, would seem prudent set expectation future growth realistically, adjust fiscal forecast accordingly. 2. low rate unconventional monetary policy support economy slide 4: danish monetary-policy rate closely link ecb rate it ten year since global financial crisis disrupt global economy. look back today, excite decade – excite perhaps – central bank perspective. high public debt level restrain fiscal capacity number coun-tries follow financial economic meltdown. thus, central bank le leave support economic activity. conse-quently, low even negative policy rate become common globally, alongside massive expansion central bank balance sheets. danmark nationalbank central bank pioneer first cut deposit rate zero already 2012. this do offset large capital inflows. a might already know, fix exchange rate policy denmark mean monetary policy rate exclusively re-served maintain peg euro. therefore, key mon-etary policy rate danmark nationalbank tend track ecb closely. in denmark, negative rate year now. so far, implication far le excite radical might expect enter negative territory. basically, negative interest rate continuation low rates, strong pass-through money market rates. however, financial sector adapt new environment. negative interest rate put pressure banks' earn slide 5: household exempt negative deposit rate first all, negative rate challenge danish banks' business models. net interest margin thereby net interest income squeezed. the introduction negative policy rate mean sig-nificant share bank deposit danmark nationalbank currently remunerate rate -0.65 per cent. while lend rate mirror fall monetary policy rates, bank reluctant page 4 9 introduce negative deposit rate household deposits. this likely re-flects concern reputational risks. in contrast, negative rate widely introduce corporate deposits. the spread short term long term interest rate also im-portant banks’ maturity transformation business. the ecb’s large scale asset purchase work reduce spread long term short term interest rates. this make effort le profit-able banks. these decline margin low banks' net interest income signifi-cantly. the large bank far able compensate ex-panding new business areas, wealth management, adjust fees. small bank typically rely heavily deposit funding. for them, adjustment much difficult. on positive side, negative interest rate contribute fa-vourable macroeconomic climate drive loan impairment charge minimum. the effect low impairment charge one main explanation record-high result book large danish bank recent years. these result achieve despite pres-sure fall interest margins. increase resilience bank low expect return equity slide 6: more resilience low interest rate: require return bank equity low with strengthen profit recent years, danish bank clearly put financial crisis behind them. equally important, financial sector much robust prior crisis. the financial crisis reveal many financial institution insuffi-ciently capitalised. a result, resilient loss incur wake crisis subsequent market cor-rection. this inability absorb loss exacerbate economic down-turn. since then, much do increase resilience fi-nancial system, internationally denmark. for example, capital requirement enhanced, solvency danish financial institution improve considerably. this contribute robust financial system whole. expect return likely low pre-crisis level effect high capitalisation increase resilience banks. especially low interest rate environment, perception return equity double-digit misguided. and set target return page 5 9 high level may trigger bank take far much risk create new vulnerability future. it may take time investor adjust expectations. they need take account risk em-bedded banks' share decline increase capitalisation bank become safe investment. central bank balance sheet expand markedly slide 7: expand central bank balance sheet with interest rate close effective low bind ever before, central bank resort new approach achieve ne-cessary monetary accommodation. these approach include unconven-tional measure target lend operations, asset purchase forward guidance. consequently, several central bank advance economy experi-enced pronounce balance sheet expansions. this clear evidence monetary policy play key role last decade crisis management global economy. usually, variation balance sheet danmark nationalbank reflect change foreign-exchange reserves. and probably know, denmark experience massive inflow currency shortly swiss central bank's decision abandon floor swiss franc euro. over follow weeks, saw unusual turbulence danish foreign-exchange market. so response, use usual measure defend peg. we intervene heavily fx market buy euro sell danish krone meet elevate demand. in addition, monetary policy rate significantly reduced. the sizeable intervention cause sharp increase fx reserve almost 15 per cent gdp le two months. a pressure abated, level fx reserve gradually reverse course 2015 reach level 20 per cent gdp – close current level. we specific target foreign exchange reserves, remain sufficient support peg. for example, due financial turmoil 2008, danmark nationalbank decide increase size foreign-exchange reserve order signal commitment fixed-exchange-rate policy. rise asset valuation light easy financial condition let move effect exceptionally supportive monetary policy financial markets. in current environment easy financial conditions, asset valuation leverage risen. asset price in- page 6 9 crease may reflect improve macroeconomic prospects, also search yield. this compress spread high-yield debt re-duced risk premia. slide 8: rise house price european city in denmark, especially focus risk associate house price developments. a number european country experience hous-ing bubble year prior financial crisis, include denmark. in post-crisis period low rates, real estate price increase rapidly many country – china canada australia nordics. in countries, real house price around large city rise most. to extent, reflect various structural factors, ur-banisation, rise incomes, supply constraint cities. but could also indication financial recklessness. in denmark, thus pay close attention house price copenhagen. these price begin bear resemblance level reach bubble mid-2000s. however, take account fundamental factors, mortgage rates, income levels, house stock, clear sign speculative bubble – least yet. in general, house price assess relative income levels. this chart show house price several large european cities, relative gdp per capita. here, copenhagen currently outlier. elevate price level wide-spread issue european cities, re-cently see correction stockholm oslo. price development carefully monitor appropriately address pre-emptively through, example, macroprudential measures. in denmark, take steps, require high financial robustness buyer major cities. for sure, house affordability also major social issue tackled, largely beyond remit central bankers. 3. normalisation monetary policy entail risk time normalisation require careful calibration now, i would like turn perspective towards future. it evident still whole range challenge need address. go forward, key stability challenge central bank man-age balance exit strategy easy monetary policy. a output gap close unemployment decrease u euro area, normalisation expect proceed gradually. synchronisation page 7 9 economic development critical. misstep likely follow abrupt asset price adjustment financial market disruption. op-positely, normalisation phase excessively prolonged, build-up vulnerability financial system may exacerbated. either way, normalisation entail risks. steady well-communicated policy tighten-ing important manage market expectations. in regard, important follow development government bond markets. the recent correction equity market accompany surge imply volatility. the increase imply volatility long-term german government bond period modest, remain well average level past ten years. finally, normalisation monetary policy could complicate con-tinued subdue inflation. recent high inflation euro area seem mainly drive energy prices, core inflation remain low. the possible flatten phillips curve receive lot attention lately. in denmark, nominal wage growth remain modest, despite capacity pressure increase labour shortage sectors. however, real wage growth historical average since begin 2015. international spillover major central bank inevitable, especially small open economy a federal reserve ecb initiate balance sheet normalisation rate hikes, effect transmit economy be-cause high integration global financial markets. this news you. both stability turbulence financial market increasingly synchronise across region continents. this so, even monetary policy cycle economic recovery differ timing. international spill-overs balance sheet normalisation thus inevitable underestimated, past experience guide. obviously, danish exchange-rate peg maintain be-cause will implement monetary policy stance euro area. this precondition world international capital mobility. a strong spillover ecb's monetary policy danish fi-nancial condition therefore expected. a recent study1 danmark nationalbank show ecb's asset- purchase programme clear spillover effect danish bond mar- 1 see jakob roager jensen, jakob guldbæk mikkelsen morten spange, the ecb's unconventional monetary policy role exchange rate regime cross-country spillovers, danmark nationalbank work paper, no. 119, august 2017. page 8 9 kets. since begin ecb's qe-programme, reaction danish sovereign bond much line german bonds. this case even though official bond purchase take place denmark. therefore, also prepare opposite effect ecb start roll back unconventional measures. in general, small open economy highly influence global mon-etary policy factors. and confirm lead researcher apply country fix well float exchange rates. therefore, might say small open economy large de-gree import financial condition set large economies. spillover best mitigate robust economic policies. here, important country live so-called ohio principle, keep-ing house order. furthermore, continue international co-operation crucial. i would like conclude intervention today detail comment regard specific area cross-border harmonisation vital, namely financial regulation. new regulatory framework essential financial stability slide 9: a new foundation financial regulation solid capital adequacy important component new post-crisis regulatory framework. this framework still implementation phase, internationally denmark. in view, regulatory frame-work, eu base single rulebook, rest three pil-lars. these pillar address capital, liquidity resolution. a already emphasised, mean first, ensure solid, true fair capital ad-equacy position base actual risk exposure banks. second, need requirement ensure healthy liquidity management stable financing, include recent basel reforms. last least, need credible resolution regime. in european case, need strict imple-mentation eu directive bank recovery resolution. this include set minimum requirement fund eligible liabil-ities use resolution bank troubles. it also include formulate credible resolution plan credit institutions. this get incentive right. no credit institution “too big fail”. these well-known area progress since crisis, still way go new harmonise regulatory framework fully place. there indeed still bump road. at current juncture, memory last financial crisis seem fading, page 9 9 important stay commit implementation new regulation. this reduce likelihood new financial crisis detrimental effect economy. if – ongoing reform implementation new rule adopt basel brussels – end deliver three pil-lars regulation, i think learn lesson crisis well. and measure place, ready take next step: remove unnecessary red tape simplify remain-ing part regulation ease administrative burden banks. the three-pillar system would leave market force keep finan-cial sector check. a long bank perform three parameters, credibility soundness balance sheet business model ensure access necessary capital funding. and resolution regime place, long need government save bank taxpayers’ money. conclusion to conclude, period low interest rate unconventional mon-etary policy fundamental economic recovery. while global economic development indeed strengthening, prepare low growth rate go forward. structural reform lift potential growth rebuild fiscal buff important. low interest rate also leave legacy, affect banks' earnings, cen-tral bank balance sheets, well asset-price valuations. a normalisa-tion monetary policy proceeds, must ready carefully manage risk spillovers. implementation regulatory reform effect-ive macroprudential framework essential contain financial sta-bility risks. thank much attention. danmark

introduction. it pleasure dublin 2018 aima forum."managing fragment world” is, view, well-chosen topic. most economic policymakerscurrently hand full try escape doom loop trade war potentially hardbrexit. at time, banks, investor firm prepare worst-case scenario – least, supervisor urge to.and course fragmentation financial service regulation may cause nightmaresfor many industry well policymakers. and i understand – itimplies great deal uncertainty.but not, i believe, panic: great fragmentation seem inevitable brexit. though,repercussions bad, fear, succeed manage greaterfragmentation constructively – mean without resort nationalism would bedestructive us.my topic today, then, look estimate extent fragmentation regulation financialservices brexit it.2 brexit financial servicesin brexit negotiation common grind still seem hard find. even basic principle newpartnership remain vague. give time preparation run firms,uncertainty among business weigh heavy every day.from economic financial market perspective, two important question probablyare:will free trade comparable agreement?would possible free trade agreement also include financial services?in view, substantial scope general free trade agreement. the main question tome therefore far-reaching future relationship be. for example agreementwithout tariff would high value possible. another, le clear highly complicatedquestion deal non-tariff barrier like product standard regulations.however, view financial service sector, far-reaching free trade agreement israther unlikely give uk’s aspire exit single market custom union.likewise, i rather sceptical approach via mutual recognition similarapproaches base regulatory harmonisation technical committee independentarbitration mechanisms.approaches kind could well undermine ability jurisdiction set rule 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech ability safeguard financial stability.the option remain table “no deal” scenario one quite limit freedomsfor financial services, case ceta. what would scenario mean financialtransactions uk eu?first, “no deal” scenario would mean eu uk would trade rule set bythe world trade organization – service sector thinly covered.service provider would apply comprehensive license jurisdiction andhave necessary element fully function bank ready places.and second, even ceta-like deal would likely mean far-ranging freedom providefinancial service respective foreign jurisdiction.3 live fragmentationtherefore, – like – quite likely see great fragmentation financialregulation supervision europe. what exactly mean is, however, unclear now.it uncertainty exact nature fragmentation post-brexit make hard toassess cost benefit fragmentation.financial firm highlight fragmentation likely mean organisational inefficiency andhigher organisational costs. and doubt least transition new regimeand new organisational structure costly. however, cost may le substantial inthe long term – firm adapt new regime, clever manager find neworganisational solution integrate new compliance reality organisational efficiencies.significant cost may be, politicians, regulators, supervisor nevertheless totake broad perspective, one line change democratic preferences.thus, uk perspective, far-reaching free trade agreement financial service – andservices general – could consider obstacle take back legal regulatory power.at time, eu perspective, cannot accept liberalise common market,without common supervision. otherwise, supervisor, i would concern financialstability. it seem therefore degree fragmentation almost inevitable.but, simply wait end eu-uk financial relations? should simply hope forthe best?of course not. we manage fragmentation constructively – find innovativeapproaches new reality.but let make one thing clear: must result race bottom. fragmentationshould lead competition lax regulation supervision. such policy may seem tobe best national interest, ultimately represent special interest politics. we mustexpose policy really are: threat financial stability.and politicians, firm supervisor deliver three crucial points: first, atransition agreement; second, pragmatic supervisory cooperation; third, managerialinnovation.let take briefly, start transition – implementation phase, isnow called.1 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech 4 the need transition phasea transitional deal uk eu agree yesterday negotiators’ level.during implementation phase, last end 2020, eu rule would continue toapply uk exact term future partnership shall work out. it utmostimportance order give firm time adjust new realities.it furthermore reduce long-term cost brexit. firm weigh option anddecide market want serve organisational design. they nowtime re-arrange organisation basis analytical forward-looking approach,rather approach simply minimise uncertainty. the inefficiency potentiallyhigher cost financial intermediation reduce agreement. i confident side apparently recognise importance transition phasein make brexit le abrupt and, long run, le painful. despite positive news, still early lay back. many issue still discussedand transitional period still fully guaranteed. it remain subject successfulconclusion article 50-deal within next twelve months. for instance, irish question –i.e. keep border republic ireland northern ireland invisible – need tobe resolved. hence, recently widely use phrase “nothing agree everything isagreed” still hold true. 5 manage financial firm fragment worldbut even transition phase, brexit fragmentation would mean two things. first, futureaccess financial service market would like access give third country.second, successful conclusion brexit negotiation guarantee depend onwhether fully-fledged long-term agreement achieve ratified.this i see alternative timely preparation, prepare worst-casescenario hard brexit without free trade agreement.looking banks, proper preparation would include establish least basic entity othereconomic area – is, eu27 uk – order continue business there. theconcept “basic entity” easy define. a far concerned, i repeat wewill certainly accept empty shell letterbox company business effectivelycontinues run london. for critical function management, control andcompliance, qualify personnel need present eu entity times. we expect anybranch subsidiary retain chief responsibility business.and bank begin implement plan submit license application nolater end second quarter 2018. otherwise, difficult prevent acliff

organisational strategies. for example, i convince profitable business modelscan organise two independently license entities.6 manage regulation supervision fragment worldbut don’t get wrong: regulator supervisors, too, pragmatic innovative toachieve goal efficiency, stability, ensure real economy provide credit. 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech with financial sector firm relocate business

supervision dialogue. let begin though highlight i would tell 5 year ago today symposium ”bankenaufsicht im dialog”, would spend half day discuss sustainability, would none believe me, likely many would take sort tree hugger rather central banker. and yet today. it’s clear indication significant shift think occur financial sector supervisory community past years. sustainability become part mainstream finance, evidence many initiative example worldwide, sustainable finance action plan, european commission publish tomorrow, latest. at de nederlandsche bank, central bank supervisor banks, pension fund insurance companies, active issue year now. i imagine though many might wonder active issue year already. what happen there? today, speech ‘from mission supervision’, i want share precisely happened. i firstly share issue get agenda, highlight sustainability relevant central banks, supervisor financial industry. i turn thematic review climate-risks dutch financial sector 2017, lead publically available report, call waterproof. a andreas already explain economy financial sector could impact climate change energy transition, i bore repeat that. instead, i would like share outcome thematic review risk see dutch financial sector. third finally, i say thing mean bank risk management supervision. all hope walk away good understand sustainability affect different organizations. and convince make perfect sense incorporate sustainability day-to-day operations. i. mission: sustainability agenda dnb let begin explain sustainability get onto agenda dnb, thereby also show process issue fit mandate central bank supervisor. you see, long ago, sustainability u mean ensure coffee cup make sustainable paper, coffee cup fair trade. sustainability something certainly think important, something concern core task strategy organization. (and i’m guess organization think like this.) that change 2011 though, newly appoint board dnb conclude probably appropriate time update mission statement. we answer question: existenzberechtigung? it’s something i’m sure many deal well, whether supervisor commercial bank. mind you, happen 2011, live global financial crisis. europe still midst sovereign debt crisis, emergency measure take around

more, relate crisis development i mentioned. hadn’t crisis teach u prosperity create year financial crisis, prove durable long run? put differently, prosperity turn sustainable. because that’s sustainable means: durable long run. and so, walk foggy beach zandvoort, try come new mission statement, fortunately clarity mind add word ‘sustainable’ word ‘prosperity’. our mission central bank supervisor become “to safeguard financial stability thus contribute sustainable prosperity netherlands.” now, course, add word ‘sustainable’ mission, main think relation economic financial crisis. sustainable prosperity meant, example, bank sufficient buff absorb unexpected losses. but soon become clear word sustainable could broad implications. after all, way prosperity create today result significant ecological damage prevent future generation obtain similar high level prosperity, today’s prosperity creation sustainable either. and such, run counter mission. of course, mission start. a i’m sure know, policy determine top need embed throughout organization truly effective. therefore policy become incorporate relevant sustainability consideration core tasks. of course extent sustainability incorporated, depend individual task central bank/supervisor may have. and i’m sure extent sustainability incorporate financial institutions, depend type institution - bank, pension fund insurer - may also differ per institution well. for core tasks, quite practical. in payment system task, example. we probably one central bank world 70% bank note make either fair trade organic cotton, goal 2019 reach 100%. for core tasks, conceptual theoretical. a part economic research advisory function, publish exploratory study call time transition. in it, identify upcoming energy transition, agree upon 190 country paris december 2015, one economy’s key long-term challenges. in report urge government pursue plausible practicable path towards carbon-neutral economy, long-term view enable household business gradually adjust investments, prevent excessive misallocation. and also decide take close look climate risk dutch financial sector part supervisory mandate. ii. risks: thematic review climate risk dutch financial sector which bring second part speech. what risk see supervisor dutch financial sector? in 2017 conduct thematic review issue. in review take deep dive four topics: - climate-related damage insurance industry - risk financial sector potential flood - risk finance carbon intensive assets, call ‘brown finance’ - risk finance asset project mean contribute energy transition, call ‘green finance’. 4 today i want share key find banks, regard risk brown green finance. in term brown finance, one thing want get understand size risks. how big risk energy transition bank sector? a first step, want measure expose financial industry sector need significant reform become carbon neutral. sector fossil fuel producers, utility industry, heavy industry, agriculture transportation. this wasn’t something could easily get supervisory data. which welcome work commission develop taxonomy sustainability financial asset part sustainable finance action plan. for research, however develop template financial sector fill out. we send template three big banks, cover around 70-80% market. what find banks’ balance sheet consist around 11% exposure carbon intensive industries. not surprisingly, exposure loans, make bank le sensitive market fluctuation example pension funds. moreover, loan maturity le five years, provide bank sufficient scope anticipate changes. especially transition gradual nature. in one area however, already see transition risk materializing, that’s real estate sector. the real estate sector play important role carbon emission therefore sensitive energy transition. in eu, many, all, residential commercial real estate energy efficiency labels, range a g, g least energy efficient building. the dutch government announce legislation require almost office netherlands minimum energy efficiency label c 2023. any office doesn’t meet requirement long used. this affect bank two ways. first, loan regular corporations, use office collateral bank loans, second, loan commercial real estate company lease office business model. if office may long used, need upgrade meet requirement, could affect value collateral ability commercial real estate company pay back loans. so big issue banks? unfortunately, neither bank know energy label distribution office use collateral loan regular corporations. for loan commercial real estate companies, bank know roughly 50% loan energy label distribution is. of loan know label distribution, find 46% bank loan commercial real estate company relation offices, energy label low c. this around 6bn worth loans. all loans, one could say, elevate credit risks, banks, one way other, need manage. fortunately, see many bank react swiftly. bank demand new loan refinance exist loan relation office dependent client meet energy-label requirement time. this ensure bank limit exposure office won’t meet deadline time. for us, national legislation prime example energy transition lead risk financial sector. we also look risk green finance, i mentioned. first risk green bubble. history show u many transition accompany boom bust cycle, whether it’s dot-com bubble early 2000s, railway mania late 1900s. whenever there’s increase demand, hype, new market opportunity instruments, there’s risk create new bubble. while still far away green bubble, institution tell u green project become expensive, competition increase institution essentially bid projects. a second risk see green washing. do investor consumer know green is, they’re buy green? there example green bond use make coal plant sustainable. in itself, nothing wrong that, least that’s u say, 5 important purchaser bond aware this. here, too, work european commission sustainable taxonomy well standard green bonds, welcome. lastly, see increase lobby effort low capital requirement stimulate green investments. andreas already touch upon this, i won’t repeat that, wholeheartedly agree: capital requirement remain risk based. we thus quite skeptical expect plan european commission relation prudential requirements, even though also acknowledge risk base nature capital requirements. iii. supervision: implication bank risk management supervision so let end mean bank risk management supervision. the main conclusion banks, include present today, need manage material climate-related risks. and supervisor need supervise this. this course easy say done. if anyone room already know exactly manage climate-related risks, please join u podium minute! two thing important keep mind here. one: incorporate climate risk greatly facilitate government impose clear long term transition legislation, give bank ability steer towards set well-defined goals. this exactly see energy efficiency requirement dutch offices. two, many part economies, unfortunately yet clear legislation allow bank anticipate set well-defined goals. in cases, bank would still well try gauge business model part balance sheet would strongly affect transition type legislation technological change might expect sectors. it would prudent try ass potential loss result. scenario analysis stress test would good tool this. put differently, institution need take forward look approach incorporate climate relate risks. this process fortunately help implement recommendation fsb taskforce climate-related financial disclosures. implement recommendation mean need explain governance, risk management strategy climate relate issues. and need explain metric target use prepare issues. and course mean need strategy, risk management governance system issue. and subsequently need target metric measure progress areas. fortunately see many financial institution netherlands abroad experiment incorporate climate risk management. one dutch bank example, incorporate energy transition credit policy loan utility industry. this bank finance utility carbon reduction strategies, bank want average energy mix utility company finances, line 2 degree scenario international energy agency. this precisely kind think attitude need, start incorporate climate risk consideration investment decisions. it won’t easy, i’m sure won’t perfect first either, need start somewhere. how precisely incorporate climate-related risk bank supervision also remain open question. here too, two point stand out. one, risk already material, course already ass them. if dutch bank example ignore increase credit risk sustainability requirement offices, sure would serious supervisory dialogue part pillar 2 credit risk assessment. but that’s course one specific example, specific transition legislation affect small part economy. it’s challenge energy transition whole banks’ balance sheet whole. how supervisor ass 6 well bank incorporate climate-related risk there? do need establish separate risk category supervisory review evaluation process european parliament member proposing? or incorporate exist srep-elements, example credit risk? we don’t answer yet, continue explore question year come, hope join us. one thing clear though: sustainability factors, climate issue particular, affect solidity financial institutions, therefore warrant consideration bank supervisor alike. fortunately, month ago, central bank supervisor 8 jurisdictions, include germany netherlands, launch central bank supervisor network green financial system. this network aim enhance role financial system manage risk mobilize capital transition environmentally sustainable world. my colleague, frank elderson, recently elect first chair network. i grateful excite dnb bundesbank work together network advance issue international supervisory community. conclusion lady gentlemen. today go mission supervision. i hope transition dnb undergo organization, relevant sustainability-considerations incorporate core tasks, inspire perhaps even sound familiar. but i also imagine might remain skeptical appropriateness this. perhaps still wondering: really discuss sustainability today? for i would like share something colleague jan sijbrand say recently: “klaas, come sustainability, criticize sides: say operate beyond boundary mandate. but also say way little.” “to me”, said, “that’s clear sign we’re exactly track be.” and i would like conclude now. thank you. philip r lane: the macro-financial environment ireland spring2018speech

central bankers' speech no, i don’t think it’s worth frighten indicators. growth strong. there akind stabilisation growth rate, talk what’s call “second derivative”rather growth itself. maybe there’s stabilisation. in way, strengthen belief thatthere structural measure take monetary policy. of course, thatis possible direction.you describe policy “giving time” government attemptreforms. ha france take right road, right direction?yes, it’s job ecb give lesson go detail thatgovernment must do, don’t politics, that’s us. we mandate whichis simple, bring inflation euro area back towards 2%. and we’re makingvery good progress towards that, we’re quite yet. then, growth driver needed,growth investment, consumption, take monetary policy. for happen,economies perform better. what see france fact go direction. thereis reform momentum i think two dividends: one french economy andone euro area. france large country, second-largest country euro area.the euro area need reform strong french economy also something canset series dialogues, series reform right across euro area.france take path reform momentum growth momentum?yes, i don’t want judge way mean french government, sequence ofreforms.no,

comparedwith france’s competitors. however, train problem show theinternational surveys, increasingly priority. and government work it.there’s talk “budgetary jackpot” weekend, regard that? whatare comments?it’s slightly ridiculous discussion; i spend 15 year ministry finance previous life.whenever france’s deficit go 3%, good soul speak jackpot. ifyou listen them, mean 3% upper limit deficit france, thelower limit; mean deficit never go 3%. government debt 97% gdp. ifour deficit remain 3%, clear head towards serious debt sustainabilityproblems. so shouldn’t listen good people think jackpot thedeficit fraction 3%. it bite like give alcoholic sweet former alcoholic, tospeak, seem little dangerous.and particularly – centrepiece policy i think themain difficulty face – northern european countries, number country there,have quite clear vague attempt euro area reform put forward byemmanuel macron. why not, first public finance balanced?not public finances. growth france must

central bankers' speech 1-7 open remark bot’s policy direction fintech development bangkok fintech fair 2018: sme consumer financial solution dr. veerathai santiprabhob governor bank thailand monday 19 march 2018 bank thailand learn center distinguish guest lady gentleman swasdee krub, a good morning all. welcome inaugural bangkok fintech fair welcome bank thailand learn center. this learn center first open public december last year. it bangkok’s new learn center public library also open space individual entrepreneur collaborate exchange ideas. so, fit first bangkok fintech fair hold venue. over next two days, join top mind thailand’s fintech financial industry well regional global leader financial innovation. the main discussion panel present various issue surround fintech ecosystem focus sme financial solutions, retail payments, technology infrastructure; cybersecurity room, library, underscore importance cyber-awareness highlight key security issues, range emerge threat defensive strategies; technology talk room various presentation booth venue showcase late technology initiative thailand’s fintech financial industry work on. 2-7 lady gentlemen, on program, morning i suppose talk bank thailand’s policy direction fintech development. before i so, i would like take step back focus three key words, i believe imperative formulate financial sector policy thailand region whole. these three key word productivity, immunity, inclusivity. first, emphasis must place productivity uplift productivity critical requirement long term growth economy. for one, current stage, many country region face structural transformation age workforce. shrink workforce dampen long term growth prospect. we must become productive order increase output level improve standard live people. productivity also need boost competitiveness business expand global trade network emergence large e-business platform introduce new competitor business landscape. moreover, role bank could challenge share financial platform gain prominence modern economy, new fintech firm offer financial product unbundled long stand value chain banking. without meaningful adjustment—that improve productivity, long term growth potential economy could deteriorate. second, immunity become imperative current global economic landscape. we live time changes, outcome abrupt, unpredictable, volatile. amidst fallout global financial crisis 2008, unconventional monetary policy flush global financial market excess liquidity, enter cycle major central bank start normalize monetary policies. along normalization path, one expect see market correction 3-7 volatile asset prices. on top this, rise u trade protectionism raise concern global trade, investment, production, measure could retaliated. global warm geopolitical risk also increase many region world. besides, rapidly change technology could disruptive incumbent many industry also bring new form risks, range cyber threat strategic risk exist business models. all uncertainty necessitate build sufficient immunity become key consideration financial sector policy. third notion inclusivity. we need understand financial sector policy without consideration inclusivity cannot sustained. this especially important thailand many country region income wealth inequality one press social economic issues. any policy action pay attention issue inequality threaten long-term social economic stability, high capital easily reap benefit economic growth new technology, leave without access new technology know-how behind. eventually, inequality income, wealth, opportunity raise social polarization, result political gridlock see many countries. ultimately, policy make improvement three key imperative uplift real economy standard live people whole. productive financial sector allow efficient resource allocation among different segment economy. maintain resilience financial system allow smooth function financial market keep systemic risk bay. and, inclusive financial system ensure benefit economic growth share fairly across whole society, foster stable social economic environment conducive sustainable growth. lady gentlemen, 4-7 amidst rapidly change technology, fintech must instrumental driver financial sector policy fulfill three key imperative productivity, immunity, inclusivity. on productivity front, fintech enhance efficiency financial services. rise new electronic payment ecosystem enable efficient transfer fund significantly low transaction cost customers. adoption fintech platform allow bank scale high cost brick-and-mortar delivery model shift le costly efficient digital services. lend process make much efficient usage transactional data e-commerce payment platforms, banks’ business model could change collateral-based lend information-based lending. meanwhile, blockchain advance technology behind many aspect financial services, especially back-office operation fund transfers. all help low cost financial transaction improve ease business bank customers, thereby improve productivity economy whole. on immunity front, prudent application fintech help bank business improve risk management. with vast amount data available new payment ecosystem digital transactions, bank good analyze business condition make accurate forecast customers’ credit demand credit risks, result improve risk management model. additionally, emergence new data unlock new hedge products, especially insurance industry. furthermore, advancement technology like artificial intelligence, biometrics, blockchains help safeguard financial information, improve identity verification, reduce number magnitude financial frauds. these development contribute safe environment service provider customers. 5-7 on inclusivity front, expand fintech universe advent new diverse platform improve financial access customers, especially underserved current financial system. a different individual different level affordability financial requirements, ever-expanding fintech universe offer wide-ranging choice solution need fulfill different needs. digitization financial service emergence new platform improve financial service online access smartphone applications, benefit customer city remote areas. fintech application also help cross-border transaction small business enable fast cheap remittance transfer immigrant workers, thus create opportunity improve quality life many might underserved. meanwhile, information-based lend help small business without adequate collateral gain access fund fair price. all solution lead low cost financial services, great financial access, great opportunity public. ultimately, “fintech” help unlock massive potential people business powerful tool thailand develop country improve productivity, immunity, inclusivity financial system well whole economy. lady gentlemen, the theme first bangkok fintech fair focus smes consumers, two group face various challenge benefit greatly adoption fintech. for thailand, smes represent majority firm make 80 percent total employment. many smes struggle gain access finance payment services, which, one hand, attribute poor financial health due loss competitiveness. on hand, many smes lack financial management skill collateral need funding, 6-7 cost finance remain high. meanwhile, thai public face big hurdle low long-term save high household debts, thailand household debt gdp ratio amongst high region. many household lack access efficient low-cost financial services, deposit, payment, insurance loan products. these people need good serve financial system able unlock potential, improve standard living, ensure financial security age. despite many challenges, i delight excite development initiative take place thailand around region use fintech address problems. allow highlight initiatives. we have:  account service application smes start-ups cloud platform  online mortgage refinance portal help select best refinance option mortgage client  real-time low cost cross-border money transfer remittance platform  biometric verification e-kyc facilitate remote access financial service  machine learn use

throughout next two day i look forward personally interact participants, learn find way collaborate benefit thai regional financial industry fintech ecosystems. thank much participate first bangkok

one contribute factor improvement global economicconditions. this support business profits, help reduce actual prospectivedefaults. in turn, underpin narrow credit premia. we see evidence this, forexample, decline default rate high-yield u bond past years, althoughsome decline since last year may also reflect improvement condition affect usoil producers.another part story may uncertainty declined. this evident thelow level financial market volatility observe last year early year. that suggest thatmarket participant confident forecast future. a sense greatercertainty consistent reduction variability many key macroeconomic indicators,which accompany decline revision analysts’ forecast variables.yet another possible reason low spread financial market participant appear bewilling take risk low level compensation. in words, price risk may havedeclined. this could consequence developments. importantly, accommodativemonetary policy provide investor incentive take risk achieve areasonable rate return. a investor take risk, tend bid price – ascaptured spreads, example. this search yield hear lot.why matter australia?so relevance decline spread offshore fix income asset australianmarkets?first, matter many corporation issue overseas. this offshore issuancefacilitates capital inflows, financial counterpart australia’s current accountdeficit.23 2 / 15bis central bankers' speech most bond issue australian company issue offshore, whether financial ornon-financial company (graph 2). for non-financial companies, influence mine firm inthis market significant recent years. overseas issuance quite natural minersoperating australia revenue stream often denominate foreigncurrencies.second, decline spread offshore also matter highly correlate withspreads domestic market (graph 3). for example, spread bond issue australianbanks australian market strong relationship spread face uscorporations. the true spread bond issue non-residents australianmarket (so call ‘kangaroo bonds’). this surprise market forcapital global one. if price risk australia deviate far global price– beyond suggest difference fundamental credit quality – would beopportunities profitable arbitrage. one way another, process arbitrage would lead toa degree convergence spreads. 3 / 15bis central bankers' speech the responseso spread decline australia, much like rest world. be end thestory? far it. non-government issuer respond development numberof ways.low spread make attractive company issue fix income securities.issuance across range markets. but quantity part story. gooddemand condition also make easy diverse range company issue.moreover, tenor increased, notably domestic market.quantitieslet start quantities.issuance many market up. gross issuance bank bond 2017 secondhighest since global financial crisis (graph 4). in 2016, bank act ahead time inpreparation implementation net stable fund ratio (nsfr) requirement. so,having issue bite paper 2016 case time, seemedreasonable expect 2017 go somewhat subdue year bank bondissuance. a happened, though, bank take advantage favourable fund condition overthe past year tap bond market actively might otherwise thecase.4 4 / 15bis central bankers' speech corporate bond kangaroo issuance rebound 2016 level 2017, although therehave recent year issuance higher.issuance residential mortgage-backed security (rmbs) particularly strong 2017.indeed, strong since global financial crisis. part likely owe toextra issuance non-banks (i.e. financial institution authorise deposit takinginstitutions, non-adis). their house lend pick strongly time thegrowth lend major bank easing.

remarkable number ‘other’ (non-major)banks issue rmbs – count 17, high ever. 5 / 15bis central bankers' speech interestingly, major bank relatively inactive market. only 13 per cent totalvolume issuance 2017 account majors, low since 2010. onereason major active that, even decline rmbs spreads,pricing particularly attractive them. rather, alternative source fund – asunsecured wholesale

theycannot avail favourable term currently offer there.an alternative way show increase diversity herfindfahl-hirschman index,which standard way measure concentration. the low index, low level

accounts, asian investor help support longer-termaustralian dollar issuance late. it yet seem case resident investor areable provide demand need large volume longer-term issuance, although thatcould

lowspreads range non-government debt. australian issuer benefited, greaterissuance, across diverse range issuer long average tenors. but outlookis without risks.indeed, accommodative monetary policy encourage great risk-taking lendersand borrowers. this one important way monetary transmissionmechanism works. it support decline spread positive development i’vejust discussed. at time, however,

especially high relation callcryptocurrencies. i call virtual tokens, way. they like token buy whenyou go casino. study show 50% transaction make use virtualtokens 25% user link illicit activities. there four main risks. the first risk ismarket liquidity. the market excessively concentrated, 96% transaction beingcarried 2% account holders. second liquidity risk. these currency still always

leverage, greaterthe risk well.the fourth risk operational technical immaturity technology. we open thetechnology distribute ledgers. but something different bitcoin. bitcoin itselfbelongs one; one

sector grow without proper authority, that’s shadow banking. arecent study show it’s growing, luxembourg market – forthe first time include study – could represent 7.2% shadow banking. howwould judge whether activity like securitisation represent threat financialstability?let first say cannot call everything bank shadow bank. bank bydefinition mean give credit take deposits. indeed, many institutionsdon’t that. but hand certainly true vehicle create toremove risk bank thus reduce regulatory capital requirements, vehiclesbeing use order escape supervision. that cannot accept more. we cannotafford another crisis magnitude had.how would manage risk?we need determine implement rule agree pittsburgh g20summit. but everything shadow banking. for example, world bank – itssister

worldwide cannot raise fund eachcountry; it’s efficient bundle them. i would say efficient international finance,not shadow banking, create additional risk customer rather low thecost funding.another topic discussion money market funds, extent leverageand much close like bank. and also reason money marketfunds oblige report ecb. then investment fund entity likeinvestment banks, private equity alternative investment fund (aifs). don’t forget thatlehman brother bank luxembourg, sell product bank atthat time. so area see whether what’s involve fact bank-like activity. and is, also subject

practice, use medium exchange store value. but aren’t manyother things? the red paperclip storythis bring mind story red paperclip go viral. some may familiarwith it. in 2005, canadian blogger – kyle macdonald begin series transaction heposted on-line. he begin red paperclip medium exchange. he exchange foran interest look fish-shaped pen, trade odd-looking doorknob…then acamp stove…so forth. by thirteenth barter – little year — macdonaldwas possession movie role (a chance act movie), finally trade atwo-story farmhouse small canadian town! and start red paperclip! (it’s aninteresting story. you google it!)this red paperclip story uncomplicated element differ starkly cryptocurrency’shigh-tech world blockchains, miner cryptography. i introduce keep yourattention refresh simplicity powerful commonlessons learn phenomenon cryptocurrencies.these are: first, additional participant transaction exponentially increase value isdefined, measure transfer consent. second, power leverage ondigital technology connector people. finally, people always count. use points, allow share insight cryptocurrency, also someinitiatives bsp’s excite financial reform agenda – initiative (unlikecryptocurrencies) fully endorse.exponential increase value wide consentthe first lesson red paperclip story phenomenal use privately-issuedcryptocurrencies additional participant

privately-issuedcryptocurrencies fast gain global popularity, deem acceptance still limited. we believe privately-issued cryptocurrencies cannot completely fulfill role money astore value independent unit account. until time cryptocurrenciesare able fully demonstrate stability, prospect replace today’s fiat currenciesappears far-off. they simply still volatile.power technology connect peoplethe second lesson power leverage digital technology connector ofpeople. in red paperclip story, cannot deny value trade notjust object (they were, especially beginning, ordinary object andmight even consider junk many). 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech rather, psychic value come opportunity on-line personalities, viralexposure trade post macdonald’s blog gain quite following. aswith cryptocurrencies, great socio-experiment could also possible withoutdynamic computer-to-computer connections.in regard, bsp acknowledge huge potential digital technology, includescryptocurrencies, transform financial service delivery, specifically area payment andremittance. high-speed digital network allow fund move across globe much faster,cheaper convenient way compare traditional models.

thedevelopment society-wide taste decentralized, peer-to-peer, facebook-type, interactionsacross powerful computer networks, dramatically alter landscape financialservices. and central bank age digitalization interest issue reflection therealm monetary economics.in speech i try explore key issue money evolves, keyinnovation private digital currencies, would central bank digital currency like andwhat might impact introduce one central bank monetary policy.***“monetary space”to ass possible path mean payment, consequently monetary policy, maytake come decades, discussion often focus definition money, function andforms.so money?a simple answer would probably involve adam smith’s example “the butcher, brewer andthe baker”, money solution arise address inefficiency bartereconomy. money quite simply asset everyone wants. the greek word money,“chríma”, mean something one us needs. so money mean payment must beefficient safe use.money, know today, result long process. the world’s first coin wereproduced lydia 2500 year ago. they make electrum, alloy, roaringlion head engrave one side, symbol rule dynasty. this innovation quicklyspread city-state ancient greece. during classical period, greek coinage reachedan exceptional technical artistic level. a anyone visit numismatic collectionat bank greece know money evolve meet society’s needs. a economicactivity increased, become apparent money supply need expand beyond limit ofholding precious metals. century later, circulation paper money, mint metal 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech coin restrict low values.in classical economic theory, money fulfil three functions. first, mean payment andtherefore key role financial transactions. second, form unit account. third, isa store value. people accept money mean payment believe beused future. for work, money assume broad trust issuinginstitution. the first central bank found build additional trust currency, since theissuance private entity lead unstable system. hence, role central bank isrelated trust.there three type money economy: a) physical cash, i.e. banknote coins.banknotes form central bank money hold general public. b) thesecond electronically record deposit account liability ledger commercial banks.c) the third reserves, is, deposit commercial bank central bank.cash nowadays displace many way “demonetization” transaction hasbecome commonplace. however, question arises: will increase need forcash near future? the answer clearly positive. for, paradox coming“cashless economy”. accord ecb, 2016 around 79% payment point ofsale (pos) europe make cash. therefore, although nowadays money hasbeen already digitized, cash still world’s quintessential mean payment. cash still remainsan important popular component money supply.digital currenciespreserving two distinguish attribute cash, namely anonymity peer-to-peerexchangeability within digitize platform, prove significantly challenge thedistributed ledger technology offer 2008 key assure decentralize way onecould never spend twice withhold (the “double spend problem”).there lot excitement air cryptocurrencies. everyone hear bitcoin,whose market capitalization first quarter 2018 exceed 110 billion us$, increasingby factor ten within year. the observation raise many questions, true thatcryptocurrencies represent negligible fraction world payments.there rag debate effect financial system introduce virtualcurrencies, digital currency relate innovations. the imf recently recognize thatdigital currency might offer potential benefits, include great speed efficiency makingpayments transfer – particularly across borders. offset promise benefit lowpayment process costs, expect technology field matures, theextreme volatility cryptocurrencies’ prices. “crypto” mean anonymity anonymity beabused world crime, terrorism evasion.the ecb consider monetary policy implication result introduction ofcryptocurrencies since least 2012. in recent study, suggest due high pricevolatility low acceptance rate, bitcoin could regard full form money froman economic perspective. more recently, issue discuss g-20 meet andin late communiqué finance minister central bank governor (buenos aire 19-20march 2018) state crypto-assets lack key attribute sovereigncurrencies, although point could financial stability implications.so, current state, digital currency leave monetary transmission mechanism largelyunaffected.123 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech however, almost cliché say certainty future cryptocurrencies isuncertainty. risk financial stability may eventually emerge since impact digitalcurrencies monetary transmission mechanism ultimately depend whether firm andhouseholds broadly accept them. therefore, supervisory authority monitor alldevelopments crypto-ecosystem, occasionally issue warn crypto-exchanges andbrokers, initial coin offerings, futures, exchange trade fund etc. to date, countrieshave try ban crypto-assets altogether (e.g. morocco) others foster theirdevelopment (e.g. malta).on hand, distribute ledger technology (dlt) underlie digital currenciesschemes, offer potential benefit go far beyond digital currency themselves. a distributedledger technology use decentralize mint transaction process platform, withcopies transaction ever perform distribute public network computingservers. a transaction network complete majority server thenetwork achieve consensus valid, use cryptographic identification technique (private-public key hash functions), thus eliminate need trust party (e.g. central bank).dlt likely change mainly security clear settlement operations. a key feature ofdistributed ledger network payment platform entire history transaction –which immutable - available transaction verifier real time. a copy transactionledger store participate agent data center thus cannot easily compromised;at time easily verifiable readily auditable.bank canada experiment dlt-based wholesale payment system (the called“project jasper”) conclude core wholesale payment system function quite efficientlybut could benefit interaction large dlt ecosystem financialmarket infrastructures, include cross-border transactions. in recent speech, imf statesthat dlt could apply various process cross boarder payment gain would bemost evident efficiency. bank england express view scope forcentral bank financial system broadly benefit settlement technology.but many colleague stress dlt perfect yet technology beenadequately tried. to central bank remain experimental stage present.central bank digital currency (cbdc)i move interrelate discussion focus desirability central bank toprovide digital currency distribute ledger technology decentralize fashion.lately, prospect central bank cryptocurrencies attract attention. central bank aredrawn idea issue fast, efficient, digital currency carry cost ofsecuring, distribute process physical banknote coin track inreal time move financial system. the development dlt recent year nowprovides possibility supplement physical cash form central bank digitalcurrencies. the bank england among first central bank take notice thefeasibility central bank digital currency, monetary authority since followed.cbdc potential new form digital central bank money. in current bank system, onlycommercial bank hold digital money deposit central bank, i.e. reserves. by introducingan universally accessible cbdc, every household business would enable hold directclaims central bank. in practice, central bank would guarantee free convertibility atpar (i.e. 1:1). this practice would make digital currency secure store value, incentivizingindividuals business hold cbdc. one major issue, however, whether cbdcshould interest bear asset not.4567 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech there two cases:a) cbdc pay interest, like paper currency.in case, household company would incentivized hold liquid fundsin interest bear deposit account commercial banks, keep use digital currencyfairly modest. however, form digital currency would constrain ability central bank topush interest rate zero period weak aggregate demand deflation becausedepositors would swiftly move fund digital currency pay zero interest. thus, theeffective zero low bind interest rate would become bind constraint formonetary policy.b) cbdc introduce interest bear currency.in case, central bank would pay interest digital currency account hold centralbank individuals, company banks, similar deposit facility commercial banks. ifthe digital currency bear interest, likely affect demand physical cash ofcirculation, least large extent. in recent work paper bank england, cbdc isdefined “a central bank grant universal, electronic, 24x7, national-currency-denominatedand interest-bearing access balance sheet”.furthermore, interest bear cbdc, still assume zero-interest bearingpaper currency eventually disappears, constraint effective low bind removedand thereby need alternative monetary tool quantitative ease orfiscal interventions.introducing cbdc interest bear security merits, explain above, itcomes also great risks. one major question following: money user access torisk free central bank money, would hold risky commercial bank deposits?this give rise gresham’s law, namely “bad money drive good money”, particularlyduring period bank crises. therefore, impact balance sheet commercialbanks would classical bank run. bank would increasingly lose ability toattract deposits, create potential destructive financial crises. moreover, without theability attract deposits, bank would lose ability provide credit; hence would losetheir core function financial intermediary economy.there reason central banks, example scandinavian countries,might view cbdc particularly favourably. at time rapidly decline paper currency circulation,this could maintain central bank’s seignorage revenue preserve public, trust-enhancing, element money. the advent digital currency help increase financialinclusion thereby expand size formal economy. on hand, real-timetraceability digital ledger transaction combat effectively money laundering, fiscal andsocial fraud help expansion tax base.payment system efficiency seem also objective consider cbdc. money andpayment system intrinsically linked. they evolve together connection remainsevident responsibility central bank ensure stability payment systems.some potential benefit include a) le concentration liquidity payment system makelarge bank le systemically important b) enhance stability overall paymentecosystem, depend type distribute ledger technology.***innovation something power development financial sector, contribute the89 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech high standard live enjoy make finance “democratic”. for example,crowdfunding enable access finance great part society, usingsmartphone apps make mobile payments.yet, digital currency something else.i sure whether digital currency become substitute cash near future sincemany important question remain unanswered. cryptocurrencies intrinsic value, onlyvalue exchange. their

dilemma emergence dlt. just internetdecentralized flow information, emergence crypto instrument decentralizedvalue. and postal service disappeared, bank disappear either.dlt might many positive

well-established growth vital ingredient, indeed pre-requisite, meet many broad societal objective many would view important longer-term health, wealth happiness.2 while end itself, economic growth appear vitally important mean achieve societal ends. economic growth main reason global level poverty rate infant mortality fall spectacularly recent centuries. it longevity educational standard rise secularly period. and growth may even contribute incidence global conflict war fall low levels, perhaps human history.3 that make growth gift, one necessary (if necessarily sufficient) deliver secular improvement live standards. and make good understand determinant driver growth crucial societal progress. by understand force drive growth, past, present future, begin devise implement economic policy

future challenge technology devise future policy institution necessary meet them. that might require, among things, repurposing successful institution like one, turn university multiversities. the story growth the story economic growth often begin chart like one (chart 1). this plot path global economic growth, measure gross domestic product (gdp) per head, past 1000 years. and story tells. it tale two half – or, accurately, tale three-quarters quarter.4 for first three-quarters past 1000 years, global economy stand still growth terms. gdp growth per head population average le 0.1% per

history that, understandably, attract huge amount empirical, historical, social theoretical research. out cloud evidence, clear sunbeam understand emerge deep cause catalyst economic growth. if ask schoolchild happen england around middle 18th century, i often do, many give right answer. it mark dawn industrial revolution. but exactly revolution exactly cause it? in standard account, catalyst revolution economic growth come single source, one “i” - ideas.11 in second half 18th century uk, idea begin sprout like morning mushrooms. these idea emerge seemingly spontaneously roughly contemporaneously. they also relatively closely cluster geographically. they include jam hargreaves’ spin jenny 1764, richard arkwright’s water frame 1769 jam watt’s steam engine 1775. in fullness time, idea begin revolutionise industry work. after lengthy adoption lag, spread across sector across regions. they migrate mere idea become “gpts” general purpose technologies.12 in process, generate wave investment new factories, machines, process infrastructures. there was, jargon, capital-deepening. neo-classical theory economic growth clear would expect happen next.13 when outward shift economy’s technological frontier combine high level physical capital, fuse light high productivity among companies, high wage among worker and, ultimately, high live standard among societies. so golden era. chart 2 plot productivity, wage gdp per head uk since industrial revolution. all three plateaued prior 1750. since then, three move lockstep. idea innovation bear continuous fruit high productivity, pay live standards. this fruit share roughly equally owner company (profits) worker company (wages). we know labour’s share national income pie similar today 1750. of course, idea innovation 18th century sustain growth subsequent period. although innovation process continuous, historian often point three distinct wave – three industrial revolutions. the second come latter part 19th century emergence gpts 11 for example, romer (1990) describe theoretical model growth base around innovation. 12 bresnahan trajtenberg (1995). 13 for example, mokyr (2011) discus britain industrial revolution. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 electricity, internal combustion engine sanitation. the third come middle 20th century new gpts computing, digitisation internet.14 yet case playbook familiar first industrial revolution. the emergence new strain gpts result outward shift production possibility frontier capital-deepening. with high level investment physical human capital, productivity companies, wage worker live standard society continue northerly ascent. the golden era continued. some people discuss next innovation wave, so-called fourth industrial revolution. the gpts drive likely include artificial intelligence (ai), big data, automation, robotics, 3d-printing nano-technology.15 i return fourth industrial revolution discuss future growth. a different growth story a appetising growth story sounds, read history book make difficult swallow whole. it certainly plausible think divine coincidence hargreaves, watt arkwrights, roughly place roughly time, result white-hot crucible creativity. indeed, might see self-same crucible creativity silicon valley today. but industrial revolution hardly first fire crucible. we have, history, see many episode furnace-hot crucible innovation, span continent centuries.16 successful cities, regions, countries, continent empire recent distant past often build sustain idea innovation accompany investment machine people. the roman empire case point. some remember sequence monty python’s the life brian begin rhetorical question: “what roman ever us?” the sketch concludes: “but apart good sanitation medicine education irrigation public health road freshwater system bath public order...what roman do us?” you need go far back example big idea transformative impact industry society. immediately prior industrial revolution run chronologically, include windmill 12th century, mechanical clock 13th, cannon 14th, print press 15th, postal service 16th telescope microscope 17th.17 it

6 6 economic growth, historical record suggest may sufficient. other force appear play, translate idea sustain growth live standards. what might force be? i want provide two different, complementary, lens growth story. the first focus rather broad set “capitals” – physical capital (plant machines) human (skills expertise), intellectual (ideas technologies), infrastructural (transport legal systems), social (co-operation trust) institutional (national civic, private public) capital.18 history suggest capital may play important support role story growth. idea alone, without support one broad capitals, historically run aground. for example, uk many foundation growth industrial revolution lay century precede it. it platform “capitals”, plural, idea innovation built. take human capital. the dramatic improvement educational standard uk occur prior 1750 (chart 3). so large improvement measure social, infrastructural institutional capital.19 idea need foundation flourish. a steam engine much use without skill build it, track run on, institution oversee it, trust public accept it. the cause growth inflexion 18th century england much sociological technological. another lens view alternative growth story recently provide economic historians, steve broadberry john wallis.20 indeed probably lens world, others, lead change story growth. broadberry wallis two things. first, construct new estimate growth go back 1300. rather rely period averages, use higher-frequency measure growth. this change growth picture significantly. period average conceal large,

decompose growth data “expanding” “contracting” periods. chart 5 plot uk past 700 years. a broadly similar pattern expand contract period find spain, france, italy, portugal, netherlands roughly

prior industrial revolution, kill expansion dead. after it, society appear find effective mean dodge them. a second “i” growth to understand growth, then, need explain economy become le recession-prone 1750. for me, explanation lie second “i” – institutions. i argue emergence institution explain rise capital essential pre-conditions growth (human, social, infrastructural, intellectual etc.) it emergence institution also cushion damage effect recessions. a sight, gain true perspective growth need two “i"s. this is, one sense, new story. a number distinguish economist

why nation fail.23 if institution hold key, exactly mean exactly come about? douglas north’s definition good start point: “humanly devise constraint structure political, economic social interactions”.24 so defined, institution social infrastructure. they include formal legal institutions, like parliaments, judiciaries, central banks, social safety net schools. but also include le formal association groups, universities, trade unions, guild charities. a genesis, history suggest institution emerge variety reasons. sometimes direct response political upheaval. some large transformation political institution result revolutions: uk, glorious revolution 17th century, france french revolution 18th century, unite state civil war 19th century. at times, institution emerge response press financial social need citizens. often, time press financial social need coincide sharp change economic environment leave large swathe society worse-off. and often, technological disruption displacement root cause sharp change economic environment. the three industrial revolution provide useful set case studies. each cause technological disruption significant job displacement. each had, result, wrench last impact job income prospect large swathe society. each cause significant sustain period hardship many.25 and cause stretch social fabric, often close break point. it well-established industrial revolution cause significant loss livelihood worker whose set task susceptible automation. the upshot, often, “hollowing out” job across skill distribution.26 because reskilling retrain take time effort, job displacement worsen pay prospect great many, significantly persistently.27 and loss often make bad concentrate occupationally geographically.28 a second,

end skill distribution saw income fall, due reduce demand increase supply skills. the result rise income inequality tended, historically, heighten popular discontent worsen social cohesion. a third adverse side-effect worker always benefit, fully immediately, technologically-induced gain companies’ productivity profitability. in early stage industrial revolution, wage tend rise line productivity, cause labour’s share national income pie fall.29 this, too, tend add popular discontent damage social cohesion. labour’s income share also fall number advance economy past decades.30 a final side-effect period technological transition often lengthy well painful. in first industrial revolution, many displace worker still find alternative work middle 19th century, income inequality run high labour’s share falling. this period know historian “engel’s pause”.31 subsequent industrial revolution see similar, le long-lived, pauses. if economic hardship widespread social cohesion damaged, societal response needed. one response creation new piece social infrastructure – words, institution building. each industrial revolution saw surge institution-building, cushion adverse side-effects technological change job pay. in way, recessionary hit worker economy could shorten dampened. broadly speaking, two set institution emerged. one set equip worker new skill need thrive new job environment. it acquire skill worker could transition new job created. by keep one step ahead machine, technological unemployment could avoided. a shorter, seamless skill transition reduce hit workers’ income low risk skill atrophy, might otherwise cause last damage employment. this social infrastructure might call “enabling” institutions. another set institution provide worker support cushion hit finance well-being painful lengthy period job transition. this might financial support, income loans. it might house shelter. or might social emotional support. this social insurance ensure life underpinned, inequality hold check social fabric hold together. it reduce recession risk, individual societies. these might call “insuring” institutions.32 29 allen (2005) document

nonetheless leaf large swathe society slipstream. more that, recent research suggest likely outcome fourth industrial revolution. there good conceptual grind think displacement effect fourth industrial revolution may large ever-previously. every industrial revolution result hollowing-out, typically mid-skilled tasks. historically, mean largely manual, labour-intensive tasks. machine replace human activity routine repetitive. the future could well different. for example, dawn ai mean human long cognitive play field themselves. think non-routine task may increasingly take machines. they able process quickly, cheaply few error human counterpart, least activities. that could make hollowing-out human tasks, cognitive well manual, far great ever before.48 a cottage industry emerge recent year manufacture estimate job loss might result rise robots. a early contributor industry, i least partly blame.49 the estimate gross job loss span pretty wide range, lie anywhere 10% 50% global workforce, depend whether job task assume displace (table 1 summarises). even low end range, societal impact would significant. at upper end, would truly transformative. if truth lie between, could still make job loss fourth industrial revolution great predecessors. and so, potential societal cost – rise wage inequality threat social cohesion – could also great ever previously.50 some

ultimately determine unemployment settle.54 no one could say confidence today long-run net effect be. what say confidence scale gross displacement may large ever-previously. this mean that, technological unemployment avoided, positive effect productivity, good job also commensurately larger. that lead argue technological unemployment likely time around.55 even avoided, societal cost transition could well larger, term rise wage inequality, fall labour share damage social cohesion. and recessionary impact technological change individual society sufficiently large, could well call question merit pursue creative course first place. or that, least, lesson history. what experience since industrial revolution teach u risk mitigate appropriate institutional response. to effective curb recession risk, response objectives, first, speeding-up process reskilling worker (“enabling”) and, second, cushion impact new technology displace company worker (“insuring”). in face mount concern societal impact rise robots, quite lot write recently sort new insurance mechanism might require smooth transition.56 here, i focus two area new “enabling institutions” could ease transition worker companies. both draw one great institutional invention past millennium – universities. in 1852, john (later cardinal) newman publish the idea university, book since assume classic status statement principle university run organised. there many theme text. from these, i would highlight two particular relevance debate future role university within societies. first, newman emphasise universities’ role provide liberal education students, mean access range disciplines. rigid specialism avoided. the capacity think mattered. second, role university propagate ideas, rather necessarily generate them. the capacity diffuse knowledge, rather generate it, mattered. with twist, relevant idea university 21st century. david willetts, example, emphasis role university much vigour newman recent book, a university education. 54 see, example, acemoglu restropo (2018) organise theoretical framework. 55 for example, acemoglu restrepo (2017), susskind susskind (2015). 56 martinelli (2017) stand (2017), example, discus universal basic income. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15 15 (a) human capital let start human capital, workers’ skill experience. two fundamental shift job skill market likely period ahead. the first demographic. a young person bear today expect live 100-year life.57 that case, likely career 60, perhaps 70, years. give change future world work, multiple change career, job, likely lifetime. this never happen human history. the second secular shift demand skills. in past, skill-shift uni-directional. there secular rise demand cognitive skill correspond decline demand technical skill involve routine repetitive tasks. that cognitive skill attract rise wage premium (chart 6). put differently, demand skill “head” (cognitive) dominate “hands” (technical) and, less extent, “heart” (social) past 300 years. in century ahead, skill-shifts may go reverse. to see why, need ask set human skill robot likely find hard reproduce replace period ahead. my read rune three area human likely preserve comparative (if always absolute) advantage robot foreseeable future. the first cognitive task require creativity intuition (“heads”). these might task problem whose solution require great logical leap imagination rather step-by-step hill-climbing. exist machine learn algorithm allow huge number solution permutation try quickly costlessly. this allow hill-climbing algorithm scale local peak record time. whether scale global peak altogether another matter. it hard machine solve problem difficult define solution step logical sequence advance. human call solution arrive way “intuition”. despite rapid progress deep learn techniques, remain far-harder devise search algorithm solve problem require leap unknown.58 even world super-intelligent machine learning, demand still likely exist people skill programme, test oversee machines. some human oversight judgemental overlay automate process still likely needed. machine design, improvement oversight require, least moment, human machine operate partnership. the second area prospective demand human skill bespeak design manufacture (“hands”). routine technical task relatively simple automate already well way disappearing. 57 gratton scott (2016). 58 alphagozero one attempt. it update version alphago, computer programme play game ‘go’, first software beat

manufacture delivery. a rise global wealth income likely create increase demand luxury good service type, whose characteristic unique supply constrained. indeed, see already rise demand price rare art artefact independently-produced foodstuff beverages. to meet demand, mark carney speak re-emergence new artisan class. if so, would mark something return pre-industrial revolution future.59 the third, perhaps big potential growth area all, social skill (“hearts”). that is, task require emotional intelligence (such sympathy empathy, relationship-building negotiation skills, resilience character) rather cognitive intelligence alone. these skill robot likely find hard replicate. and even could replicate them, human might still prefer human carry out. the future could see world work eq rival iq skill supremacy. profession involve high degree personal social interaction – health, caring, education leisure – could see demand rise. indeed, possible balance cognitive social skill might alter significantly even among job traditionally cognitively-intense. take medicine. the doctor future might value far le clinical competence diagnose illness prescribe solutions. in world individual medical record data-hungry diagnostic algorithms, much process diagnosis prescription might fall machine rather human. indeed, uk prime minister recently suggest strategy deliver that.60 but unlikely eradicate need doctors. patient still likely want discus diagnosis prescription. and want advice deliver personally empathetically. in survey patient satisfaction doctor’s bedside manner, rather clinical competence, matter most.61 in future, balance social clinical skill may shift further. and, likely, social skill demand flesh-and-blood rather robo-doctors. if nature career skill require changing, carry implication educational institutions? that seem likely. for decades, primary focus institution provide young people cognitive skills. that model work well meet need skill-shifts see three industrial revolutions. 59 carney (2016). 60 pm speech science modern industrial strategy, available here:

available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17 17 whether model meet need fourth industrial revolution seem questionable, two reasons. first, future seem likely young old alike equal educational need – train, retrain retrain 60 70-year careers. second, skill people require future world work long cognitive. rather, likely evenly balance cognitive, technical social - head, hand heart. it become rather trite talk need “life-long learning”. but never need learn likely great give long span great volatility future career paths. make career transition call particular set skill – personal resilience, problem-solving flexibility. a well-recognised, character attribute best instill early years. if turn exist university colleges, present appear ideally sit meet either secular shift educational train need. by large, currently configure centre life-long learning. and nor, main, institution provide balance educational offer cognitive, technical social skills. to meet need future world work, might need change. the importance broad-based, newman-style, education likely great ever. this might criss-cross disciplinary boundaries, one way increase people’s ability make giant logical leaps. those skill social technical every bite much cognitive, head, hand heart share equal billing. put way, future university may need different creature past. it may need cater multiple entry point along age distribution, rather focus young. and may need cater multiple entry point along skill spectrum, rather focus cognitive. it would, short, need plural rather singular – “multiversity”, rather university. (b) intellectual capital multiversity spread future skill across workforce. another educational challenge spread future technology across companies. this crucial idea innovation become gpts, boost productivity, pay live standards. at present, evidence diffusion new technology across firm paint rather mix picture. to understand why, useful recognise two force work new idea diffuse economy. first, adoption (or extensive margin) – time take new technology first reach country company. second, penetration (or intensive margin) – extent technology reshape process product within company country.62 62 comin mestieri (2013a). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 18 18 take example like compute technology robotics. the adoption lag would measure time take country company first computer robot. the penetration rate would measure many computer robot country company intensively used. you would expect important process technological diffusion boost productivity. and, empirically, typically find important processes.63 so evidence suggest twin diffusion processes? look adoption lag range different technology across countries, time-series evidence suggest fall time. average adoption lag shrink century 18th century, perhaps 40-80 year 19th century 20-50 year 20th century.64 it seem possible lag may fall enter 21st century, cross-border flow information idea rise new heights. this good news story productivity. indeed, one key benefit globalisation past several decade free flow good services, people capital, idea information, serve vehicle transmission diffusion new technology across borders. other thing equal, accelerate catch-up country operate inside technological frontier.65 other things, however, equal. penetration rate new technologies, adopted, tell different tale. they suggest that, time, divergence frontier non-frontier countries. in words, intensity new technology use expand rapidly frontier (especially western) economy non-frontier (non-western) ones. this retard catch-up two blocs. it le encourage story diffusion innovation. with intensive extensive margin diffusion push opposite directions, out? it seem force divergence: slow rate penetration new technology counter-balanced fast rate adoption across countries. this show level productivity frontier non-frontier which, since around 1980, anything diverged. chart 7 illustrate that. it compare level productivity across 44 country since 1950 relative frontier country (the us). convergence prior 1980 give way divergence subsequently. that divergence level productivity has, turn, translate divergence level gdp per head across country period.66 the process live standard catch-up stalled, possibly reversed. and reason appear slow rate technological diffusion. if slow rate technological diffusion across countries, potentially true within countries? evidence use micro-level company data within country suggest is. research 63 comin mestieri

across firm number countries.67 put differently, long lengthen low tail company fail keep pace technology use frontier companies. their productivity performance fall ever-further behind. this widen dispersion performance upper low tail company appear particularly acute uk. to great extent elsewhere, appear uk tale (or tail) two companies. at upper end, uk seem many high-productivity company main competitor (chart 8). that fit uk’s stand global innovation hub, world-leading company university high index innovation international standards.68 that counter-balanced, however, productivity performance low tail. this tail appear materially long low uk’s main international competitor (chart 8). moreover, low tail lengthen past decade countries.69 the already slow rate technological diffusion uk, international standards, slow recent past. these diffusion dynamic important productivity live standards. the wide dispersion long low tail company help explain uk’s roughly 30% productivity gap with, say, france germany. and widen dispersion productivity performance upper low tail company help explain uk’s relatively poor productivity performance country past decade. these diffusion dynamic also consistent, least inconsistent, dawn fourth industrial revolution. this effect shift outward technology productivity frontier pioneer firms. there clear evidence happening. productivity among firm top 1% distribution grew, average, 8% per year ten year 2014. the most-productive 0.1% firm exhibit 12% annual growth.70 a point comparison, low 99% tail firm experience annual average productivity growth le 1% period. in words, look cross-section uk companies, secular innovation (for upper 1% 0.1%) co-existed secular stagnation (for remain 99%). the two engaged, much secular struggle, secular stand-off. technological diffusion, hence productivity growth, casualty. there one two recent study quote question importance “long tail” issue uk.71 these piece use data use here. the problem arise data (mis)interpretation place studies. all study show, 67 andrews, criscuolo gal (2016). 68 department business, energy & industrial strategy (2017). 69 haldane (2017). 70

schneider recently publish blog post show good chunk slow productivity growth since crisis could account worker top quartile productivity distribution.72 this entirely consistent tale two companies. indeed, evidence low tail company flat-lining productivity lengthen crisis uk competitor countries, consistent long tail hypothesis. why might uk’s long tail, hence technological diffusion, problem acute elsewhere? several reason posit probed.73 one interest window issue provide look intensive extensive diffusion margins, see provide clues. look range ict technologies, data suggest high relatively consistent level technological adoption, low variable rate technological penetration, mimic international evidence. take internet access. almost uk business – excess 90%– internet access. but uk rank poorly compare oecd country term broadband penetration (chart 9).74 that true standard broadband connectivity, also advance infrastructure optical fibre connections. those low rate penetration largely reflect large/small firm differences. a oecd countries, broadband usage large firm almost 100%. but small firm fall 93%. similarly, share uk business website oecd average, around 83%. but mask sizable large/small firm differences. almost 100% uk large firm use websites, case decade. only two-thirds small firm website 2007. one may expect gap close rapidly. even today, however,

mirror large share uk business sell online. in practice, uk marginally oecd average. and 2009 2016, share uk business make e-commerce sale increase 6pp, 17% 23%. if story, then, one diffusion dynamic sluggish uk elsewhere, might do improve matters? institutions, within universities, may well role play. at present, relatively small sub-set uk’s university operate innovation hubs. they conduct world-leading research use world-leading researchers. and, increase number cases, tandem business spin-off science parks, act incubator innovation. 72 schneider (2018). 73 haldane (2017), jacob et al

university could serve, much innovation incubator new companies, diffusion clinic exist ones. this idea go grain early proposal; would broaden scope purpose universities. in future, would develop broad set capital – beyond human capital (in people) include physical intellectual capital (in firms). and would throughout lifecycle companies, early years. a happens, would also consistent newman’s original conception university diffusion-engines, every bite much innovation-engines. in germany, network apply research institutes, run jointly university industry, place since 1949. the fraunhofer

sector meeting: innovation, transformation reputation deloitte, sociedad de tasación abc luis m. linde governor 3/6 let begin thank organiser – deloitte, sociedad de tasación abc – invitation participate session 25th financial sector meeting, occasion turn three ideas: innovation, transformation reputation. in opinion, three concept accurately encapsulate main challenge currently face financial sector. the new technology enable financial institution transform system business models, transformation lead u forget keystone market, financial markets, customer confidence. the financial sector face singularly complex set conference provide opportunity confer institutions’ key decision-makers different way change address time transformation, crucial future industry. the new technologies, already significantly impact various sectors, potential also substantially change way financial service provide not-too-distant future. i would thus like take opportunity offer view opportunity risk new technology pose. in connection, i shall first briefly review innovation i consider significant and, secondly, i shall address challenge pose new scenario authorities, particular central bank. financial market innovation any list ongoing financial innovation inevitably highlight weight technology. the significance technological component new phase ultimately lend name process change: fintech. what involved, however, broad diffuse concept, encompass new highly technological firms, financial institution innovate application new technologies. occasionally, also use describe new business model even refer basic technology enable various innovations. the confusion surround fintech concept illustrative confusion deep-change process cause. in circumstances, easy sweep away excessive enthusiasm unwarranted pessimism, two option little value added. it undoubtedly much useful focus separate innovation potential improve efficiency provision financial services, cut cost increase security, seek adapt change occur demand, spurious novelty provide significant improvement block soon possible. in words, truly important separate simply showy. in respect, cryptoassets cryptotokens one strike development area, go extensive medium coverage – bitcoin – receiving. but mean important even promise innovation. indeed, view, current use pose risk benefits: low level acceptance mean payment, subject extreme 4/6 volatility, numerous operate vulnerability relate fraudulent illicit activity many cases. i shall not, however, give exhaustive list risk crypto assets, since position banco de españa connection well-known. but i draw attention important disassociate cryptoassets token underlie distribute ledger technology. distribute ledger technology offer interest possibility insofar allows, short, ledger book share securely among various agents. although technology yet sufficiently mature, potential generate efficiency gain cost cut activity require continuous reconciliation among various agents, either activity relatively non-standardised, involve high number intermediary require complex processes. area security trade post-trading, international settlements, collateral management, trade finance management digital identity might benefit use technology ultimately matures. also, program smart contract distribute network might add gain efficiency, provide automation processes. this so, especially, case complex contract give rise multiple transaction distribute time conditional upon one another. other innovation receive le medium attention cryptotokens nevertheless appear mature are, practice, exert notable impact way financial institution general, bank particular, provide services. i refer specifically big data, artificial intelligence know cloud computing. big data offer clear potential enhance personalise supply financial services. true, financial institution time use massive data process technique enhance knowledge customer personalise services. however, possibility boost thank grow volume information available digital formats, cheap storage cost increase compute power. the move big data fact boost development technology go beyond mere data processing. this case artificial intelligence automatic learning. they numerous application financial sector direct end-products customer relations, also transform financial services-provision facets, include banks’ in-house operation area risk management regulatory compliance. the use virtual agent virtual recognition already contribute enhance users’ relationship financial services-providers. but artificial intelligence automatic learn also apply task automatic information reconciliation, fraud detection, risk mitigation regulatory compliance. the final innovation i like mention brief review cloud computing. in environment data configure strategic asset, technique enable new 5/6 solution offer great speed, cost efficiency attain business process adaptation become nimble. that said, must do maintain appropriate level security, especially far critical area concerned. a little historical perspective suffice see improvement new technology bring users. credit debit cards, atm on-line bank obvious example past innovation change day-to-day better. the success changes, however, closely bind appropriate treatment risk vulnerability inevitably accompany processes. the move digital economy accompany great cyber threats, new measure safeguard processes, asset customer data must developed. along pay particular attention management threats, also essential respond challenge stem concentration operational risk among small number critical service-providers, arise customer protection. financial services-providers must also meet challenge understand full dimension function result increasingly automate autonomous algorithm procedures. organisational change address challenge financial innovation the role regulator supervisor contribute harness full benefit innovation maintain risk within reasonable socially acceptable limits. a imagine, easy task require authority undertake internal transformation process able appropriately meet challenges. a result need, banco de españa recent year assign grow resource monitor analyse financial innovation. the first step creation, february 2017, internal group representative different business area within central bank gain cross-departmental view phenomenon promote coordination among different areas. one year on, deem necessary take step, assign specific resource analysis financial innovation. to this, new associate directorate general create last march. this new area pursue three major aims: (i) understand dimension change take place, (ii) analyse consequence new developments, (iii) provide coordination contact market authority involved, include jurisdiction since, short, financial technological innovation global phenomenon. the ultimate aim develop overview main feature challenge face financial services-providers. by way conclusion, let stress that, duly harness managed, new technology grow digitalisation financial sector may offer major opportunity increase efficiency improve financial service whole. they may also useful adapt service change take place user demand. 6/6 a regulator supervisors, believe must active part process, perform role assign u society analyse development take place market promoting, within remit, healthy, orderly positive innovation financial sector. joachim wuermeling: brexit mean brexit - meanfor

introductionladies gentlemenit give great pleasure able speak today future europe afinancial centre brexit. there three aspect i would particularly like address.the first bank look relocate business eu expand theirpresence brexit ask satisfy minimum prudential standardsthat foreign bank already operate within union domestic institution expectedto comply with. at time, need find solution prevent anyunnecessary additional expense.my second point future, institution conduct cross-border business beheavily dependent respective supervisor oversee third-country institution – asthey – authority involve cooperate internationally.and third, consider brexit, tend dwell negative side thing thinkabout best cushion impact. a important justify considerationsare, nonetheless need continue press ahead vision harmonisedfinancial market eu – digital financial centre europe offer yet untappedpotential.2 leave single market mean separate supervisory regimestwo year brexit vote, assume cross-border economicrelationships look set face noticeable headwind go forward. for financial markets, thismeans one thing: financial service passport dead.this immediately raise question: could feasible something like diet version ofthe financial service passport, perhaps create range exceptions?the clear answer cannot be, be, permanent exceptions.institutions relocate operation eu expand presence follow brexit willhave comply high supervisory standard apply institution thatalready operate here.this answer underpin fundamental belief supervisor must capable ofintervening business activity institution operate within jurisdiction alltimes. this sine qua non, grabs.at time, credo prevent u think whether, where,we cushion additional operational outlay cause time pressure.a transitional period, least outline principle march, could help this. it would lowerthe long-term cost exit allow firm reflect option decide marketsthey want operate organisational structure would best allow strike theright balance compliance profitability. however, cannot count 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech transitional period right now, since negotiation could break time.3 supervision future third-country institutions: requirement cooperationbut whether transitional period, one thing certain: standard apply thefuture third-country institution ultimately boil treat relevantsupervisor brexit authority work together context. to shed light onthis issue, ssm already adopt whole bundle supervisory policy stances.however, ssm, baseline assumption still bad case, ie no-deal scenario. andjudging recent development unite kingdom, seem appropriate.with next meet eu head state government fast approaching, doesn’t look likesolutions number quite fundamental issue concern future partnership foundany time soon. the border northern ireland one sensitive topics. this meansthat huge package agreement would hammer next summit onein october, would then, turn, review parliament short oftimeframes. and even go smoothly, would framework wouldhave flesh detail forge future treaty – would take many years. andbecause breakdown negotiation – therefore hard brexit – remain possible anytime throughout entire process, enterprise prepare this.that bank supervisor concern number bank ease intheir effort establish license operational entity eu uk good time ahead ofmarch 2019. let say uncertain term institution cannot rely leniency.we expect bank make provision hard brexit. and that’s i would strongly urge allinstitutions make necessary preparation keep business operation run even ifthere hard brexit 29 march 2019. institution submit application end thecurrent quarter find likelihood license procedure conclude time willdiminish considerably.we also expect application satisfy supervisory policy stances. let u take brieflook key aspects.first, principle authorisation governance, risk management andoutsourcing. in essence, several hundred page requirement boil this:“empty shells” permitted. bank euro area must able manage theirmaterial risk independently locally. to achieve this, need control theirbooks positions, locally independent governance control functionsthat report local board management – particularly area risk management,compliance internal audit.that bring u question book models. will back-to-back hedge still beaccepted? here, ssm expect bank euro area sufficient local capacity tomanage least evident portion euro-denominated business notto fully outsource entity within group. the local entity establishedin local market, ensure that, event group entity fail, canparticipate market autonomously. however, bundesbank naturally see theeconomic advantage back-to-back hedging. to extent, transaction theseserve pipeline international capital resource locations.some party hop overarch supervisory legal solution issue thecontinuity financial contracts. in response, i warn rely u this, notso much supervisory issue civil law problem.one important issue – foreign bank – supervision future third-country ccps uk. in bundesbank’s view, clear rule 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech safeguard ensure continental european authority sufficient right toobtain information robust power intervention respect uk ccps – otherwise, itseems relocation eu would unavoidable. the look whole issue, clearly see serious therepercussions ccps consider systemically important leave ourjurisdiction. volker brühl center financial study give systematic summaryof many aspect recent study topic. he set simulate painstakingaccuracy implication problem third-country ccp for:monetary policy transmission euro area,the function resolution regime,having recourse national central banks, especially bundesbank, lender oflast resort.these scenarios, i would supervisory influence whatsoever, fill withincreasing unease. and colleague, brian bussey u commodity future trade commission(cftc), stress lead supervisor crucial, say u interest lchthan anyone else world, i think already back third place. give theccp’s systemic importance euro area, would unacceptable. the econ committee european parliament recently take initial stanceregarding migration – here, too, possibility relocation continue play majorrole. for u bundesbank, matter structural policy trade issues. we arecompetitively mind neutral. our mandate safeguard price financial stability,and decision affect stability major way.these policy stance already stake clear, transparent framework expectation thessm.4 the future europe financial centreladies gentlemen, much greatly regret unite kingdom’s decision leave theeu, must nonetheless look forward consider financial service deliver inthe european union future.first, need observe consequence brexit perspective individualbank. bank far avoid make major changes, least alsobusy cop large-scale acute challenge financial implications. so easy tolose sight strategic issues. it’s brexit that’s shift tectonic plate bank –digitalisation regulation two key driver change. when traditional structure andmarkets break way, cake redivided – lose out, geta big slice. there real danger adhere cost traditional position london 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech risk miss new opportunity eu – though everybody: don’t willbe winners. so i would urge lose sight medium long-term strategic options.second, also consider repercussion brexit term impact eufinancial market whole. what look nothing le finance theeuropean economy, especially time global economic financial order isbecoming increasingly shaky. early eu initiative – single financial market, bankingunion, capital market union – inward focus. and london, europe aninternational financial centre. this change. hence question whether eu27 aspire develop globally competitive financial centre sum ofits part frankfurt, paris, amsterdam dublin. françois villeroy de galhau, governorof banque de france, recently speak integrate network centre specialise invarious activity – i think along lines, include major effort harnessdigital potential well.i would like help kick broad, forward-looking debate surround concept digitalfinancial centre europe.it’s idea base three pillars.first, network pillar. today, europe’s financial service potential spread variouslocations. it cumulative effect. however, fully-fledged financial ecosystem totruly flourish, need enough provider user financial service localmarket. at present, european financial centre tick box. the continental venue could,however, tap aggregate potential form network financialproduct buy sell quantity time, would expect aglobally competitive financial centre.the second pillar digitalisation. financial centre continental europe need robust digitalmarket infrastructure leverage state-of-the-art digital

neologism mergingthe word cooperation competition, european financial centre could cooperate, competeand, time, hone area expertise. but vision future.it’s picture future also much inherent interest central bank,because financial flow end system force, ableto promote financial price stability well strong currency.5 conclusionladies gentlemen, “brexit mean brexit” – end day, mean thefinancial

naïvelywhitewashing regrettable development, plan sober yet forward-looking 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech model.thank attention. 5 / 5bis central bankers' speech william c dudley: the transition robust reference rate regimeremarks mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reservebank new york, bank england’s market forum 2018, london, 24 may 2018.* * *thank you, mark, thank bank england opportunity talk importantissue reference rates. i focus remark today reference rate reform unitedstates—where been, are, headed. in short, i arguethat much already accomplished, still lot do—and musthappen within compress time frame. this important point andrew bailey usefullyunderscored u last year. because great uncertainty libor’s future risksto financial stability would likely accompany disorderly transition alternative referencerates, need aggressive action move durable resilient benchmark regime. asalways, i say reflect view federal open marketcommittee (fomc) federal reserve system.libor scandal demonstrate imperative reformalthough backdrop current reference rate reform effort well know here, somehistorical context useful consider issue face u today. that history highlightswhy alternative libor needed. it also illustrate importance continue focus onbank culture proper incentive order support financial stability long term. at core, problem face today financial system build tremendously largeedifice structurally impair foundation. while many industry cannot recall timewhen libor exist, fact, develop 1980s. since then, use oflibor reference rate exploded—with size financial contract reference u.s.-dollar libor today estimate close $200 trillion. the vast majority exposure arederivative obligations, interest rate swaps. but, tally also include trillion dollarsof cash products, residential commercial mortgages, corporate bond loans,and securitized products. and, new contract reference libor still written, thisbalance continue grow significantly. broadly speaking, reference rate vital efficient market functioning. they facilitate tradingin standardize contracts, low transaction cost increase market liquidity. robust reference rate also reduce information asymmetry risk misconduct byproviding transparent, independent pricing. but, case libor, foundation serious flaws. most notably, libor (and is)based submission individual banks—which, turn, base hypotheticalborrowing rate expert judgments, actual transactions. moreover, deficiency existedin regulatory oversight governance rate-setting mechanism. these vulnerabilitiesenabled manipulation rate financial benefit individual institutions. amidprofound breakdown control compliance, individual trader conspire ratesubmitters institution trader firm manipulate set rate toimprove trade results. during global financial crisis, panel bank also reportedlysubmitted low borrow rate could actually obtain marketplace. they soto disguise financial fragility time uncertainty bank liquidity solvency washigh. the result scandal particularly disturb scale flagrancy, includingcollusion employee across firms. it lead billion dollar fines, jail term someindividuals, severe reputational damage financial industry whole. the global123 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech financial crisis expose excessive risk-taking long series lapse judgment, thelibor scandal undermine trust ethical standard bank industry. the scandal provide many cautionary lessons, include way poor technicaldesign exploited, limitation self-regulation, problem arise loyalty isto one’s trade co-conspirators rather one’s institution, need robust controls. it also underscore power incentive drive individual firm thing areimprudent and/or unethical. and, governance control framework bank thelibor administrator place prove woefully insufficient prevent misconduct thatstemmed poor incentives. in context, one could say situation ripe forexploitation. the openness brazenness misconduct capture record transcript also pointto serious deficiency bank culture. my new york feed colleague i commentedfrequently need sound culture incentive complement effective regulationand supervision. while progress issue recent years, liborand rate-rigging scandals—not mention recent breakdown individual banks—point need strengthen bank culture. i look forward discussion withminouche andrew improve culture fix income, currency, commoditymarkets follow panel. one key lesson financial crisis critical piece financial systeminfrastructure must strong resilient, libor scandal underscore need. the essential problem libor inherent fragility “inverted pyramid,” thepricing hundred trillion dollar financial instrument rest expert judgment ofrelatively individuals, inform small base unsecured interbank transactions. moreover, base contract recent years, due many factors, includingregulatory reform quantitative ease program initiate central bank many themajor advance economies. relative vast sum u.s.-dollar libor contract imentioned earlier, median daily volume unsecured three-month u.s.-dollar wholesaleborrowing minuscule, around $1 billion, many day see le $500 million involume. this lack market liquidity mean rate cannot sufficiently transaction-based truly representative, rate transaction-based risk bemanipulated. so, despite effort improve libor recent years—and undoubtedly beenimportant change strengthen administration governance—the lack ofunderlying market liquidity nearly currency maturity remain problem, thereis obvious solution. the set libor still depend heavily expert judgment. even foru.s.-dollar libor, actual transaction basis one-third ratesubmissions tenor one three months. this noteworthy thematurities reference bulk financial contracts.in light history libor—and context $320 billion overall misconductfines since crisis—banks naturally reluctant assume legal risk associate withsubmitting quote base shallow markets. indeed, bank leftindividual libor panel recent years. andrew bailey drive home point july 2017speech. he explain financial conduct authority press hard persuade banksto remain panel voluntarily submit libor quote end 2021. libor’s potential cessation 2021 pose clear risk financial stability, prudent riskmanagement mean u must prepare world without libor. the official sector responsein recent years, international domestic authority alike actively work private456789101112 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech sector address libor’s shortcoming find alternative rates. one notable developmenthas publication international set principle financial benchmarks, developedby international organization security commission (iosco) 2013. theseprinciples—which include 19 specific standard across governance, benchmark quality,methodology, accountability—have emerge international standard. iosco hasrightly focus tie benchmark closely observable, arms-length transactions. thisrepresents important step toward eliminate excessive reliance expert judgment.the financial stability board (fsb) galvanize force international level. thefsb member publish proposals, plans, timeline reference rate reformand promote strengthen major interest rate benchmarks. the fsb beencarrying work development introduction alternative benchmarks, develop aplan accomplish transition new benchmarks, encourage work private sector oncontract robustness, report regularly progress made. the federal reserve play lead role development recommendation asapplied u.s.-dollar libor, work closely major financial regulatory agency inthe unite states. this effort also involve coordinate official sector sponsor ofsimilar effort around world. in late 2014, response fsb financial stabilityoversight council recommendations, federal reserve convene alternative referencerates committee (arrc)—a group market participant establish identify robustalternative u.s.-dollar reference rate risk-free nearly risk-free, fit need thederivatives market, compliant iosco principles. this effort parallel similarones jurisdiction find reference rate well-suited local condition andmarket needs—including uk’s work group sterling risk-free reference rates. thearrc also task develop transition plan facilitate adoption rate ina voluntary orderly manner, consider best practice contract design preparefor possibility libor cease published. publication alternative reference rate federal reservethe arrc make important progress achieve mandate. notably, june 2017, itselected secure overnight finance rate, sofr, prefer alternative u.s.-dollar libor. sofr broad measure cost borrow cash overnight use u.s.treasury security collateral, thus relevant wide range market participants. therate entirely transaction-based, underlie market robust, current daily volumeof $700 billion. (by comparison, unsecured three-month u.s.-dollar wholesaleborrowing total roughly $1 billion per day, i mention earlier.) sofr move closely withlibor money market rate time, cover multiple segment therepo market, provide scope future market evolution. besides resistant tomanipulation, nearly risk-free rate also prove much resilient period offinancial stress, u.s. treasury repo market likely remain deep activeduring episodes. the new york feed administer produce sofr cooperation office financialresearch. we begin publish rate april 3 year, along two repo rates:the tri-party general collateral rate broad general collateral rate. this workcomplements step federal reserve promote great transparency rate inunsecured market enhancement calculation effective federal fund rate(effr) launch entirely new rate, overnight bank fund rate (obfr). i long proponent idea central bank well suit take thisresponsibility. reference rate strong public good properties, private sector facesnotable coordination challenge area. central bank long history produce suchmeasures—recognizing traditionally purpose relate monetary policy—13141516171819 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech trust independent parties. in view, central bank also ultimately “own” financialstability risk present key reference rate flawed. good recognize thisresponsibility move proactively mitigate risk step aside hope thatsomeone else take mantle reform. the federal reserve design benchmark compliant iosco principles,with regular review oversight body comprehensive ethic conflict-of-interest policiesfor staff. best practice also dictate administrator periodically review rate theyproduce ass whether change underlie market require change thoserates administered. we dedicate significant resource efforts, arecommitted continue production rate market participant confidenceabout long-term viability. for reasons, federal reserve concur arrc sofr represent acompelling alternative u.s.-dollar libor—particularly derivative transactions, wherea near risk-free rate appropriate rate incorporate bank credit riskpremium. nevertheless, market adoption sofr face challenges, development ofsufficient liquidity derivative reference sofr, establishment term referencerate, i discus moment. these element build time. thearrc’s pace transition plan lay timeline milestone must reach thecoming quarter year successful transition. i confident arrc willsucceed, take considerable attention effort.progress already evident. the chicago mercantile exchange begin offer sofr futurescontracts early month, trade activity get good start. development ofsofr derivatives, turn, support creation term reference rate. although thearrc’s transition plan anticipate complete end 2021, would bebetter occur expeditiously. the good news broadly appreciated. in thisvein, committee’s second report discuss term rate alternatives, anddevelopment proposal term reference rate recently add mandate. in thisregard, i would also encourage market participants, academics, interest party tocontribute effort develop term reference rate.another key area focus—further motivate andrew’s warning—is development offallback contract language event libor cease published. the absence suchlanguage create potential large-scale disorder global financial market liborgo away. put simply, unacceptable risk. the international swap dealer association(isda) work issue derivative market expect issue aconsultative document soon prove instrumental make progress. thearrc also coordinate similar effort across cash product types. the goal isto achieve consensus consistent approach across market whenever feasible. look aheadas i note previously, libor continue significant shortcoming despitestrengthened governance recent years, uncertainty future grow overtime. this uncertainty reflect limit liquidity underlie libor correspond legalrisks i discuss earlier. but, i also skeptical whether libor ever adequatelytransaction-based. a andrew highlighted, guarantee libor continue existbeyond december 2021. in view, libor likely go away—and should, notsupported sufficiently robust regime. the libor countdown clock provide animpetus action, also make market participant regulator increasinglynervous approach deadline—especially longer-term solution train in2021 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech place. time essence, must manage well. the arrc others lay outvaluable transition plans, need ensure execute expeditiously well. of course, i mean minimize cost involved. this monumental complicatedeffort—one industry never undertaken—and entail overcome manyobstacles. it require collective action wide variety market participants, whommay fully convince need change. and, may others directinterest preservation libor—such administrator—who may support movingaway status quo. there also undoubtedly seek free ride theefforts others. and, course, effort encounter inertia wishful thinking. all isto expect large undertake significant upfront costs. nevertheless, delay isnot viable option. this task bear necessity. financial crisis typically result fail identifyvulnerabilities, unexpected trigger turn vulnerability point weaknessthat lead catastrophic failure. the discontinuation libor, however, different. wecan see coming, know impact disorderly transition would huge. therefore,a half-hearted effort failure act would inexcusable, especially learnedfrom experience financial crisis. move core piece global financial systemto firm durable foundation essential worth cost. this task admittedly hard, i optimistic give past successes. we havedemonstrated effective collective action provide solution longstanding structuralvulnerabilities financial system. a key lesson crisis structural vulnerabilitiesmust address continually. if ignored, large problem eventually result. forexample, collective action past decade, successfully addressedstructural weakness tri-party repo market, over-the-counter derivative market, andmoney market mutual funds. each challenge require tailor solution rely different tools—including adiverse mix market, regulatory supervisory measures—to get job done. everythingisn’t nail, best tool always hammer. you identify problem thatneeds fix select right tool job. this likely require official sectorengagement private sector initiative. in case libor, official sector take multi-pronged approach: strengthen thelibor regime, develop reference rate principles, use convene authority marshalprivate sector participation, supply robust alternative reference rates, use bully pulpitto educate spur action. international coordination feature strongly efforts, andshould continue so. this approach achieve great deal date, but, light therisks potential implications, sufficient? the transition away libor represent significant risk event firm sizes, theyshould actively manage transition exist framework identification,management, mitigation risk. supervisor continue support objective byensuring firm aware transition libor-related issue beingaddressed way commensurate firm’s exposure risks. more broadly, theofficial sector continue push market participant take necessary step mitigate therisks financial stability disorderly transition. in closing, libor scandal certainly one low point among many financial crisisand aftermath. it highlight need reform critical area global financialsystem. we make considerable progress since then, reform still long way go. the remain work, necessity, involve purposeful collective action engagementacross financial industry address market-wide issues. it also require firm-specificaction manage individual risks. the challenge window action narrowing. 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech therefore, must redouble effort ensure successful transition libor moresound durable regime. thank kind attention. i would happy take questions. jam bergin,

describe monetary policy strategy. the basis strategy riksbank shall strive towards annual change 2 per cent consumer price index fix interest rate (cpif). give confidence inflation target, monetary policy shall also support good growth output employment. the riksbank therefore conduct generally refer flexible inflation targeting. this basic framework monetary policy. within framework, riksbank must cope fact economy way work change time. my intention today discus challenge face monetary policy economic policy general result change occur last decade. in brief, question surprisingly subdue wage increases, apparent difficulty reduce unemployment via expansionary policy alone, apparent deterioration match labour market. i intend discus help simple survey, i look five key variable covary. the time period i’m study 2007–2018 i’m use monthly data. the five key variable are: • inflation, measure cpif, target variable monetary policy • wage increases, accord short-term wage statistic national institute economic research (nier) • unemployment, accord labour force survey (lfs) • job openings, accord statistic swedish public employment service (arbetsförmedlingen) remain job open ∗ i would especially like thank mikael apel emelie theobald help speech. meredith beechey, charlotta edler, jesper hansson, ann-leena mikiver, åsa olli segendorf, cecilia roos-isaksson ulf söderström submit valuable comments. 2 [16] • krona exchange rate, accord trade-weighted kix index. in order focus trend five variables, i remove seasonal variation general noise series use move average twelve month throughout. we follow time series variable two time. by so, see covariation inflation unemployment, example. look data good place start it important understand covariation two variable necessarily mean causal relationship, causality, them. instead, covariation may, example, depend third variable shown. a classic example strong correlation sleep shoe wake headache. but presumably imply shoe cause headache. there instead underlie variable explain person sleep shoe wake headache. we also aware plot two variable other, rare expect find clear-cut correlation type see textbook illustrations. the reason is, course, variable link also constantly influence number factors. for example, inflation affect change energy price significant impact unemployment. unemployment can, turn, affect reform labour market, example, significant effect inflation, least immediately. in words, cannot expect see exact relationship often content barely able detect one. on hand, absence correlation visible eye mean isn’t one. it may still detectable control variable two studying. to gain good understand happen behind scenes, therefore, often delve deep data, consider variable use sophisticate analytical method “eyeball econometrics”. but study exactly data look like always good starting-point. so let’s look figures! the phillips curve – central controversial allow begin correlation normally call “the phillips curve”. the name come new zealand economist, william phillips, who, article 1958, show negative correlation unemployment wage increase british data period 1861–1957. high unemployment tend therefore associate low wage increase vice versa, figure 1. when many people compete jobs, demand high wage increase fall shortage labour lead great wage increases. 3 [16] figure 1. the phillips curve subsequently, phillips curve concept broaden accommodate slightly different, though similar, correlations. in 1960, two american economists, paul samuelson robert solow, award prize economic science memory alfred nobel, reformulate curve term unemployment inflation rather unemployment wage increases. a close relationship unemployment output, phillips curve also often formulate term correlation inflation output – or, commonly express nowadays, resource utilisation. but basically thing want identify, namely correlation economic activity rate increase price wages. for time, phillips curve interpret economic policy-makers able choose combination inflation unemployment. this think possible aim permanent reduction unemployment willingness accept high inflation return. but ten year launch phillips curve, milton friedman edmund phelps, nobel laureate economics themselves, lay foundation so-called “expectations-augmented phillips curve”. in brief, imply short-term negative correlation inflation unemployment, long-term relationship. in words, possible choose certain combination inflation unemployment expect last. the reason behind illustrate use figure 2. unemploymentwage increase 4 [16] figure 2. the expectations-augmented phillips curve the short-term correlation basically depend fact high inflation often unexpected inflation. an expansionary policy lead low unemployment high inflation; move a b. but gradually, agent economy realise inflation rise demand high wage increase compensation. in words, high inflation incorporate expectation become norm, high wage increase cause unemployment rise. the short-term correlation shift upwards move b c. we back unemployment started, high inflation. if thing repeated, would move similar way c d e. once again, unemployment inflation higher. this unemployment normally refer “equilibrium unemployment”. a consequence thus expansionary monetary policy cannot permanently create high employment low unemployment. the long-run phillips curve therefore assume vertical, show figure. it’s good keep mind, i won’t discus long-run phillips curve here. instead, i concentrate short-run phillips curve, important piece puzzle economic policy-makers, least central banks. it link demand economy, central bank assume able influence policy rates, inflation. negatively slop phillips curve inflation – flat wage increase so correlation look like swedish data? a i mention introduction, i look data last decade. to make figure clearer, i mark period 2007–2010 blue period 2011 red. unemploymentinflationlong run phillips curveabcde 5 [16] figure 3. inflation unemployment annual percentage change share labour force note. move average 12 months. sources: statistic sweden riksbank a see figure 3, reasonably clear negative correlation whole period. the follow additional observation make look little closer: (i) during period 2015–2017, inflation rise unemployment fell. (ii) over last six months, unemployment fall inflation remain level consistent inflation target. (iii) for give level unemployment, inflation tend low recent year period 2007–2010. a i noted, original phillips curve formulate term wage growth inflation. so curve look like sweden last decade? see entire period, correlation also seem negative figure 4. but look development since 2011 particular, appear correlation – the phillips correlation seem le horizontal. despite good economic development especially recent years, many believe midst economic boom, wage growth increased. why this? 01234012345.56.06.57.07.58.08.59.0inflationunemployment201820072011 6 [16] figure 4. wage increase unemployment annual percentage change share labour force note. move average 12 months. sources: statistic sweden, swedish national mediation office riksbank first all, remember are, all, talk rather short period time. in words, still slightly early draw conclusion form structural change take place labour market affect development future. but obviously, nevertheless interest reflect cause development. it also worth point fact unusually low wage growth, give activity economy, specifically swedish phenomenon. the situation much industrialise country underlie reason currently subject rather intensive discussion.1 a flexible labour supply possible explanation in view, important overarch explanation labour supply probably become flexible elastic previously. in words, supply curve labour market flatter. this imply great resource utilisation necessarily lead high wage increases. when demand economy rises, satisfy labour draft production process, without much pressure increase wages. a i see it, primarily three probable cause behind flexible elastic labour supply. the first globalisation increase economic integration. globalisation, hence rise trade, increase labour supply indirect way. by this, i mean product previously manufacture inside 1 see instance leduc wilson (2017). 12345123455.566.577.588.59wage increaseunemployment201120072018 7 [16] country domestic labour often manufacture abroad, often cheaply, imported. this imply global labour supply affect domestic wage increases, especially regard le educate workforce. economic integration within eu affect labour supply direct way result free movement labour within union. many utilise opportunity provide free movement – move permanently, others work temporarily country within union. the cause technological development. the electronic revolution make possible organise work different way previously. for example, make teleworking much possible. this occur inside sweden also form teleworking country organisation locate sweden. teleworking make possible use labour force flexibly business cycle, work part-time economic activity low full-time activity high. the third cause change institution broad sense. a concrete swedish example collective agreement contain agreement work time “banks”. accord agreements, number hour work employee redistribute business cycle. another example emergence temporary employment agency sweden. from upon time illegal, industry currently 80,000 strong. in 2017, 250,000 employ temporary employment industry area temporary staffing, career transition direct recruitment. in sweden, also see great labour supply among old people. accord lf first quarter 2018, almost four per cent employ 65 74 year old. one assume labour supply flexible. if add explanation together, perhaps strange correlation resource utilisation nominal wage increase seem weaken recent years. other explanation also feasible but also feasible explanation observation figure 4. one normally refer “structural unemployment”, unemployment level situation normal activity economy, fallen.2 an overestimation structural unemployment imply spare capacity economy originally think thereby possible stimulate demand wage growth kick in. the fact structural unemployment cannot observe also vary time obviously make difficult verify hypothesis. purely theoretically, observation wage increase unexpectedly low well line overestimation structural unemployment. personally, i little sceptical 2 for example, bell blanchflower (2018) think case unite kingdom. 8 [16] hypothesis far sweden concerned. i come back late on. another possible explanation low wage increase inflation develop financial crisis. for six years, 2011 2017, cpif inflation often well target. it would particularly surprise certain impact economic agent generally believe inflation. it true inflation expectations, measure surveys, indicate economic agent expect inflation remain target long term. it also appear employee organisation increasingly see inflation target basis wage negotiations. at time, however, employer claim inflation target long obvious starting-point. accord swedish association industrial employers, instead competitiveness wage outcome euro area constitute benchmark.3 the implication obvious. ultimately, outcome depend respective party’s negotiate strength. but since wage increase germany, example, tend quite modest since industrial sector’s wage agreement turn constitute benchmark collective agreement sweden, conceivable could contribute flat phillips curve since 2011 figure 4. in long term, however, major problem euro area inflation target “close 2 per cent”, i.e. close target. this imply wage increase also high euro area go forward. but tension may arise periodically, course. all all, therefore, numerous feasible explanation wage increase relatively low despite good economic development. but far definitive answer like permanent phenomenon is. research phillips curve ongoing a i mentioned, discussion phillips curve international high degree. quite lively debate take place various country recently centre intensive estimation phillips curves, use slightly different specification different methods.4 this i mean i say need advance method study pairwise plots, order try come grip correlation actual look like. in context, interest mention fresh contribution debate originate school business örebro university, sune karlsson pär österholm estimate phillips curve u sweden respectively term inflation unemployment. for sweden period 1995–2017, phillips curve has, perhaps surprisingly, find stable time. it also find phillips curve, 3 see, example, kinnwall rune (2018). 4 see example blanchard (2016), cunliffe (2017) murphy (2018). 9 [16] specify way, become flat recent years. the phillips curve also find unstable us. it appear flat 2005–2013 thereafter clear negative slope. it understand economic research help improve knowledge find many different quarter thrash hopefully eventually point particular direction. find far vary great deal. off on, phillips curve say dead, still alive flat usual. my interpretation “the jury still out” common find study perform seem correlation economic situation inflation wage increase weakened, still there. correlation job open wage increase the number people unemployed measure indicate unsatisfied labour supply, i.e. number people would like job yet obtain one. the unsatisfied labour demand, i.e. job open remain unfilled, also measure similar way. the unsatisfied labour demand, labour shortage normally refer to, normally measure term job vacancies. in statistics, discrepancy make job vacancy job openings. the fact employer job open mean employer start external recruitment employee yet employ someone. this wide concept vacancy, define “vacant, unstaffed job take immediately”. the difference job open staffed, example supply worker perform work temporarily. but also unstaffed without necessarily possible someone fill immediately. one reason employer plan well advance start recruitment good time need become acute. a i note introduction, fact i point rather subtle technical discrepancy i choose highlight various correlation past decade use monthly data. in swedish statistics, monthly data job openings, job vacancy report quarterly. even though would desirable many way use vacancies, i therefore use job open approximation. if look data, make much difference context, still good know i simplify little job open job vacancy really thing. if view job open measure labour demand, could see relationship job open wage increase kind inverse phillips curve. in way relationship wage increase unemployment expect negative, correlation wage increase job open positive. 10 [16] figure 5. wage increase job open annual percentage change share labour force note. move average 12 months. sources: swedish national mediation office, swedish public employment service riksbank figure 5 indicate really case period. see entire period, correlation, anything, negative. if look development since 2011, curve almost horizontal, reflect wage increase low stable. we look correlation wage increase unemployment wage increase number job openings. let u complete cycle also study third possible combination, is, correlation number job open unemployment. the beveridge curve show well labour market function the correlation job openings, job vacancy exact, unemployment another well-known curve within economics. it call beveridge curve like phillips curve develop 1958. in contrast phillips curve, however, william beveridge originator curve, british economist give name curve result commitment labour issue unemployment skill matching. the beveridge curve way measure well labour market functioning. it reasonable assume demand economy high, number job open rise unemployment falls, vice versa. the correlation therefore negative. but position beveridge curve interesting. if large number job open time unemployment high, suggest 123451234500.511.522.5wage increasejob openings201120072018 11 [16] unemployed cannot reason fill openings. in words, problem match job-seekers job open labour market, i.e. labour market function particularly well. what beveridge curve look like swedish data last decade? a see figure 6, correlation negative, exactly expected. but also see correlation 2011 high previously, i.e. give level unemployment, great number job openings. in words, seem though match swedish labour market bad before. figure 6. job open unemployment annual percentage change share labour force note. move average 12 months. sources: swedish public employment service, statistic sweden riksbank what overall conclusion therefore draw simple correlation i presented? well, look merely data, low unemployment lead high wage increases. it has, hand, associate rise number job openings. it altogether easy interpret development. one interpretation could, however, company financial crisis have, great extent, look recruit worker different type cutting-edge expertise. this unfortunately type labour often difficult find. this also impression i get i travel around country talk different companies. if high wage offered, type labour, nevertheless appear prevent shortage labour emerge segment labour market. 00.511.522.500.511.522.55.566.577.588.59job openingsunemployment201120072018 12 [16] on increasingly dominant “traditional” labour market, however, labour shortage seem major problem. there, flexible labour supply help restrain wage increases, way i describe earlier. why inflation risen? the phillips correlation measure term inflation negatively slop since 2011, term wage increases, completely flat. how inflation rise despite wage increase do so? inflation rise steadily 2014 2017, measure term cpif, around 0.5 per cent level consistent inflation target 2 per cent. it course difficult identify exact impact individual factor inflation, nevertheless possible highlight thing play part. one factor affect cpif rather direct straightforward way change international market price energy. particularly 2017, high energy price help fuel cpif inflation. early period, contribution energy price instead negative. another factor, difficult capture inhibitory effect long time, international economic activity. in sweden, resource utilisation rise quite long time, make easy company raise prices. at time, however, weak uncertain economic situation abroad contribute low external price pressures. recently, however, increasingly strong international economic activity push inflation upwards many countries. more inflation impulse abroad also improve condition inflation rate line target. a factor probably also contribute high inflation rise short- long-term inflation expectations, measure surveys, since 2015. since end 2016, long-term inflation expectation close inflation target 2 per cent. actual inflation obviously affect expectations, converse also true. when confidence inflation target strong, become easy reach target, price wage formation adapt expectations. the development exchange rate also contribute upturn inflation. in simple theoretical framework, change price level, i.e. inflation, affect fluctuation exchange rate.5 but correlation difficult find. if compare exchange rate fluctuation inflation period, correlation zero. however, exchange rate influence inflation time lag. the correlation inflation exchange rate fluctuation twelve month previously 0.19 data material. if lag exchange rate fluctuation twelve months, correlation increase 0.43. the maximum correlation (0.46) occur time lag 27 months. it become clear positive correlation exchange rate 5 in model price rigid, inflation rate instead affect level exchange rate, real exchange rate’s deviation long-term value. 13 [16] fluctuation inflation, see figure 7. when krona weakens, i.e. kix-index increases, inflation also rises. figure 7. inflation exchange rate fluctuations, 27-month time lag annual percentage change note. move average 12 months. sources: statistic sweden riksbank of course, correlation exchange rate inflation neither clear-cut straightforward. it depends, example, cause exchange rate fluctuate long expect last.6 but fact correlation, insofar weaken exchange rate tend result rise inflation vice versa, obvious. finally, emphasise monetary policy course important development. from ongoing debate, impression sometimes monetary policy play major role economic activity strong inflation target regardless policy conduct riksbank. this course case. no causal relationship wage price what fact inflation rise wage actually signify? to begin with, sake completeness, also plot inflation wage increase (see figure 8). a see, tendency towards positive correlation, least periodically. 6 see instance article “the impact exchange rate inflation” december 2016 monetary policy report “the exchange rate inflation” april 2018 monetary policy report. 00.511.522.500.511.522.5-10-5051015inflationexchange rate fluctuations20182011 14 [16] figure 8. inflation wage increase annual percentage change note. move average 12 months. sources: national mediation office, statistic sweden riksbank but causal relationships? there sometimes appear tendency see wage increase source inflation. the perceive chain event increase inflation always precede tight labour market push wage increase company pass increase cost form high prices. can therefore expect modest wage increase push inflation go forward? no, unshakeable causal relationship wage increase inflation exist. it easily case strong demand allow company increase prices. this increase profit margins, turn provide scope raise wages. the interplay prices, wage activity economy – course number variables, least productivity – complex. there quite study examine link wage increase future inflation whether wage increase tend precede lag behind inflation. not unexpectedly, find vary somewhat, fairly common find seem wage increase particularly informative come forecast inflation.7 the fact wage increase modest need therefore signify inflation fall period ahead. personally, i believe inflation long-term inflation expectation remain close 2 per cent go forward, even monetary policy make slightly le expansionary. 7 see instance peneva rudd (2017). 00.511.522.5300.511.522.532.02.53.03.54.04.5inflationwage increase200720112018 15 [16] with inflation target – new challenge so allow summarise. i think survey present three important economic policy challenges. an important starting-point inflation target. it around target 2 per cent outcome expectation time. target attainment good. occasional monthly variation odd tenth percentage point around 2 per cent mark must determine monetary policy, i see it. and give inflation target, scope consider important macroeconomic variables. the first challenge several year correlation unemployment vacancy one hand wage increase other. unemployment fall wage increase remain steady around 2 per cent annual rate. inflation indeed climb back target without help wage increases, show inflation necessarily wage-driven. but still reason ask oneself permanent subdue wage increase are. the second challenge unemployment. the key question is: ha unemployment bottom out? or fall expansionary monetary policy? my assessment possible bring unemployment much monetary policy alone. in view, increase demand labour currently witness likely lead increase labour supply low unemployment. this also labour force survey flow statistic show. further reduction unemployment require measure policy areas. the third final challenge fact skill match labour market deteriorated. this imply output employment high could without match problems. monetary policy scarcely improve match swedish labour market. here, too, measure policy area required. it question increase productivity among unemployed person reduce cost employ them. labour market policy crucial role play here. 16 [16] reference bell, d.n.f. d.g. blanchflower (2018), “the

* disclaimer: view express speech personal view necessarily reflect institution i affiliate with. 2 1. introduction remark state euro area economy at global level, i official representative bank

strike balance classic struggle solidarity national responsibility, ‘new wine old bottle’, namely risk-sharing (namely mutualisation costs) versus risk reduction. especially south europe, strong feel balance unstable order make stable symmetrical; need strong european institutions. to quote winston churchill, great european, “to best enough; sometimes must required”. the ultimate risk rise

decision make romanian leu enter erm2. i advise would right time enter euro area. any decision adopt single currency people democratic institutions. but i would like give word caution concern conversion rate currency euro remark apply candidate country euro area membership, romania. this conversion rate key euro area accession and, fixed, irrevocable participate currency. with benefit hindsight, i could share greek euro area accession experience, debatable even today entry euro back 2001 make valid conversion rate (overvalued); also many people claim 15 country need time put economy order. ex post, evident country’s economic devastation trigger global financial crisis back 2008, turn full-blown double crisis, namely sovereign bank crisis, country. in case romania, thing quite simple. you don’t look eu forecast convergence report find out. all listen wise man lucky country: ask central bank governor mugur isarescu who, aware, widely regard one handful top central

code forthe financial service industrywelcome address m jessica chew cheng lian, deputy governor central bank ofmalaysia (bank negara malaysia), launch fspb professional code financialservices industry, kuala lumpur, 24 may 2018.* * *i delight witness launch financial service professional board(fspb) professional code financial service industry. thank allow anopportunity offer brief remark morning importance initiative banknegara malaysia’s perspective. let begin say launch code come time issue culture andconduct financial industry become important focal point financial regulators.after hive activity largely focus strengthen prudential rule standards, anacknowledgement behaviour ultimately regulate something run deep thanrulebooks. it easy thing put finger on. regulator talk “the waythings get done” institution, “the human element everyday decisions”. we like thinkof one behave one watching. on score, financial industry could better. despite much publicity widespreadefforts tackle issue, incident misconduct continue cast dark shadow thefinancial service industry across world. this worrying, misconduct erode trustin system. if investors, depositor policy holder stop believe interest arebeing safeguarded, entire system quickly come unravel significant cost society.these cost arise failure financial institutions, misallocation economicresources, simply steep fine destroy shareholder value employment prospect foraffected workers. since global financial crisis, bank pay usd320 billion fine legalcosts subject numerous government financial inquiry due misconduct.in malaysia, last 5 years, bank negara malaysia impose fine financial servicesproviders tune rm116 million. a survey conduct bank reveal almost two-thirds report loss bank 2016 associate internal fraud, regulatory non-compliance operational lapses. we examine incident depth. our observation lead u conclude thatbehaviour much influence bycontextual factor organisational values, incentivesand management response misconduct non-compliance. the rightcontextual set canexert powerful influence individual behaviour. we believe begin set clearlycommunicating expectation desire behaviour. without clarity acceptable thefirst place, would possible encourage, much le enforce, expectations.the fspb serf important role regard work define developingcodes behaviour financial institutions.given strong focus financial regulator conduct culture, professional codeswill matter greatly go forward important complement regulatory standards.the fspb well place lead support initiative establish standard conduct thefinancial industry. it standard serve useful framework financial institution andprofessional body develop specific guidance employee members; theyalso serve embody industry’s collective commitment socially responsible value 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech ethics. for example, i note interest professional code launch today commit todealing counterparties, include supplier agent “subscribe sound ethicalprinciples”. matter environmental footprint human right record third partyproviders typical obligation currently find regulatory standards, yet, arematters great importance. they reflection value industry, matter tomany conscientious consumer age increasingly accessible information.given central role financial service economy, issue likely move fromthe periphery increasingly important business considerations. at global level, arealready see great attention give sustainable responsible finance. in many cases, itwill require industry draw experience beyond traditional core competency mostfinancial service providers. the industry, fsbp, demonstrate much neededbusiness leadership address broad ethical question increasingly confront u asa society global citizens.apart end write codes, also important value simply frankconversations share ethical challenges. in unite kingdom, senior banker gottogether discus way reform organisational culture follow widespread ppi mis-selling scandals, would consider “too little late”. we need bring suchdiscussions forward actively encourage process would allow industry get frontof emerge issue around professional conduct ethics. these include examine issue likehow institution might go gain pulse culture various level within theorganisation, effect incentive structure behaviour.with digital revolution, increase need industry come together toset standard novel area practice. already much buzz use ofartificial intelligence big data finance. this create opportunity innovation, efficiencyand growth, also new risks, challenge – without doubt – difficult ethical question onlines draw prevent unfair, systematic, discrimination specific groups,(for instance result algorithmic programs) inappropriate use personal data andexcessive volatility high-frequency trading.as industry navigate issues, share commitment common set value hasnever critical build trust – customers, employees, financialinstitutions, public large. there compel economic, social moral,reasons so. it encourage healthy competition, efficient sustainable markets, andconsistently high level performance long term.the fspb, however, cannot achieve alone. deliberate sustain effort industrywill need engage, communicate, educate internalise share values. by pool input across industry, rich work example develop shed light onhow ethical principle apply practice. the consequence misconduct also beclear unambiguous firmly entrench behavioural norm – within individual financialinstitutions industry level. a aware, move direction already beingtaken requirement financial institution capture share information employeemisconduct inform hire decision begin july year. the bank part continue provide credible deterrent misconduct throughenforcement actions. with enactment financial service act 2013, bank nothesitated use wide enforcement power include stiff administrative penalty providedunder financial service act bring institution book serious conduct breaches, andbarring individual hold senior role financial institutions. we continue pursueinvestigations enforcement action serious conduct breach full extent powersprovided law administer bank. beyond limit bank’s powers, bank 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech maintain close cooperation authority facilitate investigation enforcementactions. conclusionbuilding trust easy. it take hard work, determination right thing confidenceto make judgement situation always well-defined. take context, workof fspb serf important anchor decision action engender trust inthe financial industry. in fast move world, strong commitment professional code ofconduct provide assurance public seek – financial institution employeesare hold consistently demonstrate high standard professional ethicalconduct. i hope industry continue lend strong support fspb’s work. followingtoday’s launch professional code, bank would urge financial institution andprofessional body reflect standard set code value conduct thatyou demand staff, agent members. this need move beyond symbolic gestures,to diligent implementation policy program promote desire culture. thebank confident fspb continue play important role support efforts– include work identify implementation challenges, develop solution andintroduce improvement reflect emerge issues.the financial industry demonstrate leadership many area – surely none asimportant leadership something fundamental professional ethical conduct. onthat note, let commend congratulate fspb important, andcertainly relevant initiative. 3 / 3bis central bankers' speech benoît cœuré: interview die zeitinterview mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank,in die zeit,

billion theeuropean central bank. they since withdraw demand, it’s still shock,isn’t it? the political discussion still ongoing italy. the ecb ass new government’s planswhen make public.so, make question general: ecb relieve euro area country fromthe debt owe country?no, cannot. european treaty prohibit debt relief. central bank cannot financegovernments.the coalition agreement include tax cut spend increase add morethan €100 billion accord estimates. italy already heavily indebted country. areyou concerned?again, it’s early comment plan don’t know. on fiscal policy general, ecb’sview well known: europe fiscal rule respected. this matter oftrust common currency.the ecb’s large-scale purchase government bond highly controversial,especially germany. many critic feel vindicated. wouldn’t true saythat buy bonds, nobody would able call debtrelief?it’s simple. the purchase government bond within mandate. it prove decisivein enable euro area economy overcome crisis restore growth pricestability europe. that i always defend actions. and design assetpurchase programme way breach treaties. how that? for example, set strict limit much buy, safeguard function thebond market. moreover, purchase mainly make national central banks, buytheir national government bond risk: bundesbank buy german governmentbonds, banca d’italia buy italian government bonds, forth. they would bearthe bulk loss government could service debt. i always support thisarrangement ensure ecb introduce fiscal union thebackdoor.that mean italian fail repay debt would first instanceharm themselves. the italian central bank would bear heavy losses.i can’t comment hypothetical scenarios.the euro area head state government want launch reform monetary union 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech june. a say yourself, economy growing, crisis over. why needfor yet reforms? indeed, euro area expansion strong broad based. but christine lagarde, headof international monetary fund, often say [quoting jf kennedy]: time repair roof iswhen sun shining. europe make stable past years, arenot yet right time complete job. have honestly ever meet politician fix roof sun shining?most start repair it’s raining.that understandable, you’re right, mean next crisis occur europeanleaders improvise wobbly solution hectic late-night meet inbrussels. i don’t think that’s citizen expect europe governed.but isn’t precisely europe always governed?it height debt crisis, situation time unprecedented. theproblem late-night meet that, get thing do indeed succeed indoing then, type improvise decision-making sow seed mistrust – betweengovernments, citizen politicians. it tenable situation. europe need stablerules institutions. in connection, ecb call european deposit insurance scheme. sogerman bank would pay towards reimburse saver italy spain banksin country failed. how would make europe resilient crises?let put discussion perspective. we need three line defence monetaryunion. the first well-functioning private markets, yet fully place. thesingle market need completed, particularly service sector. capital market alsostill domestic. the second line defence sound fiscal policy memberstates. most country reduce deficit, mainly thank favourablecyclical conditions. fiscal improvement make structural, otherwise government won’thave fiscal space next recession hits. euro area-wide protection mechanism asthe european stability mechanism, single resolution fund banks, new depositinsurance scheme third line defence. all exist currency union orsimilar mechanism safeguard stability currency.what exactly deposit insurance protect u against?for one, enhance confidence bank system prevent saver emptyingtheir bank account crisis situation. history teach u bank run highlydangerous.that sound fine, germany different perspective: common depositinsurance scheme mean german would also affect if, say, bank italyfailed. to return metaphor: rains, roof would bad state therepair before. why agree that?with proper european deposit insurance scheme, german would few problem ratherthan more. a deposit insurance scheme see insurance economicrisks, take liability insurance protect risk accident. ifrisks properly priced, it’s system transfer country still le the“north” “south”, often argued. of course, bank would need reducerisks deposit insurance scheme introduced. much do recently thatrespect. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech and reform can’t manage june? at moment, party seem busy draw red lines. it would send positivesignal think achieve together. let give two reason isurgent. first, know next crisis look like? if monetary union madestronger now, ecb come rescue next time crisis,and may lead u test limit mandate. who know next crisis willlook like? that’s german expect central bank, rightly so. second, world isin disarray, many expect europe show way. fail decide future wouldsend signal don’t know want.germany cautious europe moment. olaf scholz say agerman finance minister first foremost german finance minister. do find thatdisappointing?absolutely not. mr scholz job. and also say strengthen europe veryimportant german government. what surprise debate germany thatthe impression often give half europe germany’s money.isn’t case? no, it’s put right rule place, strengthen euro area’s institutionsand make sure goods, service capital market work better. all germany’sinterest. and european country buy german products, also becausegerman save invest europe. but french government also argue european budget europeanfinance minister. that money. i believe euro area fiscal capacity useful finance investment, include ineconomic downturn – provided, course, member state respect europe’s fiscal rule inthe first place. many politician don’t like tell ecb do. i know central banker sometimes get politicians’ nerves. but job keep thecurrency stable, require stable political foundations. the condition improve thesefoundations rarely good now, economy well.and trade dispute escalate? a fully fledge trade war would negative impact. at ecb we’ve analyse theimpact increase tariff worldwide. the result pretty bleak. but that’s weare right now. economic growth moderate recently, exceptionally high levels. so,we concern moment. we expect economic expansion continue, andwe increasingly confident inflation rise towards aim below, close to, 2%. so soon able end asset purchases? at end last year i say i didn’t expect asset purchase programme would needto extend again. i see reason change view.what mean exactly?the programme currently expect run september. we still need discussionabout exactly end. 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech oh, think end mean end it, i.e. stop september.the baseline

(equally leave eu allow economy trade invest openly uk channel likely support uk productivity). we don’t know whether long-run channel already operation. but possible contribute reinforce continue weakness productivity growth.6 in short run know uncertainty eventual outcome brexit negotiations, perhaps expectation brexit low economic growth time, depress business investment. business wait clarity embark new capital projects, reduce productive capacity relative could been, well hamper resource re-allocation across economy. we see clearly business surveys. brexit consistently rank near

persistent effect incomes: real household income rise 0.2% seven quarter since referendum, compare average growth 1½ % per year five year prior (chart 6). give slow real income growth, could argue it’s surprise household haven’t adjust consumption even more. consumption growth certainly slowed: average around 0.3% per quarter since referendum, compare 0.6% previous five year nearly 0.9% pre-crisis decade. but household also aggregate reduce save – household save rate fall two per cent income (chart 7). whether household maintain low rate saving, mpc’s central forecast, remain see –

income.11 finally, third channel brexit affect uk economy effect exchange rate. i already discuss effect recent depreciation demand, contribute rotation away consumption towards net trade. equally important mpc effect inflation. i hardly need remind inflation conference cpi inflation overshoot mpc’s 2% target year now, peak 3.1% last autumn. that overshoot almost entirely reflect effect depreciation. uk non-fuel import price rise 7% since referendum, direct result low exchange rate. if anything little le expect base past experience, revise inflation forecast slightly last inflation report reflect that. but nevertheless enough generate significant overshoot. why mpc act prevent overshoot? after all, committee know coming. one reason lag raise bank rate low inflation long enough would unlikely able offset full effect import prices. but substantive reason face trade-off growth inflation. the mpc’s remit give u two clear objectives. the first objective, “to maintain price stability”, define inflation target 2%. importantly target symmetric: bias towards keep inflation target. the second objective “to support” – subject first – “the economic policy her majesty’s government, include objective growth employment”. economic situation like one uk create conflict two objectives. monetary policy reduce inflation, cost reduce output increase unemployment. if inflation target output potential (or vice versa), fundamental trade-off achieve two objectives. since 2013 mpc’s remit require u manage significant trade-off exceptional circumstance cause arise. and basis committee’s assessment uk situation since referendum.12 to explain position evolved, let turn second unusual aspect economy i want focus afternoon: uk labour market. 11 for detail see box 5, “how economy evolve relative february 2017 report”, prospect inflation section may 2018 inflation report. 12 for detail explanation see: carney, m (2017), “lambda”, speech london school economics, 16 january 2017. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10 the labour market i say start speech wage growth surprisingly weak. that wasn’t figure speech. this chart (chart 8) show mpc’s wage growth forecast past year actual data. a see, mpc consistently surprise continue weakness wage growth. chart 8: mpc wage forecast why wage persistently weak? one reason weak productivity growth. how much company prepare pay worker depend ultimately much worker able produce. weak productivity mean weak wage growth. but wage weak even relative productivity. statistical model take account effect slack productivity struggle explain full extent weakness wages. “missing wage inflation” question whether phillips curve dead become hot topic among economists. a productivity puzzle itself, wide range candidate explanation “wage puzzle”. i won’t go full list now. but i want mention three i find relevant. one candidate explanation may lag unemployment fall wage growth start pick up. that might case instance wage expectation take time adjust tight labour market – last effect post-crisis downward nominal wage rigidity wear off, could re-emerge 2% wage inflation become accept typical follow financial crisis. or -10123452012201320142015201620172018february 2014february 2015february 2016february 2017february 2018may 2018total pay growth, per cent all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11 11 might pay initially rise worker move jobs, pay worker stay job doesn’t pick stock unemployment worker use up. that would consistent fact pay growth “switchers” recover much pay growth “stayers” (chart 9). in recent period might another effect brexit: i argue last autumn, worker might respond uncertainty outlook show even flexibility wage demands, employer might act precautionary way. chart 9: pay growth “switchers” “stayers” this chart contain statistical data ons crown copyright. the use ons statistical data work imply endorsement ons relation interpretation analysis statistical data. this work us research datasets may exactly reproduce national statistic aggregates. a second explanation would technological development reduce individual workers’ bargain power. this would continuation long run trend rather development specific financial crisis. it would consistent study find longer-term flatten phillips curve predate crisis. but might intensify “uberisation” of, influence on, uk labour market, may leave worker atomised. great contestability across international labour market great integration global labour pool would also fall category.13 finally, third explanation would headline unemployment might understate amount slack leave labour market. at time actual unemployment falling, number structural change labour market likely shift equilibrium 13 for detail, see: carney, m (2017), “[de]globalisation inflation”, 2017 imf michel camdessus central bank lecture, 18 september 2017.

example, high educational attainment, increase use online job advertising, increase flexibility labour market likely increase match efficiency low job destruction rates. that would consistent fact broad measure domestically generate inflation also remain level would consistent inflation target medium term. the idea slack headline measure unemployment suggest one i put particular weight i start mpc last autumn – word room economy grow without generate inflation target medium term. that one reason i vote (in minority) change november policy meeting.14 during mpc’s annual supply stocktake february make judgement revise estimate economy’s equilibrium unemployment rate 4½% 4¼%: words, judgement indeed slack labour market. that leave comfortable balance risk around mpc’s central assumption i previously. at time, february inflation report, annual wage growth data pick materially relative expect november meeting. in november recent observation whole economy regular pay 2.1% growth (in august). and forecast pick slightly next six months. but february report pick 2.4% growth (in november) forecast pick-up 2.8% next months. that corroborate agents’ pay survey point ½ percentage point increase settlement year, around 2½% around 3%, ability recruit retain staff number one factor drive growth. since february picture remain same. wage indeed pick 2.8% may inflation report. and late observation, 2.9% regular pay growth march, slightly high expectation even may. wage growth rise steadily past six months, unit labour cost rise towards growth rate consistent overall inflation target. the period unusually subdue growth wage appear come end. the year far that bring third unusual situation contend – development economy far year, mpc respond – recently may policy meeting. at time february report judge trade-off manage slack control inflation much diminished. we go far say “were economy evolve broadly line february inflation report projections, monetary policy would need tighten somewhat 14 see: ramsden, d (2017), “monetary policy end end: define, decide, deliver”, speech king’s college london, 20 november 2017. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13 13 early somewhat great extent forecast period anticipate time november report”. give that, didn’t vote may raise bank rate? the key thing note dependence data. do economy evolve broadly line february projections? the simple answer question no. instead early april face string much le encourage data early part year. the march pmis fell sharply partially reverse april. inflation surprise downside. gdp growth q1 0.1%. consumer confidence fell. and consumer credit growth slow sharply march. of course always data, layer story. most importantly, staff analysis suggest low gdp growth figure likely heavily influence bad weather march. that partly weather likely dampen effect activity – pattern activity consistent this. and partly gdp typically revise usual period heavy snow: chart (chart 10) illustrate size revision previous period snow. from economic perspective also hard find factor could contribute sharp slowdown: world economy continue grow, financial condition remain accommodative. chart 10: snow effect gdp revision at time, labour market continue perform robustly. employment continue rise, – give correlation gdp, anything become

www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14 14 suggest else equal gdp also growing. underlie regular pay growth continue pick line forecasts. give this, seem mpc likely explanation apparent weak data run may meet temporary, weather-related softening. and continue see trade-off slack inflation much diminished. in fact last month part continue effort make think transparent, publish estimate excess supply (or slack) economy first time. if look report see accord estimate small amount excess supply – ¼% gdp – remain economy. but couldn’t certain this. even benign interpretation economy go temporary soft patch. the majority indicator point one direction. and felt like least risk that, perhaps reflect unusual position uk, something material go – perhaps one risk i highlight early crystallising. that i, along majority committee, decide vote leave bank rate unchanged. how i see economy evolve here? it still early days. we still two third way q2, le far q2 data cycle, month pass since last mpc meeting. even so, data far suggest interpretation slowdown q1 temporary look bear out. consumer confidence consumer credit pick late data, retail sale several business surveys. that include late service pmi output balance, represent 80% economy. so far least may judgement look track. look ahead, central expectation economy line mpc’s best collective judgement express inflation report forecasts. global growth still look solid, albeit bite le rosy before. the labour market still robust. i expect gdp growth resume steady unspectacular pace (chart 11), demand continue rotate away consumption towards trade investment. of course conditional smooth transition eventual post-brexit arrangements. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15 15 chart 11: may ir central gdp forecast give forecast productivity growth, however, even subdue pace growth enough exceed new, low economic speed limit, estimate around 1½%. unemployment fall 4%, estimate equilibrium, small margin excess demand open up. and expect wage growth domestic inflationary pressure continue pickup saw end last year (chart 12): wage growth eventually pick 3½% – give productivity growth forecast imply unit wage

inflation fall back upward pressure sterling’s depreciation come end, domestic cost pressure keep inflation close target medium term. relative central forecast i see risk directions. i already mention possibility consumption growth might take leg household continue adjust low real incomes. in case gdp growth would lower, spare capacity could open inflation could drop target. but also risk supply side. on one hand, productivity growth serially disappoint could continue future. in case excess demand could build quickly inflation could stay target. that said, i optimistic potential fintech new technology lead productivity gains, either directly drive competition, turn potentially higher, non-inflationary, wage growth.15 one thing emphasise central forecast conditional market yield curve. at time may inflation report yield curve price roughly three rate rise three year cover forecast. and three rate rise one force prevent excess demand rise fast forecast inflation remain persistently target. to demonstrate would happen without rate rises, also publish version forecast inflation report show would happen bank rate remain unchanged (chart 13). in version forecast inflation fall back target. instead excess demand domestic cost pressure build much rapidly. and inflation stay persistently around 2.4%, little change materially inflation target. 15 i set view opportunity present fintech speech march – see: ramsden, d (2018), “the bank england – open fintech”, speech hmt’s international finance conference, london, 22 march 2018. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17 17 chart 13: may ir central inflation forecast this seem desirable outcome. inflation persistently target sustain period excess demand would represent failure meet remit. this one reason i sign committee’s collective judgement “were economy develop broadly line may inflation report projections, ongoing tighten monetary policy forecast period would appropriate return inflation sustainably target conventional horizon”. despite backdrop uncertainty, despite unusual thing go economy, i actually reasonably confident understand what’s go on. forecast never go perfectly accurate. but last year i think get broad narrative, understand key move parts, right, slow gdp growth, rotation demand overshoot inflation.16 student uk labour market – i one thirty year –

bpsmacroeconomic financial data exit period 7 i intend skip late heat debate cash buff vs. precautionary credit line, 2 reasons. firstly, short-term solutions, maximum one plus one year, real question remain come next first post mou-year. this question i propose focus on, namely: need do order country achieve permanent sustainable return capital markets, like pre-2008 status. it sequel question either cash buff precautionary credit line country inevitably face year so. i want open debate today make number proposal make return feasible foreseeable future. secondly, economic debate turn saga, it’s politically controversial issue, quite often case greece, call ‘sour grapes’ – i don’t want go territory. the truth matter hand eurogroup decision 15 june 2017, agreement government lender view end current programme august 2018 i quote: “europe commit provide support greece’s return market …” “to build cash buff support investors’ confidence facilitate market access”. right agreement. if changes, discus it. before come proposals, let list number undeniable fact post-mou greece: 1. the fourth final programme review conclude successfully last week. so last disbursement esm matter time and, today, extension third adjustment programme, end 20 august late year. 2. any prior action leave deal post-mou period, know post-programme surveillance (pps). we know name, entail. this big known-unknown today, patient know weeks’ time. 3. what clear, however, doubt it, greece exit 3rd mou, enter something new, 4th mou, something hybrid conditionality since debt relief, accord evidence, give tranches. 4. finally, seem austerity stay u least another 4 year primary surplus 3.5% require 2022. before turn proposal greece, one word imf. it clear yet role imf hold itself. any imf decision future role fully respected. there proposal already, i endorse, greece’s remain loan obligation imf €10 billion come gross interest rate 3.8%, much high european loan interest rate 1%, repay immediately (the money found). such early repayment imf loan would contribute improvement 8 sustainability public debt, make also possible balance management payments. figure 5 greece public sector outstanding debt (in billion euro) sources: hsbc greek public debt management authority (pdma), january 2018. then past grave mistake imf (e.g. value fiscal multipliers, assume 0.5, correct value 1.5), over-optimistic forecast growth fiscal surplus 1st mou, turn over-pessimistic forecast 3rd mou, etc. recent ones, like e.g. greek bank need least €10 billion capital injection result 2018 stress tests, “all forgive forgotten”, say. of course, key prerequisite permanent return capital market sustainable recovery greek economy growth level 2%. on top point view, follow four proposal also required: proposal #1: further increase cash buff the government’s strategy - agree lender - make sense: fully cover country’s finance need first post-mou period. this three country did. for instance, case ireland, cash buff €25 billion, portugal around €20 billion, case around 13% gdp. greece’s gross finance need next two year amount €45 billion, €18 billion cover primary surplus privatisation agenda, exist cash buff already 2018 debt issue repos. my personal view due to: a) adverse capital market condition globally, return volatility high oil prices, invert u yield curve result monetary policy tightening, widen libor-ois spreads, exert pressure u dollar money market, recent u dollar strength vis-à-vis main currencies. all might great impact vulnerable country low credit rat weak economies. name it, italy describe trump’s trade war china major economies, fog uncertainty thickened. 9 b) also due political development greece next year year european election also national regional elections. plus also geopolitical risk neighbourhood (our unpredictable eastern neighbour connection drill gas aegean cyprus). all make strong case increase buff much possible shield economy. large cash buff boost investor confidence aid market re-entry ireland, portugal cyprus. the extra money could come either bank recapitalisation amount remain 3rd programme, new issue market next 3 months, provide dust capital market settle down. if thing turn nasty italy europeriphery, next weeks, plenty time greek government negotiate european partners, negotiation i would suggest make high level, prime minister level, greece exhaust remain amount, €25 billion, €86 billion 3rd programme, leave even single euro account. this amount already approve national parliament eurozone countries, face extraordinary situation due external factors, prudent greece lender secure maximum reserve amount rainy day order shield country. there still plenty time government look this. just keep cool head! proposal #2: from debt sustainability… obtain investment grade greek public debt we every confidence lender keep word provide greece debt relief - pacta sunt servanda apply lender borrower - deliver promise since november 2012. the debt relief measure describe eurogroup statement 15 june 2017 need clarify specify clear timetable consider credible investors. it along line 1st package short-run measures, i.e. extend maturity low interest rate which, give new debt metric “gross finance need 15% gdp medium term 20% gdp thereafter” would make sure greek public debt sustainable. the new debt metric focus gross finance need (gfns) – rather old one nominal debt-to-gdp ratio – capture adequately concessional term loan greece efsf esm (more €180 billion maturity 32.5 year fix rate close 2% directly indirectly take basis near-zero borrow rate market esm). reduce public debt present value term put profile greek debt advantageous position among two third eurozone country four fifth eu countries. with end programme august specification debt relief measure june july eurogroup meetings, positive dsa report – i 10 open bracket (recalling “the one pay piper call tune”, esm borrow €180 billion today naturally prepare debt sustainability analysis (dsa), likely sign dr. strauch, chief economist esm, pleasure u today – close brackets) one normally expect least two-notch improvement country’s credit rat relevant agencies. this would still far investment grade bbb-, but, proposal: new advisory task force senior figure public debt management agency (pdma), general account office bank greece, head establish figure international reputation, would join force help obtain investment grade asap lobby analysts, make roadshows abroad investors, etc. clearly, permanent removal capital control (i’ll say minute) elimination ela end year commercial banks, would give another notch ratings, plus perhaps overshoot target primary surplus - first evidence q1 suggest may reach 5% gdp year (from target 3.5%) and/or better-than-expected growth performance due say another record tourist arrivals, etc. then, investment grade may within reach next 12 month so. i dare say this: for country move forward avoid setback future, importance get investment grade reasonable time ahead important meet maastricht nominal criterion 1990s, prior greece’s entry eurozone. we manage delay two years. it may sound bite optimistic today, motivation open discussion make central part policy debate post-mou greece. i believe feasible, fair country. proposal #3: greece’s participation ecb’s qe programme re-investment period with 3-4 notch next 8 12 month investment grade greece within reach, ecb may potentially examine purchase greek government bond public sector purchase programme reinvestment period, last least two year (end-2020). even though potential purchase volume greek debt today (around €3-4 billion) ecb’s asset purchase programme cannot compare portugal, currently around €33 billion ireland’s €27 billion, yet, greece’s inclusion ecb’s qe programme would yield major boost term confidence send positive signal investor greece anymore outlier, include president draghi’s umbrella clear benefit term cost borrow sovereign bank corporate debt, case post-mou ireland portugal. note if, part upcoming debt relief measures, buy-out anfas smp bond esm, release total amount €13 billion, volume potentially purchase qe programme could 11 increase €16 billion, one third marketable debt, trigger drop even 150 basis point secondary market. we buy bank greece - €50 billion - part qe, mainly supranational, hopefully time buy also ggbs also near. proposal #4: towards permanent lift capital control no return market permanent hence credible capital control still impose economy. the government, cooperation bank greece would sooner later, definitely close end programme, publish roadmap detail specific measure set date full lift capital controls, signal also end-date. this would catalyst full recovery trust depositor return around €20 billion hoard mattress safety deposits, also boost investor confidence prospect economy. b. what go wrong greece? let turn briefly four adjustment programme take place eurozone, focus question “what go wrong greece”. the distinguish panellist previous session debate length elaborate significant question countries’

spread start diverge noticeably. nine month later, december 2009, heighten pressure ggbs. greece first country though within euro area sign financial assistance programme, unfortunately last one exit programme. figure 6 ten-year government bond yield euro area crisis country vis-à-vis german bund yield (september 2008-december 2014, percentage points) source: haver analytics. during period, greece experience dramatic fall output (more 25%), unemployment ratio almost triple 9% 208 26% 2015, huge fall standard live valuation asset (real financial) another mountain private debt build (around €220 billion 7 years). so, go wrong greece? there several reason this, let name few: starting-point argument (a huge deficit require bold adjustment effort); error design programme include mix adjustment measure (a great reliance tax increase public spend cuts), value fiscal multiplier show above, etc., slow pace implementation structural reform (due lack programme ownership behalf greek authorities); fact greece relatively close economy and, hence, internal devaluation may contribute negatively, net terms, economic activity, fact debt restructure 2012 occur much sooner, i.e. begin first mou 2010, directionless economic governance first half 2015 ensue huge cost economy’s backtracking, lose valuable time then, lead imposition capital controls, severe distortion upon economy; wrong sequence reforms: product market reform come first, follow labour market reforms, exact opposite take place greece (hardouvelis). on top reason le commonly accepted, i would add couple - rather technical subtle - reason 13 contribution relevant debate. firstly, know, fiscal consolidation take place target nominal variable, i.e. overall fiscal deficit cyclical. take permanent austerity measure reduce cyclical deficit deepen prolong recession, result excessive austerity overtaxation self-defeating (it raise le government revenues). instead, structural deficit appropriate target variable, cyclical deficit would correct economy’s automatic fiscal stabilisers, provide growth-enhancing measure supplement fiscal consolidation (mourmouras, ft, 2012). secondly, certain misperception mous reform would work economy. i identify two grey area here: (i) reform take time unlock growth potential result also country-specific. a recent study oecd (2014) indicate time period may extend five year more; (ii) structural reform work good quick investment capitalise and, generally, demand economy recession linger on, hard achieve positive result implement structural reforms. such demand element incorporate adjustment programme monetary union adoption broad concept conditionality, namely investment conditionality, along fiscal structural conditionality (mourmouras, wsj, 2012). these important lesson draw greek experience, hopefully take account design implementation future adjustment programme monetary unions. truly, last year so, witness revival greek economy stabilisation expectation gradual restoration confidence. look forward now, agree give prolong fiscal consolidation private disinvestment take place (2007: investment 27% gdp, today 11% gdp, low level since 1960), country need investment shock. revive domestic foreign investment crucial support economic recovery. that important government speed privatisation agenda, much revenue exercise, great opportunity attract fdi key sector economy, transport, energy, logistics tourism. in respect, let come back old proposal mine, fifth proposal today, make back summer 2014, join central bank (see mourmouras, the double crisis – volume 2, chapter 18: first all, agree limit overtaxation. for instance, regard corporate taxation greece, 29% corporate tax (plus 10% tax dividends), tax competition country intense, e.g. iberian peninsula average tax rate 20% (spain portugal), baltic country average tax rate 15% (lithuania, latvia, estonia) balkan average 10% (turkey 20%, romania 20%, albania 15%, cyprus 12.5%, bulgaria 10% fyrom 10%). hence, strong case 14 make greece favour drastic gradual reduction corporate tax rate start 2020, announce fairly soon, ultimately reach flat tax rate 15% remain lock level another five years. the drastic reduction corporate tax rate commitment leave unchanged period five year best signal greek foreign investor greek authority seek change country’s growth paradigm move towards dynamic economy base private investment exports. this drop tax could finance fiscal space achieve decrease primary surpluses, say, 2.5% 2020 onwards, bring effectively forward year two agreed-with-our-lenders low primary surpluses, persistent overshoot agree surplus target 3.5% gdp 2022. much delight, proposal link low corporate tax low primary surplus adopt bank greece may 2016 main opposition leader deth thessaloniki september 2016. c. the role ecb country adjustment programme a euro area crisis trigger either weak fiscal position case weak bank system others, lead “negative feedback loop” bank sovereigns, ecb emerge institution best equip tackle. it use appropriate instrument disposal order ensure primary priorities: price financial stability across euro area. c.1 the role ecb price stability 1. reduce base rate first all, since emerge financial crisis 2008, ecb reduce main refinance rate 4.25% 0%, large cut ever decide short period europe, also bring interest rate pay banks’ deposit excess reserve eurosystem negative territory, -0.40% today. 2. smp programme furthermore, sovereign bond market euro area jurisdiction become increasingly dysfunctional, may 2010 ecb approve security market programme (smp) worth €210 billion. it main effect cut refinance cost country whose bond sell unsustainable interest rate international markets, leave time money supply unchanged sterilisation. 15 3. ltros tltros in december 2011, ecb revive longer-term refinance instrument make central bank liquidity available bank three year fix annual interest rate 1%. the total allot amount euro area bank €1 trillion. in 2014, ecb announce two series target long-term refinance operation maturity four year practically zero interest rate, amount €700 billion, affect directly borrow condition enterprise euro area. 4. outright monetary transaction (omt) a crisis progress become intensive begin 2012, spread euro area government bond market continue widen, i.e. spain’s 10-year government bond rise 5% march 2012 7.6% july 2012. in summer 2012, president draghi speech london declare ecb, within mandate, prepare whatever take order preserve euro, repeat irreversibility euro currency, three famous word “whatever takes” make second influential roman ever, julius caesar three famous word “veni, vidi, vici”! follow speech, ecb develop structure policy sovereign bond market announce outright monetary transaction programme (omt). how much money ecb spend omt programme far? zero euro!!! it powerful impact credible policy announcements. 5. quantitative ease (qe) due headwind come primarily international economy, inflation outlook euro area continue deteriorate summer autumn 2014 something threaten destabilise long-term inflation expectations, put forbid letter “d”, “d” deflation, mouth international investors. a result, january 2015 govern council announce expand asset purchase programme (app), include large-scale purchase programme target government security (pspp) €60 billion month september 2016. currently, eurosystem hold expand asset purchase programme amount around €2.4 trillion 20% euro area gdp (pspp worth almost €2 trillion, remain amount concern cover bond asset-backed securities). the positive effect qe mostly reflect sovereign bond yields, growth rate loan bank lend rates, course avoid deflation euro area (see mourmouras, speech monetary policy global capital markets, 2017, chapter 4). 6. emergency liquidity assistance (ela) also, emergency liquidity assistance (ela) provide national central bank order help domestic bank liquidity shortage 16 prevent domino effect. hence, 2010 2014, ela extend bank ireland, greece, cyprus, portugal, eurosystem borrow country ela, surpass €200 billion. in greece, ela provide bank greece last eight year reach peak €120 billion march 2012. 7. the eurosystem resolution liquidity (erl) tool last least, ecb consider new policy tool, eurosystem resolution liquidity (erl) tool would allow inject cash bank resolution, words, rescue threat insolvency. the erl see monetary policy tool, ensure bank system transmit official interest rate real economy. c.2 the role ecb financial stability on june 2012, european council reach agreement creation european framework banks’ supervision single supervisory mechanism (ssm), form first pillar bank union. the ecb assign specific task carry ssm like instance, ensure safety soundness european bank system, increase financial integration stability ensure consistent supervision. currently, ecb directly supervise 118 “systemically significant banks”, represent almost 82% total bank asset euro area indirectly supervise le significant bank participate countries, number approximately 3,500 euro area! it’s ssm, chair danièle nouy, conduct late stress test greek banks, result come last month. two week ago, recent visit bank greece, chair nouy emphasise u greek bank need reduce high stock non-performing loan (npls), highlight big challenge face bank sector country exit third bailout programme august. d. conclude remark instead epilogue, i would like close speech question future, “back future”: so crisis-management tool available, euro area today good position vis-à-vis 2008 tackle next crisis, which, way, may around corner? i already talk italy introduction. with monetary policy reach limits, namely, negative rate (in 2008, base rate +4%, today negative) trillion buy ecb qe programme, scarcity issue naturally arises, clearly, monetary policy can’t “only game town” next crisis. in eventuality, hopefully active role fiscal policy fiscal backstop 17 implemented, move also towards risk-sharing euro area. many people, include myself, feel need strike balance classic struggle solidarity national responsibility, ‘new wine old bottle’, namely risk-sharing (namely mutualisation costs) versus risk reduction. especially south europe, strong feel balance unstable order make stable symmetrical, need strong european institutions, instance, full-blown bank union esm turn proper european monetary fund. it important bring forward date establishment european deposit insurance scheme (edis), bank union’s third pillar, schedule 2025, provide strong uniform deposit insurance cover. even announcement entry full operation edis strong confidence-building effect depositors, sense avoid risk self-fulfilling prophecy bank runs. the jean monnet principle inter-temporal apply times: “europe sum solution adopt address crisis face with.” the european clock tick eu must take action june council two weeks’ time late december summit, otherwise european electorate punish politician slow reflex european election year’s time, lead generalise crisis confidence european union. over long history, europe traditionally manage find consensus burn issue face it, even last minute. a true european myself, i hope time different! thank

governor bank italyfabio panettabocconi universitymilan, 7 june 2018 1. introduction1 it great pleasure here. the topic conference speak heart challenge question central bank today: digital revolution affect financial system? what impact consumers, economy central bank themselves? these complex questions, relate consequence fourth industrial revolution society,2 within central bank digital currency (cbdc short) might one day play important part. i attempt provide comprehensive answer questions. rather, i focus general issue relate digital transformation society, pro con digital cash (as mean payment store value) and, concluding, recall open issue regard cbdcs. 2. the digital transformation society technological progress foster digital representation many daily activities. for example, use physical letter postcard dwarf email digital photos, estimate number letter-like item send worldwide one year roughly equal number email send single day.3 instant message apps qq whatsapp allow estimate three billion user digital conversation across globe.4 the process digitization reflect increase demand immediacy individuals, transform behaviour, culture structure economy. 1 i wish thank nicola branzoli marcello miccoli valuable help preparation speech. 2 see schwab k. the fourth industrial revolution, new york: crown publish group, (2017) gordon r. (2012), ‘is u.s. economic growth over? falter innovation confront six headwinds’, nber, work paper 18315, august 2012. 3 source: base data universal postal union radicati group. 4 source: radicati group. digitization also prominent financial system. for example, dematerialization financial asset instrumental emergence electronic trade platforms. online banking, digital representation brick-and-mortar bank branches, gain popularity since introduction 1990s . the advent digitization particularly evident payment system. until long ago retail payment could make cash cheques. but day us cheque anymore? digital innovation payment go even further, payment tool available directly app smartphone even simply use smartwatch. the issuance cbdcs – digital version cash – could accordingly see natural consequence broad process digitization financial system. in world security contract dematerialize trade electronically, payment make smartphones investment advice provide computers, cash physical? be central bank miss benefit innovation issue cbdc? crypto-assets (or virtual currency call realize cannot perform function money) sometimes associate digital currency. let emphasize, though redundant audience, cbdcs nothing crypto-assets bitcoin. in fact – like banknote – cbdc would liability central bank would back assets. it would support credibility central bank and, ultimately, rule law. crypto-assets, hand, liability belong nobody: asset back clear governance structure guarantee trust. for reasons, value cbdc would suffer excessive volatility affect crypto-assets. 3. the pro con digital cash but let’s go back main question today’s conference: central bank issue digital currency? one way address issue perspective agent (the central bank) charge supply cash behalf state, ultimate goal maximize social welfare. in respect important distinguish possible role digital currency mean payment store value.5 5 these two three function money. the third one, money unit account, relevant here, since digital currency issue central bank would denominate unit exist banknotes. 4 cbdcs mean payment a mean payment, cbdc would add available digital payment services, thus increase degree competition sector. but set tool permit almost frictionless instantaneous payment already large: today make digital payment wire transfer (through online banking), credit debit cards, use paypal apple pay (to name few); via computers, smartphones smartwatches, simply put wrist close point sale. competition supply payment service already high, efficiency system increase introduction many jurisdiction instant payment – yet another alternative cash.6 from vantage point advantage cbdc best unclear: potential benefit term improve ease transaction probably insufficient justify involvement central bank activity well serve private suppliers. a cbdc could nonetheless improve access digital payment specific group consumers. in fact, consumer bank account – precondition use exist digital payment tools. a cbdc could offer access tool minimum zero cost. in unite states, unite kingdom, france spain, name high-income country one might easily think financial inclusion almost universal, share population without bank account 4 7 per cent.7 in italy proportion unbanked household similar (7 per cent, 1.8 million households).8 survey evidence suggest account maintenance cost physical distance bank among reason bank account. however, close look socio-demographic characteristic unbanked consumer show low income also low education: 90 per cent unbanked household bottom half income 6 instant payment (ips) allow consumer transfer fund almost real time. the eurosystem enter ip tip project, offer settlement facility central bank money ip scheme start november 2018. the extent ip succeed substitute cash open question. the experience country ip first introduce mixed. for example uk, ip introduce ten year ago, average value ip £800, ordinary cash payment similar traditional credit transfer. 7 demirgüç, a., klapper, l., singer, d., ansar, s., hess, j. the global findex database 2017: measure financial inclusion fintech revolution, world bank group, 2018. 8 source: survey household income wealth, banca d’italia. 5 distribution little formal education. to extent consumer access bank account – thus digital payment tool – reason cost, introduction cbdc would improve situation. again, stage available evidence best insufficient justify introduce cbdc, spite importance goal improve financial inclusion.9 the introduction digital mean payment could justify objective reduce cost cash i.e. outlay production, transportation, disposal, etc. recent estimate suggest cost amount half percentage point gdp european union every year,10 around €76 billion. by way comparison, figure amount almost half annual eu budget. these estimate low bind actual costs, since include households’ costs, time take obtain banknote (shoe-leather costs), difficult estimate. however, shroud uncertainty; moreover, central banks, commercial bank handle cash constantly strive improve efficiency. would cost provide cbdc low cash? the cost manage cash due physical nature digital world would disappear. non-monetary costs, households’ shoe-leather cost find cash provider, would also disappear cash accessible via smartphone pocket. hardware software cost would, instead, increase. however, digital technology already play crucial role financial sector. it use transfer commercial bank money, buy sell securities, process information. it continuously test update protect risks, first foremost cyber risk. the technology need transfer digital cash would likely strong complementarity exist digital network infrastructure. this suggest overall cost provide mean payment may well decrease introduction cbdc. the potential efficiency gain promise new technological solution distribute ledger technology (dlt), though still unclear, could also help low cost manage cbdcs. 9 here i ignore fact disputable, likely suboptimal undesirable assign goal improve financial inclusion central banks. 10 schmiedel, h., kostova, g., ruttenberg, w. ‘the social private cost retail payment instruments: european perspective’, european central bank occasional paper 137, 2017. 6 cbdcs store value another important function money store value. the cost store cash, key factor use store value, estimate 0.5 1 per cent value stored.11 since would completely dematerialized, cbdc would storage cost would convenient way household firm keep liquid wealth. mattress could free role vaults! in addition superior cash store value, cbdc would asset unique characteristics, free credit liquidity risk. it might prefer instrument commonly use store wealth, bank deposits. the consequence cause concerns: switch bank deposit cbdc could lead fund shortfall bank system, potential adverse effect supply cost lend real economy. in extreme condition availability cbdc could even increase risk digital bank run. the potential consequence large portion wealth structurally transfer bank deposit cbdc could significant financial system. currently euro area overnight deposit non-financial private entity amount around €6.5 trillion, 20 per cent balance sheet bank system. i convinced, however, effect would necessarily disruptive banks. first, category deposit might migrate central bank (most likely sight deposits, pay little interest). second, bank compete offer service cbdcs cannot, access credit payment services. third, bank could increase recourse wholesale funding. but banks’ business model would affected. the decrease callable liability could ultimately push towards ‘narrow’ bank system,12 operational framework bank little maturity mismatch asset liabilities. the debate benefit narrow bank go back centuries,13 easy answer; economist likely examine issue anew. 11 see, instance, witmer, j. yang, j. “estimating canada’s effective low bound”, bank canada review, spring 2016 “banks look cheap way store cash pile rate go negative”, financial times, august 16, 2016. 12 see broadbent, b. “central bank digital currencies”, speech london school economics, march 2016. 13 see pennacchi, g. (2012), ‘narrow banking’, annual review financial economics, vol. 4, issue 1, pp. 141-159. 7 the magnitude effect depend demand cbdcs public, turn vary accord currency’s specific, yet still uncertain, characteristic – whether would remunerate whether would account base token based. balance risk benefit the risk benefit cbdcs two side (digital) coin, relate role money mean payment store value. recourse cbdc mean payment may well benefits, precise nature uncertain may still small justify introduction digital currency. moreover, issuance cbdc may become le positive balance take account potential effect demand commercial bank deposits. the risk benefit would affect characteristic cbdc, event risk would disappear altogether. the business case introduce cbdcs remain best unclear. however, like issue relate technological innovation, costs, benefit risk digital currency likely change rapidly future. this suggest central bank continue examine potential effect digital currencies. indeed, many currently engage research technical experimentation cbdc. the riksbank, bank england, bank canada, name few, actively analyze issue. some go even further, central bank uruguay, launch pilot project.14 at banca d’italia, also study cbdc would impact financial system monetary policy, work within eurosystem trial use dlt, might prove useful digital currency. researcher also actively reflect cbdcs. today’s conference notable example. 4. some open issue a mention above, risk benefit cbdcs, together impact financial system, real economy society, closely depend characteristics.15 14 the danmark nationalbank sceptical whether benefit cbdc really prevail costs. see gürtler, s., rasmussen, s. central bank digital currency denmark?, december 2017. 15 see bank international settlements, ”central bank digital currencies”, march 2018. 8 probably important issue whether digital currency traceable whether design guarantee, extent possible, anonymity. cash always incredible instrument: allow third-party anonymity transaction leaf trace. while imply effective mean payment illicit activity money laundering, finance terrorism tax evasion, also ensure privacy users. the possibility trace digital transaction may important economic ethical implications. imagine moment payment data suggest spend alcohol probability default loan positively correlated. base evidence, bank might decide reject loan demand applicant high expenditure alcohol, even though correlation reflect ex-ante causal relationship two variable could simply due, example, ex-post common psychological factor.16 though may simplified, example emphasize need address carefully privacy issue may stem digitization, particular introduction cbdc. today risk still limited, country retail transaction conclude mainly cash, record electronic payment represent imprecise screen device.17 this change rapidly, however. just decide degree anonymity associate use cbdc? clearly, technical issue, such, choice belong central bank alone also political sphere. we need think carefully, right now, make introduction cbdc fully compatible right individual square increase availability information private life one u relation political views, state health, sexual orientation, protection personal freedom rule govern function modern liberal democracy. another key issue whether cbdc remunerate or, case cash, pay interest. this choice would far-reaching consequence core activity central 16 the introduction general data protection regulation might limit application profile make illegal (see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/my-rights/can-i-be-subject-automated-individual-decision-making-including-profiling_en). 17 for example, eu cash payment represent 65 per cent total retail transactions. see schmiedel, h., kostova, g. ruttenberg, w. “the social private cost retail payment instruments: european perspective”, european central bank occasional paper, no. 137, 2017. 9 bank, financial stability monetary policy, would also affect issues, volume allocation seigniorage. for example, interest payment would make cbdc close substitute bank deposits.18 this would increase volatility deposit and, extreme conditions, could even facilitate digital bank run (whose probability increase existence cbdc): bad times, depositor could switch rapidly cost bank account cbdc. the central bank could limit risk – example set ceiling amount cbdc individual investor hold, bring remuneration zero hold cbdcs certain threshold – would raise number technical issues.19 at time, interest-earning cbdc would reinforce transmission monetary impulse banks, household businesses.20 in downturns, low remuneration digital currency central bank could spur bank reduce deposit rates; could push zero (assuming cash would long available), improve capacity stimulate economy extreme condition without necessarily resort unconventional measures.21 a symmetrical mechanism would work upturns, increase remuneration cbdc (which would represent floor market rates) would force bank take swift action also increase remuneration deposits. a shift interest-free cash interest-bearing cbdc would affect seigniorage multiple ways: addition direct effect interest payment central bank (which would negative impact seigniorage), would indirect effect reduce cost supply cash (positive impact) increase demand central bank liability (positive impact). the overall effect ambiguous, could non-negligible non-trivial distributional consequences: central bank profits, transfer state use state see fit, could change 18 on contrary, cbdc without interest would comparable cash. 19 for example, ceiling individual hold cbdc could limit number size payments, recipients’ hold cbdc would know order finalize payment. see gürtler, s., rasmussen, s. central bank digital currency denmark?, december 2017. 20 see bank international settlements, ”central bank digital currencies”, march 2018, coeuré, b.”the future central bank money”, speech international center monetary bank studies, geneva, may 2018. 21 if central bank push interest rate negative territory world non-remunerated cbdc, bank would effectively avoid negative rate substitute reserve digital currency. bank could adopt strategy world physical cash, high cost store make option le attractive, induce bank accept moderately negative interest rates. 10 significantly currency holder remunerated. the political economy consequence underestimated. turn specific cbdc implementation, central bank decide whether cbdcs token-based – whereby token represent particular denomination currency, like banknote – or, like bank deposits, account-based, whereby hold account records. again, choice would important consequence number key issue anonymity (a token-based cbdc would imply good protection privacy)22 organization central bank. in particular, manage account-based system million account balances, potentially change every day, would require incredible effort central bank. the implementation token-based system, instead, would easy could delegate private party. in case security resilience cbdc cyber-attacks must assured, order preserve trust currency. digital hack currency reap large rewards, likelihood large counterfeit banknote – recent attack central bank bangladesh come mind.23 undoubtedly hacker everywhere dream violate digital currency system! the number question relate cbdcs enormous public debate infancy. i cannot address issue today. but i wish emphasize one last point conclude remarks. if central bank decide make asset – cbdc – free credit liquidity risk, possibly remunerated, available anybody cost, role economy would fundamentally change. the size balance sheet would likely increase, footprint economy. if cbdc account-based, central bank would start interact directly private non-financial sector. be central bank ready play new role deal attendant complexities? in short term answer no. beyond short term, great investment new technology human capital would necessary address challenge associate issue cbdc. 22 see example mersch, y. “digital base money: assessment ecb’s perspective”, speech suomen pankki, january 2017. 23 for instance, malware instal bangladesh central bank’s computer successfully divert around $80 million accounts. 11 5. conclusion the technological revolution push u towards digital representation many object daily lives. banknote might next line. however, still many uncertainty front. some economic nature, efficiency payment system financial stability. others relate individual rights, right privacy. society whole would well decide tackle latter central bank step in. other issues, i time touch today, le important, legal nature. can central bank issue new form currency without explicit authorization government? if cbdc legal tender, mean everybody need technical mean accept it? in many country new law may require concrete step towards cbdc taken. for central bank, issue digital currency like travel new land: path take choose time map drawn. the many uncertainty involve undoubtedly make journey excite full discoveries, though substantial amount prudence wisdom still required. all all, hardly go purely technical decision. society whole, political bodies, need involved. whether central bank issue digital currency – characteristic – remain open question i look forward hear view present today. i remain convince physical cash continue quite time part payment system. it hard dispute money probably one important useful social constructs, one u around 3,000 years24 still much use. cash far dominant mean payment, euro area25 elsewhere,26 demand rise advance economy last decade. currency circulation euro area amount around €1.1 trillion, record steady growth rate recent years. coin banknote prove resilient technology, may early call complete retirement. 24 see, instance, robert a. mundell, ‘the birth coinage’, columbia university, mimeo, 2002. 25 esselink henk lola hernández (2017), ‘the use cash household euro area,’ ecb occasional paper series 201/2017.

quarterly review, march 2018. available https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1803g.pdf. 12 while jury still whether cbdc, debate already bring benefits. many central banks, include banca d’italia, experiment new technology dlt artificial intelligence, study work put productive use. this research contribute advancement technological frontier, help make financial system resilient technological cyber risks. these benefit stay, independently whether one day live world digital cash. 13 design print print publish division bank italy page 1 4 open remark francois groepe, deputy governor south

schedule join u today. we appreciate great interest work, locally abroad. 1 international organization standardization page 2 4 i make brief introductory remark hand governor sarb, mr lesetja kganyago, deliver keynote address. my remark centre around three observations. barely six month ago, i could imagine would successfully trial use dlt process high-value transactions. this part i acutely aware challenge involve build wholesale payment capability appreciate that, proof concept complex take time develop. a example, requirement endeavour need carefully defined, prioritised, map functional technical specifications. furthermore, coding, development test require intense laborious exercise. add challenge integration multiple participant one come appreciation initiative often multi-year projects. the design, build delivery project khokha happen le three months. this noteworthy achievement. it evident pace innovation technological development require shift new ‘agile design approach’ demand fast turnaround. after all, mantra financial technology, ‘fintech’, ‘design flexibly, fail fast succeed sooner’. this rapid prototyping agile process trial new way innovate financial service rapidly become norm. a regulators, keenly aware day play catch-up often long lag long appropriate approach may allow systemic risk build market conduct failure go unchecked. project khokha therefore significant demonstrate regulatory institution indeed capable respond rapidly change environment agility, flexibility speed. the insight gain also beneficial area sarb’s activity extend beyond fintech initiatives. page 3 4 my second observation success complex project build strong collaboration – even trial prototyping phase. this go beyond collaboration participants; also involve connect expert ongoing unresolved challenges. for example, reach settlement finality dlt major issue long ago. with speed change dedicate global effort, issue address short timeframes compare past. i proud announce project khokha contribute global dlt body knowledge think first time istanbul byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism pedersen commitment confidentiality use quorum. this help ensure tokenised rand remain legitimate transaction transfer, assist honour participants’ privacy confidentiality requirements. it evident that, new digital economy potentially decentralise architecture, progress make gradually cross new frontier extend concept solutions. there little doubt dlt huge potential, equally substantial road ahead large-scale adoption across multiple interconnect system considered. much work required, collaboration vital importance deepen collective knowledge base area great variability understand due speed technology changing. there huge expectation among broad financial service community around emerge exponential technology blockchains distribute ledgers. multiple trial across many different industry across globe take place. a south africans, active participant leverage innovation technology drive efficiency within financial system order reduce frictions. we furthermore leverage immense social welfare benefit development may deliver ensure financial stability compromised. page 4 4 finally, contribute efforts, careful treat emerge technology panacea every problem. whereas rapid prototyping bring benefit gain practical insight deep understanding, critically reflect work doesn’t important aspect journey. complex network ecosystem encompass multiple dimensions: policy, legislation, economics, process, governance, business and, course, legacy. the economist remind u ‘stickiness’ integrate nature path-dependent systems. i would thus encourage u continue trial new approach vigour, equally frank applicability appropriateness new emerge architectures. finally, let take opportunity thank project khokha team lead effort. many thank bank participants, consensys pwc2 teams, course numerous sarb colleague department actively involved. special thank mr edward leach, business owner, dr arif ismail, mr gerhard van deventer mr anrich daseman fintech unit. with that, i would like hand governor kganyago

pricewaterhousecoopers inc vitas vasiliauskas: open speech - china financial summitopening speech mr vitas vasiliauskas, governor bank lithuania, chinafinancial summit 2018, beijing, 16 may 2018.* * *good morning, lady gentlemen,it honour today address open session distinguishedsummit intend discus opportunity new financial era holds.i start bright chinese proverb, say ‘opportunity knock door onlyonce’. and – allow – i add european twist it: ‘if opportunity knock – build adoor’.i believe times, opportunity lie novel financial technologies. and – i meanboth business public authority – act decisively capture it.here china, far i know, door innovative financial technology openedquite widely. the country one large vibrant fintech market world. itranks among global leader term capital investment industry enjoy ofthe develop epayments online lend sectors. it thus coincidence one inthree successful fintech start-ups worldwide – so-called ‘unicorns’ – originate fromchina.for businesses, fintech allow open new door domestically, also globally. let’stake, example, lithuanian start-ups: dozen take chance surpass thelimits domestic market jump international waters. today lithuanianfintech firm make instant money transfer across globe provide internationalmobile payment services, substantial attention international investors.in vein, lithuania push actively increase fintech cooperation within the‘16+1’ framework, strongly believe format like crucial unlock newmarket take fintech offer. we will host high-level fintechforum central eastern european country china. i would glad indeed see yourdelegation next year capital vilnius.the potential financial innovationin term fintech’s potential, i would underline three benefit i find key. first, novelfinancial technology may boost growth provide additional credit sources, especially forsmall medium enterprise households. it estimate 2024 global peer-to-peer market worth nearly usd 900 billion – grow around 50% annually. animpressive trend, indicate scale opportunity alternative fund source hold.second, fintech may help increase financial inclusion. world bank data show around 40%of global population still access formal financial system. at timewe get remarkable example prove technological innovation allow underbankedsocieties skip step conventional bank expansion move directly latestfinancial instruments, instant mobile payments.and third, digitalise financial system, fintech limit space ‘shadow economy’.due increase transparency, digitalisation allow authority curb illegal economic activitiesmore effectively. with amount money launder globally, range usd 800 billion tousd 2 trillion annual basis, financial innovation offer substantial gains. 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech i could go benefit fintech brings, but…i suppose need prove obvious, let u move challenges.fintech call increase flexibilityfinancial innovation alter way whole financial system functions. while provide betterquality efficient services, fintech challenge operative model establishedfinancial institutions. in fact, 80% actor global market believe theirbusinesses risk due competition innovators. this suggest traditionalplayers either change, face risk push market.on top this, fintech render long-standing regulatory practice ineffective. thismeans regulator need become flexible. if not, risk fit throughthe door open new technologies. to put bluntly, without adapt rapidly changingfinancial developments, regulator may find sideline unable meetexpectations. more authority across world seem realise this.back 2016, uk financial conduct authority first world set ‘regulatorysandbox’. in essence, function ‘playground’ test novel instrument theyreach market. this do guidance regulator, allow keep withmarket development build necessary know-how.in words, format serve two purposes. first, allow innovative start-ups testtheir idea grasp regulatory requirements. second, ‘sandboxes’ enable regulator toupgrade toolkits, align new generation business model andtechnological solution bring fintech.in recent years, similar format regulator engagement industry spring widely– canada australia. arguably, development mark shift authorities’ think –facilitating innovation instead aim restrict it.in regard, idea develop central bank digital currency recently gainingtraction. the task issue central bank digital currency indeed complex requiresextensive long-term efforts. yet also offer substantial gains. these include increasedtransparency, efficient payment settlement system enhance instrument forfinancial risk monitoring.with flexibility come new responsibilitiesnevertheless – i put strong emphasis – flexibility come newresponsibilities. while become open innovations, – i mean industry andregulators – cannot turn blind eye associate risks.first – cyber risks, which, intensify digitalisation processes, attract elevatedregulator attention. financial institution increasingly base operation novel technologicalsolutions, cloud computing. this certainly bring efficiency gains. but also makesfinancial firm vulnerable hack malware, place vast amount data criticalict infrastructure potential danger zone. today challenge particularly relevant ineurope due ongoing regulatory shift towards ‘open banking’.it therefore surprise international standard setters, bank internationalsettlements, recently become active domain. a result, today financialinstitutions regulator offer guidance – include recent step take theeuropean central bank – implement enhance level cyber resilience. tostrengthen efforts, international monetary fund lately put emphasis 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech cyber risk within surveillance policy advice frameworks.nevertheless, digitalisation-induced risk financial system stem beyond cyber threats.financial innovation also tend create additional room ‘shadow banking’ expand.it take time identify fully understand new often obscure financial services,sometimes reveal regulatory supervisory loopholes. through interlinkages otherfinancial institutions, may eventually lead build-up hide systemic risk. in otherwords, absence adequate regulation, ‘shadow banking’ operation risk put wholefinancial system threat.in last several years, witness increase scrutiny towards ‘shadow banking’activities global scale. it seem regulator will take chance wait a‘minsky moment’ occur back technological innovation. look perspectiveof international financial stability, highly welcome reassure development.treating fintech opportunity, headacheso: opportunity headache? adapt regulatory framework ever-changing financialinnovations easy task. yet instead treat problem, see anideal chance. this exactly strategy pursue bank lithuania.a couple year ago, institution set mission turn lithuania regionalfintech hub. the nordic-baltic region know highly digitalise economy financialsystems. yet lithuania manage stand particularly fintech-focused openjurisdiction. of course, undermine core mission – ensure stability andcredibility financial system.looking specific fintech-supporting regulatory elements, bank lithuania one thefew central bank globally provide direct access payment infrastructure non-bankfinancial firms. this mean fintechs provide payment service across euro area ontheir own, cut middleman. in words, innovative financial institution placedon truly equal foot establish banks, foster competition sector.while ‘regulatory sandboxes’ interact new market entrant become quitewidespread now, take step further. next year, prepare launch a‘technological sandbox’, codenamed lbchain. it function service-based platform forcooperating private actor nationally internationally. the platform’s central goal isdeveloping test state-of-the-art solution base emerge blockchain technology.being fintech frontrunner regionally, lithuania also offer one favourableregulatory environment europe. take, example, licensing. a highly speed-oriented, electronic money payment institution licence ready 3 month –compared roughly 12 month european countries.on top this, introduce unique ‘specialised bank’ licence, allow fintechfirms transform banks, low capital requirements. and alithuanian licence get. it also enable fintechs offer service across europe,with basically additional documentation fees. such openness flexibility allowedlithuania take role fintech gateway europe’s payment bank sectors.the lithuanian doorway use fintechs broad set jurisdictions. firm withorigins range u singapore establish presence lithuania. recently, wehave also witness elevate attention china. several chinese fintech companieshave already enter european financial market via lithuania, currently theconsultative phase. yet still plenty room inside. 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech embrace changedear colleagues,fintech shake foundation financial system know it. it also push ashake-up regulatory mindset. this challenging. yet change never easy.but offer substantial benefits. innovation create better, effective financial servicesand facilitate provision cross-border basis. under right circumstances, maygive new boost globalisation, much-needed uncertain time live in.to wrap up, i would like come back think i mention – opportunityknocking door. i sure knock already hear – fintech. and isthe moment u learn embrace it. if not, risk miss may bethe once-in-a-generation opportunity.thank attention. 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech all speech available online

include default clear house. the objective debt holder bail liquidity provide restore bank solvency enable continue meet obligations. i return late question assurance bank resolution operate effectively. the point i want stress major bank fails, effective resolution prevent default ccp occur first place. the ccp’s defence strong bank effective resolution regime reduce significantly risk ccps face member default. but eliminate it. like banks, ccps need hold resource absorb default losses. but unlike bank great majority resource capital owners. it resource member counterparty risk member managed. these resource comprise first margin collateral default member, ccps’ capital (their ‘skin game’) mutualised loss absorb capacity default fund member contribute. these resource considerable. in 2017, addition £145 billion initial margin, default fund hold uk ccps total around £10 billion. a broad comparison, height financial crisis uk government make initial injection £37

www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 resolution failed, default occurred, would take failure ccp’s two large clear member extreme plausible market condition lead exhaustion default fund – scenario, tail tail, would almost certainly severe see historically, include crisis. the crisis has, course teach us, need think event tail probability distribution. so need ask happen prefunded loss absorbency exhaust insufficient cover losses. unlike banks, prefunded resource insufficient absorb losses, ccp become insolvent. ccp’s rulebooks, member agree advance, allow series recovery actions, prescribe sequence. a ccp could require member contribute resources, could reduce liability members, ultimately could “tear –up” (i.e. cancel) contract – effect closure clear service. the sequence ever draconian actions, reflect fact ccps independent risk takers. in fact, risk taker all. they service that, fee, manage risk derivative counterparty default member would otherwise face directly far great cost. again, comparison bank instructive. writ large, objective recovery resolution systemically important bank ccps – ensure maintenance critical economic service stress. but similarity pretty much stop there. the main challenge bank exhaust much prefunded loss absorb resource – ie capital - able bail resource reduce liabilities. by contrast, pre-funded resource ccp insufficient absorb losses, ccps able bail resource member absorb losses. if insufficient, unlike banks, able reduce liability – ultimately zero. all would happen outside insolvency. and would “orderly”, sense would prescribe sequence action pre-agreed member clear house within contractual arrangement clear member clients. give scale loss absorb resource hold available ccps fact rulebooks provide ultimately wind outside insolvency, argue resolution relevant banks, simply relevant concept ccps. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 i see force argument. certainly, far loss absorb resource concern i believe likely justify require ccps hold extra shot, form bail debt – enable replenish resources. if, follow default two major wholesale financial market institution stress market conditions, margin hold ccp, default fund, cash call membership insufficient meet losses, go considerably tail systemic stress event experience require bank withstand. in circumstances, reload ccp’s resource bail debt unlikely resolve problems. on side ledger, hold bail debt would use ccp could put materially cost clearing. all else equal, would pass onto user clearing, reduce incentive use risk reduction clear offers. resolution, however, access extra loss absorb resources. it objective ensure systemic financial institution get trouble, financial service critical real economy maintained. the latter stage ccp’s recovery plan terminate, tear contracts, would probably “orderly” sense would prescribe sequence pre-agreed actions. give likely circumstance would occur tear derivative contract wind major clear service could significant shock system. in circumstances, i see number reason resolution regime necessary provide public sector authority option step – necessary ccp come end pre-agreed recovery wind actions. in circumstances, action inaction ccp run risk amplify systemic problem, appropriate public authority capable intervene manage systemic risk thereby protect public fund need used. in contrast ccp management owe fiduciary duty first foremost shareholders, resolution authority power duty require enable act interest financial stability. the benefit step stabilise situation could take number forms. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 for example, ‘voluntary’ measure auction fail serious risk financial contagion margin gain haircutting, resolution authority could decide good intervene quickly tear-up subset contract early would otherwise permit rulebook. do would return ccp match book loss escalate damage become irreparable. loss tear-up position would still expect allocate order contractually agree rulebook without discrimination counterparties. but discretion exercise resolution authority, scope price partial tear-up speed replenishment deplete default fund would take objective protect financial stability subject public law safeguards. in take action resolution authority would advantage able coordinate exchange information domestic foreign authority wide market way ccp would not. this ability coordinate could crucial orderly management systemic event particularly default impact multiple ccps. an important aspect stabilise ccp wide market would maintain sufficient certainty around loss could incur resolution. a ccp’s rulebook provide member assurance ex ante point extent expose event clear member default. it protect discrimination allocation losses. resolution authority similarly respect ccp rulebook allocation loss. if, extreme circumstances, prof necessary resolution authority deviate rulebook, ccp member compensate loss bear excess would incur rulebook followed. this concept “no creditor bad off’’ (ncwo) central tenet resolution regime banks. resolution power interfere property right ncwo protection need constrain use power authorities. in case bank, test creditor bad bank go insolvency. for reason set above, insolvency counterfactual need modify ccps; assume insolvency pre-agreed order loss rule book would followed. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10 non default loss finally, important emphasise i talk throughout loss ccp follow default clear member. this, i say outset, main vector risk ccp. but one. non-default loss arise number reasons, particularly operational failures, include follow cyber attack, loss arise investment collateral hold ccps. in cases, ccps generally recourse resource members. loss need absorb capital firm insufficient ccp face insolvency like firm. operational risk become much great concern ccp supervisor regulator recent year increasingly need see high standard resilience face operational cyber risk. recovery resolution regime ccps need take account threat ccps direction. whether mean loss absorb capital ccps, access member resource event non-default loss combination two matter ongoing discussion. but give role ccps play financial system, need think would resolve ccp

address dr. veerathai santiprabhob governor ban thailand nomura investment forum asia 2018 5 june 2018 / singapore distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, a good morning all. i would like thank nomura invite share think current state outlook thai economy. for today’s talk, i two main agendas. first, i talk current state thai economy i discus recent development prospect ahead. second, i talk bank thailand’s role help transform thai economy one great productivity, good economic prospect, inclusivity. a many know, thai economy weather several storm past years. on external front, change political landscape macroeconomic policy major economy bring financial market volatility throughout region also great uncertainty global trade. on domestic front, thailand experience major drought flood affect agricultural price output, significantly pass his majesty late king bhumibol year half ago cause great grief sorrow among thais. yet thai economy stand firm able continue expand steadily, thank sound economic fundamental well-diversified economy underpin thailand’s resilience shocks. in 2017, thai economy recover markedly achieve annual gdp growth 3.9 percent. merchandise export grow 9.7 percent usd terms, high past 6 years, one main driver growth. the tourism sector continue perform well, number tourist reach new high 35 million. the economy expect continue strong momentum year, gdp growth 2/10 first quarter register impressive rate 4.8 % year year, high 5 years, private investment growth record 3-year high. nevertheless, recent economic upturn different episodes. indeed, gdp outturn macroeconomic number show strong improvement previous years, close look reveal growth uneven across different segment economy. at time indicator unemployment rate npl ratio rise slightly 2015 2017. this contrary would expect see macroeconomy perform better. although unemployment rate npl ratio recently stabilized, development reveal segment economy benefit much economic recovery. in view, least three reason behind developments. first, recovery primarily drive external demand. hence growth benefit felt mostly associate external sectors. the robust recovery momentum global scale result strong expansion thai export across product category export destinations. in addition, thai tourism sector grow consistently steady increase number quality tourists. therefore, surprise see business associate export good service enjoy benefit improve external demand. domestic demand growth, however, still proceed gradual pace. despite continuous recovery, private consumption growth remain well gdp, register within 3 percent range. and recently, private investment growth concentrate mainly export sector. overall, large current account surplus 10.5 percent gdp last year summarize pattern economic recovery reflect imbalance external domestic demand. second, rural economy expose adverse shock urban counterpart. specifically, several populist measure include controversial rice pledge scheme withdrawn, together adverse weather condition severe drought 2016 flood 2017 well decline global price key export crop especially rubber rice, constitute negative income shock farmers. in addition, rural entrepreneurs, mostly smes, tend le 3/10 productive might able compete large firm good equip capital technologies. thus, large productive firm able reap benefit economic recovery adapt change new business environment. indeed, difference business performance medium-sized large firm stock market widening. this evidence several financial indicator include return asset net profit margin. these development partly explain npl situation yet improve smes across board, see improvement loan quality among large corporates sectors. the third reason uneven economic recovery impair function spend multiplier. usually, recovery start emerge certain segment economy, multiplier effect spend create positive spillover part economy, thereby secure broad-based recovery time. however, export-oriented firm currently spearhead ongoing economic recovery capital-intensive. they utilize machinery rather rely labor. thus, positive spillover employment le prevailing. this partly explain manufacture employment growth rather moderate despite strong export growth pickup manufacture production index. furthermore, high level household debt, especially debt deleveraging period, dampen multiplier mechanism. this household use additional income service debt obligation rather spend good services. while sign household debt deleveraged, reflect continuous decline ratio household debt gdp fell 79.0 percent 2016 77.5 percent end last year, debt burden remain high especially lower-income households. lady gentlemen, i talk factor behind uneven economic performance last years. go forward, economic recovery expect broad-based i want highlight positive developments. first, export growth, main growth driver, become broad-based growth extend beyond large players. in fact, export growth rate smes 4/10 become le par large firms. domestic demand also gain traction steady growth private consumption, pickup private investment since third quarter last year especially import capital goods. second, government directly step various stimulus measure support rural economy. last year, government introduce supplementary budget particular focus local infrastructure development, welfare card scheme aim support daily expenditure among poor households. this year, new supplementary budget allocate vocational train part second phase welfare card scheme, development local community enterprises, well water resource development improve productivity within agricultural sector. this, together increase minimum wage april, support rural economy well-being lower-income group. third, multiplier effect improve back increase public private investment. while government infrastructure project defer last year partly due new government procurement system. this year progress good outlook since many project go bid procurement processes, material progress underway. these project include, among others, 4 5 dual-track railway project would greatly improve upon logistics network major city industrial estate central northeastern thailand. we expect see dual-track railway run 2019 2020 onwards. our mass transit system also upgrade 3 new metro line bangkok extend key station city residential area out bangkok. two projects, particularly green orange lines, construction complete 2021 2023, respectively. other infrastructure project construction include bangkok-korat high speed train expansion suvarnabhumi airport also expect complete years. on private side, private investment expect gain momentum evidence grow import capital good well investment spend machinery equipment. this line private credit growth pick since begin 2017. 5/10 give outlooks, expect growth momentum balance strong contribution domestic demand. in march forecast, gdp growth 2018 2019 project 4.1 percent. these figure likely revise give better-than-expected growth outturn first quarter year. headline inflation april may turn low bind target, set 2.5±1.5%, mainly due recent pickup energy prices. yet inflationary pressure remain soft overall must continue closely monitor inflation development supply-driven fluctuation fade. over time, improvement domestic demand rise energy price expect bring high inflation, although likely headline inflation would still remain midpoint target year. for now, accommodative monetary policy stance would maintain foster strong economic growth facilitate return inflation target. go forward, monetary policy committee closely monitor strength growth momentum, inflationary pressure well underprice risk financial system could lead financial fragility financial stability concerns. lady gentlemen, so far, i give overall near-term summary thai economy. let move second part talk look backbone thailand’s economic growth engine long horizon. in particular, i want focus bank thailand’s role help transform thai economy one efficient, productive, inclusive. but so, let give quick summary broad perspective regard new economic platform thailand emerge past years. chief among new investment platform eastern economic corridor eec short. the eec, many know, economic zone specifically design bring large infrastructure upgrade provide extensive investment incentive high value-added industries. the continuity investment platform ensure regardless political change eec act come effect since may. last year, see value net investment application thailand board investment privilege program 6/10 grow 23 percent, almost half investment eec. the high speed train project connect u-tapao airport major city within eec two main airport bangkok announce tor project available potential bidders. the tor laem chabang seaport upgrade also announce months’ time. in addition eec act, various legal amendment process improvement implement past couple year improve ease business thailand ensure law adjust accommodate new business practice timely manner. with reforms, thailand’s position world bank’s do business rank improve 46th 2017 26th 2018, continue see improvement ease business thailand go forward. another important development, provide strong foundation digital economy, nationwide broadband internet project. over past years, project bring fiber optic network almost 25,000 village remote part country, enable access free-wifi hotspot well home broadband affordable prices. a such, human capital development improve greatly good access online information, remote education, online healthcare services. business opportunity also greatly expand great access online market platform cost-effective communication tools. this new expand online connectivity critical milestone bring economic opportunity productivity people rural area whose potential limit previous lack supportive infrastructure connect modern world. lady gentleman, let turn bank thailand’s initiative help uplift thailand’s long-term competitiveness. thailand transition new era digital payment system financial technology bank thailand fully commit foster. first foremost, electronic payment infrastructure must put place realize full potential digital economy. under national e-payment masterplan, last year bank thailand together ministry finance 7/10 thai bankers’ association launch new fast payment system – promptpay – propel wide adoption e-payment thailand. promptpay instant payment platform link bank account various form identification include national id number mobile phone numbers. with promptpay, fund transfer recipient’s prefer bank account real time virtually cost. this new technology significantly boost usage mobile banking, potential lead significant growth e-commerce thailand well radically change way government welfare payment distributed. in year since launch promptpay, 40 million id register platform 2.7 million transaction day. the increase usage promptpay also serve catalyst eventually lead announcement commercial bank two month ago, eliminate transfer fee transfer mobile online banking. all all, promptpay provide crucial payment infrastructure open door many digital payment services. another initiative bank thailand promote digital payment service thai standard qr code payment. the standardize qr code make e-payment seamless across platform regardless bank non-bank service provider merchant consumer using. in eight month since implementations, two million merchant thailand accept e-payment qr code, figure continue grow. have common standard qr code indeed generate benefit beyond payment convenience. the common standard help ensure incumbent service provider advantage lock merchant qr formats, allow new innovative payment service provider easily enter market. the standard also help facilitate move towards information-based lend smes payment transaction information consolidated. give payment standard develop together five global credit card company use emvco, could serve platform enhance financial connectivity region. thai bank payment service provider begin work partner neighbor country facilitate cross-border payment use standardize qr code. this standardize qr code product go bank thailand’s regulatory sandbox. go forward, high-impact 8/10 technology application develop test bank thailand’s regulatory sandbox. the first one extension standardize qr code include mean payment, include credit card. this could bring number fraudulent transactions, markedly reduce merchant discount fee credit card payments. the second one blockchain technology work closely financial industry apply various bank applications. ‘thailand blockchain community initiative’ officially announce bangkok fintech fair march year. this initiative collaboration 14 thai bank 7 lead business state-owned enterprise utilize blockchain technology financial services, start pilot project offer blockchain-based letter guarantee. this project expect become operational second half year. on long horizon, blockchain technology also plan apply supply chain finance improve authentication efficiency would facilitate real sector activities. other blockchain relate project pipeline include scriptless bond issuance would significantly speed save bond allocation retail investor 15 day 2 days, well grant flexibility bond issuers. the proof-of-concept project almost complete, production expect begin near future. another project pipeline “project inthanon” bank thailand bank co-develop new way conduct interbank settlement use wholesale central bank digital currency cbdcs. like central banks, goal immediately bring cbdc use, rather explore potential implication back office operations. these effort pave way fast cheap transaction validation due le intermediation process need compare current systems. so far, i discuss bank thailand’s role catalyst digital infrastructure development facilitator innovation. one forget core mandate regulator safeguard financial stability. to end, propose new payment system act become effective early april. the act unify previously fragment payment law regulation single act, empower bank thailand authority regulate oversee development thai payment system manner conducive new 9/10 payment innovations. beside payment system act, supervisory practice also update improve safeguard cyber security risks. the update guideline management information technology risk financial institution release december last year ensure bank appropriate governance structure place swiftly respond event cyberattacks. our effort also extend ensure safety payment system, awareness among financial service provider consumers. let turn another area important region, promotion regional financial connectivity. over years, bank thailand make multiple arrangement regional central bank support use local regional currency trade investment. this reduce transaction cost mitigate exchange rate risk today’s volatile financial market conditions. in addition, direct exchange rate quotation currency pair involve thai baht available include chinese yuan, malaysian ringgit, indonesian rupiah, and, recently, japanese yen. on top promote local currency usage, foreign exchange regulation reform implement last year would complement regional financial connectivity make foreign exchange-related transaction flexible accessible. to give examples, foreign exchange transaction form completely abolished; qualify company allow conduct foreign exchange transaction hedge base risk management practice without request approval transactional basis; commercial bank also allow provide loan thai baht non-residents invest region; coverage qualify investor allow directly invest abroad expand include retail investor within wide range wealth. all all, outlook prospect digitalization regional financial integration look promise bank thailand continue facilitate timely development new financial innovation also safeguard financial stability efficient business-friendly manner ensure smooth successful transition thai economy. 10/10 lady gentleman, i come end talk let give brief summary i say today. the thai economy continue expand good pace merchandise export tourism far main driver growth. although growth benefit spill segment economy much would like see, domestic demand improve expect robust balance gdp growth year. on long horizon, thailand undergo major transformation emergence several promise economic platform ongoing transition towards new era digital financial payment services, unlock thailand’s economic potential, uplift productivity, bring inclusive growth. the thai government bank thailand, various capacities, commit make achievement possible. thank much attention. 1/5 keynote speech “strengthening acmecs integration financial cooperation” acmecs ceo forum dr. veerathai santiprabhob governor bank thailand friday, 15 june 2018 shangri-la hotel, bangkok excellencies, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, swasdee krub, first all, i would like take opportunity thank leader ayeyawady-chao phraya-mekong economic cooperation strategy (acmecs) organizer opportunity speak important forum. i believe acmecs bank thailand share common goal, goal promote economic financial development ensure sustainable well-being people. certainly, region immense potential growth perspectives, abundant natural resource population prim embrace new economic opportunities. just important development financial system unlock potential people support grow intra-regional trade investment. a well-functioning financial system critical foundation u achieve common goal. to establish suitable financial environment, financial development

development sector prioritize hind economic integration. fortunately, today opportunity leapfrog development financial system regional financial connectivity rapid advancement technology. not point history powerful technology affordable accessible. for instance, cost industrial robot smartphones 30 time 50 time cheap similar feature ten year ago. moreover, diverse extensive number software application well know-how available satisfy business consumers; many access online obtain free-of-charge. all allow great adoption mobile device well emergence new financial technology platforms. look around region, many excite development take place enhance financial system strengthen productivity, inclusivity, immunity. for instance: a. emergence faster-pay infrastructure mobile financial service within region like fast payment wing cambodia, wave money myanmar, promptpay thailand help reduce cost financial service financial institution public large. for thailand, promptpay infrastructure help cut cost retail fund transfer much financial institution offer online transfer free-of-charge. these infrastructure critical foundation new add-on service build upon support grow e-commerce activity region. b. in addition, see firm experiment use alternative online data machine learn credit score model. a credit 3/5 score model create data payment receipt help financial institution good ass credit risk ensure borrowers, especially small enterprises, gain fund fair price. c. another initiative undergo test thailand use blockchain cross-border financial transactions. this technology make cross-border payment secure, efficient, affordable business large population near future. lady gentlemen, all example development happen financial landscape. what important must recognize financial technology powerful tool u improve productivity, immunity, inclusivity. efficiency financial service enhanced, new payment ecosystem enable efficient transfer fund significantly low transaction cost consumers. it also allow financial institution scale-down high cost brick-and-mortar model shift le costly efficient digital services. meanwhile, resilience strengthen financial institution use payment online data good analyze forecast credit demand credit risks. additionally, advancement technology like biometrics blockchains help safeguard financial information reduce number magnitude fraudulent activities. finally, financial inclusion improve digitization financial service platform allow access online smartphone, benefit consumer city remote areas. moreover, ever-expanding universe new financial service mean number choice solution available fulfill different needs, especially currently underserved. lady gentlemen, a financial technology help unlock massive potential people, us, leader policymakers, play important role “the catalysts,” pave way great adoption financial technology. on point, i believe least four key area catalyst like u must act together: 4/5 first, must encourage common standard technology platform avoid market fragmentation. have common standard would improve competition innovation, allow easy access players, especially small innovative players. a good example common standard standardize qr code electronic payment thailand, bank non-banks apply common standard applications. the result remarkable speed adoption qr code payment; le one year since launch, qr code payment accept 2 million merchant thailand. more importantly, financial institution within region already take advantage interoperability qr code apply common standard application cross-border transaction partners. we certain many similar partnership future. second, must establish basic open digital financial infrastructure innovation emerge serve wide range consumers. open infrastructure enable service provider build value-added service top low cost. for instance, e-payment service create base promptpay infrastructure, bill payment request-to-pay features. these, turn, help facilitate e-payments merchant consumer improve overall e-commerce business landscape. even charitable organization able take advantage open-platform e-donation. meanwhile, adoption electronic payment common infrastructure create data essential information-based lend bank improve risk models. third, must facilitate great convergence rule regulation within region make sure exist regulation impede advancement financial connectivity. effort make area. asean central bank work initiative asean bank integration framework make bank regulation cohesive, aim achieve great consistency international best practice. meanwhile, aim enhance connectivity, since june last year bank thailand undertake foreign exchange regulation reform relax 5/5 rule foreign exchange control make foreign exchange-related transaction digital, flexible, accessible. to give examples, foreign exchange transaction form completely abolished, reduce document-related burden private sector; work scope money changer money transfer agent expand good facilitate retail cross-border transactions; commercial bank provide direct thai baht loan non-resident company establish great mekong sub-region (gms). these effort improve connectivity well ease business region. fourth, must foster great cooperation cyber security ensure resilience financial systems. arise new form financial technology increase reliance data transmit device data usage; come great risk cyber threat. and, globally number threat incident rising. cyber security one, not, top priority catalyst like u go forward. lady gentlemen, the bank thailand look forward work closely central banks, government agency and, importantly, private sector participant acmecs region support adoption financial technology promote economic financial developments. with affordability availability many powerful financial technologies, good time u improve productivity, immunity, inclusivity ensure sustainable improvement standard live people. i certain contribution acmecs leader present today go long way towards fulfil common goal. thank much kind attention. “rising above disruptions: a call action” keynote remark dr. veerathai santiprabhob governor bank thailand national director conference 2018 thai institute director 21 june 2018, plaza athenee hotel, bangkok thailand dr. bandid nijathaworn, mr. andrew sheng, secretary general rapee sucharitakul, chief executives, directors, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen. a good morning all. first all, i would like express sincere thank thai institute director (iod) invite part excite important event. i always strong appreciation iod’s mission work improve director professionalism corporate governance thailand. i would also like commend iod organize year’s conference proactive forward look agenda go well beyond focus corporate governance. this year’s conference program concentrate area need collaborate ensure future success country. it therefore honor today share think distinguish director key leader play integral role drive thailand forward. lady gentlemen, 2 we live unprecedented period profound change exponential advancement technology transform everything know. the speed, scope impact technological change unlike anything experience before. it disrupt transform whole value chains, across sector corner globe, extremely fast pace. the effect digital revolution far reaching. we see affect wide spectrum industry range agriculture automobile, encompass broad range profession farmer financial professionals. drone use monitor agricultural yield provide logistic services. artificial intelligence (ai) predict certain form cancer accurately doctor enable car self-driven. from 3d printing, genome mapping, internet thing (iot) and, soon, internet everything, possibility limitless. a country, respond challenge determine thailand’s position world economy path future generation take. of course, one accurately predict path technological advancement lead u digital future unfold, certain traditional way conduct business upend leadership challenged. board member executive face strategic risk could threaten viability organization make timely change business model remain relevant competitive. equally important manage risk associate digital transformation. a director know well, execute successful strategic transformation easy task. execute successful digital transformation ecosystem still evolve even challenging. lady gentlemen, amidst rapid technological advancements, i believe everyone agree wait-and-see strategy inadequate. hence, i much concur conference’s theme “a call action.” it take courage lead transformative 3 journey unknown territory. the collective wisdom share among director enable u make good inform decision lead organizations, importantly, lead thailand, onto right path – path rise disruptions, iod eloquently put it. a thailand embark journey digital transformation, must focus three key imperative productivity, immunity, inclusivity. technological advancement provide tremendous opportunity u uplift three area like never before. while policymakers regulator provide support infrastructure level promote stable environment conducive innovation, firm level action must take drive meaningful change country whole. first, productivity: uplift country’s productivity necessary ensure continue long-term economic growth. specifically, structural change due age workforce hasten need country improve productivity maintain output level. in fact, thailand’s labor productivity growth decline. from 2002 2017, annual growth labor productivity average 2.9 percent, significant drop average 5 percent 1986 2001. in contrast, country china indonesia experience rise productivity growth. should trend continue, thailand able maintain competitiveness output level. fortunately, many technological advancement available much low cost today hold huge promise raise productivity. cloud computing, robotics automation allow business save significant costs. big data, artificial intelligence machine learn capability offer insight enable target services. i urge seize opportunity leverage new technology improve productivity firms, industries, eventually country. second, immunity: growth sustainable must sufficient immunity withstand unexpected shocks. we live time great changes, outcome sudden, unpredictable, volatile, bring 4 new form risks. not firm face risk relate strategy, finance, operation, also face risk associate drive digital transformations. manage transformation process digital environment require foster organizational culture agile nimble—to gain flexibility speed drive productivity innovation. but, time, strong culture risk management must also instill safeguard firms’ resilience. a industry increasingly rely data data-driven technologies, cyber security must consider top priority. globally, number threat incident rising, increase frequency, sophistication scale impacts. for instance, 2010 mcafee lab record 60,000 new malwares per day, 2017 number rise almost ten fold 500,000 350 new malwares per minute. it also estimate cost cybercrime excess usd 600 billion year. a such, organization must build sufficient cyber resilience put place safeguard improve threat prevention detection ensure preparedness response recovery cyber attack occur. third, inclusivity: economic development without fair distribution induce social economic instabilities, threaten long-term sustainable growth. this one area must improve country. accord credit suisse global wealth report, 58 percent nation's wealth control rich 1 percent people. meanwhile, 61 percent land own top 10 percent land owners, three quarter population land. like previous industrial revolutions, digital revolution bring challenge income wealth distribution, high skill access capital much likely reap benefit get large piece pie. this call increase effort address issue make sure one leave behind. if issue neglected, digital divide widen inequality gap even further. 5 ensure easy affordable access technology innovation help reduce inequality promote thailand’s inclusivity. lower-income group people remote area need access quality service essential improve welfare, education bank services. it therefore crucial basic infrastructure put place starting, instance, national-wide internet broadband access point promptpay electronic fund transfer system. moreover, infrastructure must interoperable open all, would definitely require collaboration whole industry, effort one firm. our promptpay infrastructure result close collaboration bank thailand thai bankers’ association. it spur healthy competition amongst banks, catalyze enhancement e-payment landscape provide increase opportunity many small merchant consumers. another important factor inclusivity digital literacy. it imperative equip people necessary skill survive thrive digital era. this endure task one require active participation every level. this effort begin individual staff one’s organization—working tech-savvy junior technologically-challenged peers. lady gentlemen, i believe three key imperative productivity, immunity, inclusivity help thailand navigate digital disruption continue path sustainable economic growth. before i end remark morning, i would like emphasize new digital ecosystem still evolve future remain uncertain, cannot afford hold back. we must strategically adapt adopt technology remain relevant competitive provide support sustainable improvement standard live thai people. 6 in closing, i would like congratulate iod fittingly organize call action conference. action take firm level determine direction country whether efficiently catch rapid technological changes. these change also inevitably affect whole ecosystem thailand. therefore, i urge think big picture firm help make thailand’s digital transformation successful fruitful. so, think big, stay informed, act wisely. only certain together could truly rise disruptions. thank attention. ********* gent sejko: albania's economic financial development 2017introductory statement mr gent sejko, governor bank

monetary policy transmissionmechanism. throughout 2017, work three main aspects:first, promote use national currency.the high euroization render monetary policy pass-through difficult, expose theprivate agent financial system exchange rate volatility. aware fact, bank ofalbania, ministry finance economy albanian financial supervision authoritysigned memorandum cooperation “on increase use national currency (all) inthe albanian financial system economy”. in memorandum, signatory institutionscommit identify undertake action within area competence. in framework,the bank albania identify package measures, follow consultation thebanking industry, shall enter force second half 2018.second, enhance appetite bank expand lending.banks’ appetite lend continue remain relatively low, reflect

6bis central bankers' speech regard financial stability, bank albania continue implement prudential andpro-active regulatory supervisory policy.in 2017, fourteen full-scope partial examination perform banks, non-bank financialinstitutions, save loan associations. the examination show performanceof bank sector improve term of: quality internal policy theirimplementation; establishment adequate risk

medium-termdevelopment strategy bank albania, together medium-term budget, wasupdated 2017. for first time, capital expenditure project include 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech budget preliminary approve capital expenditure committee. also, auditcommittee continue work throughout 2017. this committee conduct monitor functionindependently bank albania management. in 2017, supervisory council

implement policy undertake measure serve promotingmonetary financial stability, contribute safeguard economic financialbalances, necessary sustainable economic growth.honourable speaker,honourable member parliament,as i state begin speech, development perspective albania remainspositive. nevertheless, continue face challenges, beaddressed courage, vision determination.at end presentation, allow present vision bank albania futureof economy financial system, well adequate development policies.3. development perspective challengessupported favourable finance conditions, recovery global economy thestrengthening confidence economy, cyclical improvement albanian economy isexpected continue medium-term horizon next two-three years. the growth ofaggregate demand encourage increase employment fast rise wages.the full utilisation production capacity enable return inflation target within themedium-term horizon help improve overall economic financial equilibriums.the realisation scenario condition lack internal external shock thealbanian economy financial system. also, require continue accommodative monetarypolicy stance maintain consolidate fiscal policy trend. these policies’ coordination isvital strengthen macroeconomic stability albania. on one hand, maintain astimulating resultant trend main economic policy and, hand, address thevarious vulnerabilities.looking beyond medium-term horizon, bank albania ass need bedone strengthen economic growth pace increase albanian economy’sresilience shocks. though accommodative monetary policy provide support thisregard, cannot substitute structural reform need improve whole function ofthe albanian economy.we deem structural reform address key issues:further improvement business climate, through: continuation measure

necessary policy reform integration country.***honourable speaker,honourable member parliament,concluding, i would like assure bank albania remain commit complyingwith legal objectives, fulfil institutional task engagements.thank attention! 6 / 6bis central bankers' speech 23.05.2018 “strengthening economic governance euro: short-term priority long-term view” high level seminar. banco de españa luis m. linde governor 3/5 lady gentlemen, let first extend warm welcome banco de españa. thank join u today seminar address press important topic economic governance euro: short-term priority long-term view. i would like thank panelist kind accept invitation; please among u long list distinguish participant would certainly throw much welcome light discussion. the time conference particularly relevant. after year low growth, europe experience robust recovery open window opportunity make progress governance reform agenda next economic downturn unfolds. support expansionary monetary policy, real gdp euro area expand 19 quarter row. strong price dynamic yet materialize, confident prudent, patient persistent, monetary policy measure effective achieve medium-term goals. price stability necessary sufficient condition achieve sustain balance growth. in fact, one important lesson draw first twenty year emu need improve area’s resilience large macroeconomic shock increase stabilization capacity. in context, currently find crossroad refer pace governance reform agenda. despite evident progress since peak crisis, build cohesive monetary union, propose van rompuy’s report june 2012 (the so-called four presidents’ report) juncker’s report june 2015 (the so-called five presidents’ report), is, know that, difficult task. a matter fact, significant step forward since establishment single resolution fund june 2014. recently, several initiative attempt re-launch debate future euro area’s governance, including, december 2017, european commission’s report “further step towards complete europe's economic monetary union: a roadmap”, or, january present year, center economic policy research’s report “reconciling risk share market discipline: a constructive approach euro area reform”, which, many probably know, discuss recent seminar banco de españa. the package reform measure put forward ec cover broad set issues, completion bank union design mechanism reconcile market discipline risk share establishment european union finance minister. the panelist today share view analysis central issues. let briefly reflect upon them. the euro-summit 15th december 2017 result renew political commitment foster progress emu´s architecture first semester present year. the aim trigger necessary discussion achieve material progress 4/5 month precede closure, spring 2019, current legislature european parliament. our political leader assign priority completion bank union, establishment common fiscal backstop single resolution fund, introduction common european deposit insurance scheme (edis) eventual full risk mutualisation. both essential element severe link bank sovereign bolster ability area deal large macroeconomic shocks. the development capital market union surely another key project deserve mention top political agenda. leader also agree need reduce risk banks’ balance sheets, include –but only- stock non-performing loans, still large jurisdictions. current proposal create sovereign bond-backed security (sbbs) could contribute reduce current home-bias bank´s sovereign hold accompany regulatory reform ensure acceptance investors. but reform carefully calibrate avoid hind liquidity price formation sovereign bond markets. but issue require time agree put motion. a empirical evidence point out, risk share channel substantially weak euro monetary unions, also compare large country inside euro area, large share idiosyncratic national shock income cannot smooth out. upgrade efficiency risk-sharing channels, private public, good exploit synergy among would provide euro area shock-absorption capacity improve access cross-border equity finance currently lacking. on fiscal front, euro area need achieve eventually complete fiscal union. some form semi-automatic cyclical insurance mechanism asymmetric shock could design make possible risk-sharing without entail permanent transfer countries. depend modalities, instrument could also contribute smooth aggregate shocks, achieve balance policy mix increase share responsibility monetary policy. in addition, eu rule-based fiscal framework need gain simplicity transparency. recent proposals, seek give great weight public debt medium-term anchor expenditure rule operational tool, deserve consideration. at time, increase national ownership foster enhance oversight role independent fiscal authorities. the aim generate enough room maneuver good times, stabilise capacity fiscal policy may large crisis times. in sum, lot work remain do near- medium-term. these perspective underpin agenda today’s seminar, organize around two panels. a first panel, short-term challenge towards complete emu, discus reform agenda feasible pursue current european parliamentary cycle (until 2019). 5/5 in second panel, long-term prospect cohesive emu, would like address medium- long-run step necessary increase euro area’s capacity prevent crisis manage them. finally, economy minister ramón escolano close seminar explain strategic vision underline recent proposal emu architecture articulate spanish government. the proposal constitute, view, politically realistic program advance process governance reform short-term without lose sight longer-term needs. the final goal provide emu solid institutional framework help ensure prosperity well-being euro area citizen improve public perception integration project. now, accord agenda, i give floor moderator first panel, paloma marín. bank italy – the global foundation rome roundtable 2018 rome, 15 june 2018 dinner address governor bank italy ignazio visco your excellences, lady gentlemen, pleasure welcome bank italy. i would like thank steve howard, secretary general the global foundation, bring together many distinguish guest discus state world might improved. i also thank jock murray, chairman the global foundation, kind introduction. i honour set stage keynote address his eminence cardinal pietro parolin. unfortunately, i could attend session first day meeting. i regret much address theme fundamental importance global economy. these theme appear remote main task central bankers, preserve price financial stability, deep level issue connect lose sight major change affect society economies. in january 2017, pope francis’ address the global foundation inspire main theme today’s tomorrow’s discussion. he stigmatize “an ideology capitalism” show “little interest reality marginalization, exploitation human alienation, lack concern great number people still live condition grave material moral poverty, blind faith unbridle development market force alone” invite u “to discern way attain globalization ‘cooperative’, thus positive, oppose globalization indifference”. obviously, i clear short answer question pose pope francis, i believe issue labour central. it relate social integration personal identity. at economic level, see solely cyclical problem: economy’s growth depend quantity quality labour force capacity provide adequate job ever-changing times. therefore, remark tonight i first consider main force shape future challenge pose; i hint trap – policy maker – avoid order move towards “cooperative globalization” invite realize. 1 over last decades, four overarch force shape world economy: globalization, technological progress, demographic transition climate change. for part, globalization technological progress positive powerful engine economic progress social change. but give heterogeneous, pervasive differentiate effects, also object fierce critique deep-seated fears, policy maker neglect. globalization complex, multidimensional phenomenon, consist deep integration goods, service capital markets, also greatly increase mobility people, information ideas. the globalization experience last quarter century could achieve without technological revolution today symbolize wide diffusion computers, internet, smartphones robots. this technological revolution inexorably permeate aspect economic social life. it radically change people’s habit firms’ activities, well way working, producing, consuming, exchange information interact socially. statistic concern digitalization economy tell clear story: 2016, 95 per cent business oecd country broadband internet connection; 75 per cent web presence; half adult population purchase good service online, compare 36 per cent 2010. these number suggest that, digital era, financial, economic even social inclusion closely relate technological inclusion. the formidable achievement globalization technological progress often forget discussion turn shortcoming risks: − the world economy today six time large 50 year ago, total population increase little two-fold, average per caput gdp doubled. − over last 25 year 1 billion people escape extreme poverty (defined income 1.9 dollar per day) 2.2 billion add world population. therefore, 3.5 billion people never enter escape condition. the target halve share people live extreme poverty thus achieve five year early establish within millennium development goal agree 2000 unite nations, notwithstanding exceptional increase world population. − the so-called emerge economy – exclude global economy host large share poor – substantially narrow gap advance country today main contributor world growth. − the mortality rate child age 5 halve globally 1990 2015. 2 − thank great labour mobility, today 260 million people live foreign country, le 80 million 1970, flow among develop country exceed towards advance economies. however, everybody benefit way economic expansion provide trade innovation. economic backwardness, poverty high mortality rate still dramatic problem many develop countries, especially sub-saharan africa. even prosperous countries, many leave behind. inequality distribution income decline dramatically last three decade global level, mainly result fast growth china emerge market reduce distance rich part world. however, within country difference income wealth rise historically high levels. finally, rapid pace technological progress unprecedented nature make possible replace physical labour even displace intellectual contribution variety task believe prerogative humans. this raise fear new form technological unemployment, medium-skilled population also vulnerable, help spread sense insecurity, raise demand protection. the two factor shape present future condition – demographic transition climate change – independent from, actually reinforce by, global economic integration technological progress. high live standard wide access good healthcare increase life expectancy across globe. for first time history, world face grow population – estimate reach almost 10 billion 2050, 7.5 billion today (and 2.5 billion 1950) – also age one: almost 1 billion people age 60 world (13 per cent global population) age group grow fast (at 3 per cent per year) young age groups. in advance countries, well china, decline birth rates, increase life expectancy, push so-called old-age dependency ratio, population 64 relative working-age population (aged 15 64). in europe, age progress fast rate: italy, old age dependency ratio rise 12 per cent 1950 35 today; germany, 14 32 per cent. demographic transition, however, global phenomenon: japan old population world, china dependency ratio double since 1950 expect reach 44 per cent 2050, 13 today. this demographic transition deep long-lasting economic impact. however, argument impact inevitably negative rest assumption old people unproductive consumer government benefits. this necessarily case: 3 − age automatically imply unproductive sick. a 70 year old today many respect much “younger” person age 50 year ago mean avoid marginalization elderly keep integral productive part society longer. − while relative term old outgrow young, number young people world large history absolute terms, distribute evenly around globe. of 2.2 billion people add world population since 1990, le 1 10 live advance countries. africa, host poor country world, expect fast population increase century, reach asia absolute terms. only integrate world economy wise policy help spread benefit progress evenly. this also require flow migration properly managed. climate change link say far. the post-war exponential demographic acceleration – “population explosion” – prompt discussion “limits growth”. at start 1970s, report club rome, centre predict depletion natural resources, raise alarm survival earth’s ecosystem human race. these projection receive great attention media, greet sceptically many eminent economist time. with reason, critic note report fail account two major stabilize mechanisms: ability relative price rebalance supply demand endogenous response technology. notwithstanding power two mechanisms, make long-term projection hazardous, concern abated. the debate sustainable development – i.e. development “meet need present without compromise ability future generation meet needs” – suggest today impossible ignore environmental balance planet reciprocal compatibility, trade-offs, economic, social ecological objectives. climate change long scientific curiosity, fundamental theme today’s public debate. a series important international agreement (the kyoto treaty 1997 paris climate agreement 2016) make clear two aspect special importance: 1) tackle challenge climate change global level, cooperation party involved; 2) devise incentive invention use new technology drastically curtail emission carbon dioxide greenhouse gases. globalization, technological progress, demographic transition climate change present u formidable challenges. but economic integration, scientific progress improvement education health condition provide great opportunity forge prosperous, equitable sustainable world economy. however, must clearly understand attain “cooperative” globalization entail govern world 4 economy, would illusory rely solely upon unfettered market forces. a global financial crisis clearly demonstrated, effective regulation, adequately fund international financial institution strong cooperation among nation necessary mitigate risk, grant stability correct market excesses. unfortunately, live unprecedented bad time international relations. a retrenchment policy towards narrowly define national interest short-termism definition policy objectives, partly dictate continuous monitor popular approval facilitate new digital technologies, significant risk today. the u decision back paris climate agreement recent failure sign share communiqué g7 summit charlevoix clear sign danger liberal world order global cooperation. the trade dispute revelatory difficulty encounter road cooperation. a well known, basic economic teach trade policy free trade far best option grant full exploitation comparative advantage party involved. indeed, current trade system base multilateral agreement underpin economic development decades. obviously ignore potential complication arise different level industrialization across nation risk specialize product might lock country pre-industrial stage, may case much north-south trade colonial period. but must consider that, trade deals, interest producer consumer seldom aligned. often benefit give tariff import quota concentrate hand well-organized producers, costs, matter great absolute terms, spread among large number unaware unorganized consumers. a similar conflict concentrate diffuse interest also arise case climate change, tension added, one current future generations. a final example difficulty encounter road cooperation reaction migration. of course, many reason migration meet resistance receive communities. while concern vulnerable part population must addressed, recognize international mobility positive force economic social development: properly handled, could help poor country grow alleviate pressure labour markets, could ease consequence age rich economies, need young labour force balance fall birth rates. but ignore conflict migration may generate. a first one citizen rich

challenge interest rate already low levels, limit room availablefor cut policy rate – ecb deposit facility already bring tozero july 2012.but interest rate across whole spectrum maturity low first

credibility. however, mid-2014 benigndevelopments overshadow decline long-term inflation expectations, which, acentral bank’s perspective, highly concerning. turn real term premia, availablesince 2005

annualresearch conference central bank ukraine, kiev, 1 june 2018.* * *ladies gentlemen,before i begin talk earnest, i would like thank organizer invite thisinspiring event. it honor participate distinguish panel. and particularpleasure visit kiev, one great historical pivot europe also city withimmense economic potential. the latter, i believe, say ukraine general.the topic panel entire conference monetary-fiscal interactions. this animportant issue, i convince good work relationship central bankand government imperative proper counter-cyclicality economic policy. myintention today, however, offer relate cautionary tale. i talk central bankindependence, emphasis experience country.few economist nowadays doubt importance central bank independence achievingprice stability. for example, late meta-analysis research question summarize 300empirical estimate dozen study find strong evidence independence iscrucial deliver low inflation (iwasaki uegaki, 2017). this find hold bothdeveloped emerge economies, author clearly show.but many economist stream literature, prominently alex cukierman, stress itis enough independence enshrine central bank’s charter. legal independenceis necessary condition actual independence, sufficient one. i would say actualindependence state mind central bankers. this state mind, then, determine theoutcome monetary policy imperative provide price stability.so actual independence differ legal independence? the key condition actualindependence de facto impossibility dismiss central bank board members. in fact, thecharters almost central bank around world (including national bank ukraine andthe czech national bank) allow board member dismiss specificconditions. but applicability condition vary widely, depend custom –crucially, i believe – central bank’s stand society.this observation bring important point i want make. even central bank actuallyindependent government, cannot long term act direct contradiction thepreferences society. for example, population averse modest inflation, thecentral bank hard time impose ultra-low-inflation environment, theassociated cost benefits, long run.the experience czech national bank, perhaps, serf case point, although theopposite direction. in general, czech despise inflation, central bank need explainrepeatedly us worldwide standard 2% inflation target instead target literalstability cpi level, 0% inflation. already many decade era independentmonetary policy, early 1920s, czechoslovakia pursue strategy deliberatelystrengthening national currency. this policy result deep deflation, strong contrast tothe hyperinflations see time neighbor country (austria, germany, hungary, andpoland; see sargent, 1982).so, come surprise czech national bank rarely applaud cut interest 1 / 2bis central bankers' speech rates, hike often welcome majority population. an important public-relations test arise bank 2013, interest rate cut prove insufficient returninflation target. inspire partly one distinguish member today’s panel, czechnational bank adopt exchange rate commitment keep currency appreciating.the commitment terminate year ago. since then, study imf academic alikehave point large benefit policy term reduce unemployment, lift gdpgrowth, prevent deflation. within two year commitment’s enactment, czechrepublic – least part thank commitment – turn de facto sick man europeto one fastest-growing economy low unemployment rate entire eu.when i attend conference seminar central banks, foreign colleague oftenassume policy must tremendously popular. indeed, economics behindit straightforward, result boost peoples’ wage hard deny. in spite that, theexchange rate commitment cause sharp ever deterioration public confidence theczech national bank: around 75% around 50%. confidence recover thecommitment terminated. these precisely time hard-won independencehad put work.thus, central bank independence build country’s law code treasure without whichprice stability rarely possible. but equally important perception independence bycentral banker themselves. this perception, turn, depend compatibility themonetary policy regime preference population. it often overlooked, however,that central banker impact preferences. rhetoric matter great deal, andcommunication one potent tool monetary policy.true, enhance financial literacy alter public preference process thankless,tiresome, long-term job, one often appreciate year even decade later. the manresponsible instill low-inflation mentality czechs, alois rašín, shoot

house market seminar, klaas knot share view house price become problem broad economic wellbeing, thus form area interest central bankers. a balance suitable supply house needed. the new dutch house agenda promise example lead role government play dutch house market. distinguish guests, welcome amsterdam! the city high house price rise netherlands and, last year, also eurozone. i live here, i witness soar price first hand. amsterdam, like many capital cities, lead rebound dutch house market, start 2013. price begin take off, within year grow annual rate 15%. it story large city netherlands. and recently, rest country follow trend, house price rise everywhere. my work take globe, world’s major cities. many come cities, europe: london, paris stockholm, also washington, seoul sydney. and similarly, i see eye similar house market dynamic locations, become increasingly popular. this invite here, discus serious questions. do agree analysis problem field? could learn other’s best practices? be one solution? my view but first, please allow share view. a resident, president course economist. while increase popularity city worldwide may good news places, homeowners, also pose challenges. demand urban house strongly outstrip supply. this lead surge house price seeing. at time, also put pressure rental markets. and although supervisors, central bank government strengthen mortgage regulation since crisis, risk credit-driven boom always looms. after all, homeowner often will take debt able live city. we haven’t yet see credit boom netherlands, country house price growth couple strong mortgage growth. 2 indeed, strong price increase make urban house affordability press issue everywhere world. for central bankers, responsible financial stability, affordability may always important concern. however, extreme example san francisco bay area, silicon valley, average house cost €1.5 million, show become problem broad economic wellbeing. a area booming, many worker cannot afford live anymore. recently, see books, research paper newspaper article document consequence decrease affordability, social well economic. urban demographic change result. young, well-educated people draw cities, often chase limit supply housing. due house shortage, middle-income household disadvantage: rich qualify social housing, rich enough buy house. they need rely rental market. however, market function well, case many cities, middle income family force move away. moreover, rise major city also lead increase divergence city peripheral regions. at time, spillover effect cause price rise area directly border major cities. this ultimately affect structure economic development, increasingly shift urban area away periphery. house supply the lack suitable house play major role here. supply shortage cities, less extent part country, main driver current price rises. and know past experience, strong house price rise lead overshooting. which often follow correction. this price volatility remain confine house market. in country like netherlands, high rate home ownership dependence mortgage lending, house price volatility fee real economy. the link house price private consumption strong here. this symbiotic relationship cause boom grow large bust deeper. a balance suitable supply house thus needed. this mean owner-occupied housing, also private rental, especially middle-income households. a dnb study pinpoint last year, put tight spot house market. in view, large mid-market private rental segment key create house market free imbalances, especially cities. on top that, make house market good align need increasingly flexible globalize labour market. however, since last year, necessary progress enlarge house supply still limited. a lack plan build capacity, well zone restrictions, impede new-build development around cities. moreover, lower-tier government like municipality lack effective incentive develop private rental sector. so dutch government take pro-active, lead role ensure appropriate supply new houses. they mean encourage municipality provide private rental housing, instance set minimum targets. in practice, would mean government make arrangement municipality include minimum percentage mid-market rental house zone plans. moreover, higher-level body, national government coordinate locality le affect local pressures, nimby (not-in-my-backyard) protests. therefore, i happy hear, yesterday, minister interior present new house agenda. this agenda mean accelerator ensure construction 75,000 new house year 2025. i think good initiative, broad spectrum house market stakeholder involved: builders, house associations, home-owners, institutional investor local governments. to me, promise example lead role government play dutch house market. our next speaker, i introduce shortly, speak dutch government’s effort field. 3 a central banker financial stability mandate, house market development pose new challenge risk analysis possible policy responses. and i sure struggle challenge too. today’s tomorrow’s seminar you room discus issue watchful eye past presidents. and might notice programme, come different countries, also divergent backgrounds. when organise seminar, want avoid groupthink promote healthy exchange view different perspectives. so speaker come central bank public bodies, others academia private sector. and course seminar major city would complete without representative city themselves. we hope different background help u tackle question face us. today tomorrow, would like address four questions. we start question big city popular, whether popularity stay. the first session devote question. but i also sure keynote speaker professor edward glaeser shine light issue. after all, conduct research urban development 25 years. be central bank, also broach bubble question: house bubble big city measure this? if anything financial crisis teach us, cause concern bubble fuel excessive credit provision. credit-driven bubble detrimental financial stability. curiously, netherlands, house market recovery seem credit-driven: house price seem exploding, mortgage growth near zero. i cannot help notice uncommon development drive today’s low interest rates. a private investor find sufficient return save account safe investments, turn house market drive prices. tomorrow, look third question, supply side house market: role supply friction play current environment? city notoriously dense, expand supply thus difficult urban areas. so peripheral areas, supply issue policy option study detail. this bring u last topic, fourth question: policy action need effectively address issues? until recently, policymakers, least central banks, focus mainly restrict demand. measure like ltv limits, lti restriction capital requirement keep mortgage growth, thus price growth, check. however, current development seem le drive credit, least netherlands, fundamental like population growth supply shortages. it’s thus likely need look standard house market toolkit. the seminar: proceed & logistics to ensure lesson learn today tomorrow available future, publish conference proceed summer. from contribution already received, i tell rich collection paper surely add collective knowledge urban house markets. before i introduce next speaker, i would like give detail logistics seminar. to begin with, session different moderator. they important role today: make sure presentation keep brief to-the-point, stimulate debate. second, fortunate impressive turnout high-level policy makers, lead academic financial sector representative various countries. give seat constraints, number sit second row. at time, let stress everyone second row welcome participate discussion seat front. finally, please note we’ve invite couple trust friend dutch press attend seminar. but, obviously, chatham house rule applies, start right introduction key note speech. so, nothing stand way open, thought-provoking stimulate discussion! i sincerely hope today’s seminar bring collective understand urban house market bite further, help u tackle challenge ahead. 4 and let turn next speaker. we invite deputy prime minister, minister interior kingdom relations, kajsa ollongren. she responsible house policy netherlands. unfortunately,

forward-looking approach identify vulnerability hard soft market infrastructure. we see core institutional responsibilities. indeed, bank make catalyse structural reform financial markets, new risk-free benchmark i’ll turn moment, one core strategic goals. but authority cannot future-proof alone. we rely industry help u scan landscape emerge risk help determine way mitigate them. we encourage efforts. in particular, fmsb undertake horizon scan future misconduct risk innovative behaviour cluster analysis; global foreign exchange committee, responsible keep fx global code ‘alive’, already identify area work spot fx market practices.7 with leader industry here, hope today’s discussion identify emerge risk challenges, explore work together address potential vulnerability continue build real market good people uk beyond. in spirit, concluding, i want briefly touch one big challenge face u right – transition risk free rates. the move new risk free rate libor prime example critical hard (market) infrastructure keep market developments. libor mean measure short-term unsecured fund cost banks. but reality that, since financial crisis, libor really become rate bank don’t lend other. bank fund market change enormously. bank long take sufficient short-term wholesale deposit form basis robust transaction-based libor benchmark. a result libor overly reliant expert judgement rather actual transactions. and global market remain overly reliant libor, benchmark may exist beyond 2021. that reliance neither desirable sustainable. that’s authority internationally work market participant identify alternative benchmark base actual transactions. these overnight rate – relatively pure read risk-free rate economy. in sterling, market choose sonia, benchmark administer bank england. in april implement reform sonia boost volume transaction capture factor three £50bn per day. 7 these area are: role ‘cover deal’ similar trade model play fx market; market participant

executive board european central bank, atthe international risk management conference, paris, 8 june 2018.* * *risk management come long way since edward altman introduce z-score tomeasure likelihood bankruptcy 1968, financial crisis bring aboutsignificant change risk management commercial bank central bank alike.but emerge crisis, would well reflect persist fromthat period, “new normal” risk management be. so today i would like todiscuss risk management mean ecb recent times, change wecan expect approach phase monetary policy normalisation.but i elaborate this, i note enter quiet period nextmonetary policy meet ecb govern council, therefore remark beunderstood high-level reflection interpret contain commitment orcomments upcoming monetary policy decisions.parallels risk management commercial central banksrisk management gain importance recent year commercial centralbanks.the regulation emerge follow crisis lead commercial bank bolster riskfunctions number ways. they subject detail demand capitalrequirements, high standard risk report and, particular, detail rule thebuilding internal models. more recently, target review internal model (trim) waslaunched ass banks’ compliance requirement thereby reduceinconsistencies unwarranted variability output internal models.the ecb’s involvement risk management perhaps familiar context: abanking supervisor. but management measurement risk also greatsignificance monetary policy side operations. the ecb, like central banks,has expand balance sheet substantially recent years, result several change ourrisk management framework. for example, expand range eligible collateral forour lend operation begin purchase financial asset outright, include wide array ofprivate sector assets.while many parallel way commercial bank managedrisks, also important difference due public mission lay mandate.first, conduct single monetary policy euro area whole. though creditoperations risk mitigation measure way similar collateralised lendingoperations commercial banks, financial asset take collateral lend ratewe set borrowers. that, turn, require risk control framework aimsto achieve risk equivalence across asset accept collateral.second, primary goal maintain price stability. so, unlike commercial bank whosefiduciary responsibility maximise financial income, central bank consider thewider macroeconomic picture set risk management frameworks.this central banks’ exposure financial risk – may indeed – increase in1 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech order honour mandates, commercial bank typically aim reduce risk duringcrises. in exceptional times, central bank may need take risk balancesheets reduce risk financial system whole. this contribute financialstability and, ultimately, price stability.still, say manage financial risk important implement theeurosystem’s monetary policy. quite opposite, fact! just commercial bank mustcomply regulations, central bank must follow mandate risk managementprinciples therein. for u ecb, principles, establish long weembarked non-conventional policies, underpin policy measures.broadly speaking, principle protection, consistency, simplicity transparency. theyimply – several monetary policy option take fulfil mandate –we select measure minimise exposure financial risks. this idea,which underpin risk management (including commercial banking), know riskefficiency. in addition, principle require risk management integral part ourdecision-making. and embody transparency simplicity rules-based aspredictable possible operations.this commitment risk efficiency vital several reasons. first, central bank revenue arepublic funds, mean loss central bank loss public purse euroarea country. second, loss affect financial independence central bank andtherefore, potentially, operational independence. third, loss harm credibility andreputation eye public, thus confidence central bank maintain pricestability.for reasons, principle continue guide approach risk management allour policy decisions. but move towards new phase monetary policy, worthreflecting principle imply future risk management framework.in view, aim return closely possible pre-crisis state. but alsoneed consider carefully whether temporary measure remain part ourtoolkit. and since take new risk balance sheet long time,we may need retain certain element current risk management framework.as monetary policy begin normalise, three area particular riskmanagement framework need reviewed.risk management principle return conventional monetary policythe first relate change make collateral framework crisis enablegreater access central bank liquidity.when launch various vintage longer-term refinance operations, introducedin parallel number adjustment collateral eligibility criteria. these adjustmentscontributed sizeable take-up operation effectiveness reinvigorate thebank lend channel. and maintain risk equivalence haircut mean broaden setof eligible asset reduce level protection eurosystem.but measure introduce fragmentation collateral framework.before crisis, eurosystem operate concept single list. it purpose toenhance level play field across euro area, promote equal treatment forcounterparties issuers, increase overall transparency collateral framework.this changed, however, introduction temporary additional credit claim (acc)framework 2012.23 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech the temporary acc framework deviate single list principle allow individualnational central bank specify framework adapt local needs, albeit fulfillingcertain agree minimum risk management requirements. this acceptable combat thesevere financial tension uneven distribution collateral euro area timeaccs introduced. but clearly, crisis mode, would want arenationalisation collateral framework persist.so i see case maintain national extension common collateral frameworkin form today. at time, since acc represent considerable source ofcollateral long-term lend operations, might case retain adifferent form.one option would return fully fledge single list collateral exclude accs.another would introduce strong harmonisation future acc framework, whichcould either part regular framework part state-contingent framework. the keyissue future framework remove fragmentation see today.other temporary measure introduce crisis le bear fragmentation. forinstance, also widen eligibility requirement collateral, certain asset-backedsecurities, accept non-euro denominate collateral. we achieve specificmonetary policy goal; reach goal liquidity demand declines, beless need exceptional measure continue. of course, remain “on shelf”to use again, necessary, fulfil monetary policy aim.a central bank flexible may need many instrument disposal toachieve mandate. but take high risk necessary.so head path monetary policy normalisation, decide whethersome temporary measure need jettisoned, include state-contingent framework, ortransformed harmonised, permanent measures.since last long-term lend operation mature first quarter 2021, thisdiscussion need conclude today – many question still open. but anycase, change area involve careful consideration, since experience repeatedlyshown crisis need tailor response.the second area risk management framework need review risk controlframework asset purchase programme (app).we retain framework beyond horizon net asset purchase since, anextended period time past horizon, principal payment mature securitiespurchased app reinvested. for long keep outright portfolio ourbalance sheet, principle behind risk control measures, include eligibility criteria,purchase limits, benchmark ensure diversification different risk-sharing agreements,will continue apply.still, reinvestment phase, criterion risk control parameter may warrantrecalibration. this ensure – give change portfolio composition bond matureand proceed reinvested – overall risk exposure increase. moreover, withsignificantly low volume purchase relate increase operational flexibility, someparameter adjustment may possible would actually contribute risk efficiency gains.the third area review counterparty collateral framework adapt apost-crisis financial system. certainly, future rely judgement onthe quality asset counterparties consider expand eurosystem’sinternal credit assessment capabilities. the crisis highlight importance more4 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech information aspects.this implies, among things, enhance due diligence external credit ratings,for great transparency judgement underlie rat essential. and itimplies make good use supervisory information. the introduction european bankingsupervision bring fundamental improvement regard, facilitate theassessment relevant information within legal limit separation principle.moreover, balance aim return simplicity previous frameworkwith adapt new reality financial system. for example, need keep theflexibility apply collateral framework financial innovations, especially complex newfinancial products. the new “simple, transparent standardised” securitisation regulation acase point. it allow u good ass collateral accept.at time, financial innovation simply present new type risks, soaccommodating. this also key lesson crisis. we forcefully deal new type ofsecurities whose risk may yet fully appreciated.conclusionlet conclude.thanks stable principles, eurosystem’s risk management framework successfullyweathered challenge financial crisis. the size type operation changed, asdid asset accept collateral. but principle stay same.like risk management bank sector, central bank risk management evolve withthe times. so need reflect principle lead u post-crisis landscape.most importantly, need start think financial risk management framework willbe appropriate environment conventional monetary policy.while benchmark future framework pre-crisis state, clearwhether return entirely previous status quo. instead, might apply whatwe learn crisis, retain useful future, leave behind thing whosetime passed.this enable u rely framework transparent robust, also flexible enoughto deal challenge future.ecb (2015), “the financial risk management eurosystem’s monetary policy operations”.in 2010, govern council approve set “principles risk control framework eurosystem’scredit operations”.the ecb’s govern council also decide december 2011 enable national central bank accept ascollateral perform additional credit claim (accs) satisfy specific eligibility criteria. such asset notbelong single list also subject separate ecb guideline: guideline ecb 9 july2014 additional temporary measure relate eurosystem refinance operation eligibility ofcollateral amend guideline ecb/2007/9 (recast) (ecb/2014/31).this expansion include certain short-term debt instrument derogation own-use government-guaranteed bank bonds. non-euro denominate eligible asset include denominate

future? thank invite speak summit. it great pleasure chance share view fos-ter sustainable growth europe. the subject important ever. let start emphasize one thing: despite imperfection – euro-pean single market engine growth. it act catalyst trade free exchange labour, capi-tal knowhow. at time anti-globalization draw headlines, fundamental right take granted. in fact, i believe core make europe prosperous future. **** [slide 2: key messages] today, i would like highlight four observations: first, europe good reputation. economic performance keep abreast advance economies. the rumour demise simply exaggerated. 7 june 2018 side 2 af 8 second, major advance economy adjust low po-tential growth. it's fact, headwind slow productivity growth age kick in. europe exception. third, free global competition main driver innovation. europe suffer r&d gap relative global hotspots. but innova-tion zero-sum game: prosperous neighbour make european bad off. in fact, pro-ductive rivalry stimulate new ideas. finally, europe need fully develop single market financial ser-vices. the single market engine growth decade still incomplete. the bank union important step towards allow consumer business reap benefit cross-border competition. it al-so case denmark – join. please allow expand point one one. *** [slide 3: europe good reputation] the organizer debate ask u answer question: how europe crack code get back growth track? well, imply somehow go track. but europe really do-ing badly? i don’t think so. i argue recent growth performance part europe line advance economies. no better, worse. the european union home diverse set countries. they quite different stage economic institutional development. just look average simplistic. [slide 4: europe tale three] europe tale three stories: north, south east. side 3 af 8 the enlargement european union towards east economic success. but without challenges. but level prosperity new member state converg-ing towards core. and support overall growth europe. there certainly element catch behind this. and move value chain become increasingly important keep momentum. the south main source europe's dismal economic reputation. it clear growth laggard past decade. country south drift away germany's gdp per caput since financial crisis. while much do restore competiveness, many challenge leave unaddressed. there still clear need tackle structural imbalances, rigid labour market weak productivity dynamics. the north home prosperous competitive economy europe. their economic performance past ten year keep abreast usa major advance economies. while nordic region good shape, remain toe stay ahead future. when take stock three stories, evident eu-rope underperforming. gdp growth european union reach 2.4 per cent 2017. not since boom period mid-2000s find high growth rates. in sum, europe good reputation. *** [slide 5: age weigh future growth] the growth observe last year might good gets. age population weak productivity gain weigh growth advance economies. europe exception. side 4 af 8 we adjust expectation accordingly. demographic shape growth potential europe. the share european 65 year go 12 per cent 1970 20 per cent 2015. and expect exceed 30 per cent 2050. other advance economies, notably japan, face even great chal-lenges age population. this demographic transition important implication economic growth. our estimate suggest workforce age reduce gdp per caput growth europe 0.5 percentage point year period 2020-2050. the demographic headwind extent mitigate work longer. the spotlight turn policy foster productivity gains. **** [slide 6: europe face r&d gap] advance economy turn towards sector productivity gain hard achieve. the development new idea therefore essential unlock future growth. historically, europe produce successful compa-nies world. it start point bad. but europe suffer r&d gap relative global hotspots. it spend le 2 per cent gdp research development year. this significantly american half front-runner south korea invest. [slide 7: global innovation engine innovation] side 5 af 8 the vanguard innovation europe. the hotspot dominate global patent application tokyo, shenzhen, san francisco, osaka seoul. the top european region – munich – number 13. back 1989 seven european region top 20. today, three. asia increasingly innovation centre today. but relative decline europe problem itself. prosperous neighbour make european bad off. *** i say early europe tale three stories. when come pa-tent applications, clear regional difference well. [slide 8: regional dimension european innovation] the innovative cluster locate central europe scandina-via. they generate growth push frontier. free global market competition best catalyst company look spur new ideas. they keep business toes. they real driver innova-tion. **** i see two key challenge innovation europe. europe face shortage skills. eight ten innovate company consider lack skilled staff barrier investment. well-trained worker essential create economic powerhouse future. strengthen venture capital would support creative disruption. an oecd study suggest u venture capital market significantly large european. pattern change investment finance. europe bank-based economy. side 6 af 8 but bank credit always ideal intangible investments. these in-vestments risky hard collateralize. access broad range finance source provide company good opportunity innovation. in respect capital market union initiative important role play stimulate alternative source risk financing. *** the decision unite kingdom leave european union re-grettable. but brexit least one positive side effect: it increase awareness remain 27 eu member state significance benefit single market. [slide 9: eu need single market financial services] the single market provide citizen company eu incredible opportunities. it provide access purchase offer good service freely huge market place. via brexit, become crystal clear big advantage is. it seem widely accepted, maintenance con-tinued development market key driver economic growth countries. the single market far fully develop sectors. one example bank sector. there tradition see bank company require special protection – ultimately government support order survive. with bank union big step take direction al-lowing bank function market term – without compromise finan-cial stability. the single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism go long way establish level play field banks. side 7 af 8 it open much wide cross border competition financial services. *** [slide 10: a level play field bank important] furthermore, common framework recovery resolution bank (the brrd) essential ensure fail bank – kind private company – may resolve without use gov-ernment funds. in words: give bank right fail! the danish government announce decision denmark's participation bank union take autumn 2019. while fully acknowledge political decision, view danmark nationalbank would make good sense denmark join. danish bank face competition nordic region reality european scale. we make great effort handle challenge arise cross border bank nordic country numerous arrangement agreement relevant authorities. the bank union provide solution challenge europe-an scale. furthermore, increase competition follow join bank-ing union would healthy danish financial sector. in bank union danish bank would compete harmonize term much large market. increase competition path growth – indeed favourable condition consumer non-financial companies. if ask telecom industry today, might tell life cosy liberalisation industry. we see many areas, example telecommunications. this key reason recommend denmark join bank union, side 8 af 8 join bank union would mean fully join single mar-ket bank services. it would benefit citizen companies, necessarily banks. danmark nationalbank gitter- og hjælpelinjer for se gitter- og hjælpelinjer

reserve bank, annual financial market department cocktail function johannesburg 10 may 2018 lady gentlemen, good evening. it pleasure i welcome annual cocktail function financial market department (fmd) south african reserve bank (sarb), 12th year. we greatly honour presence tonight. the deal i strike financial market department move function pretoria johannesburg i would allow speak 90 minutes. introduction allow welcome event, make brief observation financial market development since last meet touch could store u period ahead. i would also like draw attention two initiative gather momentum, require cooperation next months. i know view domestic monetary policy always interest financial market participants, eve enter close period next monetary policy committee meeting, start 22nd may, i shall refrain comment today, ask patience get recent take two weeks’ time. the global financial market backdrop since last fmd cocktail function, global financial market ponder plethora developments, include strengthen synchronise global growth environment, change perception around monetary policy normalisation, rise page 2 8 financial market volatility, threat escalate trade conflicts, rise geopolitical tensions. in many ways, period since last cocktail function one transition; market complacent risks, current environment risk-sensitivity level appear rise again, even still relatively overall supportive financial conditions. the initial period characterise volatility subdue across broad range asset classes, certain instance indicator touch record lows. while u interest rate future increase reflect expectation feed would hike interest rates, also appear factor-in u treasury would issue short-term debt, anticipate pace interest rate increase expect follow relatively slow gradual profile. the major economy see still somewhat behind u regard change monetary policy settings. one puzzle issue market fact even expectation good growth us, stimulus come implementation tax reforms, point possible hike fed, usd weakening. during period relatively benign global environment, capital flow emerge market also hold rather well. we move period market adjust strength cyclical growth momentum start put upward pressure short-term interest rate push volatility higher. adjustment monetary policy way policy rate increase reduce pace asset purchase feature prominently assess future developments. this already witness 10-year u treasury yield rise psychologically significant level 3% – level last seen, albeit briefly, 2013. now market-generated path policy rate suggest upward trajectory. concomitantly, u dollar regain grind lose previously, see usd reach three-year low february 2018. development domestic financial market you familiar development domestic markets, allow brief. prior recent dollar strength, subsequent fmd cocktail function last year, price formulation domestic financial market reflect confluence idiosyncratic global factors. page 3 8 the rand range-bound second third quarter last year, trade r12.62 r13.95 steadily weaken u dollar. the benign global environment extent help shield domestic financial asset unfavourable domestic growth development well political policy uncertainty. however, latter part year, domestic factor dominant result rand depreciate year’s high r14.47 november 2017, subsequently rebound positive sentiment towards domestic fiscal political development well concomitant view credit rat agency positively receive market, include moody’s investor service retain south africa’s sovereign credit rat investment grade level improve outlook stable negative. a key factor moody’s assessment reduce nervousness south africa’s rise economic fiscal risks, high level comfort regard effort restore strength key institutions. the strengthen rand lead sharp decline local bond yields, yield benchmark r186 decline 141 basis point 7.98% 30-year r2048 bond’s yield compress 146 basis point investor repriced political risk premium. the five-year sovereign credit default swap spread improve 60 basis point peak 200 basis point november 2017. in recent weeks, rand relatively volatile weaken profile currently trade around r12.40 usd. in line development emerge markets, development reflective usd strength rather exhibit rand-intrinsic weakness. what need look for? while degree monetary stimulus recent year far surprisingly little impact inflation, debate remain whether pattern likely continue, rather speed change occur, economy operate positive output gaps. there concern shift high volatility may necessarily orderly background fear protectionism, increase geo-political risks, page 4 8 uncertainty pace monetary policy normalisation. this may lead abrupt tighten financial conditions, turn may curtail global growth. even recent corrections, asset valuation remain generally stretched, currency mismatch arise large amount usd denominate debt incur take advantage low rate (by corporates sovereigns), could make financial market vulnerable financial condition tighten fast pace currently anticipated. at recent imf/world bank spring meet another issue receive particular attention rise level global debt, unchecked potential trigger financial instability future, weigh growth undermine financial assets. these development may harbour serious implication emerge markets. firstly, risk-aversion may reduce attractiveness emerge market assets, include carry-trade relate transactions, may negatively affect portfolio flow markets, witness sharp pull-back flow since mid-april 2018. secondly, export-dependent emerge economy impact commodity price tend fall dollar strengthens. lastly, strong dollar would put pressure emerge market large dollar liabilities, increase financial vulnerabilities. we already see early sign risk materialise emerge economies, number emerge market currencies, include rand, weaken dollar, also advance economy currencies, euro yen. but admittedly others test lot compare south africa. a key risk outlook rand remain possibility accelerate monetary policy tighten central bank advance economies, particularly us. escalate trade conflict geo-political developments, present another risk factor need monitor carefully. page 5 8 the impact trade conflict could result decrease demand south african export potentially high volatility

delight see large number guest would like greet representativesof diplomatic corps, member parliament, representative europeancommission, council eu institutions, member state government ofhesse, member audience today.i live work hesse many year – beautiful rheingau region inthe buzz metropolis frankfurt, precise – long since come feel homethere. hesse middle germany, also heart europe.the political cabaret artist matthias beltz said: “the people hesse surround bymasses germans. they access sea, alp foreign countries, theyhave direct contact freedom.” but luckily, freedom come us. hesse, especiallythe area around frankfurt, international character, region’s cosmopolitanatmosphere make easy enjoyable place live.at time, hesse home several eu institutions. one europeancentral bank (ecb), turn twenty day ago. it commence task on1 june 1998 frankfurt, month start third stage economic andmonetary union.2 20 year euroin two decade since introduced, euro prove success. the original promiseof stable currency keep – euro stable internally externally. at 1.7 % onaverage last 20 years, rate inflation low many people expected.it therefore surprise support euro among general public high. accord tothe late eurobarometer survey, three-quarters (74 %) respondent euro area infavour single currency, one five (21 %) (the idea of) euro. insome countries, germany included, approval rat high 80 %, even.however, positive survey result obscure fact euro’s seconddecade rife crisis problems: financial crisis, economic crisis, europeandebt crisis, bank crisis, double recession high level unemployment. severalcountries experience prolong period economic weakness necessary adjustmentmeasures bring social hardship.figuratively speaking, could say euro easy childhood difficultadolescence.over last years, eurosystem’s central bank face unfamiliar challenges, andnot core area responsibility, ensure price stability. during thecrisis, extent force act crisis response units, take out 1 / 8bis central bankers' speech edge mandate while.in interview last week, otmar issing warned: “politicians easy. they rely ecb tosort everything out. but isn’t go work long term.”the dialogue member state also take harsh tone times. but monetaryunion actually project intend encourage european integration ultimately evenbring deep international friendship.all same, i would like stress that, many ways, euro area good shape today thanit crisis. this thank measure take member state well aschanges structure monetary union, i focus briefly.3 reform euro area3.1 adjustment progress member statesthe crisis bring home u part monetary union mean involves.and way country hit hard crisis tackle root theproblems regain competitiveness, example, truly remarkable receivestoo little recognition.in greece, portugal, ireland, spain cyprus, instance, average unit labour cost growth wasabove euro-area average pre-crisis period (1999–2007). this contribute factorto countries’ loss competitiveness.since crisis, unit labour cost five country grow slowly theeuro area average. this make economy competitive.the structural reform already undertake also begin bear fruit contribute tothe upturn. take structural unemployment, instance, go onepercentage point euro area, slightly spain, much 5 and7 percentage point respectively portugal ireland, thus show workhere upbeat state economy.current account deficits, high, also balance even turnedinto surpluses.it would tragic if, give this, reform roll back consolidation gainssquandered. instead, build success achieved.incidentally, also go country germany, weather crisis fairly well.3.2 change governance framework datebut it’s member state much happen result crisis. in theeuro area, much change good institutional term well.one positive development esm – permanent euro rescue facility grantconditional financial aid member state event crisis thus prevent nationalcrisis jeopardise stability entire euro area financial system.the creation bank union also welcome development. thus far, bank unionencompasses single supervisory mechanism, single resolution mechanism, harmonisednational deposit guarantee schemes.these reform remedied weakness structure monetary union either 2 / 8bis central bankers' speech ignore overlook euro founded.the experience among may remember idea joint financial supervisorysystem actually discuss delors committee back end 1980s, wasultimately dismissed.the crisis set motion learn process field, too, old belief call intoquestion, member states. this, way, also apply bundesbank,which, example, long sceptical common financial supervision.the esm bank union, together strict financial regulation, doubtless madethe monetary union stable. if new upheaval financial system inindividual member states, would considerably good prepare deal today thanwe 2010, greek debt crisis catch euro area guard.4 further reforms4.1 guidelinesmuch achieve member state european level. but still isn’tenough crisis-proof euro area all. the financial market turbulence last weekwith regard italy case point.the consensus previous reform insufficient put euro area assound foot would like. meanwhile, economic environment moment stillexceptionally favourable overall, take advantage this.so i concern fact enthusiasm consolidation euro area appear havewaned. whilst almost euro area country reduce structural deficit half percent ofgdp 2012, single one set improve structural budget balance 2018. itseems reform fiscal rule weak impact old rules.furthermore, ecb govern council emphasise theimplementation structural reform euro area need significantly intensify inparticular, view current favourable economic environment, order economy tobecome resilient structural unemployment fall face strongerheadwinds – structural unemployment i mean unemployment remain even whenthe economy well. this also need case want productivity potentialgrowth euro area rise.at around 1½ %, potential growth euro area recover since crisis, stillconsiderably low pre-crisis level 2 %.in context, currently passionate debate national sovereignty memberstates. in fact, national economic policymakers responsible improve theconditions require growth, employment social cohesion – good educationsystem, efficient public administration, growth-friendly fair taxation, appropriateinfrastructure, name examples.this countries’ national interest and, time, best way whicheach individual country contribute stability europe. europe need takeresponsibility community – truly able make progress theeuropean project also show citizen europe create prosperity.so many press issue discuss decide upon national level,an intensive reform discussion also take place regard future structure themonetary union eu. this topic, know, also agenda eu summit 3 / 8bis central bankers' speech end month brussels.the idea voice french president emmanuel macron, greet amix goodwill scepticism germany, provide important impetus europeandebate. furthermore – is, i believe, great achievement – create convincing,lively narrative joint european project citizen buy even enthusiasticabout.it seem clear progress debate germany france workin concert move direction.the bundesbank also provide proposal debate long time now,and within debate agenda stability single currency set.from perspective, three guideline form basis proposals.1. the european union focus attention spend task createadded value citizen europe.2. the institutional economic condition monetary union need set away eurosystem properly fulfil mandate intervene aregular basis crisis response unit.3. a stable monetary union require solidarity solidity, essential thealignment action liability maintained.allow me, will, delve slightly deep last point particular.the alignment action liability mean authority make decision need belinked responsibility consequence decisions. or, words, hewho power influence decision also prepare bear risk decisionsentail.when decide maastricht create economic monetary union, memberstates agree pool sovereignty monetary matter european level. however,under exist regulatory framework, responsibility fiscal policy – general economicpolicy – lie individual member states, i already mentioned.from outset, measure place design prevent unsound publicfinances jeopardise stability single currency. rule debt lay downin stability growth pact; prohibit simply print money way financingthe public sector; country cannot take other’s liability – famous bail-outclause.in principle, though, member state remain sovereign fiscal matters. and indeed, thissovereignty something always confidently champion defended. in thisvein, i recall matteo renzi, former italian prime minister assert “it’s u todecide tax cut, eurocrat sit brussels”.if monetary union reform include far great degree fiscal risk-sharing, action andliability would remain align certain sovereignty right transfer theeuropean level. otherwise would end imbalance dubious incentives.but cede significant portion sovereignty brussels precisely euro areamember state prepare – give european finance minister right intervenein national budgetary plan fail comply fiscal rules, instance.it seem it’s already hard enough time ensure commission’s exist 4 / 8bis central bankers' speech power enforce respected. and that’s i’m convince reform step need tofit within exist maastricht framework.4.2 risk share provisioningbut comply maastricht framework doesn’t necessarily rule expansion mutualliability. if action properly align liability, risk share make lot sense.in principle, justifiable argument favour collective resource theesm function fiscal safety net european single resolution fund, per thecommission’s suggestion. after all, already bank supervision european level,meaning share responsibility supervisory decisions.for similar reasons, bundesbank isn’t oppose common european deposit insurancescheme per se. quite contrary. such scheme would, without doubt, contribute morestable financial system, would reduce risk bank runs. and share supervisoryresponsibility make good case joint liability here, too.but protect link action liability, risk arise nationalresponsibility must reduce common deposit insurance scheme created. what’smore, impact national policy decision quality bank balance sheet must belimited.the stock non-performing loan countries’ bank balance sheet – veryhigh – example kind legacy risk. the average non-performing loan ratio fallenby around one-third europe since 2014. but country remain high wellabove pre-crisis levels.the large hold government bond bank balance sheet also problematic. owe toa regulatory loophole, government bond back little capital. and – unlike withprivate borrower – cap individual banks’ exposure sovereign debtors.before deposit insurance scheme created, sovereign default risk banks’balance sheet would need reduce long term, would stock non-performingloans. otherwise insurance scheme would find assume liability them.my colleague ecb govern council, benoît cœuré, rightly point day that“a deposit insurance scheme see insurance economic risks, asyou take liability insurance protect risk accident.” but allknow, lady gentlemen, take liability insurance policy cover futureaccidents, damage already done.following logic insurance scheme, give member state still abearing health bank future, concept permanent national risk retentionrequirement also seem worth considering. think, example, insolvency law islegally enforced.if look afield, beyond bank union, rainy day fund model type placein several u state certainly worthy consideration. many state put aside budget surplusesfor hard times. but new scope borrow fund transfer state incompatiblewith approach.however, reasonable question whether country solid public finance even needsuch fund. after all, european fiscal rule le strict come government debtthan constitution u states, prohibit new borrow altogether.but instrument would least offer great room manoeuvre difficult situation 5 / 8bis central bankers' speech without need expand fiscal risk share require cross-border payments.4.3 private risk sharingincreased risk share within euro area would make member state good able absorbeconomic shocks. the goes, particular, private form risk sharing.a recent article ecb economist show that, euro area, particular memberstate experience economic slump, 80 % downturn bleed consumption inthat country. now, first, might seem plausible u chiefly people affectedcountry tighten belts.but u states, 40 % – – shock gdp reflect fall consumptiongrowth. so there’s clearly another way. the rest impact absorb elsewhere. forinstance, loss sustain enterprise one u state distribute acrossthe whole country shareholder often domicile states.[1] the much great importance private risk share unite state show private risksharing capable enhance individual countries’ resilience euro area, too.integrated efficient financial market key prerequisite this.creating capital market union, propose 2015 commission, would move europea long way towards achieve aim. which bundesbank explicitly endorse theproject.it potential spur economic growth, dismantle barrier cross-border investment,diversify corporate finance strengthen private risk sharing. and would also keycontribution make euro area stable.the successful effort strengthen cross-border equity finance are, great thesums capital market union could expect contribute strengthen private risksharing. after all, one key difference equity borrow funds: equity investorsparticipate directly economic risk gain losses. creditors, hand, notexposed loss – except case insolvency.equity therefore provide good opportunity share risk opportunities. however, thereare incentive firm obtain fund debt rather equity. in many countries, forinstance, debt interest tax-deductible, cost equity isn’t.to extent, effort make create common assessment basis corporation taxrepresent good opportunity reduce preferential tax treatment give debt tomake equity finance attractive.5 focus euladies gentlementhe euro area strong part strong european union.what require – last item today – eu focus single-mindedly task comparative advantage benefit cansell convincingly public – is, task clearly european add value.there task perform good european level national. from aneconomic standpoint, might include europe-wide public good therefore policy areaswith cross-border externalities, particular. 6 / 8bis central bankers' speech a know, public good define good individual cannot exclude using,the use reduce amount available someone else. because

withchancellor merkel weekend, know express similar views.that would appropriate add topic border security migration theeuropean agenda without delay. this would also help individual member state feel lessdisadvantaged abandon account geographical location.at time, however, principle subsidiarity enshrine eu treaty need beapplied effectively, task still home domestic level. andthat welcome development commission president juncker convene atask force subsidiarity ask consider power good exercise nationallyor locally european level.this task force, head first vice-president frans

thusputting cart horse. so le much party pay andreceives figure invest fund wisely. 6 conclusionladies gentlemenas early five year ago, then-federal president joachim gauck, estimation, put hisfinger essence debate european policy reform say “this unioninvolves give take; must one-way street anyone. it base principle ofreciprocity, equality mutual commitment. more europe must mean: reliability.

phenomenon – know carbon leakage – global greenhouse gas emission would notnecessarily decrease.on hand, result subsidy renewable energy, example, form oflow-emission power generation may replaced. if price energy decline due subsidies,companies may shut low-emission power generation plants, addition renewableforms energy, may leave power generation low-cost high-emissions.professor matti liski present interest view perspective.a common global climate policy would create effective incentive develop low-emissiontechnology.another key issue combat climate change equity. the reduction greenhouseemissions involve costs, poor country necessarily sufficient resource orinterest participate. moreover, advance economy responsible majority ofhistorical greenhouse gas emissions. if one

monetary policy speech meet business leader osaka bank japan september 25, 2018 haruhiko kuroda governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader kansai region. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation various activity bank japan's branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. in speech today, i would like first talk bank's view recent development economic activity prices, explain think behind conduct monetary policy. i. economic development let start talk economic developments. japan's economy expand moderately, virtuous cycle income spend maintain corporate household sectors. although real gdp growth rate january-march quarter temporarily mark negative growth, due mainly irregular weather, continue register positive growth eight consecutive quarters, rate april-june quarter show return firm growth, represent 3.0 percent annualized basis (chart 1). the long-lasting recovery japan's economy likely mainly attributable external domestic demand increase well-balanced manner. a external demand, export continue increase trend, exceed peak global financial crisis, lead mainly capital good it-related goods, japan comparative advantage (chart 2). look underlie development overseas economy detail, u.s. economy continue expand firmly, growth rate april-june quarter register 4 percent annualized basis. firms' sentiment continue improve manufacture nonmanufacturing sectors, positive momentum private consumption back favorable employment income situation. meanwhile, european economy continue recover whole business fix investment private consumption follow uptrend; however, export recently decelerate somewhat, due mainly effect appreciation euro. a emerge economies, chinese 2 economy continue see stable growth whole private investment consumption remain firm, although growth infrastructure investment decelerate somewhat. other emerge economies, mainly asian economies, recover moderately, reflect part increase export effect economic stimulus measures. thus, momentum economic recovery differ extent across country regions, bank judge overseas economy continue grow firmly whole. turn domestic situation, corporate sector, profit environment remain favorable, ratio current profit sale record high level (chart 3). under circumstances, accord bank's june tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), firms' business fix investment plan fiscal 2018 show high growth time year since survey started. in manufacture sector, notable increase research development investment view advance next-generation technology self-driving system large-capacity batteries, addition investment intend capacity expansion back firm domestic external demand. in nonmanufacturing sector, investment aim improve efficiency save labor order deal recent labor shortage maintain high growth. such improvement corporate sector positive effect household sector. in labor market, active job openings-to-applicants ratio currently 1.63, high level last see period high economic growth, unemployment rate decline around 2.5 percent, level observe bubble period (chart 4). while number employee register year-on-year growth rate around 2 percent, total cash earn per employee rise moderately steadily, lead mainly part-time employees. against background improvement employment income situation, private consumption increase moderately, albeit fluctuations. in term contribution economic growth, recent increase demand foreign visitor cannot ignored. sale duty free good department store first half year register annual increase close 50 percent, occupancy rate city hotel maintain high level almost 80 percent past years. on 3 point, big event rugby world cup g-20 summit schedule hold osaka next year, i hear construction new hotel rebuild exist facility take place successively. a typhoon begin september, bank make effort firmly grasp impact damage caused, expect public private sector work together overcome disaster create region even strong attractive. so far, i explain japan's economy improving, lead external domestic demand well-balanced manner. with regard outlook, economy likely continue moderate expansion. however, various risk baseline scenario, uncertainty regard overseas economy particular warrant attention. for example, necessary thoroughly examine extent recent protectionist moves, trade friction unite state china, affect trade well firms' investment activities. there active discussion issue international conference i take part in, include g-20 g-7 meetings. in addition, international monetary fund (imf) recently release simulation analysis effect protectionist move global economy. accord simulation, downward pressure global economy stem stagnation trade activity likely 0.1 percentage point next five years. however, protectionist move bring turmoil global financial market deterioration firms' sentiment, downward pressure global economy expect around 0.5 percentage point most. global economy become interdependent ever before, recent progress globalization information technology. in situation, clear protectionist policy benefit economy, regardless whether adopt policies. therefore, brake expect put excessive protectionist move point, essential continue global discussion ensure make sure protectionist move create instability financial market firms' sentiment. moreover, attention also pay effect move toward monetary policy normalization, include policy rate hike unite states, global capital flow emerge economies. in fact, emerge economy turkey 4 argentina -- vulnerability economy include twin deficit high inflation -- confront significant depreciation currencies, inflow dollar-based capital economy turn outflow. that said, fundamental many emerge economy include asian economy firm, federal reserve seem conduct policy carefully take account development global financial market global economy. thus, fairly unlikely point problem happen emerge economy spread widely. however, sudden change could arise market, continue carefully examine development global financial market emerge economies. ii. price development now i move price developments. price continue show relatively weak development compare economic expansion labor market tightening, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food energy price range 0.0-0.5 percent (chart 5). after five years, japan's economy long deflation, sense sustain decline prices, bank's price stability target 2 percent inflation annual basis yet achieved. for reason, outlook economic activity price (outlook report) release end july, bank focus examine reason sluggish price development update outlook economic activity prices. today, i would like outline key point report. the first point reason price sluggish even though economy improve steadily. basically, likely mainly attributable experience prolong low growth deflation. the long severe adjustment phase since second half 1990s, include financial crisis, bring sluggishness economic activity asset prices. under circumstances, firms' wage- price-setting stance well households' view toward price rise become cautious. the bank introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) 2013 persistently conduct powerful monetary easing. however, mindset behavior base assumption wage price increase easily become embed economy long period time, take time situation change. 5 in addition basic factors, large room raise productivity, mainly nonmanufacturing sector, well technological progress digitalization recent years, allow firm maintain cautious stance toward raise price despite increase labor costs. for instance, many firm accommodation well eat drink service sector compensate rise personnel expense introduce online reservation order system use tablet devices. in addition, increase labor participation woman senior past year ease labor shortage part, serve factor slow pace wage increases. in long term, move likely strengthen economy's growth potential make firms' households' spend activity active, thereby contribute push prices. at least short term, however, move weaken upward pressure wage price due reason i mention earlier. the second point concern price japan mechanism rise inflation lost, although pace sluggish. move raise sale price observe recently among wide range firms, reflect rise personnel expense price raw material well components. also, accord tankan, first time 10 years, number enterprise answer output price rise exceed number answer price fall (chart 6). go forward, heighten perception labor shortage, wage part-time employee continue increase, effect likely spread wage regular employees, mainly among small medium-sized firm young generations. in fact, year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, rise rate increase base pay evident small medium-sized firm large firms, summer bonus increase significantly last year. such move expect ease consumers' cost-saving mentality price rise firm likely easily accept accordingly. in way, high level utilization labor capital, improve output gap, sustained, many factor delay inflation -- firms' cautious wage- price-setting stance well households' cautiousness toward price rise -- likely resolve gradually. when price rise come observe widely result 6 this, people's medium- long-term inflation expectation project rise gradually. a consequence, year-on-year rate change cpi likely increase gradually toward price stability target 2 percent, although take time expected. in july outlook report, bank project year-on-year rate change cpi (less fresh food) fiscal 2018 fiscal 2020 would likely 1.1 percent, 1.5 percent, 1.6 percent, respectively. we difficult situation term achieve 2 percent inflation fiscal 2020. nevertheless, maintain positive output gap -- driver rise inflation -- long time, firmly push actual price well inflation expectations, i mentioned, likely certain path toward achieve 2 percent inflation. iii. the bank's conduct monetary policy lastly, i would like talk bank's think behind conduct monetary policy. the bank conduct powerful monetary ease framework "qqe yield curve control," aim achieve price stability target 2 percent (chart 7). in term yield curve control, view facilitate formation yield curve consider appropriate achieve 2 percent inflation, bank purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) guideline market operations, set short-term policy interest rate minus 0.1 percent target level 10-year jgb yield around zero percent. under circumstances, jgb yields, also lend rate firm well issuance rate corporate bond remain extremely low levels, amount outstanding bank lend increasing. in addition, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) amount outstanding increase annual pace 6 trillion yen, view low risk premia stock market exert positive effect economic activity prices. a i mention earlier, likely take time expect achieve 2 percent inflation. on hand, mechanism whereby improvement output gap lead rise inflation continue operate. consider situation, bank judge important persistently continue powerful monetary ease decide 7 july 2018 monetary policy meet (mpm) strengthen policy framework follow (chart 8). first, bank introduce forward guidance policy rates. specifically, publicly make clear "maintain current extremely low level short- long-term interest rate extend period time, take account uncertainty regard economic activity price include effect consumption tax hike schedule take place october 2019." this base recognition that, situation achieve 2 percent inflation take time, simply state persistently continue monetary ease cannot sufficiently ensure public confidence regard monetary policy. i hope introduction forward guidance make clear bank's strong policy stance toward achieve price stability target. with regard forward guidance, point difficult understand long "for extend period time" means. first all, word imply, base specific period time. the phrase "for extend period time" often use central banks, presumably imply fairly long period time. partly central bank unite state europe proceed monetary policy normalization recently, market participant speculate policy rate hike would take place soon even japan. however, situation regard price stability target japan differ substantially unite state europe. in term clarify point, important make clear bank maintain current extremely low level short- long-term interest rate extend period time. of course, "for extend period time" mean permanently. such case, may think period interest rate level maintain link specific period time price indicators, order ensure effectiveness commitment. however, various uncertainty regard economic activity price japan, i mention earlier. therefore, design forward guidance, need ensure effectiveness commitment, also flexibility future policy conduct, balance manner. the apply forward guidance central banks. that is, initial stage follow introduction, case 8 japan, common commit maintain interest rate level present qualitative condition economic situation risk assessments, focus rather flexibility policy conduct. in addition introduction forward guidance, bank decide july mpm enhance sustainability "qqe yield curve control." in persistently continue monetary easing, necessary make adjustment policy framework function competent manner period easing's duration. for example, current target level 10-year jgb yield around zero percent, i mention earlier, bank make clear that, target, long-term yield might move upward downward extent mainly depend development economic activity prices, thereby conduct market operation flexible manner. yield curve control essential measure stabilize interest rate japan low levels. on hand, powerful, interest rate formation jgb market somewhat rigid, notable decline transactions. it consider measure decide july mpm mitigate side effect accompany powerful monetary ease facilitate formation appropriate yield curve, consequence, lead enhance sustainability policy. in addition, etf purchases, aspect enhance sustainability policy, bank make clear might increase decrease amount purchase depend market conditions, maintain annual pace increase amount outstanding 6 trillion yen. almost two month pass since policy decision made. so far, stock price foreign exchange rate stable whole, bank recognize policy intention accept market participant without misunderstanding. meanwhile, jgb market, transaction become active price movement increase somewhat (chart 9). accord survey conduct august, proportion respondent answer degree bond market function "has improved" exceed proportion answer "has decreased" first time three years. a market transaction usually tend decrease summer difficult grasp actual developments, bank continue thoroughly examine degree 9 recovery market functioning. i give opportunity talk time every year, sixth occasion since take office governor bank japan april 2013. six year ago, economic recovery start overcome deflation sight. under development economic activity prices, necessary decisively implement large-scale policy, thus policy take bank's think behind simple clear. over past five years, japan's economy continue long-lasting recovery, corporate profit record highs, employment situation improve substantially. wage price long see sustain decline turn uptrend. however, achieve price stability target 2 percent take time expected. in situation economic activity price improve significantly development somewhat varied, appropriate conduct monetary policy take account variety development comprehensive manner. this mean that, continue powerful monetary easing, need consider positive effect side effect balance manner. the late policy response indeed line thinking, bank's stance toward aim price stability view contribute sound development national economy change all. go forward, continue make utmost effort central bank, take account development economic activity price well financial conditions, thereby firmly support corporate activity japan. thank much attention. september 25, 2018haruhiko kurodagovernor bank japanjapan's economy monetary

topic “private debt direct lending” frankfurt main 18 september 2018 it nearly ten year ago day global financial crisis reach initial peak. the global economic crisis follow severe since great depression. in wake crisis, reform financial market introduce aim make financial market resilient, many reform already implemented. after all, stability financial system key prerequisite efficient dynamic economy. just preventive medical care good immune system help limit effect disease, prudent approach couple good defence help financial system mitigate effect economic shocks. the question today far international financial system good place deal unexpected development decade ago. the global economy currently fraught uncertainty number fronts. geopolitical tension escalated, trade dispute erupted, threaten tip trade war. in europe unclear circumstance unite kingdom leave european union. germany's economy may boom right now, every period growth, matter long lasts, ultimately give way economic downturn. how well prepare german financial system face potential economic slump? what happen risk materialise? 2 1 with global economy good shape interest rate low, risk underestimated. the world economy currently well. accord calculation international monetary fund (imf), global growth amount 3.9% year next year (imf 2018). for come year, imf forecast slight fall growth 2.4% 2.2% industrial country 2.2% 1.9% euro area. at time, imf emphasise growth without risk risk already materialising. for example, debt level emerge market economy go sharply recent years, liability often denominate foreign currency. this create vulnerability surface recent week months. for example, turkish lira lose nearly 40% value year date, argentine peso much 50%, thereabouts.1 thus far, market participant regard issue relatively isolate incidents. currently, effect global financial market small. but possible contagion effect interaction global risk difficult forecast. public private debt, close all-time high global terms, one global financial system’s vulnerabilities. industrial country bore brunt crisis see public debt level balloon, largely back measure shore financial sector. this shift risk private sector government sector. in many emerge market economies, contrast, (non-financial) private sector debt increased. in fact, double recent years. compound situation further, sector highly expose currency risk. 1 source: bloomberg, 14 september 2018. 3 bank sector debt generally diminish recent years. measure term risk-weighted assets, capitalisation bank sector end 2017 stand roughly 17% euro area, compare 14.2% unite states. however, measure term total (unweighted) assets, ratio significantly lower, 5.8% europe 9.3% unite state (cgfs 2018). it note that, due differ account standards, figure directly comparable. in germany, banks’ tier 1 capital ratio – i.e. tier 1 capital relation risk-weighted asset – climb 9% start 2008 16.4% start 2018 (chart). the unweighted capital ratio, i.e. tier 1 capital relation total assets, rise period 3.1% 6.2%. 4 furthermore, capital adequacy level sometimes vary significantly one bank next. the tier 1 capital ratio large, systemically important financial institution first quarter year stand 16.9%, unweighted capital ratio come 4.9%. for small medium-sized banks, equivalent figure 15.6% 8.1%. the wide variation capital ratio show amount capital bank cushion unexpected event depend least well future risk capture risk weights. at moment, economic environment germany highly favourable. the german economy expand nine consecutive years, 5 long period growth since german reunification. accord bundesbank’s projections, economic boom set continue, gross domestic product forecast rise 2% year 1.9% next year (deutsche bundesbank 2018). enterprise household alike borrow cheaply, accumulate comfortable capital buffers. the number insolvency credit default low, valuation financial market high. this upbeat macroeconomic situation conducive gradual rise interest rates. assume economy indeed follow expect path, risk financial stability probably limited. but economy take unexpected turn worse? what unforeseen downturn real economic momentum interest rate remain low – close zero – even longer, political risk materialise risk premium spike financial markets? a resilient financial system need position weather scenarios, though unexpected, cannot fully rule out. this especially true boom periods, long continue, market participant tend take grant prepare gloomy times. unexpectedly weak growth increase volatility could even great repercussions. scenario like question, even germany. the german economy closely interlink global economy, would hit hard possible abrupt correction international markets. possible negative effect amplify many market participant expose similar risks. 2 the german financial system vulnerable negative macroeconomic developments. over last decade, german bank improve resilience build capital. however, capital also counterbalance great macroeconomic risk. the effect risk individual bank something supervisor keep watchful eye on. however, assessment overall risk situation need look individual participant sector isolation. a macroprudential, systemic, perspective therefore need complement microprudential approach. this way, possible take account contagion mechanism financial system give rise systemic risks. after all, problematic development individual part financial system ripple across institution ultimately take toll real economy. these amplification effect particularly come bear many bank expose risk macroeconomic risk correlate strongly other. 6 monitor systemic risk germany task german financial stability committee (afs). the committee consist representative federal financial supervisory authority (bafin), deutsche bundesbank, german federal ministry finance, act chair. in late report german bundestag, committee examine state germany's financial system (german financial stability committee 2018). at present, danger future economic risk might underestimated. for example, could unexpected downturn economy, would result insolvency rate thus credit risk rapidly rising. reserve capital might insufficient cover loss unexpected event, particularly risk assessment scarcely take account period crisis fraught economic downturn correspondingly high credit default rates, even ignore altogether. in current long period economic expansion, possibility credit risk underestimate real estate market. this market, significant germany macroeconomic terms, could harbour risk financial stability. this would case, example, sharp increase real estate price lead excessive rise lend loosen credit standards. price continue rise dynamically. bundesbank estimate indicate house price german town city overvalue 15% 30% 2017. growth residential loan currently stand 4.3% (second quarter 2018) thus long-term average 4.8%.2 at time, clear evidence suggest bank loosen credit standard residential loans. however, give strong upward pressure price recent years, cannot rule value loan collateral overestimated. the value loan collateral probably turn lower, particularly event economic downturn. this increase risk unexpected loss arise result default loans. one key macroeconomic risk german financial system expose interest rate risk. in recent years, bank sharply increase share new loan long interest rate lock-in periods. the share newly issue loan interest rate lock-in period ten year stand 45% second quarter 2018; start 2010, share markedly lower, 26%. by contrast, bank fund tend short-term nature, often variable interest rates. this mean bank become vulnerable potential rise interest rates. an abrupt increase interest rate would drive banks’ finance costs, interest income would rise le quickly begin with. 2 see bundesbank’s system indicator german residential property market: https://www.bundesbank.de/navigation/en/statistics/enterprises_and_households/system_of_indicators/system_of_indicators.html 7 if risk materialise large expected, could set negative momentum motion financial system. in short term, critical situation particularly inopportune time bank raise capital markets, time capital would need absorb losses. individual bank would shrink balance sheet order fulfil increase capital requirements. they would sell assets, scale back exist line credit real economy, cut back issuance new loans. if fire sale send security real estate price plummeting, also take toll institution loan loss barely issue begin with. 3 now time strengthen financial system’s resilience readiness tough time ahead. “the time repair roof sun shining”.3 the international monetary fund repeatedly draw attention principle recent times. public sector budget need put sustainable footing, debt level need reduced, budgetary leeway difficult time need created. that said, protection unexpected macroeconomic development also need put place financial system, too. everyone make provision unexpected development ensure still service debt economic condition worsen. unexpected development happen home market, also occur emerge market economy industrial country spill germany. many mature economy currently experience buoyant economic conditions, output gap close many cases, cyclical risk financial system mounting. financial institution high level capital robust thus also make financial system whole resilient. if market participant strong defences, risk contagion falls. unexpected event le severe consequences. however, resilience need build good time – recession begin may already late. it's rather like build protection flu. once wave influenza break out, late get vaccinated. the problem weather fair feel well, easy forget time may also take turn worse. it therefore important take preventive action. if financial system resilient enough, amplify economic downturn. bank would excessively curtail 3 this quote attribute john f. kennedy. 8 lend precisely economy already run difficulties. this precisely happen around globe last crisis. defence therefore build time good. currently, sun shin markets, experience long period growth since 1970s, credit loss low. now time build sufficient capital, strengthen resilience individual institution financial

digital development policy setting? and, role could central bank play promote new technology new digital platforms? to begin approach questions, first admit boundary new innovation technology limitless potential impacts, current juncture, may fully uncovered. there thing know thing don’t. and even know identify today, perception may obscure perceive understand base past world views. there

i emphasise earlier, mr pagano discus role productivity economic growth,in particular, recent debate trigger hypothesis advance economy aredoomed experience long period, decades, slowdown economic growth anddeceleration welfare improvement. 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech i would rather anticipate find presentation, i must say i feel encouragedby find hypothesis likely true.productivity role economic growth always central theme focus theattention bank albania. our study suggest that, beyond cyclical fall theaggregate demand, economic slowdown albania, crisis, strongstructural element. in words, reduction half economic growth pace andafter crisis, show slowdown expansion demand good services,and slowdown capacity economy provide products. in particular, ourstudies find degree expansion productivity albanian economy –broadly define capacity economy utilise labour physical capital generateoutput – reduce period 2% 1%. for reason, growth productivity remain guideline agendaof

thank you! 3 / 3bis central bankers' speech 1 10 year – what learned? remark sharon donnery, deputy governor central bank ireland dublin economics workshop, wexford 14 september 2018 introduction it great pleasure today, i would like thank organiser arrange event invite participate panel.i the dublin economics workshop always key policy forum september 2018 – ten year – give u timely opportunity look back consider learn - central bank include – also, achieved, critically, must yet addressed. the crisis affect every aspect irish society, irish economy, irish bank system. a decade later, significant number people across country still deal legacies. whilst may tempt look uniqueness irish experience, take wide perspective show “the last 400 year replete financial crises, often follow increase supply credit, great investor optimism, rapid economic growth.”ii this minimise irish crisis effects, merely stress history show u must always guard next potential crisis. 2 the story cause irish crisis well told, i repeat here. iii the herd behaviour, groupthink, speculative mania, information gaps, well documented.iv today, i would like highlight i see five key lessons. whilst unique irish experience, lesson ireland learned, devastate effect, ‘hard way’. what i say overall governance, regulatory supervisory system design line responsibility manage mitigate risk effectively. in bank financial sector, primary responsibility risk management individual financial institution lie executive management board directors. this support internal audit compliance function within banks, external auditors. legislator set rules, regulator define implement regulatory framework, supervisor oversee firms’ behaviour, enforce framework enforce sanction case non-compliance.v each play role system responsibilities. “systemic financial crisis – ireland elsewhere – uncommon require large number simultaneous institutional judgmental failures.”vi for central bank regulatory authorities, particularly central bank ireland, crisis transform everything do: mandate, organisation, framework assessment, policy instruments, culture. so whilst i try exhaustive today, i said, i focus five key lesson domestic european perspective. 3 *** lesson 1: must act mitigate build-up systemic risk before crisis, irish bank build heavy reliance fund wholesale market hence vulnerable sudden stop. the crisis also lay bare lack analytical framework ass financial imbalance lack policy tool mitigate them.vii therefore, follow crisis, argument new policy instrument mitigate risk financial stability become compelling, development macroprudential policy instrument followed.viii the ultimate objective macroprudential policy mitigate systemic risk, major disturbance financial system disrupt provision financial services, serious negative consequence real economy.ix in ireland, central bank designate national macroprudential authority 2014 introduction macroprudential policy central bank key step promote financial stability.x these tool aid central bank build resilience household bank system, good withstand economic shock adverse movement credit property prices. the mortgage rule establish element macro-financial landscape important structural dimension, aim permanently dampen pro-cyclicality credit house price (relative experience prior rule place). the widespread public understand central bank’s mortgage measure positive. we conscious 4 deposit requirement heavy burden many people try build future. however, i think, public understand hard is, measure necessary good alternative. ultimately, much protect households, promote stability. from broad cyclical perspective, ensure resilience build early cycle effective – inform time calibration mortgage measure counter cyclical capital buff (ccyb). this so-called ccyb another example tool build resilience bank system withstand future shocks. we recently announce increase ccyb 1 per cent, become effective july 2019.xi structural systemic risk, relate “too-big” “too complex” fail phenomenon, mitigate other systemically important institution (o-sii) buffer, set rate 1.5 per cent relevant institutions, phase-in period 1 july 2019 1 july 2021.xii one key point note look back crisis use macroprudential tool may avert crisis decade ago, scale downturn ireland could limit high cost citizen reduced. we must therefore continue guard complacency build resilience across system. so short, key lesson crisis therefore importance develop credible counter-cyclical macroprudential policy strengthen micro-prudential policy mitigate systemic risk. this central bank last decade. 5 *** lesson 2: actor economy need build resilience a small, particularly open economy, ireland significantly influence external events. ireland benefit greatly openness. however, side coin vulnerability external shocks, may little control. we look far evidence this. over past twenty-five year growth employment, incomes, consumption, domestic investment, real estate price credit volatile ireland euro area, unite kingdom, sweden denmark.xiii the key deal vulnerability retreat global marketplace, recognise need prepare inevitable downturns. in context, build resilience, whether banks, individual, household, corporate, national level key. all stakeholder part play process. we see progress, example, household debt statistic – irish household debt proportion disposable income fell 49.8 percentage point q1 2014 q1 2018. however, despite progress legacy crisis still apparent, irish household continue fourth indebted eu.xiv from national perspective, fiscal policy one important policy lever available. one trade-off join monetary union loss independent monetary policy. this trade-off increase relative importance fiscal policy, addition macroprudential policy, lever use mitigate country specific 6 shock way broad, union wide, monetary policy cannot. the fiscal position ireland year join economic monetary union (emu) appear favourable. the debt gdp ratio continue trend downward budget show surplus. however, headline figure obscure significant shift structure tax revenues. the share revenue collect income tax fell, share property relate tax stamp duty capital gain tax increased.xv debt gni* - measure avoid distortion encounter use gdp - stand 28 per cent 2007 peak 158 per cent 2012.xvi in 2017, debt gni* stand 111 per cent. the adverse effect tax structure crisis years, highlight need broad-based stable tax base, rather one dependent windfall revenues. it also expose use potentially transitory revenue item fund regular expenditure exacerbate deterioration fiscal position downturn. the recovery public finance dramatic relative situation face early crisis years. significant fiscal consolidation play large part, favourable external factors, include unexpectedly positive growth low interest costs.xvii these factor illustrate need strike cyclically-appropriate fiscal balance strengthen resilience build buff counteract future shocks. the characteristic ireland, extremely open economy significant trade financial linkage broad 7 international economy, well downside risk economy, brexit, add need. so, second key lesson actor economy need build resilience, individuals, households, corporates, bank indeed governments. *** lesson 3: addition level regulatory capital, type quality matter turn specifically bank sector, whilst ireland, aggregate capital resource bank grow 2000-2007, bank maintain regulatory requirements, composition capital change materially. the proportion shareholder equity cover banks’ capital decrease significantly, balance make subordinate loan capital.xviii ordinary shares, however, find main effective loss-absorbing instrument go concern basis. in response crisis, european legislation agree create safe financial sector. a key aspect establishment robust framework set minimum capital requirements. the capital requirement regulation (crr) capital requirement directive (crd iv) agree 2013 revise capital requirement banks. the framework provide pillar i requirement, regulatory minimum amount capital bank must hold. this minimum total capital ratio 8% risk weight asset (rwa). a part revisions, high quality capital, common equity tier 1 (cet1), typical item 8 include ordinary share reserves, must now, follow various deduction adjustments, correspond 4.5% rwa. pillar ii additional capital requirement may apply institution supervisor base supervisory review evaluation process (srep). the institution specific nature pillar ii ensure bank’s capital tailor individual business model risk profiles. in addition pillar ii capital requirement, competent authority may also set non-binding pillar ii capital guidance relevant bank expect hold. the combine buff requirement collective term four capital buff provide crdiv. this include aforementioned ccyb o-sii buffer, well capital conservation buff systemic risk buffer. the combine buff act firstly mechanism pro-cyclical accumulation capital, institution build store supplementary fund ‘good times’ order protect regulatory minimum period adverse conditions. if bank breach buffer, automatic safeguard apply limit amount dividend bonus payment make. the key point here, however, buff must make cet1, high quality capital. and much progress made, since end 2014, fully load cet1 ratio significant institution ireland increase 9.4 per cent 17.7 per cent end-2017. so short, third key lesson crisis i want mention today that, addition level, type quality capital matter. progress make many area too. my colleague ed sibley, deputy governor, 9 prudential regulation outline detail specific regulatory supervisory response, early week.xix *** lesson 4: bank inevitably fail - good prepare the level public support bank system crisis eu staggering. in 2009, member state provide equivalent 7.3% eu gdp, eur 906 billion liquidity support guarantee financial sector. ireland stand beyond member state term relative support provide follow far-reaching 2008 decision guarantee liability deposits. beyond liquidity support, member state government provide capital support amount 4.5% eu gdp 2008 2012. ireland, example spend equivalent 37.3% gdp recapitalising bank period.xx this motivate fundamental change bank authority prepare manage bank failure. in ireland, direct response crisis, introduce credit institution resolution act 2011. in european context, bank recovery resolution directive (brrd) provide authority common european rule recovery resolution fail banks. when bank get difficult financial situations, supervisor number early intervention power disposal. the brrd also require bank prepare recovery plan outline get difficulty. the central bank ireland designate irish national resolution authority 2015. in context, bank also part single resolution 10 mechanism draw firm-specific resolution plan aim enhance resolvability firms. central brrd authority variety power try minimise cost taxpayer bank failure. critically, new framework introduce bail-in tool also aim ensure bank sufficient stock bail-inable liabilities. this know minimum requirement fund eligible liability (mrel). in short, objective ensure shareholder creditor bear brunt loss bank failures, thus move bail-out bail-in. ensure bank sufficient high quality mrel go long way increase gone-concern loss absorb capacity. so short, fourth key lesson bank inevitably fail, protect taxpayer must actively prepare failure ensure impediment resolvability removed. major legislative institutional change take place ensure authority equip tool enhance resilience resolvability institutions, good prepare deal with, recover from, crisis situation. but ensure effectiveness framework remain challenge year come. *** lesson 5: need cross-border authority the final lesson i wish discus today need cross-border authorities. the crisis expose weakness heterogeneity bank supervision across member states. of course, 11 failure bank supervision ireland comprehensively examine well documented, particularly (2010) honohan report.xxi some conclusion report show ‘financial regulator’ rely “excessively regulatory philosophy emphasise process outcomes,” “a great degree intrusiveness assertiveness” require part regulator need “additional staff resource training.”xxii the crisis also expose weakness framework resolution – i discussed, also fundamental mismatch cross-border bank domestic crisis management, addition lack adequate, harmonise power authority deal crises. prior crisis, authorities, legal powers, objective tool crisis management resolution vary considerably across eu. for example, case relevant power derive specific resolution insolvency framework banks, others general insolvency proceed available. in cases, member state authority power transfer asset third party purchaser executive order, others judicial proceedings, example.xxiii these differences, couple lack harmonise approach burden-sharing weak framework cooperation (in form voluntary cross-border colleges/stability groups) make effective, rapid, coordinate cross-border intervention challenging. in monetary union, subsidiary main form cross-border bank hold almost eur 4 trillion asset 2006, lack incentive cooperate coordinate 12 compound lack trust across system.xxiv the well document collapse inter-bank market lead need central bank aggressively step provide liquidity order prevent collapse financial system. the response crisis wholesale change legislative framework, policy tool institutional architecture bank supervision resolution. this culminate visibly establishment single supervisory mechanism (ssm) ecb frankfurt centre, single resolution mechanism (srm) brussels base single resolution board (srb) centre. so short, final lesson become abundantly clear need cross-border authorities. a major institutional overhaul architecture economic monetary union ensue complement bank union. key element address work yet complete. if “stability” short-hand use describe objective changes, important stress seek safeguard stability precisely importance citizens. build this, change i outline accompany parallel, interrelated, series change strengthen consumer protection framework. european legislation improve protection consumer area mortgage credit, payment services, insurance distribution investments. the central bank contribute work strengthen domestic framework. this include enhancement consumer protection code, introduction code conduct mortgage arrears, sme lend code subsequent sme lend regulations, more. 13 *** conclusion so, sort then? clearly no, much remain done. on institutional side, review european supervisory authority (esas) ongoing debate need european deposit insurance scheme pan-european anti money launder (aml) authority show institutional architecture necessary sustain bank union yet complete work must undertaken. enhance mrel target base outcome resolvability assessment develop policy transfer strategy remain ongoing initiatives.xxv moreover, backstop single resolution fund need quickly operationalised. now important step take address bank failure, authority need turn attention significant player financial sector financial market infrastructure insurance firms. turn resilience, debt gni* ireland still elevate remain 100 per cent. a outline governor central bank recent speech, give particularly favourable economic growth recent years, projection general government deficit 2019 appear sufficiently ambitious fiscal policy.xxvi on macroprudential side, build resilience effectively require balance timing, policy-mix policy calibration, depend nature systemic risk addressed. technical work ongoing ass whether strengthen framework further.xxvii however, much progress made. 14 and ten year on, important take stock acknowledge this. bank jointly supervise resolve cross-border institutions. bank authority good prepare bank failures, reduce cost taxpayer future. the level, type quality regulatory capital increase loss-absorbing capacity bank improved. we actively intervene address systemic risk pro-cyclicality system. also, cognisance ireland’s vulnerability small open economy need sector build resilience. we keep lesson crisis forefront mind, work, thinking, communications. then, combine effort highlight address risk build resilience make financial system strong safer, thereby safeguard stability protect consumers. thank i would like thank

ireland.i “those cannot remember past condemn repeat it"ii well-known, albeit ironically often forgotten, wisdom. there strong argument past forget lead crisis, include misconception great moderation lead permanent reduction business cycle fluctuations. give cost human misery crisis cause ireland, would inexcusable happen again. so today, brief remarks, i spend small amount time cause crisis, discuss crisis itself, change result conclude look future. the cause crisis 10 year ago, almost exactly today, new york federal reserve economists’ analysis u economy (prepared set interest rates), note “falling real estate price rise default home mortgage cause stress financial market economy…. however, analysis conclude problem would contained.”iii just five day later, lehman brother file bankruptcy. the rest, say, history. i cite analysis criticise fed, one example international failure understand strength gather storm clouds, notwithstanding proximity. problem start crystallise 2007, accelerate 2008, particularly post lehmans, market participant retreat towards safe assets. this tendency intensify the bank crisis – a decade on complexity lack transparency financial system. in words, due complexity market, participant could establish confidence risk would end might expose ultimate holder certain type risks. consequently, market move away many high risks. this include irish bank large property exposures. the move away high risk due concern solvency take form withdrawal short-term liquidity, lead failure irish bank many others. it obvious storm cloud arise single cause. a recent bank england staff work paperiv note follow contribute factor global financial crisis:  inadequate flaw regulation, supervision both;  underestimation riskiness security create financial engineering;  bad incentives;  excessive fund long term asset short-term liabilities;  rat agency failures;  flaw assumption regard house prices;  elevate household debt;  a belief banker institution big fail;  global imbalances;  financial asset accounting;  too loose monetary policy. it long list! across globe, “financial innovation….vastly outpace regulation supervision…. financial institution go frenzy reckless risk-taking…. [relying] short-term funding, dramatically low lend standardsv.” the bank crisis – a decade on many failure clearly relevant catastrophic impact financial crisis ireland too. they well cover various reportsvi, include honohan reportvii, present five root cause specific collapse irish bank system:  macroeconomic budgetary policy contribute economic overheating, rely unsustainable extent construction sector transient source government revenue;  comprehensive failure bank management maintain safe sound bank practices;  a regulatory approach deferential accommodating, insufficiently challenge persistent enough;  an under-resourced approach bank supervision that, rely governance risk-management procedures, neglect quantitative assessment need ensure sufficient capital absorb grow property-related risks;  an unwillingness take board sufficiently real risk loom problem act sufficient decisiveness force head time. in words, myriad decision large small, include decision act (inaction bias), underpin implicit explicit assumptions, lead global financial crisis catastrophic effect ireland. there also strong argument ireland, small open economy, susceptible economic cycle likely experience froth good time great risk severe downturn larger, le open economies. the bank crisis – a decade on result crisis a well documented, ireland experience credit-fuelled property bubble, inflate residential commercial prices, drive individual indebtedness, reduce overall competitiveness encourage reliance property base tax year 2003 2008viii. asset bubble least 380 year old. this time, ireland (and elsewhere) happen property relate tulips, trade ‘south seas’ dot.com companies. when confidence evaporated, soft landing. the effect plummet property price quickly spill rest economy, cause distress difficulty borrowers, hurt saver (including loss value supposedly ‘safe’ bank shares), severely weaken country’s fiscal position. in response, process fiscal adjustment bank sector support begin 2008. this include guarantee liability bank sector; series pro-cyclical, contractionary budgets; capital injection domestic banks. by late 2010, ireland’s fiscal position unsustainable. the government agree enter eu imf support programme, total size €85bn. the result adjustment programme bring additional contractionary budget (albeit would even austere ireland raise market-based funding, compare cheaper, three-year official funding), public sector pay cuts, bank stress tests, capital injections. the associate human cost immense. the effect still felt today many – still directly affect high level personal debt indirectly by, example, dysfunction still exist house market. the emergency brake apply house construction 2008, still felt acutely today. post onset the bank crisis – a decade on crisis, house stock ireland flat-lined two million homesix. that increase 8,800 2011 2016, compare increase half million first decade 2000s, c.74,000 2007 alonex. the consequence particular effect lack resilience system take work through; non-performing loan emerge much quickly. 10 year onset crisis, five year since peak, non-performing loan (npls) ireland still cause considerable distress borrower vulnerability bank system. but say considerable progress. npls irish retail bank system decline €85bn 2013 c.€25bn end 2017xi. importantly, loan “cure” (the return previously default balance perform loan status) key driver npl reduction residential mortgage segment, particularly owner occupier mortgages, loan restructure play pivotal role.xii in contrast, liquidations, write-offs, sale account large majority npl reduction commercial real estate segment. this illustrate approximately one six (116,010)xiii owner-occupier loan currently existence form restructure. 87% loan meet term restructure, 79% long arrears. this achieve hard work sacrifice borrower distress engaged, pressure requirement central bank (including repossession pursue last resort), action banks, underpin economic growth. unfortunately, significant problem remain. at end june 2018, c.46,000 account arrears great 90 days. the outstanding balance lenders’ owner occupier the bank crisis – a decade on mortgage account arrears 90 day €9.5 billion, equivalent c.10 per cent total outstanding balance owner occupier mortgage accounts. account 720 day past due constitute 42 per cent account arrears, €2.5 billion, represent 91 per cent arrears balance outstanding. this matter behind account arrears distress and, case pdh loans, vulnerability borrower risk lose home. this significant number protection support consumer face mortgage arrears. within remit central bank’s responsibilities, approach mortgage arrears resolution focus ensure fair treatment borrower strong consumer protection framework ensure bank sufficiently capitalised, hold appropriately conservative provisions, appropriate arrears resolution strategy operation place. this include regulatory requirement consumer protection code the code conduct mortgage arrears (ccma), govern lender interact retail borrower distress. firm must also follow mortgage arrears resolution process (marp) deal borrower face arrears. the marp process also require alternative option restructure cannot agree appropriate. there range advice support arrears, include money advice budget service (mabs), national mortgage arrears resolution service (abhaile) court mentor service assist debtor face court proceedings. the government also introduce personal insolvency act 2012, introduce three debt resolution processes: a debt relief notice, a debt settlement arrangement personal insolvency the bank crisis – a decade on arrangement. the insolvency service establish march 2013 independent statutory body. the government also introduce national mortgage-to-rent scheme. there also number non-statutory organisation provide assistance mortgage arrears. however, protections, safety net restructure option go address underlie problem distress borrower engage lender support place. in context, noteworthy that:  c.44% pdh loan two year past due five year past due;  c.40% borrower pdh loan two year past due engage lenders;  half loan four year past due end 2016, five year past due end 2017;  70% mortgage arrears five year engage banksxiv & xv. recognise individual distress number represent, i would urge anyone arrears engage lender and/ support available. nonetheless, we, economically societally, want function mortgage market, secure lend price different way unsecured, security must mean somethingxvi banks, commercial financial stability perspective must way deal npls. sale prove controversial, particularly owner occupier loans. they legitimate necessary approach bank address non-performing mortgage loans. to date, material difference number legal proceed issue bank non-banks, percentage total number account arrearsxvii. it the bank crisis – a decade on also important emphasise central bank has, support oireachtas, ensure protection code conduct, include ccma, travel loan – activity regulated, ownership. the regulatory response crisis domestically, much decade since 2008 spend crisis management mode, include part troika programme. a veritable ‘alphabet soup’ regulations, implement technical standards, account supervisory policy implement recent years. the list acronym long confuse – crd/ crr, brrd, ssmr, mifid ii, emir, ifrs9, gdpr, trim, psd2, etc.xviii, extensive international regulatory response reflect international nature crisis. the central bank also undergo significant organisational change term culture, structure, process. follow onset crisis, include enactment central bank reform act 2010, introduce significant change regulatory framework supervisory culture approach. this deliver assertive, risk based, outcomes-focused analytical approach supervision. enforcement important tool effect deterrence, achieve compliance promote behaviour expect. we commit continue necessary evolution regulatory framework, supervisory approach ability resolve firm industry risk present evolve. from prudential perspective, aim irish financial system resilient, trustworthy sustainably serve need economy customer the bank crisis – a decade on long term – include economic cycle. this deliver drive regulate financial service firm to: 1. have sufficient financial resources, include plausible severe stress; 2. have sustainable business model long-term; 3. be well governed, appropriate cultures, effective risk management control arrangements, 4. be able recover get difficulty, cannot, resolvable orderly manner without significant externality taxpayer costs. where objective met, take action remediate them. this remediation continue address legacy issue, drive improvement build great resilience system. the creation single supervisory mechanism (ssm) 2014 also fundamentally important. it creation reflect european nature bank failure centralise bank supervision across eurozone authority european central bank. it drive great consistency intensity bank supervision start rebuild confidence european bank system – albeit remain fragility it. if look back ‘light touch’ regulation yesteryear, extensive rulebook, catastrophic reliance banks, management market whole act certain way would avoid build-up undue risk. now 10 year since onset crisis, rule use support assertive, intrusive, outcome focus approach supervision. the construction today’s system clearly drive lesson last 10 years. the bank crisis – a decade on regulation successful improve safety soundness bank financial service firms, governance risk management arrangements, reduce (but yet removing) contingent taxpayer liability connect failure. to take one important tangible example mean case irish banks, demand increase quantity, quality capital bank hold protect loss could trigger negative shock. overall, system 3.5 time level equity risk weight asset compare 2006xix. regulation also drive great transparency, disclosure consistency reporting, product design literature. notwithstanding progress, legacy issue remain. these include remain high level non-performing loan i refer earlier, remain vulnerability banks’ business models, capability issue critical areas, include it risk management. furthermore, resolution plan yet fully implementable, mean work do remove implicit taxpayer support large banks. a recently reported, bank also work improve culture level diversity senior levelsxx. this remain focus address legacy issues, build resilience system good time mitigate effect inevitable future downturn shocks. this particularly important context ireland’s vulnerability small, open, economy, risk i refer earlier. we also take forward-looking macro prudential actions, include: the bank crisis – a decade on  the activation counter-cyclical capital buffer, design build resilience time growth, release downturn, avoid pro-cyclical withdrawal credit supply;  the introduction borrower-based measure limit loan-to-value loan-to-income ratios, increase resilience system reduce risk credit-fuelled property bubble over-borrowing over-lending;  advice government regard need run budget surplus precondition run stabilising, counter-cyclical deficit future downturn. if surplus build increase risk require pro-cyclical fiscal austerity policies.xxi my colleague, sharon donnery, deputy governor, central banking, speak macro prudential measure remark dublin economics workshop 14 september, i discus detail today. we also seek ensure financial service industry pay direct cost necessary enhancement regulation supervision. over come year aim increase levy pay regulate entity 100% regulatory costs. look ahead the irish financial system, bank system specifically, undoubtedly strong resilient 10 year ago. after many year contraction, also grow again, become increasingly complex nature increasingly internationally focused, part due brexit. so, grind optimism. however, i touch on, weakness remain, i also referenced, likely close next downturn the bank crisis – a decade on start last one. even sun shin today, cloud horizon. one hope future storm severe last one, storm undoubtedly be. in context, noteworthy globally domestically level debt characterise build crisis disappeared. in fact, global debt level high 2009, reach record peak $164 trillion 2016 – equivalent 225 per cent global gdp. debt advance economy level see since second world warxxii. close home, ireland’s household public debt levels, key indicator economy’s resilience shock remain elevate (irish household fourth indebted european unionxxiii). this level debt clearly increase vulnerability shock (including interest rate risk) limit authorities’ policy option deal counter cyclical way. these macro risk significant ireland, give openness economy. these could obviously affect domestic retail bank system, notwithstanding increase resilience. risk also arise micro level. one risk arise increase dependency interconnectedness information technology, need enhance resilience mitigate cyber security risk area. i discuss detail today, area concern i cover detail speech next month. conclusion build resilience now, individuals, government bank serve u well future downturns, whatever cause may be. it also help press need restore trust system, foundation financial institution trustworthy. the bank crisis – a decade on all action take crisis, change make aftermath support vital, public interest mission central bank. that safeguard stability financial service system protect consumers. my energy focus ensure central bank robust, fit purpose regulatory framework, deliver effective, intrusive, analytical outcomes-focused approach supervision, remember lesson past, anticipate future risks, continuously improves. my hope 10 years’ time, still remember bank crisis lesson it. but navigate many challenge ahead successfully weather inevitable shock occur, 10 year ago. this require continue diligence, build resilience, willingness listen different voice challenge assumption rely – inevitable hold. with

investor day your excellencies, dear guests, ten year ago, mid-september 2008, lehman brothers’ collapse become trigger global financial crisis. the main cause global financial crisis was, opinion, excessive deregulation, fuel speculative bubble many markets, primarily derivative market comprise mortgages. that crisis throw u eu midst financial turmoil, lead recession, deflation, force central bank take unorthodox measures, include quantitative easing, lead negative real even nominal interest rates. since then, u eu recovered, exit unorthodox policy prof hard eu, particularly country good

although vienna initiative useful tool damage control region. the rest know i want insist upon here. the diagnosis i put 2009, book “the end illusion economics. crisis anti-crisis” still valid. since then, romania witness decade major transformations. under three successive imf/eu programs, make long way reform economy make resilient external shocks. in follows, i argue romania develop good equip

account deficit witness major adjustment 10% gdp. the net real wage high 42.7% 2017 compare 2008, number employee also high 2.4% 2017 compare 2008. a social contribution tax reduced, increase real wage partially mirror increase compensation employees. when compare eu average, labor productivity raise fast compensation employee entire period, therefore unit labor cost, relative main trade partner (eu), decrease 7.7 percentage point (figure 3). this explain positive dynamic exports. public debt, percentage gdp, three time high 2008 (35% 2017 compare 12% 2008), mislead figure number reasons. first, 2008 year that, romania access international markets, choice, finance deficit one-off revenues. second, international reserve 10 billion euro high end 2017 compare end 2007 (figure 4). international reserve include foreign exchange buff build since 2011, reach average 4 month finance 2013 fluctuate around level since then. this buff first line defense short-term external shock may affect emerge markets, opinion good instrument need preserve consolidated. 4 third, finance gap much low crisis emerged: jump 2009 16.4% gdp, gradually decrease year year, go 10% benchmark 2014, 7.5% 2017 stagnate 2018. (figure 5). fourth, refinance risk significantly diminish negatively correlate average maturity. a june 2018, average maturity romania’s eurobonds 9.7 year (figure 6), investor base much diversify 2011. average maturity local bond double 1.6 3.2 years, average maturity debt 6.4 years, compare 3.8 year 2011. moreover, share public debt fix interest rate 90%, reduce interest rate risk stock debt. regain consolidate access international market crisis major success government sign trust economy. another factor point towards low contagion risk external shock refer net external debt. the net external debt low 2008: 20.2% gdp 2017, 27% 2008 (figure 7). the reduce contagion risk also visible bank sector, least 5 key indicators. foreign denominate loan represent one third total stock loans, compare two third prior crisis, therefore reduce exposure debtor foreign exchange risk (figure 8). finance parent bank 9 billion euro (as july 2018), compare 26.1 billion euro december 2008 (figure 9). currently (as july 2018), domestic deposit count 70.9% total banks’ liabilities, whilst foreign liability represent 9% total banks’ liabilities. loan deposit ratio decrease 122% december 2008 75.2% june 2018, show local deposit main source finance banks. of course, high solvability ratio (figure 10) much low npls (figure 11) also indicate bank sector resilient ever external shocks. 5 even high concentration sovereign debt hand local bank positive side effect, relatively low reliance non-residents (they account 18% market). these indicator reduce contagion effect alleviate risk sudden reversal investors’ sentiment – describe high systemic risk late financial stability report national bank romania. jerome powell, chairman federal reserve, refer assessment risk emerge economy (2017), say three element important:  first, vulnerability emes themselves;  second, evolution advanced-economies monetary policies;  third, market might respond evolution. emerge economy taker global markets; cannot much last two element mention above, exogenous. our duty prevent accumulation domestic vulnerabilities, deterioration country’s economic condition make vulnerable adverse external shocks. the main medium-term vulnerability romanian economy refer accumulation twin deficit growth potential, debt sustainability adverse scenario, also insufficient progress structural reform – constrain big loss last 10 year loss work force emigration. public debt sustainable, word caution need respect adverse scenario structural deficit return mto. a model show (figure 12 13), medium term debt sustainability ensure return medium term budgetary objective. 6 the structural budget deficit deviate mto (1% gdp) since 2016. nowadays structural deficit is, however, cash deficit tomorrow, need finance circumstance may turn unfavorable emerge economy (figure 14). the recent economic deceleration 6.9% 2017 4.2% y-o-y first half 2018 double edge sword. on one hand, represent slowdown compare last year. on hand, bring growth towards potential, therefore reduce output gap make growth sustainable. but, former u president harry truman said, “all economist say one hand…on hand…give one-handed economist!”. the current account deficit, although much low prior crisis long time trend 4% gdp, remain concern peer record current account surplus year (figure 15). however, remain fully finance autonomous flow (fdi european funds) (figure 16). let make two remark here. the fdi flows, although low prior crisis, much stable, comprise equity reinvested profit (especially mid-2014), short-term intra-company loan practically vanished. a european funds, last 10 years, 40 billion euro enter country, represent factor increase monetary aggregates. this bring issue inflation. price stability main task i think good job, give circumstances. last year inflation target met. this year, fast raise inflation mostly due administer price import inflation, saw inflation stagnate june go july, follow three interest rate hike first four month year subsequently firm liquidity management. core 2 adjust inflation, indicator exclude highly volatile prices, decrease since may (figure 17). we confident inflation reach target end year, even would upper bound. next year, expect inflation go close 3%, but, always, prediction interest rate policy-neutral. 7 what important emphasize investor discriminate among emerge economies, good reasons. romania belong group central europe, low exchange rate volatility peer slightly high yield interest rate them, far away trouble emerge market (figure 18, 19, 20

recent crisis put financial stability centre public discussion improveeconomic resilience. what institutional architecture financial stability look like andwhat role central bank context? while question largely beensettled regard price stability, similar consensus exist come financial stability.there neither settle institutional template financial stability consensus therole central banks. the economic literature suggest various models, whichhave test around world. in speech today, however, i go theeconomics financial stability. i instead approach issue legal perspective. thequestion i address is: role eu law ascribe ecb contribute stabilityof financial system?the general constitutional frameworkwhen talk role ecb legal perspective, essentially refer toits tasks, mandate competences. in compound eu legal order, cover aset basic principles. first foremost, eu union base rule law.thismeans every action take eu institution need found union law ultimatelyon treaties. this fundamental constitutional value two manifestations.first, principle conferral require eu act within limit thecompetences confer upon member state treaty attain objective setout therein. moreover, exercise competences, eu must respect principle ofsubsidiarity proportionality. second, principle institutional balance provide euinstitutions must act accordance power confer treaty andrespect competence eu institutions. these two principle guide thediscussion role ecb financial stability. they also highlight fact get theanswer right ultimately rule-of-law issue.as i argue today, author treaty make financial stability ecb objective.the ecb’s primary responsibility price stability. the treaty-makers provide eitherfor specific financial stability-oriented instrument dedicate financial stability institutionalset-up union level, i abstract coordination role european systemic riskboard (esrb). and without objective dedicate instruments, treaty could haveconferred ecb stand-alone task. in financial stability, thus, ecb limited,contributory role accord treaties.financial stability ecb lawfinancial stability: protean conceptthe treaty contain definition financial stability. like price stability, financial stability isan objective public policy. unlike price stability, however, financial stability remain proteanconcept, various manifestation different understand basic aspects.1234 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech first, notion financial stability nebulous much difficult capture pricestability. the term financial stability sometimes use broad way cover objectivesand institution encompass stability economy whole also include thefinancial stability governments, treaty establish european stability mechanismor title european financial stability facility (efsf). in speech today, i use theterm financial stability narrow sense refer “stability financial system”, isthe word use article 127(5) tfeu.but even within narrow meaning, single even widely accept definition offinancial stability. some author institution try arrive positive definition offinancial stability describe essential features, others start absence –financial instability. the ecb approach financial stability term systemic risk: financialstability state whereby build-up systemic risk prevented.in turn, systemic risk is“the risk provision necessary financial product service financial systemwill impair point economic growth welfare may materially affected”.simply put, financial stability mean ﬁnancial system expect withstandunforeseeable event shock without major disruption continue provide service tothe economy. compare definition much concrete ecb definition pricestability, year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price theeuro area 2%. in pursuit price stability, ecb aim maintain inflation ratesbelow, close to, 2% medium term. these two definition clearly illustrate that, whenit come financial stability, operate much abstract level, considerablyvaguer metrics.financial stability monetary policy also differ term instrument use pursuetheir objectives. monetary policy fairly settle set tool – first foremost, least inconventional times, short-term interest rate. financial stability, however, neither aprimary instrument standard taxonomy instruments. instead, various differentinstruments, range toolbox supervisory regulation (article 5 thessmr), maximum loan-to-value limit countercyclical capital buffers, taxation, aswell interest rates. could become example policymaking people’sinstruments?some instrument use national level, others deploy certainsector regard individual financial institution. many instrument havefinancial stability state aim advance macroprudential policies. and macroprudentialpolicies, like financial stability, often concept onto “anyone could project ownsense priorities” – priority often compete other.third, unlike price stability, financial stability fall exclusive competence asingle institution. instead, various actor national, supranational international level aregiven different role responsibility pursue financial stability. finance ministries,supervisors, expert body (the esrb, national macroprudential committee and/or regulatorswhich diverge widely term power composition), central bank basel-based financial stability board ascribe role financial stability.thus, respects, financial stability still settle field public policy sameway price stability is. and matter theoretical interest. it also bearingon question ultimately responsible field: expert political bodies. iwill come back point end speech.what role ecb field financial stability?let come basic question. what role eu law, especially primary eu law,foresee ecb field financial stability?56789 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech the basic treaty provision start article 127 tfeu chapter monetarypolicy, contain objective task ecb/escb. this article explicitlypoint clear, unambiguous role ecb regard financial stability. financial stability isnot among objective ecb enshrine first paragraph article 127. the primaryobjective define maintenance price stability. and, without prejudice tothis objective, ecb mandate support general economic policy union witha view contribute general objective union. nor financial stability one thefour basic task refer second paragraph article 127. first list is, course,the basic task define implement monetary policy union. this basic task isaccompanied certain monetary tools, specifically provide primary law. a i alreadymentioned, tool provide area financial stability.the ecb’s contributory role financial stabilitythe explicit reference financial stability article 127 fifth paragraph. thisparagraph set escb’s duty “contribute” smooth conduct policy pursue by“competent authorities” relate stability financial system. thus, escb give acontributory role field financial stability. that contribution exercise itsmonetary policy task supervisory task, embed financial stability acontribution competent authorities.what scope ecb’s contributory role?the concept “contribution” appear article 127 tfeu. it also use thetreaties describe allocation power demarcate competence themember state eu variety fields. for example, article 170(1) tfeu providesthat “the union shall contribute establishment development trans-europeannetworks area transport, telecommunication energy infrastructures”. the sameformulation use article 169(1) tfeu regard consumer protection. in fields,the eu share competence member states. there is, however, significantdifference article article 127(5). in case share competences,the eu give power contribute directly achievement objectives. when itcomes financial stability, however, ecb task contribute smooth conductof policy pursue competent authorities. there critical difference here. if ecbwere task contribute attainment financial stability, would – like eu thefield network – leeway identify policy good serve achievement aim.however, ecb’s role contribute financial stability would instead seem equivalentto category union competence narrow possible scope, namely supplementaryor support competences. in fields, eu support action memberstates “without thereby supersede competence areas”.thus clear ecb neither exclusive power field financial stability norcompetence act own. “contribution” establish competence independentand stand-alone action. to contribute attainment aim support it; basicidentification aim financial stability achieve thus lie “competent”institutions. and primary responsibility.exactly ecb carry contributory role specify either treaty orthe statute escb – unlike monetary policy, ecb’s function operationsare set detail. the ecb use usual tools, extent suitable, tocontribute financial stability. the ecb’s advisory function great relevance thiscontext. article 127(4) tfeu call consultation basic task list thepreceding paragraph. only paragraph (5) mention financial stability, councildecision implement part

extreme weather events, translate financial risk institution supervise. the go risk arise transition low carbon economy. this transition may lead strand asset policy risks, turn mean financial risk institution supervise. we aim 3 identify risks. and possible manage, resolve even mitigate them. and opportunity side. we supervisor see sunny side too, know. or least try to. i believe must fulfill responsibilities. a supervisor, together financial sector, must align financial system sustainability goals. and must support opportunity green sustainable finance. of course, central bank supervisor, must overstretch mandate. but safeguard sustainable prosperity fall well within mission. this mean financial institution sufficient buff absorb unexpected losses. we also reexamine current method create prosperity. if cause significant ecological damage, prevent future generation obtain similar high level prosperity, create prosperity today sustainable either. this run counter mission. there way impact investment decision credit allocation. our supervisory policy could, instance, take account transition low carbon economy. that’s central bank help transform financial infrastructure, facilitate necessary flow capital need most. to help transform economy low carbon one. we remove unnecessary obstacle transition. and assist sector create common definition standards. a well provide necessary guidance. the development sustainable taxonomy good example this. i know, conventional area focus central bank. so, like private sector, develop new tool methodology support u goal. and guess what! we central bank supervisor explore new type risk. central bank supervisor worldwide study issues. of course, trailblazers: you’re probably aware bank england’s pioneer work area. and morning discuss eu taxonomy, would take probably time enter force. this completely understandable complex task. in regard worthwhile look chinese approach lay foundation green finance. they manage develop green taxonomy two months! a remarkably short period time. these couple example country ahead curve. at end spectrum central banks, issue completely new agenda. background membership ngf these development lay foundation set network central bank supervisor end last year, ngfs. (you remember, network green financial system…). it bring together institution determine move forward green finance climate-related risks. 4 within network share experience best practices. this mean don’t reinvent wheel able join forces. since launch december 2017, ngf experience rapid growth term new member observers. there eight found country begin with. but chair i proud say seventeen member five observers. hopefully, many come. and member come across globe. it european party. no. all continent represented. china, singapore mexico three found members, well example france uk. this summer, ecb, include ssm, single supervisory mechanism, come board. i expect major effect within europe. the ssm directly supervise one hundred nineteen significant bank euro area also indirectly supervise le significant bank area. that mean country bank union indirectly link ngfs. member demonstrate strong collective commitment green financial system. they take responsibility contribute implementation paris agreement. now might thinking, actually do? what impact try achieve? activity ngf member voluntarily exchange valuable experience best practice climate risk analysis mitigation tools. these activity structure around three workflows: microprudential supervision; macrofinancial issues; scale green finance. in term microprudential supervision, study identify best practice central bank supervisor analyze climate-related risk affect individual institutions. we map current supervisory practice integrate environmental risk micro-prudential supervision. this force individual institution consider impact balance sheet. we also review current practice environmental climate information disclosure financial institution identify best practices. secondly, attempt quantify physical transition risk macroeconomic level. here, identify example good practice ngf members. these include example macro stress test scenario analyses. our last area focus role central bank scale green finance. we discus current practice incorporate esg criterion area central bank operational activities. against backdrop, ngf organize seminar ‘sustainable & responsible investment central banks’. the event host dnb, 21st september. then, discus best practice principle integrate sustainability consideration management official reserves. 5 concrete example this might still sound bite abstract term could mean you, financial sector. so let return first area activity: supervisor integrate climate risk supervision? last year, dnb examine exposure financial institution carbon intensive sectors. we publish find report title ‘waterproof’. this give u good indication vulnerability hard transition scenario. we also look new type national policy could cause financial risk materialize already short term. a good example dutch commercial real estate sector. in netherlands, 2023, office build meet minimum energy efficiency requirements, face closure. in 2017, estimate half office netherlands meet requirement. this raise prospect write-off lenders. a i said, i strongly believe predictable, transparent public institutions. this example show new policy achieve dutch carbon emission goal require transparent implementation, avoid sudden shocks. annual data requests, part supervision, could give great insight size nature risk. this form basis supervisor engage dialogue institutions. we may expect prepare strategy integrate esg risk short long term risk analyses. to explain adapt investment strategy align paris ambition. and demonstrate clear view viability business model two degree scenario. in contrast supervisory dialogues, one thing i believe must do, create wrong incentives. there also advocate change capital requirements. to discourage brown exposures, encourage green investments. however, dnb believe capital requirement must essentially safeguard financial solidity stability. hence, without conclusive evidence green exposure le risky exposures, low capital requirement introduce green support factor increase risk financial stability. with evidence, situation would change dramatically… we yet. we need work hard determine risk “green”, also “brown” exposures. and identify whether exist risk exposure differential green brown assets. this also one focal area ngfs. we draw experience members. and arrive common view. also safeguard level play field across prudential jurisdictions. timeline ngf stand now, i must say i’m proud network’s progress. ten month ago, acronym ngf still sound odd. but today, right back track country queue board train. it may run partly renewable source moment, hopefully near future fully power certify green energy! and able ass 6 extent succeed. the analysis conduct work stream fee ngf report issue first half 2019. the final purpose define develop best practice promote implement within outside membership ngfs. conclusion ngf dnb need demonstrate support, underpin promote transition green financial system, part regular mandate. and research possible future supervisory framework continue, we’re excite initiative you, private sector, take model risk transform financial markets. i believe drive innovation might even able provide significant lever advance global change. however, time rapid change also important analyse innovation within public sector create new risks. so therefore, hope continue dialogue work challenge together. or, words, ‘grand ballroom’ okura hotel: together, let u face music dance. let’s dance together! thank you. yves mersch: strengthen european financial industry amiddisruptive global challengesspeech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, atthe european institute financial regulation (eifr), paris, 3 september 2018.* * *europe’s financial industry

single euro payment area (sepa) – endeavourthat require substantial effort stakeholders. that initiative consist two key stages.first all, harmonise legal framework need payment service eu. thus, thepayment service directive (psd) adopt 2007 enter force 2009.second, important ensure consumer business eu could sendpayments quickly easily across borders, difference domesticand non-domestic

instant paymentsettlement service, set go live november, provide real-time, high-end platformfor payment service innovation.the challenge europeprogress towards integrate market payment without problems. europestill integrated, standardise card payment network, vision beingable use card payment terminal europe yet realised.europe’s large card payment network still interoperable. for example, germany’sgirocard france’s carte bancaires account substantial number card payment inthe euro area’s two large economies. however, owe significant technical differences, asupposed lack business case absence political will, two network remainseparate – national card schemes. a consequence, convenient touse non-european card travel across europe.although standardisation work carry via european card stakeholdersgroup, europe still europe-wide card scheme, remain fully relianton non-european scheme make cross-border card payments. although provide avalued service, scheme raise certain question governance perspective.european bank relinquish influence area, possibly short-termprofit considerations.indeed, large non-european company play significant role provision paymentservices europe, european bank focus solely serve national markets.let’s face it: foundation lay european institution leverage europeanproviders order offer paneuropean services. instead, foundation often exploitedby multinationals outside europe offer innovative, consumer-friendly solutions. indeed,european bank seem surrender much paneuropean payment business.paypal dominate market online payment europe, use

european vehicle set standard come quality reliability.there reason success cannot replicate area payment service – orfinancial service general.the way pay europe changing. significant number consumer move onlinepayment channels, retail payment increasingly carry via mobile phones. at thesame time, virtual currency long topic debate – among experts,either.european citizen demand pan-european

count freiburg andsubmitted habsburg protection instead. freiburg thus become part empire that,over time, become european multinational state.time again, parallel draw habsburg monarchy eu. for example,historian harold jam wrote, "the eu look like habsburg empire, complex vesselof nationality satirist joke situation desperate serious. when theempire fell 100 year later, lose support

globalisation technological progress, international trade policy competition withchina current challenge move discus role eu reform step for12 1 / 10bis central bankers' speech euro area. but i’d like start take brief look back. 2 ten year financial crisisover past day weeks, slew medium report remind u event often year ago, financial crisis come tumultuous head collapse lehmanbrothers.many observer regard climax crisis, follow global recessionin 2009. in term severity, precedent downturn post-war history.in euro area, financial crisis late coalesce sovereign debt crisis. what’s more,the unemployment rate peak 12% mid-2013. the rate since fall 8.2% – thisis value content with.the member state hit especially hard crisis make huge strides: reducednew government borrowing, cut current account deficits, improve competitivenessand implement structural reforms.take greece, which, 2008-09, vast current account deficit gap hole itsgeneral government budget – reach 15% gdp. last year, however, thecurrent account broadly balance surplus even record generalgovernment budget.all all, five country receive financial support via assistance programme conditionsattached. a month ago today, greece also last five country cast thestatus "programme country".greece’s exit adjustment programme mark important milestone. but would bepremature think crisis do with. a i recently say athens, stillwork done.continued structural reform need accelerate growth, create jobs, boost bothproductivity wage – greece euro area countries, too. by way, wein germany content merely ride wave successful labour market andsocial reform implement 2000s.the institutional foundation monetary union require reform euro area bemade permanently crisis-proof. because there’s one thing probably agree on: none ofus want repeat last ten year crisis.the extensive rescue package put together recent year trigger debate thecountries provide assistance mutualisation liability intergovernmental transfers. inthe country receive assistance, condition attach programme see asvery severe case outside interference national decision-making. 3 a strong europe: important everthe crisis euro area way resolve also stir animosityand resentment give boost anti-european movements. decidedly euro-critical andpopulist party enjoy electoral success many member states. but developmentcannot put rescue measure alone, populist movement flourish outsidethe euro area, too. 2 / 10bis central bankers' speech look economic setting, discontent may come surprise, globaleconomy experience robust upswing. in unite states, unite kingdom, germany andelsewhere, unemployment fall low level decades.but would seem economic effect significant factor play here. digitalchange globalisation, example, transform way live work.populist movement play fact people perceive profound change threat.and i understand many people feel uneasy cheated, fear theyhave lose control. "take back control" – motto brexit supporters.walter eucken remarked, "people’s opinions, mental attitudes, often moreimportant regard direction economic policy economic fact themselves." 3.1 globalisation technological progressfrom economic perspective, clear technological progress free trade boostgeneral prosperity long term. however, look big picture obscure fact thatemployment prospect relative wage shifting. change bring winner losers.economists investigate distributional effect globalisation great detail.studies show china’s integration global economy play particular role insubsequent massive manufacture job loss unite states.now, job loss may well offset job creation sectors, butthese new job often create places. local labour market seeminglyslow adapt, lifetime income affect worker markedly reduced.looking germany, contrary, wolfgang dauth colleague find globalisationhas open important opportunity export eastern europe china thus helpedpreserve manufacture jobs. but this, too, overall view situation.it job politician create condition need new, future-proof jobs. people haveto give ability meet today’s job requirement they, too, reap benefit ofglobalisation digitalisation.education play key role here, particularly since issue affect employment prospect forlower-skilled workers. and wherever social hardship arises, target-driven tax transfersystem step act cushion. 3.2 protectionismby contrast, protectionism isolationism way create "prosperity all".we currently see international trade escalate new level. more year ago, thebundesbank already draw attention economic disadvantage risk associatedwith trade dispute edition monthly report.simulations exercise conduct part global economic model show that, introducingnew tariffs, unite state run risk damage least economy. that’sbecause high price would largely stifle purchase power american consumers.retaliatory tariff introduce trade partner would probably make deterioration inglobal economic activity trade bad still. there loser trade wars.3456 3 / 10bis central bankers' speech some politician believe high tariff reduce current account deficits. however, themodel calculation show this, too, could turn fantasy. while new import tariffswould indeed reduce imports, foreign demand export would probably fall time.and precisely debtor country unite state would probably feel theadditional strain high interest rate wake upward price pressures.you'll doubt know song janis joplin go follows: "oh lord, won’t buy amerce benz? my friend drive porsches, i must make amends."the song probably doesn’t feature donald trump’s playlist. after all, fact americanslike drive german car german impress american one thorn inhis side.but long expression consumer

also difficult pin market distortion trade current account balances. all all, thecurrent account balance reflect countless save investment decision make within aneconomy.in addition decision make enterprise households, fiscal policy play role here.simulation exercise conduct bundesbank reveal tax cut pass unitedstates probably push debt current account deficit level considerably. this donothing reduce global imbalances.furthermore, give diversity economic relationship level interconnectedness withthird countries, look good trade two country alone insufficient. tradeexpert gabriel felbermayr point that, overall, unite state actually currentaccount surplus eu: income service primary income compensatefor trade good deficit.felbermayr also wrote, "the eu way paradise advocate free trade, especiallywhen compare unite states." for 48% products, eu impose high tariffthan unite states, reverse true 30% products.it welcome development two side discuss dismantle tradebarriers. low tariff would boost welfare benefit consumers, particular.for example, study carry european commission show consumer havesaved €60 billion year since 1990s result tariff reductions. nowadays, thank theconclusion free trade agreement, purchase car korea import value of€13,300 tariff-free, 10% import tariff previously place would result inadditional cost amount €1,300.germany quite rightly determine call free trade goods. with mind,restrictions capital flow something difficult reconcile this. 3.3 competition chinaand yet currently see debate germany extent takeover fromabroad need regulate tightly. takeover chinese investor view withparticular concern, fear state-orchestrated transfer expertise technology china.78910 4 / 10bis central bankers' speech then again, german foreign

highly innovative globallycompetitive national economy.rather adopt special measure fend chinese investors, i think would good towork towards develop suitable multilateral rule level play field matter marketaccess.another important measure would press compliance exist rules. unfairtrading practice dump cannot tolerated. in steel sector, especially, thatappears problem connection overcapacities china.at fundamental level, china's economic ascendency is, some, shake firmly hold beliefthat liberal trinity – democracy, rule law, market economy – morehumane, also successful, economically,

university freiburg. the fact far moreknowledge fact feed market economy system one person even anyone organisation know crucial reason market economy anyother economic system.that one reason i firmly believe still right path social marketeconomy, open democracy, liberal rule law.china ambitious international plans, least belt road initiative. at sametime, unite state forge link national security interest international tradepolicy.in difficult situation, need europe strong eu – stand our1112131415 5 / 10bis central bankers' speech interest negotiate table, also preserve refine multilateral

term define "the capacity play role, union, shapingglobal affairs". in words, "united, union, europe force reckon with." 4 focus european unionladies gentlemen,brexit indeed represent step backwards european path.for eu, unite kingdom’s exit – whether hard soft one – painful loss.germany, especially, share many belief uk, merit marketeconomy incentive open markets.but also need see brexit wake-up call. for one thing, public large need begiven clear vision benefit european solution deliver. for another, alsothe underlie question right division responsibility european nationallevels.both aspect suggest eu need gear ever reapingthe reward act one. that i welcome european commission’s plan focuson area eu add real value.there many task perform good european level national. froman economic vantage point, effort concentrate europe-wide public good policyareas cross-border externalities.nearly year ago day, french president emmanuel macron use speech thesorbonne single defence, border security, migration policy, climate protection, theexpansion digital network area could clearly see europe add value.a common asylum policy would also help ease pressure individual country areparticularly expose account locations. help people need task donebetter pull together, burden become much one country.note, though, provide european public good generally come price tag attached.so european to-do list draw up, question item befinanced need addressed. germany – unlike net contributor – already declaredits willingness put towards eu budget.that said, count europe’s general public get saddle even moretaxes public levy hitherto. and continue steer clear give eu theright raise debt. with member state already labour high level generalgovernment debt, would wrong public sector create even borrowingopportunities.let’s forget crisis engulf euro area sovereign debt crisis. and thatbrings final part speech today, i turn attention euro16 6 / 10bis central bankers' speech area. 5 reform euro areato prevent sovereign debt crisis escalating, financially distress member state weregranted assistance loan shape euro rescue package. but crisis also force theeurosystem adopt stabilise measure cause monetary policy test limit ofits mandate. you could say central bank become crisis response team tackle blaze. but theinterests monetary stability, that’s something become habit. hence hugeimportance forge crisis-proof regulatory framework euro area eurosystem.then central bank would able credibly focus mandate rather putout fire behalf claim hand tied.now, number improvement institutional level since crisiserupted. the esm grant conditional financial aid member state event crisisand thus prevent national crisis jeopardise stability entire euro area financialsystem.another step forward creation bank union. thus far, compose singlesupervisory mechanism, single resolution mechanism, harmonise national depositguarantee schemes.these reform remedied weakness architecture euro area either beenignored overlook euro founded.these measure restore stability euro area – there's doubt that. but haven'tmade crisis-proof all. and one doubt reform step arein order. whatever shape step take, regulatory framework monetary union need tobe design way action liability consequence aligned.originally, clearly define allocation responsibilities, maastricht treatystating fiscal policy matter national ownership. and no-bail-out clause (which istoday article 125 treaty function european union) go far toexplicitly prevent member state assume liability other’s debts. action andliability, then, locate national level.as measure last resort, no-bail-out clause state must possible impose ahaircut. that’s something creditor need aware of.i imagine architect monetary union think unlikely scenario. they did,after all, assume financial market rule debt would exert enough disciplinaryinfluence.but onset sovereign debt crisis put pay notion. the no-bail-out clause lackscredibility. even highly indebted member state pay much way riskpremiums year lead crisis. and rule debt tame, leastbecause germany, together france, take sting stability pact early on.the first step towards function maastricht framework restore credibility no-bail-out rule. it must possible reschedule restructure sovereign debt without cripple thefinancial system.real progress could make front automatically extend government bond 7 / 10bis central bankers' speech maturity conjunction orderly restructure regime, abolish preferentialregulatory treatment afford government bonds.the idea automatically extend bond maturity assistance request theesm rescue programme keep private investor hook member state receivesassistance loans. clemens fuest stress might prevent private creditor frommaking quick getaway taxpayer’s expense crisis strikes.a appropriate regulatory regime sovereign risk would encourage bank stop holdingas much government debt – particularly paper issue home country – set asidemore capital cushion losses. that would make sovereign debt restructure episode moremanageable bank system.furthermore, two measure need take make rule debt binding.first, would helpful rule stability pact simplified. one expert publicfinances, friedrich heinemann, remark official manual illustrate rule thepact 200 page long, various sort escape clause offer wealth ofarguments justify high level debt.so proposal simplify fiscal rules, recently table germany’s council expertsand french counterpart, welcome sign. what matter end day thesekinds rule comply help swiftly reduce high debt-to-gdp ratios. a second measure, rigorous interpretation rule could achieve bygiving responsibility fiscal surveillance independent authority instead thecommission. an institution equip clear mandate guarantee sustainable publicfinances would tear mission need achieve policy goal atthe time.ladies gentlemen,i must admit current reform debate isn’t exactly drive idea strengtheningnational ownership.quite opposite: another idea constantly come fore – risk sharing. beit european deposit insurance scheme, facility cushion asymmetric shocks, idea ofconverting esm european monetary fund, proposal base theunderlying assumption euro area would stable member agree sharerisk.but go proposals, too: deliver stability action liability fortheir consequence alignment. after all, responsible decision likely make ifthe economic consequence bear decision-makers themselves, one else.joint liability, then, work decision-making power surrender legacy assetsare scale back.viewed purely isolation, existence single supervisory mechanism would support theidea create european deposit insurance arrangement. this would help make financialsystem stable since would reduce likelihood bank runs.on hand, national level still home key policy area bear therisks carry bank balance sheets, insolvency regimes. moreover, bank balancesheets still riddle exposure arise national ownership. i’m refer tothe high stock non-performing loan quarters. but large hold of1718 8 / 10bis central bankers' speech government bond bank balance sheet also problematic.risks arise national responsibility communitised. after all, anindividual can't usually take insurance damage already occurred.that’s why, deposit insurance scheme created, sovereign default risk bankbalance sheet would need reduce last basis, would stock non-performing loans. and look future, would important prevent new risk frombuilding first place. stay insurance analogy i mentioned, give thatmember state still bear health bank balance sheet future, theconcept long-term national risk retention requirement also seem worth considering.but leave aside bank union, would appear great interest among memberstates euro area surrender substantial sovereignty right brussels, thepower intervene national fiscal autonomy. that's another area would bepremature communitise liability share risk. 6 conclusionladies gentlemen,a century ago, oswald spengler prophesised "decline west". that decline failedto materialise, like collapse capitalism karl marx predicted, "endof history" thesis posit francis fukuyama.events day revolve around china, trade disputes, geopolitical conflicts, refugee crisis,brexit, populism, globalisation, digitalisation demographic change. some may see thechallenges face europe open society paint bleak future powerlessto change.but karl popper’s word show u different path: "the future depend ourselves, donot depend historical necessity."i certain european together strength overcome challenge ourtime. we need remedy flaw come light euro area take brexit acue strengthen focus european union.thank attention. i look forward discussion.h.

the bank england already begin take important step towards increase engagement. some 1 for example, tucker (2018). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 3 3 step take central bank may relevance public institutions, many face similar challenge raise expectation diminish trust among general public. a central bank revolution you typically associate central bank revolution, unless “r” silent. yet i think exaggeration say that, course recent decades, revolution sweep pretty much every central bank planet. that revolution come area external communications, openness accountability. it come neither quickly easily. it generation ago that, ask mervyn king one-word piece advice, paul volcker reply “mystique”. to point, opacity rather transparency course central bankers’ veins. that bloodline run montagu norman century ago (“never explain, never apologise”) alan greenspan generation ago (“i’ve learn mumble great incoherence”). historically, case central bank secrecy deeply rooted. it rest part custom practice, part theology. central bank historically rarely subject external scrutiny, least general public. and central banker generally perceive high priest finance. it say central bankers, like faith, good understand deed words.2 that well central banker rarely utter word all. a century ago, public utterance governor bank england amount one after-dinner speech year well-watered set city london bankers. heroically, attempt make academic rationalise monetary mystique necessary mean central bank exert influence economy.3 time changed. the central bank secrecy doctrine over-turned, part conceptual reasons, part practical ones. within academia, economic theorist begin construct model policy credibility absolutely central people’s expectation remain anchor economy keep stable.4 establish credibility call clear policy target policy actions. secrecy policy actions, whatever potential shorter-term benefits, come potentially significant longer-term cost. monetary policy “surprises” might provide short-term jolt economy. these surprise especially likely policy hand politicians, perhaps seek re-election. but action nurture longer-term suspicion policymakers might neglect inflation, cause inflation expectation rise policy credibility fall. 2 kynaston (2017) discus era bank england’s history. 3 brunner (1981). 4 kydland prescott (1977), barro gordon (1983). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 4 4 if so, monetary surprise could prove self-defeating even stimulate economy. they would instead merely stoke expectation high inflation. in academic jargon, “inflation bias” would emerge.5 this theoretical story find empirical support behaviour number advance economy 1970s, experience so-called “great inflation”.6 in part response great inflation, number central bank begin give new policy responsibility reduce potential electorally-driven monetary surprises. perhaps important operational independence set monetary policy. this institutional attempt avoid temptation stoke economy short-term, anchor inflation expectation longer-term, thereby build policy credibility. with new policy power came, reasonably enough, new responsibility central banks. for first time histories, central bank need far open transparent policy target actions. why? because great transparency policy suspicion among public could allayed, thereby help anchor inflation expectation economy. a unelected technocrat act society’s behalf, operational independence also call new mean ensure central bank sufficiently accountable society. hold central banks’ foot flame call great public transparency great public scrutiny ever previously. trust central bank could endow statute. it need instead earn experience societal scrutiny. these force bring revolution central bank practice regard transparency accountability. over course past century, number bank england appearance parliament rise around 20-fold; number publication issue rise around 600-fold; number word utter rise around 1,000-fold. you don’t need tracy chapman tell i’m talkin’ ‘bout revolution. elsewhere around world, pattern much same. we see rise tide speeches, publication parliamentary appearance central banks. the bank estonia close frontier revolution. today provide rich daily diet reports, forecasts, work papers, speech tweets. the 20th century may yet see historian golden age central banks. central bank number rise 20 start century 175 close. those operational independence monetary policy rise few 40 1971 150 today. and number central bank responsibility regulatory policy rise sharply too, especially since crisis.7 5 barro gordon (1983). 6 for example, nelson (2005). 7 haldane (2017a). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 the rise central bank number part reflect great number nation state 20th century. but this, too, revealing. establish central bank increasingly see essential build block nation state-building, crucial element fabric democratic statecraft. indeed, precisely estonian experience, event room century ago testify. the age innocence this golden age central bank persist century. a best tell, serve economy society well. prior crisis, global economy enter golden period steady growth stable inflation, know “great moderation”.8 mervyn king, bank england governor time, give period different name – nice (non-inflationary consistently-expansionary) decade.9 it difficult see why. growth advance economy average 2.5% inflation 2.2%. the volatility inflation around 80% lower, volatility output 5% lower, precede two decade (chart 1). with economy perform nice-ly, public trust central bank run high. approval rat federal reserve, european central bank bank england healthy levels. the global financial crisis usher new era. great moderation give way first great recession grudge recovery. advance economy growth past decade average 1.5%. the volatility inflation rise 40%, volatility output growth 60%, relative pre-crisis decade (chart 1). the nice decade give way vile (volatile-inflation less-expansionary) one.10 it perhaps come surprise one casualty crisis level public trust financial system, bank central banks. measure satisfaction confidence central bank fell uk, u euro area time global financial crisis.11 they yet fully recover may reflect diminish trust. the situation japan similar, except crisis come sooner bust trust last longer. explain increasingly fragile trust central bank is, part, story crisis. pre-crisis, central bank see steward financial system. a failure system inevitably cause question central banks’ stewardship role. the financial crisis catalyst loss faith steward much way expense scandal british political steward year ago. but also deeper-seated change underway nature public’s trust, specific central banks, rachel botsman call “trust shift”.12 once upon time, public trust endow public institution rather need earned. trust anonymous centralised. the public ask 8 stock watson (2003). 9 king (2003). 10 “vile” coin mpc colleague michael saunders (see, example, giles atkins (2008)). 11 haldane (2017a). 12 botsman (2017). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 difficult question public institutions, large, feel need provide answers. for public institutions, age innocence. a centralise largely anonymous institutions, central bank surf wave blind trust early years. during age innocence, public expectation openness accountability need build bridge public parliaments. when quiz explanation parliamentary committee 1930, montagu norman replied: “i don’t reasons, i instincts”. but public’s attitude towards trust alter trust-building process. faith public institution long blind. trust long endow anonymously. instead build direct connections, often personalise localised. trust long centralise institutions. instead build distribute basis, peer-by-peer, across network. in short, age innocence over. a public’s trust shape-shifted, central bank public institution face new challenge trust. indeed, help explain first revolution central bank transparency practices. but crisis add cyclical push structural fall trust. central bank long surf wave. they face instead retreat tide. for them, too, age innocence may over. while loss trust central bank might expected, disappoint pre-crisis revolution transparency practice provide great degree insulation it. why central banks’ stock reputational capital, build steadily various transparency initiatives, inadequate protect crisis storm? i think two factor play. first, central bank tools, interest rate bank regulations, support whole economy financial system. they affect people’s life greatly, support job incomes, stable cost living, adequate supply credit, confidence money. but impact central banks’ tool often indirect lagged; difficult people observe benefit everyday lives. when people get job pay rise loan, tend attribute good luck good management. rarely link action take central banks, month perhaps year earlier. the benefit central bank action are, people, article faith rather fact. these days, trust need earned, put central bank natural disadvantage. we see pattern professions. in surveys, general public typically mistrustful politician bankers, appear close bottom trust league table. yet trust score local mp local bank branch manager remain high close connection people’s lives. central banks, operate economy-wide, perhaps face challenge banker politicians. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 the second reason trust prove fragile foundation public understanding. once public trust lost, public understand become crucial restore it. the hope revolution central bank transparency initiative provide improve public understand economy central banks. in practice, evidence suggest progress towards improve public’s understand economy, finance central bank slow patchy, despite initiatives. to start positives, concrete evidence improve central bank communication improve function financial markets, forecast performance economist even report medium economy.13 the transparency revolution improve understand among whose day job understand economy role central bank within – experts. the revolution appear far le impact understand among public – non-experts. in 1999, bank england begin survey public gauge understand economy bank.14 back then, around 7% identify bank’s monetary policy committee (mpc) responsible set interest rates. 19 year one transparency revolution later, survey early year suggest around 6% general public hear mpc.15 the failure boost understand economy central bank among general public help explain trust central bank prove fragile expect crisis. it reason i speak central bank face “twin deficits” problem – deficit public understand deficit public trust.16 these twin deficit clearly complementary mutually-reinforcing. these twin deficit not, far least, especially serious consequence central banks. there de-anchoring inflation expectations. there rolling-back central bank responsibility systematic retreat central bank operational independence monetary regulatory matters. if anything, central banks’ set responsibility recently add to. at time, question probably ask role power central bank time generation. that part reflection increase responsibility central bank handed; part reflection high expectation place central banks’ actions; part reflection dent trust institution crisis delivered. this triple challenge. a year ago, bank england host conference mark 20 year since grant operational independence monetary policy. at event, i strike number speaker call time 13 for example, gürkaynak, sack swanson (2005), gürkaynak, levin swanson (2010), berger, ehrmann, fratzscher (2011). 14 bank england inflation attitude survey, currently run jointly tns. 15 the survey also give “bank england” option question group set interest rates. more respondent identify bank england responsible set interest rate (around 30%) monetary policy committee, broadly flat time. 16 haldane (2017b). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 8 8 golden age central banks, speculate whether “peak central bank” reached. some ask openly whether central bank independence appropriate, least financial stability matters. i pessimistic fatalistic that. but i think concern understanding, trust legitimacy real. in response them, new effort may need close understand trust deficit bridge transparency accountability gaps. do would, i believe, leave central bank even better-informed better-placed deliver core mandate future. here why. correct deficit my answer come two, inter-related, parts. let take turn. first, build understand among general public economy, financial system central banks. most people would think improve understand economy among general public desirable. it make improve decision-making people important everyday decision spending, saving, borrow working. the good individual decision (the micro), stable economy financial system likely (the macro). improve public understand economy sense win-win, benefit policymakers public alike. but possible benefit improve public understand stabilise economy financial system underestimated. “popular narratives” among public might important drive macro-economic behaviour past. and narrative may prone destabilisation past. if so, little may invest historically, public policymakers, inform narrative hence stabilise economy. public understand economy finance start low base. you take word it. that strongly-held view public themselves. in surveys, almost half public say believe lack adequate understand economic financial issue make crucial everyday decisions.17 this weak endowment. we know quite bite cost individual weak endowment, appear large long-lasting. for example, poor level financial education show large last effect individuals’ health – financial, physical mental.18 financial illiteracy recipe debt, default depression, whose effect appear feedback another vicious spiral. 17 fca (2017). 18 richardson et al (2017), earwicker (2016). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 9 9 these individual cost amplify aggregate macro level. how people’s expectation evolve – degree optimism pessimism, exuberance depression – crucial determine individual decisions. it long recognise expectation shape importantly others’ expectations. for example, “popular narratives” emerge shape collective expectation among public – optimism pessimism, exuberance depression – drive aggregate economic fluctuations.19 recent research demonstrate powerful emergent popular narrative be, economically financially. a one example, work nick bloom co-author construct various measure businesses’ degree uncertainty around key issues, base word use medium reporting.20 these narrative-based measure uncertainty find important explain investment behaviour company time. david tuckett co-author construct measure popular narrative use participant financial markets.21 they find narrative play important role explain asset price dynamics, impact macro-economic fundamentals. in similar spirit, work michael bailey co-author found, use facebook data, important role share social narrative explain behaviour house market.22 at macroeconomic level, work george akerlof robert shiller look popular narrative emerge period boom bust.23 use word extract newspapers, find prevail popular narrative economy play significant role account height peak depth trough macro-economic boom busts. public expectations, embed story tell, key macro-economic driver. the common theme research importance public’s “narratives” shape behaviour. that true individually especially collectively – hence “popular narratives” – shift collective expectation help account width depth macro-economic fluctuations. a well contribute research, bank begin use “narrative” approach help understand behaviour. let give topical example. the bank’s agent around uk wide network company contact visit regularly discus economy. these visit write up. these write-ups enable semantic search carry identify key theme narrative emerge companies’ conversations. you unsurprised hear key theme among company recent quarter uncertainty surround brexit. 19 shiller (2017). 20 baker, bloom davis (2016), bloom (2009) bloom, bond van reenen (2007). 21 for example, tuckett (2011) tuckett nikolic (2017). 22 bailey et al (2016). 23 akerlof shiller (2009) shiller (2017). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 10 10 figure 1 plot word cloud extract company write-ups. the size word connote frequency use relation mention “uncertainty”. for word exist recently five year ago, strike brexit dominate companies’ conversations. currently, crop 10 time often word “customer” almost 7 time often word “staff” proximity uncertainty.24 chart 2 plot time-series incidence word “uncertainty” “brexit/referendum” agents’ company write-ups. the two, unsurprisingly, positively correlate referendum. indeed, mention brexit outnumber mention uncertainty factor around 3 since referendum. while mention brexit fall referendum peak, notable pick sharply past months, measure uncertainty follow suit. this new research strengthen case improve public understand economy. an improve understand could result better-informed popular narratives, stable expectations, among general. and that, ultimately, would make stable economy financial system. in practice, may structural factor could act opposite direction. the great trust shift may mean people le will past trust expert opinion (such mainstream media) will trust non-expert opinion (such part social media). around half eu use social medium news source and, among age 18-24 uk, around quarter use main news source.25 yet know information social medium source typically filter personalised.26 that fit people’s (personalised, localised) preferences. but also result news narrative likely self-reinforcing self-referential past. the echo chamber louder, reach further, last longer. they also le likely balance objective. more powerful, le balanced, popular narrative potentially destabilise influence expectation economy. this research point one direction. the case improve public understand economy financial system always strong. but world popular narrative even important drive economic behaviour, narrative may even susceptible destabilisation, case improve public understand significantly reinforced. this one blade scissor public engagement. 24 this analysis us company visit write-ups produce bank’s agent themselves, rather contact course proxy latter’s views. 25 newman et al (2016). 26 for example, papacharissi (2002). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11 11 the second blade build central banks’ understand economy financial system general public. this newer, i believe fertile, grind central banks. central bank pride themselves, rightly, technocratic skill economic expertise. there limit knowledge, knowledge every domain discipline. those limit uncertainty need importantly recognise understand economy set policy. nonetheless, would false step dispense expertise. no one seriously question need heart surgeon car mechanics, need specialist knowledge experience decision-making repair heart car parts. human body car engine complex environments. but economic financial system. it need specialist knowledge experience decision-makers. it follow this, however, expertise cannot augment improve draw wide set opinion possible, expert non-expert. non-experts provide different lens problem solutions. this diversity think find especially useful complex decision environments. colloquially, call “folk wisdom”. back 2004, jam surowiecki give another name – “wisdom crowds”.27 there many example collective wisdom work. the celebrate 19th century english statistician francis galton’s amazement accuracy average guess weight ox among visitor county fair. le celebrate (though, turn out, accurate) english magician derren brown’s attempt predict uk national lottery result 2009 use wisdom crowds. the wisdom crowd magic. subsequent research find rely instead two factors: diversity deliberation. to take turn, value diversity complex decision-making fairly well-understood. diversity think simultaneously increase chance creative solution found, reduce chance terrible solution adopted. it fatten upper tail, thin low tail, insight distribution. diversity deliver high return low risk.28 these benefit arise, part, wide pool idea fish deep pool dilute risks. but also arise collective benefit new idea risk challenge filter group. the benefit diversity arise much interaction within group, new idea person brings. but important good idea emerge bad idea submerge. and fatten return slim risks, whatever decision. 27 surowiecki (2004). 28 haldane (2016). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12 12 these benefit demonstrate number real-world settings. in book the difference, scott page go step “diversity trump ability” theorem.29 this state highest-performing team unlikely arise bring together individually-best experts. instead come combine insight diverse sources, expert non-expert. it come cocktail experience, specialist, generalist. the return diversity limitless. when choose optimal asset portfolio, benefit diversification come first assets. the true asset people. the diversity benefit move 2 4 people large compare diversity benefit go 102 104 people. there probably diminish return diversity. the second factor important wisdom crowd deliberation. complex decision require investment time, period deliberation. this need understand complex problem, consider different angles, test different solutions. solve complex problem general call instinctive, “fast thinking” type describe daniel kahneman famous book, think fast slow.30 it instead call “slow thinking”, system 2 rather system 1 thinking. time also important harvest benefit interaction within diverse group. it take time group explore test ideas, winnow winner filter losers. it take time people change minds. a diversity, decrease return deliberation time. research suggest spend little 1 hour complex problem improve performance 10%.31 these benefit likely small move 100 101 hour spend problem. while diversity deliberation cornerstone wisdom crowds, clear crowd always everywhere wise. i rarely much wise parentage football referee listen collective chant crowd. this observation new one; long historical pedigree. in 1841, charles mackay publish now-famous book whose title stand stark contrast surowiecki’s – popular delusion madness crowds.32 many subsequent author provide example collective irrationality crowd decision-making. it cause also extensively study psychologists, sociologist economists.33 this originate contagious spread opinion networks. the large connect network, le well-informed participants, great chance irrational epidemic spreading. the behaviour underpin group psychology old humankind. the desire conform group type root hunter-gatherer past. it found, time again, study human 29 page (2008) hong page (2004). 30 kahneman (2012). 31 tetlock gardner (2015). 32 mackay (1841). 33 for example, janis (1972), turner pratkanis (1998) all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 13 13 behaviour south sea bubble dotcom bubble, bay pig space shuttle disasters.34 this collective irrationality sometimes go name “groupthink”. more recently, psychological root may feed water technological advances, social media. this increase digital connectivity. for reason set earlier, probably also increase chance self-reinforcing self-referential wave collective irrationality take hold.35 if so, wave collective irrationality could become large ever. while vestige hunter-gatherer past, madness crowd day spread global village. that leaf u conundrum. if decision-makers complex environment draw wide set non-expert opinion, likely encounter? be case harness wisdom crowd avoid madness? will great public engagement help inform improve expert decision-making widen pool live experience? or hind decision-making pollute information pool irrational irrelevant opinions? perhaps comprehensive study value expert non-expert opinion, apply complex decision-making social sciences, provide political scientist philip tetlock. over 20-year period, research forecast accuracy and, recently, run the good judgement project. this explore performance set expert non-experts forecast outcome particularly complex set decision problems. so tetlock’s evidence suggest? that usefulness non-expert opinion complex decision set depend exactly information draw draw on. from tetlock’s book dan gardner 2015, super-forecasting, i would highlight two key findings. these chime evidence outline early cost benefit expert non-expert opinion collective decision-making. first, real value non-expert opinion come complex forecast tasks. in famous example, tetlock convene group 1,000 amateur forecaster enter prestigious forecast tournament run u intelligence agency (iarpa).36 this team beat control group 60% year 1 78% year 2. it beat expert academic mit colombia, professional u intelligence service access classify information. this tetlock call super-forecasting. the incremental value non-expert judgement show wide array set wide range complex problems. what judgment complex dynamic economic financial system? while structure experiment draw, illustrative evidence relative forecast performance different groups. 34 for example, roubini mihm (2011) janis (1972). 35 shafik (2017) discus impact rise social media. 36 tetlock gardner (2015). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 14 14 chart 3 consider forecast error five group – three “expert” (mpc, panel professional forecaster financial markets) two “non-expert” (companies households). for group consider forecast uk inflation 1, 2 3 year ahead. the sample period relatively short conclusion need cautious. and forecast accuracy policy acumen. nonetheless, chart 3 suggest that, complex forecast task, little choose expert non-experts.37 tetlock’s second key point, qualify first, everyone super-forecaster. a randomly-chosen panel non-experts cannot expect outperform experts. chart 3 demonstrate that. super-forecasting simply law large numbers. tetlock show non-expert super-forecasters particular characteristics, include inquisitiveness independence mind. only characteristic consistently outperform experts. we clean test hypothesis inflation forecasts. but imagine bank able identify advance one “super-forecaster” among pool outside forecasters. how much would improve forecast sample period? the gap two year-ahead forecast error mpc best external forecaster panel outside forecaster around ¼ percentage point. 20/20 hindsight wonderful thing, give measure scope forecast improvement.38 if take tetlock’s point together, suggest real value seek view non-experts help inform difficult decisions. but limit benefits. it unrealistic expect everyone become super-forecaster. for central bank message that, widen information net, could stand benefit wisdom crowds. but limit far would wish widen net crowd add signal rather noise. to illustrate point, consider follow thought-experiment. imagine endowment time – 10,000 hour – make inform decision possible complex question. i choose 10,000 hour randomly. in book outliers, malcolm gladwell argues, base detail set case studies, take around 10,000 hour one person command true expertise subject area. now let’s choose complex, topical, question: artificial intelligence (ai) cause mass unemployment? it well-known view expert (and non-experts) differ widely complex question outcome uncertain. the problem need solve simple one: many people choose help inform view impact ai unemployment? 37 the condition assumption (such assume path interest rates) purpose forecast vary central bank forecasters. 38 mankodi pike (2018) discus whether central banker become superforecasters. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 15 15 one possible answer question one person. with gladwell’s 10,000 hour belt, person would well-informed impact ai unemployment anyone planet – true expert, perhaps even phenomenon. this single person or, like, oracle (in ancient greek sense word) solution decision problem. but optimal one? there reason doubt. evidence clearly suggest that, complex decision environment, draw non-expert opinion provide add insight. it offer diversity perspective, whose benefit amplify diverse perspective discuss debate arrive collective conclusions. this surowiecki’s “wisdom crowds” work. so let’s go end spectrum draw instead insight big crowd – say, 1 million people, roughly adult population estonia. this would then, effect, estonian referendum ai unemployment. clearly, would draw vast array expert non-expert opinion. but would come expense le time deliberation. give time quota, person would around 30 second give answer. face tight time constraint complex question, people would struggle. i certainly would. the best non-expert could probably provide instinctive, “fast thinking” response. or, perhaps likely still, might jump aboard collective, potentially poorly-informed, bandwagon copy others say. this would increase greatly chance mackay’s “madness crowds”. finally, let’s try interior solution – say 1,000 people spend 10 hours. this large enough number gather benefit diversity, small enough harvest benefit deliberation. it would blend expert non-expert opinion way would allow collective deliberation. this “wisdom crowds” solution. figure 2 plot relationship insight number people provide information group, stylise terms. you might call “insight curve”. the curve (shown dot lines)

expert non-experts, reap benefit diversity think action. but large pool large dilute time available slow-thinking deliberation. it cocktail expert non-expert opinion, comprise diversity deliberation equal measure, cause good idea flourish bad one perish. a relevant, practical question optimal point along insight curve lies. what optimal number people seek view maximise benefit folk wisdom? my stylise example cannot provide answer question. but study look question use experimental method and, reach interest conclusions. christian wagner tom vinaimont ask two questions.39 first, large group non-experts need exhibit expert-like performance? second, large group need outperform consistently group experts? on assumption experts’ view ten time precise non-expert, answer first question around 30 second around 1,000. this bookend range non-expert view might need seek “wisdom crowds”. representative decision-making if take analysis face value, question practically central bank engage wider, non-expert, audience help inform view economy financial system? what new infrastructure architecture need collect assimilate views? and ensure balance diversity deliberation representative general public’s views? these deep questions, new ones. they debate philosopher political scientist thousand years. alternative model representative decision-making try test throughout course history. this experience contain useful lesson central banks, public institutions, seek strengthen infrastructure link wide society. let’s start beginning. the birthplace democracy is, many, ancient greece. around 2,500 year ago, city-state athens pioneer particular form representative decision-making come judgement complex, societally-significant, issue day. the centrepiece decision-making infrastructure public body – council five hundred, boule. the boule comprise individual draw general public random selection (or sortition). they serve year. the purpose boule debate key issue affect public life devise policy proposals. these take public assembly discussion, wide set general 39 wagner vinaimont (2010). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 17 17 public participated, often run thousands. for small number position require specialist skills, public official expert elect appointed. the athenian boule democratic embroidery, like modern-day focus group. it real power. it decide proposal take public assembly lawful. brett hennig call “nerve centre power” ancient athens.40 the boule wide public acceptance attendance. participation public life, boule public assembly, accept part athenians’ civic responsibilities. those take part term idiotes, modern word idiot derives. the infrastructure far perfect; boule exclude women, slave non-citizens. but notable seek strike balance two feature subsequent research show crucial effective, representative decision-making complex environments: diversity deliberation. indeed, reason call athenian model decision-making deliberative democracy.41 diversity decision-making achieve call rotating, randomly-selected pool non-expert citizens, augment expert limit number positions. deliberation decision-making achieve restrict number representatives, convene discus regularly agree set proposals. the council five hundred sit slap bang middle optimal range people suggest wagner vinaimont. the greek empire course last. nor model deliberative democracy decision-making. in period since, two alternative model representative decision-making rise prominence. interestingly, seek strike rather different balance diversity deliberation, relative athenian model especially relative other. one executive democracy. under model, elect appoint set representative take decision society’s behalf, often parliament congress. this model underpin modern democracy great many countries; grow popularity much past 200 years. such success, many people day would define democracy term model. for history, case. aristotle alone see executive democratic model “elected oligarchy”.42 at time many executive democracy put place, found father (they still men) often deeply suspicious athenian-style democracy. john adams, second president unite states, capture thus: “remember democracy never last long. it soon wastes, exhaust murder itself”.43 the greek empire last 350 year exhaust itself. 40 hennig (2017), van reybrouck (2016). 41 gruen (2018), fiskhin et al (2008). 42 politics, aristotle. 43 from john adam john taylor, 17 december 1814. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 18 18 while adam wrong durability executive democracy, suspicion whether properly represent slice society persisted. indeed, suspicion rise recently. at time steady ascent number country adopt executive democratic model, steady descent public trust representative executive democratic institutions. at heart trust problem concern whether decision-making sufficiently reflective wide society. by large, public accept executive democratic model reasonable vehicle discussion deliberation decision-making. indeed, public watch deliberation tv. but concern among public whether decision-making decision-makers sufficiently diverse, whether properly reflect represent societies’ view needs. this accusation could level alternative model representative decision-making – so-called direct democracy. this put voice vote firmly hand public decision important bear wide society. this model use vary degree across various country various times. in countries, public referendum reserve decision whose societal impact especially large long-lasting. i sure think examples. this model recognise pro cons. it draw much wide range expert non-expert opinion, achieve potentially great degree representativeness diversity alternatives. this breadth, however, make difficult deliberative dialogue participant time consider carefully facts, compete hypothesis possible solutions. this risk collective view le well-informed, potentially polarised, would ideal. with degree discontent executive direct democratic models, recently rekindle interest athenian, deliberative democracy, model. this model, least principle, offer great diversity executive democratic model. it also offer great scope debate deliberation direct democratic model. it third way, fact first. but middle way. it way institutional incarnation “insight curve”. interestingly, number country recent year begin experiment deliberative democratic process debate resolve societies’ complex problems. citizens’ panel jury use tackle vary issue vote reform (in canada), gay right (ireland), reconciliation indigenous non-indigenous community (australia), nuclear power (south korea), membership euro (denmark) environmental pollution (united states).44 here estonia, experience use people’s assembly debate key societal issues. in 2013, people’s assembly (rahvakogu) use debate estonian electoral laws. last year, people’s

use debate regional issues, include water transportation emajõgi river region country. estonia relative hotbed activity deliberative decision-making practice. each experiment use slightly differently approaches. this provide useful case law decide work when. one interest find citizens’ panel effective get people engage issue national regional importance, provide effective forum people change minds, converge opinions, issues. they reduce polarisation. these benefit lie heart deliberative democratic process. a second lesson technology potential game-changer deliberative decision-making. this rely distributed, modular structure. historically, structure size boule place physical constraint scope information-making debate. digital structure loosen constraints, allow long reach great connectivity great speed. some country begin use digital technology support deliberative processes, include estonia. the benefit partly practical, great number people able connect communicate ever previously. the public assembly ancient greece bring together people thousands. today, technology could million people. there also, however, behavioural benefits. the “trust shift” among public mean credibility understand often day build distribute mean direct connections. a digital infrastructure help end meet. it could argue country-level experiment – experiments. the deliberative model try test anger full gamut societal decisions. a put, true. yet least one domain public policy model try test (both literally metaphorically) wide range societal decision many centuries: judicial system. many judicial system draw expert (judges) non-expert (juries) opinion, like athenians. non-experts draw randomly population, athens. there clear process deliberation among participants, boule. this system nerve-centre decision-making define set issues, ancient greece. the english judicial system already last almost 1,000 years, twice long greek empire. the next revolution against backdrop, concrete step might central bank take build improve infrastructure engagement general public? can build others’ experience engage wide society, way improve public’s policymakers’ understand economy? let offer suggestions, motivate recent initiative bank england aim that. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 20 20 (a) mind your language historically, language central bank often pitch level make difficult non-experts understand. this contribute public’s understand trust deficits. slowly surely, begin change. central bank’s external communication reorient towards wider, non-specialist audience. let give couple examples. the first so-called “forward guidance” monetary policy.45 how judge success hinge crucially consider objective audience. if financial market participant whose job price future path interest rates, useful type policy guidance precise time-specific. by contrast, company household consider whether spend, general idea direction destination interest rate likely sufficient. the critic forward guidance tend financial market participant lack sufficient precision time-specificity. but forward guidance simply cannot precise; depend path economy. and price interest rate financial market main purpose forward guidance first place. it purpose support spend economy household companies. that call short simple guidance, focus broad direction destination interest rates. the mpc first use word “limited gradual” 2014 describe likely future course interest rate rises. it short simple – three little words. it guidance aim squarely household companies, offer indication (but promise) broad direction destination interest rates. survey suggest message understand majority company households.46 by allay fear too-rapid rise rates, likely encourage spend support economy. when mpc come raise interest rates, november 2017 august 2018, interest see well understand company households. around three-quarters households, around 90% companies, expect rise rate within year ahead survey hold immediately prior decisions. simple, directional forward guidance monetary policy appears, non-expert audience comprise spend economy, effective. a second monetary policy example come bank’s quarterly inflation report. this first produce 25 year ago, part first wave transparency revolution. it long technical document, language require least 13-14 year education understand.47 the complexity language mean report probably accessible around 10% population. 45 bank england (2013) provide useful summary concept issue relate forward guidance; see carney (2018) recent discussion. 46 carney (2018). 47 haldane (2017a). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 21 21 in november 2017, bank begin publish two simpler, “layered” version report. layer 1 single sentence/single graphic version, pitch level accessible around two-thirds population. layer 2 single page/simple graphic version, accessible 40%. measure web hit downloads, layer communication appear broaden notably reach mpc’s monetary policy messages, particular among non-expert audience. a couple recent research study use experimental method look closely impact bank’s simple communication public understand trust.48 for example, randomise control trial 2,000 member general public, recent study find use visual summary increase public’s understand inflation report’s message around 25%. this substantial gain public understand fairly modest change format. this study went, however, one step ask whether improvement understand possible. the format consider personalise language, make relatable people’s everyday life – example, great use first second person (us/you), great use commonly-used word (“rising prices” rather “inflation”) engaging, interactive graphics. do increase gain public understand 40%. there limit simplification, personalisation visualisation achieve. the study assess change format affect general public’s trust bank england’s policies. these gain modest. perhaps come surprise. understand necessary sufficient condition trust-building. and trust tend earn slowly repeat experience. nonetheless, study point important role simpler, personalise communication low twin deficits. there probably agenda run. for example, reason principle method could apply central bank publications, cover financial system banknotes. the bank already make stride direction financial stability report knowledge bank, aim improve public understand economy finance. look ahead, view great personalisation central bank communication hold promise. central bank often affect people’s life way lag indirect hence difficult observe. early year, i construct “personalised” scorecards, set impact bank’s monetary policy ease action global financial crisis income, wealth well-being citizen across uk.49 this recognise impact monetary policy people’s life often quite different depend personal circumstance – old versus young, borrower versus saver, home-owner versus renter, north 48 haldane mcmahon (2018) bholat et al (2018). 49 haldane (2018a). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 22 22 versus south. cast impact monetary policy term average aggregate tend resonate people’s personal experience. spell benefit personalise term potentially increase understand awareness central banks’ actions. there already precedent another arm uk policymaking – tax policy. taxpayer uk receive personal scorecard, tell tax payment fund spend various public good macro-economic level. this personalisation find improve public’s understand acceptance tax policies.50 (b) public education a second way improve public understand improve public education. many central bank make effort direction number years, include school visits, school competition school materials, include bank england bank estonia. that yet appear satiate demand pupil parents, almost 80% say think economics form part curriculum.51 in part response, early year bank england launch new education strategy. there number elements. one new set school competitions, aim reach broad range students. a second school ambassador programme, bank official give 200 talk school across uk year. we schedule hit target. the ambitious part education strategy develop classroom material economy financial system use school part curriculum pupil age 11-16. these go name econome. a name suggests, like recent public communication efforts, material describe economy finance term personal relatable young people’s lives. why economy finance matter me? and decision turn affect economy? we set target reach 400 state school econome course year. so far since launch april, 1,000 school download materials, conceivably cover around 90,000 pupils.52 this demonstrate potential pent-up demand school material economic financial issues. the bank’s aim reach close 1,500 school mid-2020. we currently consider next take education initiatives. a promise avenue would young age range, say 7-11 year olds. this require different material possibly different approach. a challenge market still would adults, perhaps link exist initiative boost 50 haldane

www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 23 23 economic financial literacy public large. the scale public understand deficit mean central bank effort part solution but, public institutions, important part. (c) a distribute architecture central bank historically tend be, well, centralised. but world understand economy often localise trust build distribute basis, centralise infrastructure may far ideal. what need instead distribute architecture engagement. in response, central bank time change structure change seem likely. the bank england network agent around uk around 90 years. today, bank’s twelve regional agency cover corner uk, extensive network generate around 9,000 meet company contact year. this valuable source intelligence economy financial system. indeed, i would say increasingly valuable. it provide colour context accompany data models. it offer folk wisdom, wisdom company crowd. but company one crowd among many. company important lens economy, far one. reflect that, bank recently seek strong connection crowds, crowd different lens economy perhaps le contact historically – trade unions, charities, community organisation like. for year, i augment agents’ effort “townhall” meet across uk.53 by design, seek view wide range citizens, wide range location wide range issue around economy financial system case past. these event establish wisdom crowd gauge key issue shape economy financial system. the live experience everyday people make everyday decision make economy tick (and sometimes tock). tap live experience add bank’s understand economy help set policy keep economy stable. there wisdom crowd citizens, crowd companies.54 the bank take step towards put place infrastructure formalise engagement citizens. early year, response recommendation rsa, announce bank would setting-up set citizens’ panel across uk.55 in remainder year, run trial citizen panel help u decide best organise them, roll systematically, uk-wide, next year. 53 see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/outreach 54 taylor (2018) also discus benefit deliberative democracy rsa’s 2018 annual lecture. 55 haldane (2018b). all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 24 24 there number key design question need answered. how ensure wide, diverse representative set citizen possible? how engage citizen might understand trust bank? how much time need set aside enable deliberative process fruitful? and many people engage get balance right diversity deliberation? we work range partners, include rsa, come answers. the plan would set one citizen panel bank’s 12 regional agencies. with roughly 25 citizen per panel, would give u non-expert panel around 300 people. this edge towards mid-point wagner/vinaimont range shy athenian boule. by use digital technology, would aim connect citizen panel allow national, well regional, deliberation. this deliberative democracy practice. a judicial system, involve blend expert non-experts. a jury judges, structure process deliberation. a legal system, role non-experts (citizen panels) help establish fact expert (mpc) set policy. what’s good enough decision incarceration good enough decision inflation. conclusion central banks, like public institutions, create public serve public. despite communication revolution, public understand central bank remain low public trust central bank fallen. improve call second revolution, focus educate learn general public. the age innocence may over, era engagement begun. this new era may mean 21st century central bank become disburse personalise communications, create new infrastructure interact public extract folk wisdom. thomas jefferson say democracy something learn doing. the true central banking. for bank estonia

allocate across subsidiary cross-bordergroups. bank require comply capital requirement standalone basis andwaivers apply domestic bank groups.similarly, free movement liquidity across border make possible cross-borderwaivers, practical application waiver hamper remain nationalprerogatives regulatory framework allow national authority apply large exposurelimits intragroup lend ring-fence

remark mr vitas vasiliauskas, governor bank lithuania, economicsconference bank lithuania, vilnius, 17 september 2018.* * *dear colleagues, like-minded guest potential opponents,thank join u second economics conference bank lithuania. we aredelighted here.when decide organise annual conferences, set ambitious goal:what seek original insight interest discussion (although i make secretof fact hop these, too), also tangible results. it would surprise me,then, new even unexpected idea emerge sessions. at time, aimto ass experience test real-life conditions. in short, seek concrete conclusion andproposals resolve press economic problems.it urgent need dictate choice topics. accordingly, last year’s conferencefocused issue income inequality. follow thorough discussion analysis, weconcluded inequality income and, consequently, opportunities, stem largely ourtax pension systems. we agree system require immediate radicaloverhaul. thus, today’s topic – lithuanian pension system – natural continuation thatimportant discussion.since ice last broken, however, approach crucial issue newangle. the government undertake reform pension system which, sooner later, inone way another, affect everything everyone: everyday life well national publicfinances macroeconomic stability. such all-encompassing topic warrant particularattention public institutions, public media. the bank lithuania take activepart – actively involve future – expert discussions, commensurate howit perceive institutional duty.in short, situation summarise follows: step right direction made.however, step.the work far complete since, first, important design solution also toimplement qualitatively.and, second, already clear even faultlessly follow beeninitiated, element lithuanian pension system still need improved. inparticular, i mind need increase transparency first pillar tostrengthen people’s confidence it. these issue become increasingly important thefuture. they address – sooner, better.thus, today, i suggest set gaze slightly beyond visible horizon. in words, ipropose today’s discussions, consider future pension system theperspective several decade rather simply several years.let’s take moment, however, notice start position: status quo lithuanianpension system envisage developments. let’s briefly review bank lithuania’sassessment several key proposal might help u take step directionoutlined reform. 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech colleagues,we face two major problems: poor benefit prospect even poor pension thefuture.about present. the average old-age pension close poverty line. speak aboutresidents receive sodra pension, average replacement rate, is, ratio betweenpre-retirement labour income pension, 35 per cent, whereas eu averagecomes close 50 per cent. approximately one four senior citizen lithuania expose tothe risk poverty – accord european commission, rank thebottom three eu countries. we find – third low – position quite often, andwe even start come term it. however, another important indicator – theratio pension expenditure per pensioner gdp per capita. regrettably, indicatorranks u even low position.about future. the international monetary fund estimate that, reform systemundertaken, average replacement rate resident independently save forretirement would decrease reach 20 per cent come decades. thismeans that, absence change, couple decade pension – calculate thepresent monetary value – almost one-quarter small now.nowadays, number reason poor old-age benefits. one low level ofredistribution state budget. last year, amount tax revenue lithuania wasbelow 30 per cent gdp, eu average almost 40 per cent. by comparison, hadwe collect amount tax revenue least equivalent eu average, budgetaryinflows would 2 billion euro higher. be lot little? that almost asmuch amount total pension expenditure year.the level redistribution (and thus budget availability) primarily issue equity andefficiency tax policy. nevertheless, even effective change taxation wereimplemented, would enough long term. this becausealongside redistribution problem another adverse factor, namely, highly complicateddemographic situation. this lead worsen ratio working-age retirement-agepopulation, imply heavy burden public finances.against background, become crucial create right condition incentive forincome-generating resident start accumulate financial reserve old age. tothe best knowledge, however, far 800 thousand person – half theworking population – rely minimum accumulation refrain acummulatingaltogether. i want sound dramatic, but… situation cannot call anythingother tick time bomb.our honourable speaker shortly present broad picture – practice countriesand regions. we likely see challenge unique: advance economieshave faced, currently facing, similar problems. and although specific nationalcharacteristics thus seek suitable solution national context, highlyregarded model share certain features. first all, one find focus long-term sustainability.second, one note transparency and, consequently, high level confidence among thepopulation. these feature contribute achievement core objective, namely, ensuremore even consumption, is, level income, throughout human life cycle.the pension system close neighbours, nordic countries, consider among thebest-rated world characterise features. i therefore please thatwe soon opportunity hear professor edward palmer’s presentation theswedish experience reform pension system shift towards notional definedcontribution-based model. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech colleagues,when analyse good practice foreign countries, note that, addition theaforementioned similarities, one thing common: none pension systemsin people today confidence create single sweep. quite contrary, theywere develop protract process call consistency patience.the lithuanian pension system, too, time path review andtransformation, great small scale. and even though one might argue themeaning certain “reconstructions”, particular consistency completeness, ibelieve recent decision may create condition favourable change.first, system gain integrity. have change structure contribution second-pillar pension fund (ceasing transfer state social insurance contributions), reasonfor artificial confrontation first second pillars.the second advantage likelihood people enrol second-pillar pension funds.this would mean people would good prepare loss labour income thefuture. at national level, would contribute sustainability pension system andhelp mitigate future demographic shock await us.the third point particular importance u safe efficient saving. the bank oflithuania find that, present, almost two-thirds person participate secondpillar save fund risk profile inappropriate age. this inadequacy majorobstacle efficient use opportunity financial market offer, prevent theaccumulation maximum possible reserve future, optimum level riskassumed. the decision introduce so-called life-cycle pension fund lithuania is, therefore,truly welcome. this would help end practice “one size fit all” (which really fitanybody), investment risk asset accumulate correlate certain stage inthe accumulator’s life, i.e. specific age.finally, maintenance cost system. centralise administration annuity sodra, anon-profit institution, would reduce cost. on hand, limit maximum alloweddeductions private pension fund would help resident accumulate old age.will propose change enough ensure long-term sustainability lithuanianpension system good tailor need population?certainly yes. and, time, certainly no. if idea put practice asenvisaged, reform model may well become attractive robustthan present system. however, seek align international leaders, must takecare get stick design far.having say that, i hasten assure everyone believe stability great virtue ofthe pension system. still, lithuanian pension system require three improvements.the first one ensure close definitely obvious connection betweencontributions benefits. this essential condition achieve pension-systemfairness strengthen incentive resident pay contributions.the second aim great transparency. have strengthen connection betweencontributions benefits, first pension pillar shift towards model base onindividual account (notional define contribution model) – like one currently operation insweden, norway, poland european countries.such system, ideally operate real time, would clearly show correlation one’s 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech social insurance contribution level future pension. a virtual individualaccount would demonstrate unaccounted income reduce accumulative pension thefirst pillar, thus encourage payment contributions.the third direction concern information education. clear communication old-agesaving system one reliable mean manage risk short-sighted choices.and – let’s face – threat if, entry force approve change ofthe pension system, people decide opt slightly high income today, rather thefuture.currently, three miss piece puzzle lithuanian pension system.colleagues,i wish prophet doom, risk face lithuanian pension system veryreal. unless accomplish urgent work, soon face – round corner,then around another couple turns.in order create truly sustainable – i insist sustainable long run – pension systemin lithuanian trust, must strive consensus, consistency anddetermination steps. today, opportunity talk issue boldly,openly good faith.i wish fruitful discussion valuable insights, may contribute future policydecisions.thank you. 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech i grateful clare macallan jennifer nemeth assistance prepare remarks. i would also like thank will abel, andy haldane, carsten jung, rana

switch immigration. the catalyst transformation open foreign trade investment. begin 1958 report economic development, whitaker strongly advocate replace old strategy self-sufficiency new one export-led growth, lead time ireland join eu. for many, great long-term consequence work. but student economic history know (and policymakers learn cost), without right institutions, structural change – whether large change trade relationship technological revolution – painful. whitaker recognise “readiness adapt change condition sine qua non economic success”1 adaptability require series change ireland’s institutions. major reform education essential match skill irish workforce potential job increase inward investment could bring. a 1964 report manpower policy, whitaker oversee chair, advocate great investment stem subjects, ready generation it revolution.2 more broadly, ireland repeatedly increase standard education, begin introduction universal secondary school 1967, result level

revolution, begin latter half 18th century, felt fully productivity wage second half 19th.7 indeed, start 19th century uk, despite sharp pickup productivity, wage growth stall labour share fell – period dub “engels’ pause”. a framework examine technical change labour market to understand dynamic help common conceptual framework.8 the impact technological change employment wage depict sum three major effects: destruction, productivity creation. the destruction effect focus alarmist accounts: replacement labour technology, associate reduction labour demand, wage employment. le commonly acknowledge positive effect aggregate demand new technologies, term productivity effect. this effect analogous classic say’s law supply create demand. technology make work productive, time boost wage increase return capital. this great income boost aggregate demand lean destruction effect. when technological change disruptive widespread, productivity effect generally insufficient counteract completely destruction effect, partly time take full potential new technology realised, partly phenomenon great job polarisation – i turn moment. a consequence, medium term, technological change tend reduce labour’s share income. historically, however, technological progress lead permanent decline labour share third effect – creation new task labour.9 when combine productivity effect, ultimately counterbalance displacement effect technology, boost productivity wage leave employment unaffected. 7 partly lag reorganise enough economy advantage new general purpose technology aggregate productivity growth increase. 8 the follow base acemoglu, d restrepo, p (2018), ‘artificial intelligence, automation work’, nber work paper no. 24196. 9 this creation effect need fully exogenous

speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 5 5 could time different? the fourth industrial revolution could differ three predecessor term scope, scale speed. scope thus far, wave technological change increase importance cognitive task relative non-cognitive ones. in words, machine largely substitute human hand heads. worker able improve skill take newly create set cognitive, high value task – task beyond cognitive limit machines. rapid improvement compute power, increase availability big data advance artificial intelligence machine learn mean smart machine already replace broad range human activity before, reach well range “heads”. new technology may increasingly provide intelligence, sensory perception, reason previously labour could provide. technological optimists10 believe future automation move beyond substitute ‘routine-manual’ human task technology perform late 20th century almost entire spectrum work.11 it may leave people provide “hearts” – is, task require emotional intelligence, originality social skill persuasion care others. and new form bespeak mass creativity make possible new global economy, human “hands” may take (a form cottage industry go full circle).12 one thing could different effect demographics. an age population lead great demand care straight decrease labour supply.13 scale the great scope fourth industrial revolution could mean scale large too. unlike previous episodes, job risk automation likely lie across entire spectrum wages.14 at one extreme, frey osborne (2017)15 estimate around half u employment ‘high risk’16 automation, unspecified period time. 10 for example, brynjolfsson, e mcafee, a (2014), ‘the second machine age: work, progress, prosperity time brilliant technologies’. the extreme view put forward daniel susskind, highlight possibility future machine perform task lead technological unemployment (susskind, d (2017), ‘a model technological unemployment’, university oxford, department economics series work papers, no. 819). 11 the question heart debate whether overcome ‘polanyi’s paradox’ - “we know tell” (polanyi 1966). our inability detail task (such social interactions) formulaic manner currently make difficult encode automate. 12 mckinsey (2017) also suggest demand creative social skill increase. 13 i grateful colleague silvana tenreyro suggest point. 14 brynjolfsson, e, mitchell, t rock,d (2018), ‘what can machine learn what doe it mean occupation economy’, aea paper proceedings, vol. 108, pp. 43-47. 15 frey, c b osborne, m (2017), ‘the future employment: how susceptible job computerisation?’, technological forecast social change, vol. 114, pp. 254-280. 16 define role 70% chance automation. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 6 6 however, estimate take account heterogeneity task within jobs, focus instead key task within occupation. each job usually component cannot automated, even many central component be. indeed, evidence increasingly suggest large part many job subject automation, relatively job completely automated.17 felten, raj seaman (2017)18 show recent advance technology use predict future change task structure occupations, lend support argument technological advancement likely change nature many job rather eliminate completely. the extreme estimate often base purely technical feasibility automation limit consideration economic feasibility. for example, may possible automate pour drink bars, may present cost save hire bar staff job let alone ancillary benefit able tell troubles. take additional consideration account reduce share job high risk automation 10% uk 15% ireland.19 that appear comparable three previous episode technological revolution, saw share aggregate employment account expose industry fall 10 20% long periods. some argue great scope scale task (as oppose jobs) risk replacement technology mean new job creation might long increase overall employment. that is, destruction effect may outweigh combine impact productivity creation effects. at time, range task risk could substantially increase impact inequality several reasons. most fundamentally, new technology substitute labour rather complement it, gain would accrue capital rather labour. an unequal distribution capital mean increase automation push inequality construction. in transition, economist euphemistically call friction lead depress local national labour markets, boost inequality.20 and education unable keep pace change demand skills, already skill use new technology earn even high premiums.21 job polarisation increase supply labour compete low skilled jobs.22 great global interconnectedness reinforce dynamics. 17 for example, mckinsey global institute (2017), ‘a future works: automation, employment productivity’ suggest 60% occupation could see 30% task replace technology, base o*net analysis. 18 felten, e w, raj, m seamans, r (2018), ‘a method link advance artificial intelligence occupational abilities, aea paper proceedings, vol. 108, pp. 54-57. 19 nedelkoska, l quintini, g (2018), ‘automation, skill use training’, oecd social, employment migration work paper no. 202. similarly, mckinsey argue across advance economy 15% workforce total need shift occupational category digitisation, automation, ai. 20 this process well document china shock u (autor, dorn hanson 2015) collapse local house market (mian sufi 2015). 21 if understand technology le well le will trust work it, could increase polarise effects. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 7 7 speed could fourth industrial revolution happen faster? certainly, time take new technology adopt shorten dramatically since dawn first industrial revolution. the story thus far current empirical work suggest balance that, thus far, increase automation positive employment aggregate even though lead substantial compositional changes. importantly, technology reduce middle-skilled employment, effect aggregate employment appear offset increase product demand local demand spillovers. after all, employment share uk near all-time highs. there are, however, sign recent technological advance increase inequality. globally, labour see share income fall past twenty year imf (2017) find technological progress 3rd industrial revolution big contributor decline. the uk ireland23 outliers: countries, labour share flat, income inequality stable – high – since late 1980s.24 moreover, strong evidence advance economy labour market polarise since 1980s – structural shift generally attribute technological displacement mid-skilled job result early stage automation digitisation tasks. employment growth strong high low skilled end job spectrum, result hollow mid-skilled employment. the polarisation labour market also evident return skilled labour, earn growth high level education far outstrip le schooling. so summary thus far, fourth industrial revolution similar past technological revolutions, overall effect eventually labour augment – boost productivity wages, create new job maintain even increase overall employment. but long run. in interim, similar previous industrial revolutions, seem likely period technological unemployment, dislocation rise inequality. give could happen rapidly, challenge workforce adjustment could difficult. the shift require employment job involve head heart hand could far great year see previous episodes. moreover, unlike previous industrial revolutions, rapid pace adjustment long work life mean worker may option retiring. this 22 analysis imf indicate extent job polarisation depend far ease substitution labour technology relative price technology. 23 calculate labour share use gross national income remove distortion stem multinational corporation account

set monetary policy influence structural change work fourth industrial revolution, include labour market, impact price dynamic equilibrium rate interest. to clear, structural change real nature, monetary policy cannot prevent them, would unwise attempt accelerate them. for example, run economy hot unlikely effective increase rate worker displace technology find new role address underlie frictions, particularly lack suitable skills. however, structural change take effect, likely affect balance supply demand, monetary policy need respond accordingly. in long run, fourth industrial revolution substantially boost productivity supply. base past experience, productivity role experience high level automation could expand rate excess 5% per year, aggregate productivity growth could increase much ½ 1½ percentage point per year.33 the increase supply automation fourth industrial revolution should, time, lead high demand flow high incomes. with job destruction run ahead productivity creation effect short term, however, demand likely weak period. 32 for details, see ‘new economy, new finance, new bank’, speech mark carney mansion house, june 2018. 33 the low estimate base productivity gain realise introduction steam power, upper estimate base improvement harness ict revolution. see crafts, n (2015), ‘economic growth: onwards upwards?’, oxford review economic policy, vol. 31, pp. 217-241 all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 11 11 a chair powell recently remind us, challenge monetary policy period structural change take account potential impact underlie dynamic economy. that why, uk, monetary policy committee periodically take stock development update estimate key variable equilibrium rate interest unemployment.34 the mpc provide assessment equilibrium rate interest – interest rate sustain inflation target output potential – august inflation report. the equilibrium interest rate provide way think force act economy, whether policy stimulative contractionary. it affect shorter-term influences, headwind demand, slow-moving structural factor affect balance demand capital stock wealth available finance it. for open economy like uk ireland, factor heavily influence global developments. a mpc note time, increase automation could push equilibrium interest rate down. on one hand, increase productivity result could increase businesses’ demand capital, push equilibrium interest rate period – permanently automation raise productivity growth.35 on hand, however, increase inequality would likely shift income low propensity consume,36 increase stock save push equilibrium rate down.37 monetary policy maker must also take account potential structural change labour market price dynamic result fourth industrial revolution might affect evolution inflationary pressures. these consideration illustrate use phillips curve diagram. until productivity creativity effect catch displacement effect, increase automation impart disinflationary pressure reduction businesses’ demand labour relative supply. even transition happen relatively quickly smoothly historic standard – take 30 year relatively quick rate new job find among displace technology – total hour work could 2 per cent low throughout, equivalent 2 percentage point increase unemployment rate 5 percentage point rise underemployment rate.38 34 the fourth industrial revolution could also affect transmission monetary policy effect financial sector. for example, advance technology data availability could lead great competition financial sector, potentially strengthen pass-through change monetary policy interest rate face household companies. 35 if automation increase level, growth rate, productivity, raise capital relative output temporarily. this effect reinforce increase capital-output ratio job destruction phase, labour displace automation. however, upward pressure equilibrium interest rate lessen creation effect take hold. 36 the experience past episode suggest that, first instance, return fourth industrial revolution likely flow owner new capital worker use – lead engels’ pause real wages. owner capital tend wealthy begin evidence suggest high wealth high propensity save increase income (this idea go back kalecki (1954) marx him). increase job polarisation skill premia, also shift income towards top distribution, likely add effect. globally, inequality could also increase result fourth industrial revolution, would low equilibrium rate open economy like uk ireland. 37 summer (2016) argue rise market concentration may also important cause fall equilibrium interest rate recent decades. see http://larrysummers.com/2016/03/30/corporate-profits-are-near-record-highs-heres-why-thats-a-problem/. 38 measure proportion people work part-time would prefer full-time job. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches 12 12 this excess supply labour available work non-automated task represent shift along phillips curve, impart modest disinflationary pressures. for uk, additional percentage point labour market slack estimate reduce annual wage growth one third percentage point. however, mismatch skill current workforce require new technology substantial friction worker change role could cause equilibrium unemployment rate rise alongside increase unemployment – particularly speed adoption new technology fast past. that would shift phillips curve up, reduce disinflationary effect automation. at present, little evidence go judge likely size persistence increase structural unemployment. monetary policy maker need remain alert possibility, update assessment transition occurs. the experience 1970s show mistakenly ascribe structural pickup unemployment cyclical factor lead wrong macroeconomic policy setting, long-lasting adverse effects. a automate world could also affect inflationary pressure flatten phillips curve. the threat robot substitute could weaken workers’ bargain power. and advance artificial intelligence similar technology could increase companies’ ability learn competitors’ marginal cost lead great synchronisation price change across companies. already, evidence online retailer adjust price frequently high street, le likely vary price location.39 conclusion while fourth industrial revolution potential transform economy, challenge present monetary policy maker many way new. in recent years, mpc increasingly focus structural change economy, include institute regular review publish assessment important variables, equilibrium unemployment rate. over period, unemployment fall towards estimate equilibrium rate company find hard recruit retain staff, pay growth pick up. across economy whole, growth average wage exclude bonus rise around 1¾% year 2010-15 around 2½% 2016, wage growth expect pick little around 2¾% around middle year. the recent outturn support judgement, whole economy total pay increase 2.9% three month july private sector regular pay 3% period, domestically generate inflation rate consistent 2% inflation target. 39 cavallo, a (2018), ‘more amazon effects: online competition price behaviors’, paper prepare 2018

weakness productivity growth. while weakness may reflect early consequence fourth industrial revolution, factor seem likely play. in year follow global financial crisis, aftereffect shock subsequent euro-area crisis exert drag business investment. more recently, uncertainty around brexit additional dampen effect. a case time, development regard unite kingdom’s withdrawal european union significant influence economic outlook. and impact fourth industrial revolution may felt come decades, brexit effect supply may much immediate. the bank england well-prepared whatever path economy takes, include wide range potential brexit outcomes. we use stress test ensure large uk bank continue meet need uk household business even disorderly brexit, however unlikely may be. our job, all, hope best plan worst. the mpc respond persistent change outlook bring inflation sustainably back 2% target support job activity. the appropriate policy response automatic depend balance effect demand,

thedeutsche bundesbank annual meet german economic association (verein fürsocialpolitik), freiburg im breisgau, 3 september 2018.* * *1 welcomeladies gentlemen,on behalf deutsche bundesbank, i would like welcome reception thekonzerthaus freiburg.it give great pleasure today. but i particularly please allhere. by i mean physically person virtually. at bundesbank, also thefields research education, i’m sure, event like increasingly shift realworld virtual world. presentation stream live internet, andconversations take place via chat. this eliminate costly time-consuming travel.but despite technological advances, buffets, refreshment social gather cannotbe transmit digitally, yet anyway. and us, real life usually enjoyableoption. it would shame forego pleasure evening.but digital technology become ubiquitous. they major influence welive work. most room carry triumph development today:the mobile phone.you could, however, argue make phone call whilst move particularlyrevolutionary. a early 1958, first analogue mobile telecommunication network set upin germany. to begin with, however, bulky telephone device weigh impressive 36kilos, find cars. it possible make call whilst actuallydriving, telephone consume enormous amount electricity. a battery capableof last several hour even day completely unimaginable.over time, device become small lighter, first “mobile phones” come onto themarket early 1980s. but despite technological advances, analogue telephonesare still essentially always been: device make phone calls.it course digitalisation mobile phone transform mini-computers thus clever all-round could long without everydaylife. today, smartphones also double cameras, navigation systems, game consoles,diaries, address books, pocket calculator much more, one single device.although cannot yet fly moon use mobile phones, smartphones do, however,contain memory chip several hundred thousand time large use thecomputer board apollo 11

one example transformative power digitalisation. let's look theway communicate other, keep inform shop today: 1 / 8bis central bankers' speech much change recent year would easy list actually stay thesame.the increase use digital technology also take company employee new,digital age. these development focus year's conference.from central bank’s perspective, change process raise question overalleconomic implications. in words, digital revolution mean growth,employment price developments? i would like take close look aspect youtoday.2 impact productivity“productivity isn’t everything, long run almost everything.” this quote paulkrugman emphasise fact high standard live long term hinge aneconomy's ability boost productivity. and technological progress throughdigitalisation come play.this initially involve company digital economy, manufacturer oftelecommunications technology, software developer service provider it sector.labour productivity grow much fast sector economy whole.although share company term total value add still rather small ingermany, sector make significant contribution overall economic productivitygrowth: since mid-1990s, average quarter percentage point per year. in othereconomies, sweden, finland industrialise country outside europe, thecontribution significantly higher.digital technology also break industry change product processesthere, too. we notice something astonish since mid-2000s, namely thatproductivity growth weakened.this lead speak new paradox productivity. new, already observeda similar development back 1970s 1980s. “you see computer age everywherebut productivity statistics,” note economist robert solow back then.how paradox explained? apart possible measurement errors, explanatoryapproaches roughly assign two camps:the pessimists, especially bob gordon, generally view digitalisation le transformativethan assumed. digital technology offer le potential major productivity gain previouswaves innovation, driven, example, development steam engine orelectrification.in camp, optimists, erik brynjolfsson, put forward argument time-lagged effects. general-purpose technology particular, robotics artificialintelligence, require additional innovation investment use everyday business life. ittakes time new technology spread, integrate production process takefull effect. accordingly, essential productivity gain yet come, claims.regardless right end, clear company exploit potential thatdigitalisation bring necessary framework condition place. for example, manydigital technology require access fast internet connection.and germany lag behind industrialise country respect. last year, themaximum connection speed germany 65 megabit per second average. in spain it12345 2 / 8bis central bankers' speech le 85 megabits, korea high 120 megabits.in particular, expansion fibre optic network make slow progress ingermany. just two per cent broadband connection base primarily fibre optic linesand thus technology make particularly fast internet connection possible. bycontrast, oecd average 26 per cent.this make important germany forge ahead vigorously expand digitalinfrastructure.3 impact employmentladies gentlemen,one issue worry many people digitalisation transform workplace. self-driving robo-taxis parcel-delivering drone still aren’t feature day-to-day lives. butthere deny digital technology make ever great inroad world werelong think reserve human beings.nowadays, robot help doctor carers; crawl narrow tunnel shaft thatwe don’t to; mow lawn, explore out space oceans. algorithmsmake investment decision fraction second, many sport report day iswritten robo-reporter.as venture era automation, witticism attribute economist warren bennissprings mind, i quote: “the factory future two employees, man adog. the man fee dog. the dog keep man touchingthe equipment.”we haven’t quite reach point yet. but look professions, one wonderwhether still around medium term. the oecd estimate nearly one tenoccupations could automatable next years.that said, there’s one thing shouldn’t lose sight of. history book full occupation thatdon’t exist more. or anyone still know copperplate engraver, rag-and-bone man, cooper wheelwright?so scar lose one’s job resist innovation commonplace early timesof upheaval well. just take protest launch luddite 19th century. to thisday, still find four-liner – internet, course – go like this: “who get theidea steam head? / it cost waggoner daily bread / they truly badway / because damn railway!”while doubt railway cost many coachmen, cartwright wheelwright theirjobs, create brand new type jobs: track layers, train driver guards, name butthree.we run work yet. and digitalisation also forge new professions. social mediamanagers, robotics engineer drone pilot three i could mention here.so could say new technology potentially unleash creative destructiveenergy – much like “creative destruction” coin joseph schumpeter. at present, onecould argue job loss compensate new ones. at time, ashift way employment prospect relative wages.many routine activity probably feel pressure automation particularly intensely. these567 3 / 8bis central bankers' speech area salary may well feel squeeze. then again, activity whichappear benefit automation. take isolation, lead great inequality inthe distribution income.in regard, digitalisation impact much like globalisation, presentingsimilar policy challenge well. but effect digitalisation go deep still – istransforming many job profile and, result, requirement employee expectedto meet. demand increase skillsets computer cannot replace: social skillsand creativity, also ability operate ever-evolving technologies.if society come term structural change, people need position harnessthe opportunity digitalisation presents. and education key unlock thispotential.but education misconstrue phenomenon confine first third ofour life do with. quite opposite: need make learn firmfixture professional lives. and need establish culture lifelong learning. that iswhy i think really count make sure every employee access continuousprofessional development.of course, education need start much, much early lives: none u borndigitised – even digital natives, known.needless say, child nowadays naturally adopt new technology play. you mayhave see one online video small child stand front aquarium andputs thumb forefinger glass attempt zoom make fish bigger.but tomorrow’s workplace, able operate smartphone won’t enough. that whywe need digital education give young people firm technical ground strengthen theirmedia skills.this another area action need taken. the international computer informationliteracy study (icils) find german schoolchildren average skills, that. theauthors find one-third teacher use computer regularly (i.e. least aweek) lessons. in particular category, germany actually bring rear among thecountries surveyed.swiss economist thomas straubhaar also highlight fundamental importance educationin digital age recent op-ed piece write german daily newspaper: “a goodeducation system may expensive,” conceded, long run, continued, one thingis even costlier, that’s bad education system.4 impact inflationladies gentlemen,as central bank, interest ramification digitalisation thereal economy. another aspect, one particular importance, impact pricedevelopments – keep price stable is, all, primary objective monetarypolicymakers.digital transformation impact inflation multiple channels.one way technological progress push productivity, drive productioncosts. price ought follow cost downwards, assume sufficient competition.8910 4 / 8bis central bankers' speech another shift sale channels. it become increasingly common buy good onlinerather local shop. a recently year 2000, online trade account near-invisible 0.3% retail sales. by last year, figure already climb 10%.this invigorate competition – all, online marketplace find providersfrom every corner world. at time, price comparison website let consumersscan entire market matter clicks, create high level price transparency.even look information online still end shop locally, theincreased transparency nonetheless intensify competition squeeze margin andprices. my u counterpart jerome powell speak testimony senate bankingcommittee “amazon effect story”. a study ecb conclude increasinguse online trade eu reduce non-energy industrial good inflation 0.1 apercentage point year since 2003.there another phenomenon could opposite effect: rise dominant“superstar firms”.for part, firm offer information-based good sell online. it abusiness model involve substantial fix cost barely variable costs. just take thevideo-on-demand platform – whether large small

the active user product has, attractive become forothers.that company often emerge winner time progresses. they thencapitalise market power gain push price margins. to quote title ofa famous song abba, “the winner take it all”, please forgive break outin song.jan de loecker jan eeckhout estimate general rise firms’ price mark-ups theunited state increase inflation rate roughly one percentage point year 1980and 2014. that said, digitalisation one potential factor drive rise market power.the bottom-line impact inflation contrary effect digitalisation cannot yet quantifiedwith real certainty. accord bank canada, research find far indicatethat digitalisation small dampen effect inflation. sweden’s riksbank,however, argue decline rate inflation observe sweden recent year isprimarily connect factors.another area digitalisation make felt measurement inflation.in online trade – increasingly bricks-and-mortar retail world, – price bealtered push button. the job change one price tag another thing thepast. this price mechanism, mainly deploy big businesses, us algorithm thatrespond demand change price dynamically.it’s phenomenon might notice book flight online – ticket

thefrequency price change degree uniform price increased. but for11121314151617 5 / 8bis central bankers' speech statisticians, price change frequently fluctuate strongly something challenge.these days, it’s enough survey price product month. so digitalisation ismaking difficult measure inflation.but hand, digitalisation open new opportunity well. web scrap – astatistical method automatically capture online price – one example i could mentionhere. alberto cavallo roberto rigobon already use web scrap collect hugeamounts online data part billion price project order prepare daily priceindices, interest lead indicator properties.5 potential implication monetary policyladies gentlemen,one thing clear: digitalisation many faces. some face we’ve already becomefamiliar with, we’re get know others guess now. therecan doubt potential influence productivity, employment inflation. but doesit mean monetary policy?there lot talk monetary policymakers’ capacity effective intervention. thefinancial crisis saw central bank take interest rate policy limits, barely roomto bring policy rate lower.when come interest rates, low bind like perimeter line football pitch,which set boundary play area players’ room manoeuvre. the importanceof room manoeuvre something oscar wilde recognise back day: “in modern lifemargin everything,” one character proclaim play “lady windermere’sfan”.and may well see room monetary policy manoeuvre shrink future. if digitalisation wereto dampen inflation prolong period time, nominal interest rate would fall, narrowingthe gap low bound. this increase likelihood – else equal – monetarypolicymakers resort non-standard measure remain capable effectiveintervention.from see far, though, look like inflation-dampening effect ofdigitalisation fairly minor. it also worth bear mind effect reduce cost andincreased competition stem adjustment process. in new long-term equilibrium state,potential price cut would already exhaust impact inflation wouldhave ceased.however, reverse also conceivable. if digitalisation bring increase productivity andpotential growth, natural rate interest rise. this would push nominal interest rates,giving conventional monetary policy room play with.the fact capacity effective action become key issue monetary policy thefirst place actually nothing digitalisation. it low inflation andthe low interest rate recent years, are, first foremost, after-effects thefinancial economic crisis.nevertheless, observer already think could new normal. they areconcerned central bank come low bind policy rate moreand frequently turn non-standard instruments. that’s someeconomists propose aim high rate inflation, anticipate would provide agreater safety margin interest rate floor.18 6 / 8bis central bankers' speech but side-effects risk associate raise target inflation rate, somethingwhich bundesbank highlight length june monthly report year.at point, let's bear mind vital importance firmly anchor inflation expectation foreffective monetary policy. put inflation target cause inflation expectation shift. butthere absolutely guarantee quickly fall line remain anchor thenew target rate.ben bernanke put like this: “if go 4% say we’re go 4%, wouldrisk lot … hard-won credibility, folk would say, well, go 4%, go to6%? it’d difficult tie expectation 4%.”this i convince continue aim inflation below, close to, 2%over medium term arouse doubt credibility monetary policymakers.in case, regard natural interest rate long-term outlook, growth-promotingeconomic policy structural reform right way go.and set national european level. it particularly crucial, forinstance, harness possibility offer digitalisation, improve educationalopportunities, expand digital infrastructure, bolster cyber security modernise thelegal framework. the time come europe finally complete digital single market.a high growth path lead high general interest rate level, would give monetarypolicy water keel again.6 conclusionladies gentlemen,“computers useless. they give answers.” pablo picasso suppose havesaid that, half century ago.and that, join rank famous inaccurate prediction – ways. for agrain truth words. wherever thing hinge, particular, ask right questions,in world research example, computer – yet – tool. they cannot replacehumans areas.but digitalisation shake thing up. we wait bat

farm saskatchewan impressively high-tech business. yet, succeed, business leader sector still need deal vagary mother nature global commodity prices. decision must still take follow on. it surprisingly similar bank canada’s govern council. we finely hone economic model guide us, yet must take decision policy interest rate amid many unknown meet inflation objective. we also must follow communicate canadian financial market outlook economy inflation. with mind, remark today cover three points: first, canadian economy evolve since quarterly monetary policy report (mpr) july; next, factor development trade side outlook; and, finally, i give sense govern council’s deliberation lead decision yesterday hold policy rate steady. recent economic development when come economic developments, canada throw several curve ball past decade: financial crisis; low commodity prices; now, trade tensions. it little year ago could see adjustment low oil price sufficiently behind u begin withdraw monetary stimulus put place 2015. we raise policy rate four time since july 2017, 1 1/2 per cent. during period, overall canadian economic performance solid broad-based. growth run close potential, rate economy grow sustain basis without spark much inflation. and core inflation measure around 2 per cent. today, policy rate still relatively low—by i mean low would consider “neutral” rate interest.1 the data information receive since july reaffirm govern council’s view high interest rate require achieve inflation target. in fact, global economy perform largely expected, good thing support growth home. our neighbour south see particularly strong demand, drive household business spending. some jurisdictions, though, show sign weak momentum, may partly link trade measure uncertainty trade policy. meanwhile, recent data canada indicate growth average near potential next couple years. some might recall july forecast count quick rebound mark slowdown gross domestic product (gdp) growth saw first quarter year. this important call 1 the bank estimate neutral rate interest (nominal) 2.5 3.5 per cent. for details, see x. s. chen j. dorich, “the neutral rate canada: 2018 estimates,” bank canada staff analytical note no. 2018-22 (july 2018). - 3 - lend support view july right time raise interest rate 25 basis points. the gdp data release last week statistic canada show right money; economy grow annual pace 2.9 per cent april june, twice pace saw early year. growth fuel consumption export and, less extent, business investment government spending.2 the data support view shift demand toward export investment continuing. healthy growth consumption home renovation also indicate household generally adjust well high interest rates.3 a wide range sector contribute developments. the resource sector continue expand tough years. the service sector also grow many high value-added areas. for example, second quarter computer system design relate service grow 10 per cent year earlier. we expect quarterly profile gdp growth volatile rest 2018, still average around 2 per cent. temporary factor push export second quarter expect unwind, outage oil sector. those factor likely weigh growth third quarter, point weak underlie momentum. all encouraging. and make progress understand issue mind while. the first relate house market household debt, respond wide range policy changes. these include tight guideline mortgage finance come effect january, provincial measure target specific house market and, course, high interest rate past year.4 we saw resale activity house market slow markedly begin 2018, particularly great toronto vancouver areas. this swing amplify fact many household rush secure finance complete transaction ahead new rule come effect. recent data show toronto resale rebound price stabilize too, 2 business investment growth slow first quarter, investment machinery equipment intellectual property product return normal rate record double-digit growth early year. 3 see box 3 july mpr assessment increase interest rate affect people need renew mortgage next couple years. 4 on january 1, 2018, office superintendent financial institution (osfi) introduce revise “guideline b-20.” the guideline impose stringent stress test borrower seek new uninsured mortgage stipulate lender require household demonstrate could still service debt high interest rate. in term provincial measures, “homes b.c.” plan include expand foreign buyer tax well additional tax transparency measures. - 4 - although vancouver activity price growth remain subdued. other urban market weakened, regina saskatoon, steady show recovery. so, national basis, sale price appear stabilizing. this suggest borrower lender adjust range policy change anticipated, financial vulnerability begin ease. growth household credit slowed, household debt-to-income ratio edge lower. we see improvement quality new uninsured mortgages, result small proportion household become highly indebted.5 what i mean highly indebted household loan-to-income ratio 450 per cent. these early positive signs, even good view development data come in. a second issue always work good understand relate development inflation front. the company participate business outlook survey (bos) second quarter tell u capacity pressure labour shortage intensifying. yet, wage rise le quickly would expect economy near capacity. the late data indicate still case: our prefer measure wage gain 2 ½ per cent second quarter. that said, inflation data july surprise u upside come 3 per cent. we expect inflation would average around 2 ½ per cent third fourth quarters, rise toward upper end target range temporary factor gasoline prices, rather pressure excess demand.6 since much july surprise due jump airfare component consumer price index (cpi), continue hold view. here measure core inflation particularly valuable operational guides, strip lot noise. those measure remain around 2 per cent, support assessment inflation increase temporary. factor trade policy environment outlook let turn final issue—the trade environment—which top mind time give importance economic prospect home abroad. and, canadian official work hard resolve issues, lot uncertainty remains. canadian business tell u trade tension among several factor keep invest new capacity, even though demand investment intention strong many sectors. here saskatchewan, speak firm whose investment plan flux pending clarity 5 mortgage canada loan-to-value ratio 80 per cent require government-guaranteed mortgage default insurance. 6 other temporary factor push inflation 2 per cent effect minimum-wage increase exchange rate pass-through. - 5 - nafta. others explore whether invest across border instead canada. these kind response uncertainty adequately capture economic models, need apply judgment. this judgment inform quarterly bos, well discussion business people across canada. canada alone this—we expect investment many jurisdiction suffer similar effects. to ass impact tariff announced, follow two steps. the first step look potential long-term effect recent tariff changes. we use new model develop staff describe staff analytical note publish morning.7 it provide excellent framework map trade flow might change resource might shift across sector long period time. the second step consider shorter-term effects—what might happen business worker adjust transition period. this process complex model fully capture, yet important understand monetary policy. of course, also account effect countermeasure implement canadian government. take together, bank estimate combination reduce confidence trade measure already take shave two-thirds 1 per cent gdp canada 2020.8 we see effect already. june trade data show steel export fell since 2008, little movement july. moreover, value consumer good subject 10-per cent import tariff fell almost 23 per cent july, follow run-up previous months. regard inflation, estimate canada’s countermeasure would temporarily boost inflation 0.1 percentage point third quarter 2019. the recent inflation report statistic canada show impact tariff price date. still, beer pop manufacturer announce plan raise price response rise cost aluminum cans. the outlook growth inflation canada also affect tariff dispute big player unite state china. these dispute cause shift global market affect price many commodity produce. reflect this, price base metal agricultural product softened. saskatchewan among province experience effect early summer. it important recognize challenge face canadian exporter nafta tariffs. concern weak business investment, firm 7 see k. charbonneau a. landry, “estimating impact tariff changes: two illustrative scenarios,” bank canada staff analytical note no. 2018-29 (september 2018). 8 this estimate include impact tariff previously impose unite state canadian softwood lumber newsprint well new tariff steel aluminum. table 4 july mpr provide detail tariffs. although u international trade commission recently overturn newsprint tariffs, expect meaningfully change estimate july mpr. - 6 - build new capacity outside borders, decline market share exist long current trade tension emerged. competitiveness issue hamper canadian business time, even foreign demand growing. market share unite state canada’s non-energy good has, fact, decline past 15 years.9 the effect particularly acute manufacture sector. this trend mean much low share employment manufacture industries, include automotive part clothing. regardless transpire trade policy front, bank still need good understand competitiveness issue ass extent canada permanently lose market share export capacity.10 yesterday’s decision let turn govern council’s policy deliberation lead yesterday’s decision. it surprise hear implication current trade environment front centre. a i outlined, already incorporate forecast expect negative effect uncertainty business investment exports, well effect u tariff canadian countermeasure impose far. these estimate highly uncertain may need adjust get information nafta negotiation business adjust plans. our practice incorporate scenario yet occur, even though may subject ongoing discussions. that said, risk growth relate trade policy downside, particularly light ongoing negotiations. there significant upside well. nonetheless, important understand certain trade development result complex trade-off monetary policy. on one hand, protectionist measure costly term growth incomes, particularly business people adjust. a recent study bank international settlement (bis) show virtually region canada, mexico unite state could expect low real wage country revert nafta world trade organization tariff rates.11 on hand, protectionist measure create risk upside inflation, especially economy operate near full capacity. in weigh 9 for details, see n. labelle st-pierre, “decomposing canada’s market shares: an update,” bank canada staff analytical note no. 2018-26 (august 2018); d. brouillette, j. dorich, c. d’souza, a. gagnon c. godbout, “what be restrain non-energy export growth?” bank canada staff analytical note no. 2018-25 (august 2018). 10 see t. webley, “characterizing canada’s export sector industry: a supply-side perspective,” bank canada staff analytical note no. 2018-27 (august 2018). 11 see r. auer, b. bonadio a. levchenko. “the economics revoke nafta,” bi work paper no. 739 (august 2018). - 7 - trade-offs, sure govern council lose sight primary mission. low stable inflation help reduce least one source uncertainty company households. of course, number structural policy good suit monetary policy help manage would complex adjustments. govern council also discuss whether gradual approach raise rate take past year remain appropriate. it natural question ask, give economy operate potential past year part cycle interest rate typically rise pre-empt buildup inflation pressures. a i mention earlier, factor push inflation top target band appear temporary sign excess demand. these factor mean inflation could turn high next couple quarter expect july, likely fall afterward bar new price shocks. we need full update inflation outlook october mpr, already good idea effect temporary factor play right likely dissipate. for example, increase gasoline price early year contribute 0.7 percentage point above-target inflation today. this effect largely recede first quarter next year. we see past, since fluctuation energy price account three-quarters overall movement inflation. to job without cause undue volatility growth, look factors, remain alert sign underlie inflation pressures. furthermore, still acknowledge may room grow without cause inflation build forecast. we also know high level household debt make economy sensitive interest-rate increase past. that people must commit income service debt borrow cost rise, leave le spending. the fact job market particularly strong, average household income rising, help adjustment. consumer confidence also relatively high. all suggest economy adjust well adapt high interest rates. the bottom line govern council agree gradual approach follow still appropriate. finally, discuss much momentum remain global expansion. few would disagree unite state show considerable strength, commentator see relatively flat u yield curve sign trouble ahead. while downside risk outlook, govern council prefer look broad range indicators. for one thing, yield curve currently inverted, therefore point significant slowing.12 besides that, shape curve may reliable signal current environment anyway. this longer-dated bond yield 12 see e. engstrom s. sharpe. “(don’t fear) the yield curve,” feed notes. washington: board governor federal reserve system (june 28, 2018). - 8 - distort combination central bank quantitative ease program strong private demand long-dated safe assets. other indicator look include credit spreads, remain narrow.13 there may downside risk july outlook global economy come trade tensions, crack appear certain emerge economy financial vulnerabilities, limit spillover countries. conclusion it time conclude. in term momentum canada, encourage economy adjust well high borrow rate tight guideline mortgage financing. we also please continue shift composition growth toward export business investment. recent data reinforce govern council’s assessment high interest rate warrant achieve inflation target. we continue take gradual approach, guide incoming data. in particular, bank continue gauge economy’s reaction high interest rates. the bank also monitor closely course nafta negotiation trade policy developments, impact inflation outlook. 13 see m. leboeuf d. hyun, “is excess bond premium lead indicator canadian economic activity?” bank canada staff analytical note no. 2018-4 (march 2018). 10/09/2018the evolution household sector risk | speech | rbahttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2018/sp-ag-2018-09-10.html1/13speechthe evolution household sector risksmichele bullock assistant governor, financial systemai group albury – 10 september 2018thank invitation speak ai group lunch. it great back regionalaustralia. i responsible area bank focus financial stability. so remarkstoday go cover one financial risk focus recent year – thehigh level household debt australia. household debt rise number decades.how much concern this? i go talk evolution current debt situationand see current risks. give i albury-wodonga, i finish fewcomments house market debt regional australia.household debt australia rise relative income past 30 year (graph 1). thisgraph show total household debt-to-income australia early 1990s year.over time rise around 70 per cent around 190 per cent. there three distinctperiods. the first, early 1990s mid-2000s, saw debt-to-income ratio thandouble 160 per cent. then period around 2007 2013 ratio remainedfairly steady 160 per cent. finally, since 2013, debt-to-income ratio rise again,reaching 190 per cent 2018.

climate change well accept significant impact economy worldwide. the impact physical nature, financial change consumer investor preferences, regulation. mass urbanisation challenge bring accelerate globally, quite opposite i teach would happen i school. computer would mean live lifestyle block paperless world. yeah right. i see global estimate world economic forum 60 percent world population, within next couple decades, live city population great 10 million people, many current emerge market nations. the challenge bring resources, infrastructure, social cohesion immense – unprecedented. and complain auckland traffic. age population also dominate outlook next 30-plus years, japan canary u watch. their population decline due demographic profile weight much elderly. save consumption pattern change simply due population swing. the old save demand le goods, services, especially human contact. loneliness significant grow disease. yet owner capital struggle create career care elderly, least income attract retain people needed. the could say tourism new zealand. mass migration (in addition urbanisation) pressure also grow globally, drive factor mention above. climate change mean people must leave find new homes, witness sahara-african people virtually swim europe. social cohesion challenge national boundary belief threaten change. which bring income wealth inequality come go economic history – global economy currently test fresh cyclical boundaries. what i mean inequality? well, even economic ‘pie’ grow total, reward always skew one way another. over recent decades, reward owner capital (profits) outstrip owner labour (wages) 4 throughout economic history. in addition, wage growth within, between, firm become dispersed. suppose low-skilled job far out-paced high skilled jobs. now also rise ‘superstar companies’ ‘winner take (or most)’ entire industry. these superstar firm generally low ‘wages-to-profit’ ratio competitors, accentuate income divergence. how manage this? through superior economy scale drive technology brand advantage easily replicable. witness facebook, amazon, google, alibaba on. this also true within financial sector, big bank gain significant economy scale, leave small bank struggle compete. this would fine didn’t lead problem ‘too big fail’ excessive risk take incentives. we immune issue locally, sense word. but, opportunity lead globe positive change become long-term economic activity. in new zealand, challenge environmental consequence efforts. we also significant ongoing migration urbanisation, people want part place together. we creak infrastructure suffer over-exuberant asset (house) prices. we also persistent stubborn unemployment low-income challenges. this especially amongst pasifika māori, despite significant contribution economic cultural wellbeing, despite current labour shortages. and, rapidly ageing, often lonely, population. underlie challenge new zealand’s persistently low productivity growth – economic output-per-person. the reason behind low productivity well understand but, apparently, difficult combat coordinated, persistent, manner. an excellent paper productivity commission,1 outline succinctly problem low productivity cause new zealand. in large part, low output-per-person due ‘capital-shallowness’ much economic activity. this refer physical human (knowledge) capital. new zealander low save rate (personal capital), mean don’t tend draw advantage profit (the return capital). likewise, many large company drive pay dividend (often offshore due ownership) rather re-invest company, new zealand broadly. these challenge compound relatively small scale new zealand firms, low level technology knowledge dispersion firms. paul conway challenge u all, include policymakers: assist small, remote, firm global economy; improve match job skills; use immigration wisely lift human capital; make investment easy effective; moderate pace population growth encourage capital-deepening; improve competition service sector; strengthen economic return science innovation. so problem identification solution outlined, wouldn’t move resolution? short-termism challenge u always everywhere. 1 paul conway, (2018), ‘can kiwi fly? achieve productivity lift-off new zealand’, international productivity monitor, no. 34, spring 2018. 5 why run roadblock long-termism? capitalism necessary, marvel, drive human welfare strongly positive direction century now. but know – even adam smith, godfather free market know – capitalism perfect. market can, do, fail variety well research understand reasons. otherwise, would need government, regulators, central bank? a significant challenge human myopia, inability and/or unwillingness think long-term. after all, ‘she’ll right’. myopia actually incentivised many contract – drive short deadline frequent report rapid personal gratification. this short horizon perverse outcome. annual bonus example lead excessive risk taking, lack concern unintended consequences, desire short-term cost cut lack reinvestment. however, bonus implement intent ‘buying employee in’ business long-term gain. the myopia challenge enforce know ‘principal-agent problem’. the advent remarkable limited-liability company structure liberate economic activity. these legal structure allow people take risk others capital, limit personal financial consequences. the limit liability structure do, however, mean responsibility outcome business activity compromised. hence list rules, regulations, company directorship code exist. the line owner capital (the principal) manager capital (the agent) lengthened. ‘who own company?’ tough question.2 this principal-agent separation get even hard investment portfolio way invest ‘growth assets’ ie, business. the link saver (owner capital), investment manager (who may even outsource part this), company agent. principal-agent-agent. this represent large part industry structure people audience

– care long-term. i won’t labour significant additional challenge much, let’s forget investment manager likewise incentivised behave short-term manner often also. the outcome behaviour lead pro-cyclical nature investing, include institutional ‘herding’ lock losses, rather benefit bargain price opportunities. such institutional (and business confidence) herd destroy wealth, increase financial volatility, kill long-term strategies.3 a frankie howerd, british comedian, said: ‘there’s nowt queer folk’. another challenge ‘externalities’ – tragedy common (and also horizon). too many

exactly ten year ago, 15 september 2008, lehman brothers, fourth-largest u investment bank time, file bankruptcy. the ensue storm engulf global financial market ferocity magnitude take market observer surprise. the collapse lehman brother make clear many financial institution could withstand buffet without government support. the financial crisis spill rapidly real economy, result deep global recession since great depression. we personal memory difficult period. many probably think 16 october 2008, day swiss authority step support ubs comprehensive package measures. back then, i work federal finance administration. the fact oblige burden state taxpayer exposure worth billion stabilise big bank make last impression me. the lack resilience bank system force government across world plough huge sum bank bail-outs. it way protect economy enormous damage bank system collapse would wrought. the financial crisis demonstrate uncertain term bank system sufficiently ‘weatherproof’. the financial crisis also show clearly particular risk stem large, highly interconnect banks. owe size market position, bank cannot exit market without severe consequence bank system real economy. in industry jargon, ‘systemically important’. thus, enjoy implicit guarantee state intervene emergency. this form market failure know world ‘too big fail’ issue. in speech today, i look issue, one particularly relevant switzerland. i start discuss cause effect ‘too big fail’, manifest switzerland, move reason bank regulation crisis sufficiently address risk pose ‘too big fail’ banks. base analysis, third part speech i describe wide-ranging regulatory measure take international national level resolve ‘too big fail’. let present conclusion front: in switzerland, response quick, target and, time, cost-effective. on one hand, regulatory amendment strengthen banks’ resilience, reduce likelihood bank get financial distress. on hand, introduce measure aim ensure even systemically important bank exit market orderly way event crisis. we convince swiss big bank swiss bank system much weatherproof today ten year ago. many plan measure already implemented. page 3/14 however, still quite achieve objective. only agree measure fully implement condition resolve ‘too big fail’ switzerland place. the ‘too big fail’ issue so behind ‘too big fail’, concrete form take switzerland? a) ‘too big fail’ institution must bail crisis ... a i mention start, ‘too big fail’ mean individual institution important state de facto obligation bail crisis. this state obligation arise two conditions. first, affect institution provide service crucial importance national economy generally indispensable. second, service cannot provide market participant short notice – words, substitutable. how pronounce two aspect bank sector? first, bank generally provide wide range essential service economy, lend payment services. second, service easily substitutable, particularly big banks. bank closely interconnect other, rest economy. the result problem one bank spill bank rest economy. the large bank high market share, small likelihood market participant able take important function short notice event crisis. thus, bank’s size market position important indicator assess systemic importance. specific parameter bank’s share domestic lend deposit business, importance payment transactions. another widely use measure systemic importance ratio balance sheet total gdp, good indicator bank’s interconnectedness (lack of) substitutability services.1 b) ... failure would come high economic cost if ‘too big fail’ bank get distress, jeopardise also stability financial system whole and, direct consequence, real economy. the high economic cost illustrate use two mechanisms. the high bank’s market share lend business, great probability economy provide enough liquidity bank get difficulties. first, find alternative credit provider take time. second, event failure systemically important bank, asset household company – least 1 so even though case – include – term use ‘too big fail’, institution’s size make systemically important. in addition size market share, risk profile, economic interconnectedness (organisational) complexity important variables. a result, term ‘too important fail’, ‘too complex fail’ ‘too interconnect fail’ also used. page 4/14 temporarily – frozen, attendant negative impact consumption investment. here too, maxim applies: high institution’s market share deposit business, great fallout event crisis. the second mechanism base fact that, i already mentioned, bank closely interconnected. within network, systemically important bank provide essential service banks. for example, play key role system-wide liquidity provision adjustment banks. normally, take form short-term interbank lending. if key player network get difficulty, interbank market seize up, cause problem other, otherwise sound banks, too. c) the result false incentive high risk society whole a systemically important bank expect bail cost failure real economy would extremely high. in words: bank benefit implicit state guarantee. the consequence far-reaching, provide significant false incentive bank’s shareholders, management creditors. on one hand, shareholder management ‘too big fail’ bank benefit unjustifiably low capital borrow costs, compare banks. the state guarantee tantamount subsidy worth billions.2 it allow shareholder management take debt great risk.3 on hand, state guarantee mean creditor le incentive make sure bank take excessive risk. if go well, benefit virtually risk-free interest income. if, however, thing go wrong, state intervene creditor hold liable loss may arise. the mere assumption bank big fail self-fulfilling prophecy.4 on assumption bail necessary, bank may take excessive risk much readily, focus business model heavily debt-based growth. thus, bank become even bigger, thereby increase likelihood state intervene crisis, original assumption prof correct. give increase likelihood bail-out, bank take even risk, de facto bail-out obligation become even acute – vicious circle. this bail-out obligation result high unforeseen cost state. the scale cost highlight global financial crisis, time saw announce 2 for example, cf. international monetary fund (2014) estimate magnitude subsidy. 3 cf. afonso et al. (2014). 4 cf. alessandri haldane (2009). page 5/14 state support financial sector advance economy amount 20% gdp (cf. slide 2).5 state budgets, already strong pressure recession associate financial crisis, overstretch cost state support measures. and indeed, crisis, number country find shoulder cost well excess financial capacities. ultimately, cop resort external support. d) the ‘too big fail’ issue especially pronounce switzerland a i’ve mentioned, switzerland, too, package state support measure ubs 2008 unavoidable. the capital injection around chf 6 billion confederation amount 10% federal receipts, distress asset usd 60 billion snb will take represent 10% gdp.6 in 2011 dispatch ‘too big fail’ (tbtf) legislation, federal council note commitment associate considerable risk taxpayers, future rescue package might financially sustainable switzerland.7 this ‘too big fail’ issue especially pronounce switzerland. the two big banks, ubs credit suisse, large balance sheet relative gdp, owe substantial international activity (cf. slide 3). at time, also significant market share domestic lend deposit business, major player area payment transactions. moreover, international comparison, three bank designate systemically important snb – postfinance, raiffeisen group zürcher kantonalbank – also large balance sheet relative gdp. for example, raiffeisen zkb relative swiss gdp double size large u bank relative u gdp.8 shortcoming tbtf regulation crisis lady gentlemen, global financial crisis clearly demonstrate that, least switzerland, ‘too big fail’ issue real cost risk society whole high state affair simply accepted. 5 cf. horton et al. (2009). 6 cf. swiss national bank (2008). 7 cf. swiss federal council (2011). 8 share balance sheet total relative swiss u gdp respectively end-2017: zkb 25%; raiffeisen 34%; ubs 138%; credit suisse 112%; jpmorgan chase 13%; bank america 12%. page 6/14 a) ‘too big fail’ issue: recognise insufficiently address regulation ... look back today, clear issue underestimate crisis – general regulators. for instance, crisis, neither international recommendation bank regulation swiss regulatory provision contain anything explicitly address systemic importance individual bank associate risks. and despite fact people aware issue crisis – switzerland elsewhere.9 the term ‘too big fail’ already feature political debate 1980s us, context difficulty experience number financial institutions. the first bank refer ‘too big fail’ continental illinois national bank trust company, time seventh-largest bank us, seek recourse state support 1984.10 so, point, one could legitimately ask question: didn’t legislators, regulator supervisory authority tackle know problem vigorously crisis? the short answer is: the risk stem ever large ever globally interconnect bank underestimated, result, true magnitude ‘too big fail’ issue likewise underestimated. the pre-crisis era dominate general mood self-confidence optimism. this hardly surprising, consider long phase comparatively low macroeconomic turbulence. in environment, concern sustainability economic development appear misplaced. thus, risk attach growth globalisation strategy many bank ignored. moreover, underestimation risk closely bind prevail regulatory paradigm time, overlook significance mutual dependency banks. instead, assume stability system whole ensured, long individual bank hold enough capital cover risks. yet assumption disregard fact that, bank’s size, market share interconnectedness increase, economic cost associate bank failure rise disproportionately. ally underestimation significance systemic interlinkages excessive faith modelling, supervisory authority also subscribed.11 there general conviction commonly use quantitative model measure risk capture actual risk bank system fully reliably – dangerous misapprehension. for instance, models’ risk calculation base correlation price trend recent past, often disregard fact correlation change rapidly significantly, reason directly apparent data. moreover, model simply 9 the ‘too big fail’ issue discuss detail number academic study textbook 2008; example, cf. stern feldman (2004). 10 cf. moosa (2010). 11 for example, cf. bernanke (2006). page 7/14 sufficiently replicate certain risk grow major proportion course crisis, default risk position bank hold assumption could easily sell short notice.12 since regulatory capital requirement largely rely model-based calculations, adequately take account actual risk exposure. against background, resilience many bank prove insufficient overall crisis. relative risk exposure, bank simply large enough liquidity capital cushions. they unable absorb large outflow fund losses. in short: crisis, practical relevance ‘too big fail’ issue underestimated. at time, belief risk bank system could precisely quantify monitor mean sophisticate statistical model lead false sense security. these key explanation inadequacy bank regulation worldwide crisis. b) ... switzerland these aspect also play key role swiss regulatory practice crisis. like lot big bank countries, ubs credit suisse also pursue growth globalisation strategy focus heavily investment bank decade lead crisis. ubs, particular, set goal become one global leader investment banking.13 such global business activity enable big bank achieve impressive return many year (cf. slide 4). their financial soundness strategic direction thus rarely questioned.14 the risk take big bank part development widely underestimated. in year crisis, supervisory authority regulator warn potential risk associate rapidly expand balance sheet shrink capitalisation (cf. slide 5). for instance, swiss federal bank commission (sfbc), predecessor today’s financial market supervisory authority (finma), already step supervision switzerland’s two big bank end 1990s.15 the snb, financial stability report 2003 onwards, point big bank highly leverage international comparison.16 together sfbc, snb also early advocate within basel committee bank supervision international tighten capital requirement big banks. however, call fail garner enough support, and, due 12 for example, cf. stulz (2008) basel committee bank supervision (2016). 13 for example, cf. ubs (2004), p. 7: ‘we ambitious vision – recognize best global financial service firm. we world’s large wealth manager, investment bank security business select bracket major houses.’ 14 cf. control committee national council council state (2010), p. 3104. 15 cf. finma (2009), p. 22. 16 for example, cf. swiss national bank (2003). page 8/14 consideration relate international competitiveness, decide switzerland would go alone.17 at time, swiss authority banks, like peer elsewhere, also fell victim widespread over-reliance models, lead distortion risk assessment. thus 2004 sfbc, instance, grant ubs permission use adapt risk model ass market risk, i.e. financial risk, stem change market valuation bank’s assets. use adapt risk model, maximum assume risk loss correspond positions, hence requisite capital requirement, reduced.18 grant permission use model was, condition prevail time, logical step line international practice. during crisis, however, become clear over-reliance risk model mistake – something finma (the successor sfbc) also acknowledge hindsight.19 switzerland’s regulatory response ‘too big fail’ issue the financial crisis vividly expose shortcoming bank regulation. a broad consensus quickly develop need thorough overhaul regulatory framework. in switzerland, ubs case, particular, generate strong political momentum strict bank regulations. a) extensive adjustment international regulatory standard at international level, basel committee financial stability board (fsb) subsequently adopt number measure strengthen banks’ resilience find solution ‘too big fail’. with respect banks’ resilience, basel committee increase minimum risk-weighted capital requirements, term quality quantity. it also specify capital surcharge systemically important bank new minimum requirement apply banks. furthermore, revise calculation risk-weighted asset goal restrict banks’ freedom determine capital requirements. at time, introduce unweighted capital adequacy requirement – leverage ratio, serve non-risk-based backstop risk-based capital requirement banks. the fsb measure aim improve resolvability systemically important banks. in particular, requirement define resolution plan accumulation gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity. these measure intend ensure systemically important bank exit market ‘orderly’ fashion event crisis. 17 for example, cf. finma (2009), p. 19. 18 cf. finma (2009), p.30 et seq. 19 cf. branson (2011), p.5: ‘for several decade believe great sophistication risk management technique allow u tolerate thin capital cushions. we wrong.’ page 9/14 b) swiss tbtf regulation rest two complementary pillar … in switzerland, parliament already pass package legislation back 2011 recognise special importance ‘too big fail’ issue line international approach. it base two complementary pillar special requirement systemically important banks. the first pillar define measure strengthen resilience bank thereby reduce likelihood systemically important bank get financial distress. in particular, revise regulation impose strict capital liquidity requirement banks. they meet risk-weighted capital requirement leverage ratio requirement. equity capital allow bank absorb losses, thus protect insolvency. at time, high capital buff reduce incentive shareholder take excessive risk would put ‘own money’ line. liquid assets, turn, ensure bank capable withstand sudden, unexpected outflow short-term liability without get acute payment difficulties. the bank-specific level requirement today partly determine bank’s degree systemic importance. in contrast pre-crisis era, regulation expressly take account risk financial system economy whole arise failure systemically important bank. in way, regulation also explicitly rein incentive excessive growth sector. however, even new, strict capital requirement cannot eliminate risk systemically important bank get existential difficulties. first, risk difficult ass also change time. second, nature banks’ operation mean always degree susceptible crises. absolute security never achieve if, time, want safeguard useful economic function banks. the second pillar tbtf regulation come play event systemically important bank get financial distress despite increase resilience. it intend ensure bank resolvable. in words: even systemically important bank able exit market orderly fashion. it recovery wind-down must allow jeopardise stability economy whole. for purpose, regulation stipulate requirement resolution planning. for example, end-2019, systemically important bank switzerland prepare ‘emergency plans’ demonstrate able continue systemically important function switzerland without interruption event crisis. the second pillar also specify requirement loss-absorbing capacity. systemically important bank must hold sufficient financial resource cover loss crisis finance cost separation systemically important functions. bank use so-called page 10/14 ‘bail-in’ instrument purpose. these essentially debt security convert equity write event impend insolvency.20 these measure especially design counter de facto obligation state provide assistance event crisis. the organisational arrangement facilitate orderly separation central function within reasonable timeframe. furthermore, creditor participate directly default risk. the intention ensure bail-in creditor rather bail-out state event crisis predefining criterion debt security convert write down. the swiss regulatory approach thus aim tackle fundamental cause ‘too big fail’. this also conclusion reach federal council 2015 evaluation report. it assessment swiss approach positive, consider appropriate international comparison.21 at time, federal council conclude action need relation certain parameters. in particular, stress that, due special significance ‘too big fail’ country, switzerland forefront come set resilience requirements. consequently, prescribe increase capital requirements. these change criticise quarters. concern voice adjustment unreasonable would put bank competitive disadvantage internationally.22 how justify criticism? c) … design cost-effective all regulation inevitably meet resistance create add cost regulate institutions. but often way bring desire change conduct. in discussion cost regulation, important weigh private cost incur subject regulation cost

consequently, regulation directly impact banks’ business model organisational structures. nor distinguish desirable undesirable bank activity prohibit certain practices. rather, swiss approach base

surprising. after all, take several decade denmark fully re-covered situation early 1980s, economic chal-lenges respect resemble face greece today. the debt greece write down, private-sector

ultimately foot bill. and may difficult raise government loan crisis-ridden member state future subse-quently convert income transfers. fiscal transfer perceive "taxation without representation". and legitimate need member state allow test policy hence also bear consequences. a balance strike common fiscal framework discuss ongoing basis. the rule politically rather legally binding. can simplified? it doubtful. doe work? yes, member state use support sound policy rather make scapegoat. so solve some, all, problems. nor bank union ex-pected solve problems. backstoppers assistance programme impose strict condi-tions borrowers. this always controversial, re-quirements mild condition interest rate crisis-ridden member state may obtain market terms. another example crisis management individual bank recent years, e.g. italy spain. it remember although brrd/srmr4 rule apply, build-up mrel fund mean complete yet. in controversial cases, eu institution assess bank concern systemically important community context, management bank leave national authorities. those authority insist bank regional systemic importance obtain approval euro-pean commission measure element

bank. this typically correspond 25 per cent risk-weighted assets. calculation show crisis period 2008 one systemically important european bank loss exceed-ing threshold. furthermore, contribution srf may ex-ceed 5 per cent bank's liabilities, receivable claim, income transfer. this structure result fundamental shift (with brrd) approach financial regulation financial crisis, effect crisis

cross-border insurance element overtake healthy crisis reso-lution model. the fourth example edis, relation negotiation slow. in objective terms, good case single deposit insurance scheme bank union. the risk national bank con-tinuously affect national conditions, single supervisory resolution mechanism natural also single deposit insur-ance scheme. but supporter opponent seem exaggerate

overall active job openings-to-applicants ratio high level since 1974, ratio full-time worker specifically high record since survey began, november 2004 (chart 5). against backdrop, labor-saving investment increase wide range industry view to, example, use artificial intelligence (ai), robotic process automation (rpa), means. a use ai rpa increases, displacement effect cause labor position human take robot machine issue concern. however, i believe use ai rpa could contribute overall economic growth, cost reduction bring automation, well creation new employment production new good service result technological innovation. a japan tackle challenge decline birth rate age population, contribution ai rpa economic growth could key solve challenge. indeed, research analyze positive negative effect use ai suggest challenge society work on.1 1 acemoglu, daron, pascual restrepo. "artificial intelligence, automation work." nber work paper, no. 24196, january 2018. 4 with regard outlook, japan's economy likely continue moderate expansion. through fiscal 2018, likely continue grow pace potential, mainly background highly accommodative financial condition underpinnings government spending, overseas economy continue grow firmly. business fix investment likely continue increasing, support firms' heighten growth expectation increase olympic games-related investment, well labor-saving investment address labor shortages. private consumption also expect follow moderate increase trend employment income situation continue improve. moreover, export expect continue moderate increase trend back growth overseas economies. japan's economy expect maintain expand trend fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020, support part increase exports. this despite likely deceleration business fix investment, mainly reflect cyclical adjustment capital stock peak olympic games-related demand, likely temporary decline private consumption schedule consumption tax hike october 2019. accord bank's july 2018 outlook economic activity price (hereafter outlook report), median policy board members' forecast real gdp growth rate 1.5 percent fiscal 2018, 0.8 percent fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020 (chart 6). the consumption tax hike likely affect japan's economy follow two channels: (1) front-loaded increase demand prior consumption tax hike subsequent decline hike, (2) decline real income. however, strong possibility effect consumption tax hike economy small fiscal 2014, last consumption tax hike take place. this mainly government proceed effort deliberate various measure order reduce burden tax hike households. c. recent price development concept price stability target a prices, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food (core cpi) pick somewhat recently, partly support 5 rise energy prices, although decelerate one occasion increase 1 percent february 2018 (chart 7). price reflect state economy. a stable increase price within certain range -- high, low -- drive force economy. to give example, environment price rise moderately -- increase value-added product service -- corporate profit likely increase. in case, wage people work firm also would rise, would household income. with increase household income, people likely spend product services, make corporate profit increase even more. i consider important ensure virtuous cycle operate. what, then, favorable state economy? the bank set call "price stability target" 2 percent. there three reason set target 2 percent. first, cpi statistical tendency, upward bias, toward indicate slightly high inflation rate actual one, mean appropriate figure price stability term cpi slightly positive figure. second, asymmetry policy measures. central bank usually respond inflation deflation raise low policy interest rates. they le raise interest rate high level feel necessary; basically ceiling interest rates. on hand, limit extent interest rate lowered. it therefore prudent buff secure certain "margin" positive inflation positive interest rate advance, central bank take appropriate action monetary ease economy head toward deflation. third, major advance economy define price stability 2 percent, target share global standard. 6 in short, appropriate state economy similar human body; important maintain target "basal temperature" economy, consensus central bank major advance economies. d. key factor price wage now, i would like explain development price wages, take account output gap medium- long-term inflation expectations. the first point development output gap. the output gap widen within positive territory back steady tighten labor market condition rise capital utilization rates. in theory, expansion output gap exert upward pressure prices, would increase core cpi, albeit time lag. however, reality, price increase should. part reason price remain sluggish households' persistent concern regard future amid decline birth rate age population, addition fact wage increase take time fully take hold, i touch upon later. frankly speaking, consumer still keep purse string tight. in words, households' tolerance price rise increasing. indeed, firms, mainly service sector, transportation din out, raise price since autumn 2017, reflect increase cost labor materials. price rise also see since begin 2018 good include beer consumption license premise food items. however, many case far effort lead improvement corporate profits, many firm appear difficulty accurately assess consumer sentiment. these issue seem relate firms' cautious price-setting stance. improve income situation raise wage would direct approach reduce households' concern regard future. however, also important redesign safety net public feel secure, framework pension component social security system. regard wages, increase nominal wage sluggish relative heighten seriousness labor shortage. this may regular employee tend give priority stability employment wage increases, firm maintain 7 cautious wage-setting stance consideration medium- long-term risks. amid intensify labor shortage, also increase labor force participation woman seniors, whose wage elasticity labor supply high. real wages, exclude effect price developments, also sluggish circumstances. if price rise without increase wages, burden might place national economy. therefore, bank's goal necessarily solely raise prices, also continue closely monitor development wage achieve price stability target thereby contribute sound development economy. the next point concern medium- long-term inflation expectations, le unchanged recently (chart 8). theoretically, inflation expectation affect (1) backward-looking, adaptive, component reflect past rates, observe inflation rate, (2) forward-looking component, reflect progress bank's pursuit monetary ease strong commitment achieve price stability target. while promote rise observe inflation rate, give inflation expectation japan tend greatly influence observe inflation rate, vital bank maintain strong commitment achieve price stability target. if firms' households' inflation expectation subsequently rise, albeit gradually, fee observe inflation rate, turn bring gradual increase inflation rate. due combination several factor mention far, price continue show relatively weak development compare improvement economic employment conditions. however, also true year-on-year rate change core cpi either le flat increase 19 consecutive month february 2018. it good optimistic outlook, many factor delay inflation likely resolve gradually economy continue expand trend. firms' move raise wage gradually begin spread, suggest result annual spring labor-management wage negotiation 2018. although 8 effect technological progress, example, may strengthen, increase wage expect become evident, tight labor market condition continuing. upward pressure sale price thereby likely increase, happen service sector, din out, increase distribution cost result labor shortage may ease competition retailer online retailers. households' tolerance price rise also expect increase effect rise labor productivity non-regular employees' wage level spread regular employees' wages. i mention early medium- long-term inflation expectation le unchanged, result opinion survey general public's view behavior release bank show proportion respondent answer price would go one year increase trend -- indicate change people's perception price (chart 9). these point suggest that, yet sufficiently firm, momentum toward achieve price stability target maintained, year-on-year rate change core cpi likely increase gradually toward 2 percent, although take time expected. specifically, median policy board members' forecast year-on-year rate change core cpi present july 2018 outlook report 1.1 percent fiscal 2018, and, exclude direct effect schedule consumption tax hike, 1.5 percent 1.6 percent fiscal 2019 fiscal 2020, respectively (chart 6). ii. conduct monetary policy a. quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control let turn bank's monetary policy. follow introduction qqe april 2013, bank pursue qqe yield curve control since september 2016, strengthen framework qqe. by control short- long-term interest rate -- so-called yield curve control -- bank facilitate formation yield curve, term structure interest rates, 9 appropriate achieve price stability target 2 percent. in theory, economic activity stimulate maintain observe real interest rates, obtain subtract inflation expectation nominal interest rate, low level natural rate interest, real interest rate economy neither accelerate decelerates; output gap improves, upward pressure price generated. this mechanism bank assume operate. there still way go achieve price stability target, due various factor i mention earlier. let note, however, japan's economy continue expanding, effect monetary ease thoroughly demonstrated. in situation, i believe path rise wage price start appear. for development take hold, i consider appropriate resolutely continue powerful monetary ease qqe yield curve control sustain situation output gap positive territory long possible, lead achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. b. challenge address continue pursue monetary ease there two important challenge address resolutely continue current powerful monetary easing. the first maintain public confidence bank's monetary policy, even prolong monetary easing, clarify future policy stance aim achieve price stability target 2 percent. at late monetary policy meet (mpm) hold july 30 31, 2018, bank decide introduce forward guidance policy rates. specifically, strongly commit intention "maintaining current extremely low level short- long-term interest rate extend period time, take account uncertainty regard economic activity price include effect consumption tax hike schedule take place october 2019." i believe help strengthen bank's commitment achieve price stability target. second, situation inflation take time rise current monetary ease thus need continued, possible impact monetary policy japanese government bond (jgb) market financial institution must monitor even 10 closely. even effective medicine come side effects, sense, candid assessment area monetary policy exert effect become crucial. (1) impact monetary policy jgb other market first, japan's jgb market indeed regain stability response bank's monetary policy decision release july 31. nevertheless, development give rise concern market function deteriorated. specifically, decline amount jgb transactions, number day inter-dealer transaction newly-issued 10-year bond settle grow unprecedented pace since begin 2018. moreover, long-term interest rate often use barometer economic activity, instance japanese long-term interest rate merely follow rise overseas long-term interest rates, include unite states. give developments, market participant voice concern function financial market may decline -- term "fair price formation mechanism" buyer sellers, "signaling effects" economic barometer. speak experience someone work market long time, interest rate essentially determine market. thus, change bank's stance that, even framework yield curve control, impact market bank encourage interest rate approach target level yields. however, give transaction carry within specific narrow price range prolong period line bank's target level 10-year jgb yields, number market participants, include wide range investors, arbitragers, speculators, become limited, restriction place incentive transactions. i believe one factor behind recent development jgb market. at late mpm, upon maintain target level 10-year jgb yield around 0 percent, bank make clear that, target, long-term yield "may move upward downward extent mainly depend development economic activity prices." movement among long-term yield may assume double range around plus minus 0.1 percent since introduction yield curve control. this range seem acceptable consider recent development 10-year government bond yield major economy (chart 10). 11 some may argue effect monetary ease could weaken even slight rise interest rate levels. at present, however, new loan individual corporation extend major financial institution mostly base link short-term interest rates, regard corporate bond issuance -- medium- long-term fund mean -- amount outstanding domestic straight bonds, include issue bank insurance companies, 60 trillion yen. therefore, even long-term yield move within wide range 10-year jgb yield rise somewhat response bank's recently implement policy measure, effect financial institutions' lend corporate bond market likely limited. in fact, rise expect enhance sustainability bank's monetary ease policy (chart 11). let add bank purchase jgbs promptly appropriately event rapid increase yields, intend level yield rise result recently implement measure. moreover, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) amount outstanding increase annual pace 6 trillion yen 90 billion yen, respectively. the bank work enhance flexibility sustainability current monetary policy framework, state "may increase decrease amount purchase depend market conditions" view low risk premia asset price appropriate manner (chart 11). (2) impact monetary policy financial institution it important monitor closely possible effect continue low interest rate jgb markets, also financial institutions. the net income financial institution support realization gain sale bond asset stock investment trusts, well reversal allowance doubtful accounts. however, financial result fiscal 2017 indicate that, type financial institutions, net interest income decrease domestic lend margin narrowed, unrealized gains/losses hold bond debt security deteriorate response rise u.s. long-term interest rates. 12 follow lead major banks, financial institution proceed effort improve business efficiency introduction various labor-saving technologies, include ai, suggest still room increase profitability cut costs. nevertheless, benefit effort may take time materialize. it go without say monetary policy conduct solely sake financial institutions, also must acknowledge financial institution play key role pass effect monetary policy economy. therefore, careful attention continue pay change business condition financial institutions, include regional institutions, affect financial system financial intermediation function. c. future conduct monetary policy let discus salient point regard future conduct monetary policy base objective effect policy impact jgb market financial institution i outline far. prudence require conduct monetary policy; decision must make weigh medium- long-term positive effect unintended side effects. when policy side effect accumulate extend period, risk may prove difficult even late deal unintended consequence materialize. that say, must focus time frame monetary policy produce positive effects, also time frame side effect build up. conduct monetary policy call multi-faceted approach take aspect consideration. at least now, i believe financial institution japan whole strong resilience stress term capital liquidity, stability financial system maintained. however, facilitate formation appropriate yield curve, bank take particular account development economic activity price well financial conditions, indicate qqe yield curve control introduce september 2016. a bank resolutely continue current monetary ease policy, conduct monetary policy appropriate manner momentum toward achieve price stability target maintained, examine relevant risks. economic activity, prices, monetary

asturias, 31 august 2018.* * *it pleasure la granda course asturias. in remark today, i would like toreview economic development euro area, explain recent monetary policydecisions reflect necessary reform economic monetary union, emu.recent economic developmentseconomic growth euro area remain solid broad-based, confirm latestdata. preliminary figure show real gdp grow 0.4% quarter-on-quarter secondquarter 2018.in first half 2018, growth weaken high rate last year, partly reflectinglower exports, compound temporary supply-side constraint national global level.although growth slow early anticipated, expect expansion continue. in fact,the current expansion short length small size historical averages. it haslasted five year real gdp 10% trough first quarter 2013. inthe past, growth phase lasted, average, seven half year trough peak, withgdp increase 21% period.while risk surround euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced, uncertaintiesemerging increase global protectionism, finalisation brexit negotiation andvulnerabilities emerge market become visible month ago.the ongoing expansion lead strong employment gains. since begin recovery,around 8.4 million job created. euro area unemployment decline 8.2% july, thelowest level almost ten years. this particularly relevant spain, unemploymentdeclined almost 11 percentage point peak crisis, 15.4% currently. almosttwo million job (1.9) create since start recovery.thanks recovery labour markets, consumer spend still robust. the steady rise incompensation per employee increase household disposable income. moreover,consumption benefit easy transition unemployment employment andincreased job security. low unemployment push disposable income thosewho find job, also reduce perceive risk job loss, give

turn future, notably governance emu.emu governancethe ecb’s monetary policy measure introduce since 2014 essential supportingthe robust recovery pave way inflation return towards objective. similarly, theremoval institutional structural factor contribute crisis helpedmaintain recovery. nonetheless, architecture emu still incomplete many ways.further reform need make financial sector stable. a euro area’s financialsystem predominantly bank-based, complete bank union remain key priority. wegladly welcome agreement european stability mechanism, esm, backstopfor single resolution fund. if implement swiftly, create confidence theeffectiveness resolution make sector whole stable.most importantly, need make headway establish third pillar bank union,the european deposit insurance scheme, edis. ongoing discussion hold onthe premise risk reduction must come risk-sharing.however, substantial risk reduction already take place. the significant banks’ commonequity tier 1 ratio – key indicator bank health – 67% high tenyears ago. and reduction non-performing loan toxic asset portfolio ofsome large bank way.moreover, risk-sharing help reduce risks. in envisage steady state fully mutualisedfund, edis would reduce risk bank run allow full fungibility deposit across theeuro area, thereby mitigate risk financial fragmentation. edis would hence help containmarket panic crisis hit reduce fallout taxpayers, cost bear thebanks themselves. risk-sharing risk reduction thus mutually reinforcing.at time, need make progress develop genuine capital market union.deep well-integrated

during last 10 year since time, global financial market face affect various negative political economic shock european debt problem first half 2010s. japanese stock future market immune turnover cash stock trade volume stock future sluggish time global financial crisis (chart 1). thereafter, however, background recovery global economy solid corporate performance, global financial market rebound

user-friendliness take meet diverse need investor firm include introduction new products, extension trade hours, it system reform. those initiative vital maintain enhance function japanese exchange since crisis, i would like pay tribute work hard carry initiatives. move on, 30 year since stock index future first appear japan, let u take opportunity return basic re-clarify function future contracts; future contracts, principle, use "transfer risks," namely hedge risk speculate price change trade asset future date predetermine price. in regard, derivative contract forward also function. however, two contract differ forward derivative contract base bilateral agreement two parties, future derivative contract trade "exchanges," include clear houses. future contract trade exchange

the decline market liquidity particularly evident bilateral over-the-counter (otc) derivatives. before financial crisis, otc derivative popular among customer seek high profit bilateral flexibility otc derivative enable various customize structure achieve high yields. however, financial crisis occurred, suddenly great deal concern counterparty credit risk financial institutions, particularly

non-centrally clear contract subject high capital requirements. 4 accordingly, many otc derivative contract shift exchange trade clear ccps (chart 2). however, could give rise several issues. for example, concern change might increase moral hazard among market participant give directly bear counterparty credit risk le incentive monitor credit risks. what more, perhaps crucial point, exchange clear house would face concentrate risk accommodate otc derivative contract reflect need market participant mitigate counterparty credit risks. accordingly, exchange clear house must appropriately manage mitigate concentrate risk future derivative contract trade exchange would process stable manner another global financial crisis. to end, also important exchange clear house ensure appropriate level loss-absorbing capacity assessment base stress testing.2 technological innovation second, i would like mention effect innovation field financial technology. the remarkable development information technology recent year dramatically accelerate order processing. for example, stock market tokyo stock exchange, new "arrowhead" trade system, launch january 2010, enable order process millisecond -- speed could never match human ability. against background technological innovation, grow presence financial market so-called high-frequency trade (hft) players, use automate algorithm repeatedly execute small order extremely high speed frequency. the prevalence hft might differ somewhat geographically, example, view share hft stock market reach around 50 percent unite state around 40 percent europe. that share also increase japan, number contract execute co-location area stock 2 for detail global discussion regard concentrate risk financial market infrastructure due tighten financial regulations, see "seisankikan wo meguru global na taiou ni tsuite (global approach central counterparties)," payment settlement system report annex series, august 2017 (available japanese only). 5 market tokyo stock exchange reach around 40 percent (chart 3).3 equally, view share hft japanese stock future reach somewhat high level due introduction it system design high-speed order processing. positive assessment hft summarize follows. first, view hft improve market liquidity hft player engage "passive market making" investor simultaneously place vast amount "buy" "sell" order order exploit arbitrage opportunity bid-ask spreads. second, hft theory expect constrain stock price fluctuation thereby reduce volatility sell order place price rise even slightly buy order place price decline. in fact, empirical analysis verify improvement market liquidity decline volatility.4 at time, argue hft could reduce market liquidity contribute volatility event sudden shock great impact forecast algorithms.5 some also voice concern risk large volume irrational order could place result human error unintentionally embed algorithm.6 3 it believe hft players, require fast access transaction milliseconds, usually place order co-location area (special area build host primary system exchange market participant install server contain trade algorithms). 4 see, example, "kabushiki shijyou ni okeru kousoku kouhindo torihiki eikyou (effects high speed frequency trade stock market)," bank japan review, no. 13-j-2, january 2013 (available japanese only), provide theoretical summary hft analysis effect japanese stock market. 5 in spite popular view one time attribute "flash crash" u.s. stock market may 2010 hft, joint report u.s. security exchange commission (sec) u.s. commodity future trade commission (cftc) conclude crash directly cause hft, rather complex combination factors. however, report also point hft player accelerate price fluctuation rapidly withdraw liquidity propagation market turmoil. 6 in august 2012, many stock new york stock exchange experience "mini flash crash" due massive number erroneous orders. the erroneous order attribute system issue cause human error. 6 a i mentioned, assessment hft entirely positive. it therefore important consider measure initiative ensure grow presence hft player contribute enhance market efficiency liquidity appropriate arbitrage market-making activity result transaction speed competition. for example, risk high speed frequency trade amplify price change due one-sided algorithmic trade malfunction program server leave unattended, might impair financial market stability, turn weaken risk transfer price discovery function future markets. tackle issue mean easy task, critical properly consider measure prevent them. the specific measure deal issue implement exchange alone also rest regulation hft factors. that said, advent hft grow presence hft player financial markets, various self-imposed requirement exchange trade associate financial technological innovation role exchange risk management monitor become increasingly important. increase use future asset management third, i would like briefly touch effect widespread movement use future asset management. participant future market broadly divide three classical categories: (1) hedgers, hedge price risk underlie assets; (2) speculators, take price risks; (3) arbitrageurs, seek arbitrage spot future markets. however, last 10 year since global financial crisis, future market witness grow presence new investment player take long position medium long term, investment trust exchange-traded fund (etfs). the increase use future asset management, addition hedge speculation, view favorably provide household option portfolio selection. furthermore, grow presence new buyer medium- long-term investment horizon could increase market depth future markets. it expect would enhance market liquidity, thereby improve risk transfer price 7 discovery function future markets. however, diversity market participant impair due grow presence particular investor type, price might cease appropriately reflect fundamental behind transaction might excessively affect trade strategy employ investors. in fact, grow share investment trust etf future market affect correlation different asset types. a typical example effect observe price formation overseas commodity future crude oil. since global financial crisis, large amount investment fund flow commodity future market pursuit high yield background global monetary relaxation. in process, commodity become embed global portfolio large investor extend across multiple region assets. in general, event exogenous shock, global portfolio rebalancing move multiple risky asset price direction. in regard, example, return commodity index future show little sign correlation global stock index least middle 2000s. however, wide range investor start incorporate commodity asset portfolio since financial crisis, correlation return commodity index future stock index structurally increase (chart 4). in long run, impact future price stem price fluctuation asset classes, addition correlation future price price underlie assets, could affect risk transfer price discovery function future markets. in sense well, important increase number market player also gather diverse set investor various invest style investment horizons. i hope increasingly wide range investor great investor diversity would continue observed. conclude remark i far elaborate new trend future market bring significant environmental change since global financial crisis challenge bring trends, focus three perspectives: (1) tighten financial regulations; (2) technological innovation; (3) increase use future asset management. none 8 challenge i mention today would easy tackle, i believe function future markets, offer benefit financial market many years, would develop maintain market participant take challenge adapt new environment, do last 30 years. the bank japan obtain information future market valuable understand markets' view sentiment toward economy corporate performance. the bank, central bank japan, would provide support research study participation discussion home abroad japanese future market would develop efficient stable manner. thank attention. ahmed naseer: the need

country's economy, i would like thank american chamber commerce invitation express high consideration business role country's economic development. i believe topic conference good come time bank sector make great progress improve condition sustainable finance economy, namely businesses. *** kosovo's bank sector recent year considerably increase role finance economic growth country, accelerate loan growth rate, significantly reduce loan interest rates. ease lend standard reduce loan interest rate serve important incentive increase loan demand, result annual loan growth 11.6 per cent october year. this indicate access finance, long report business one main barrier business development, undergo continuous improvement. this notice growth lend sector economy previous period limit access bank financing. accord late data october 2018, loan grant bank sector business amount eur 1.7 billion which, compare period five year ago, increase 45 per cent. the lend structure economic sector start improve compare previous periods, although room great diversification loan portfolio favour sector great potential generate faqe 2 nga 5 economic growth. currently, 50 per cent total loan issue enterprise represent loan trade sector. during year, agricultural sector manufacture sector among sector high increase loan received. however, total amount loan grant sector continue low. the share manufacture sector total loan enterprise october 13 per cent, loan agriculture sector account 4 per cent total loans. since today's topic relate role bank sector country's economic development, i would like emphasize fact great support sector economy, also sector great potential generate economic growth, indispensable order sustainable economic development. however, also aware diversification bank sector's loan portfolio depend loan supply largely dependent loan demand. in context, i would like emphasize bank high financial potential lend growth, ease loan standards, significantly reduce cost access bank finance. in october 2018, average loan interest rate 6.6 per cent, represent great improvement compare previous years. the decline loan interest rate clearly visible sectors, include loan agricultural sector, interest rate decrease 7.5 per cent, compare 16.7 per cent five year ago; industrial sector, interest rate decrease 5.8 per cent, compare 12.2 per cent past; also service sector, average interest rate decrease 6.3 per cent, compare 11.1 per cent five year ago. faqe 3 nga 5 improvement condition access bank finance also note regard aspects, ease loan approval standards, reduce collateral requirements, extend loan maturity term. however, order great lend sector currently low access bank financing, improve loan supply enough, rather also necessary demand sector loan high good quality. i would like say comprehensive approach need identify support development sector major importance country's economic development. we believe important step increase support sector undertake kosovo guarantee fund established. so far, total value loan guarantee fund reach eur 71.3 million distribute 1,836 micro, small medium enterprises. *** in order bank sector serf sustainable finance country's economic development, basic prerequisite sector sustainable. on occasion, i would like confirm kosovo's bank sector continue stable base indicator financial soundness. the main focus good quality loan portfolio, reflect good credit risk management banks, also serve important indicator favourable economic environment operation bank kosovo. in september year, non-performing loan ratio 2.8 per cent, reflect good condition loan portfolio quality. there numerous factor contribute good quality loan portfolio, amongst important one i consider macroeconomic stability, legislative

jansson venue: insurance sweden, stockholm 1 [24] monetary policy le favourable time – options?∗ to say past decade transformative monetary policy scarcely exaggeration. many central bank cut policy rate exceptionally low level find way conduct monetary policy adjust interest rates. in countries, include sweden, policy rate also pass zero bind consider absolute minimum level long ago, enter negative territory. despite policy, recovery whole slow and, all, inflation low long time. this lead policy rate many country remain record low level sev-eral years. the need keep policy rate low due financial crisis 2007–2008 ensue euro crisis require expansionary monetary policy. an equally important explanation real interest rate level around world trend several decades, largely independent financial crisis. real interest rate currently record low level (see figure 1). the downturn real interest rate sign global, so-called “neutral”, rate interest fallen. the neutral interest rate normally refer real rate interest neither expansionary contractionary effect economy.1 central bank cannot influence neutral interest rate must consider adjust policy rates. it relationship neutral interest rate determine expansionary contractionary partic-ular monetary policy is. by cause short-term real interest rate temporarily deviate neutral interest rate, central bank affect resource utilisa-tion inflation via different channels. ∗ i would like thank mikael apel assistance text speech, emelie theobald help diagrams, elizabeth nilsson translation english kerstin af jochnick, björn andersson, meredith beechey österholm, charlotta edler, rebecka hallerby, stefan laséen, åsa olli segendorf, marianne stern ulf söderström helpful comments. 1 for detail description, see instance kaplan (2018). 2 [24] one important problem neutral interest rate currently low monetary policy le scope stimulate economy necessary, difficult cut policy rate much would required. moreover, esti-mates neutral interest rate drive force usually indicate remain low fairly long time come.2 this raise difficult question short slightly long perspective. in slightly long perspective, question arise internationally, mainly research circle also extent among central banks, whether cur-rent inflation-targeting policy could reform replace another mone-tary policy framework make easy counteract economic downturn recession future.3 the aim find framework reduce risk able make monetary policy expansionary may sometimes necessary. but reform monetary policy framework something do hastily. the experience inflation target recent decade favourable never good idea “throw baby bath-water”. there therefore reason also consider short perspective, one assume monetary policy framework change time yet. within scope current framework, give monetary policy situation arise crisis, every reason begin examine opportunity exist deal next economic downturn – whenever may occur. so i intend talk two subject today – condition deal next economic downturn reform monetary policy frame-work possible change framework discuss internationally promise i ass be. let begin first subject. the condition deal next eco-nomic downturn the picture paint swedish analyst present regular economic downturn imminent (see figure 2). but nevertheless much sug-gest wise prepare le favourable time arrive sooner ex-pect; recent somewhat shaky signal regard economic activity europe, uncertainty regard effect trade conflict brexit, tension euro area large indebtedness imbalance emerge market economies. but despite word warning, reasonable start point course development come year largely lead forecaster believe. 2 see, instance, rachel smith (2017). 3 one example central bank world wilkins (2018) indicate issue next time bank canada’s monetary policy framework evaluated, 2021. 3 [24] the repo rate somewhat high give this, expect repo rate raise least somewhat be-fore le favourable time arrive. most swedish forecasters, include riks-bank, expect repo rate 0.5–0.75 per cent end 2020. until then, almost analyst believe growth slow down, extent swedish economy enter regular economic downturn 2021. there course guarantees, thing look moment. neither possible anyone say soon 2021 downturn may oc-cur. it could come soon after, year later.4 now 0.5–0.75 per cent particularly high level repo rate, one look historical point view. but hand, history may informative case downward trend global real interest rate recent decades, i point out. it therefore difficult know currently neutral, “normal” level repo rate. what one say certainty much low 10–15 year ago. but even take account, repo rate 0.5–0.75 per cent appear particularly high economic downturn occur early 2021. how much interest rate usually cut economic downturns? in sweden, easy clear idea float exchange rate inflation target 25 years, long enough experience many economic cycles. it exchange rate float one use policy rate counteract economic downturn – exchange rate fix policy rate principle lock defend cho-sen exchange rate. a couple rate-cutting phase period also little unusual. what happen 1996 particular, repo rate cut almost 9 4 per cent, largely question confidence inflation target become establish enable substan-tial cut policy rate. the substantial rate cut connection global fi-nancial crisis, 4.75 0.25 per cent within course year, also spe-cial, crisis kind fortunately rare (see figure 3). in unite states, long history float exchange rate, usually estimate policy rate cut around 5 percentage point eco-nomic downturns.5 it reasonable assume sweden, small open economy, large share adjustment economic downturn come exchange rate case unite states. let u say, without claim scientific exactness, would desirable cut repo rate 2.5–3 percentage point normal economic downturn. if downturn occur begin 2021 policy rate cut 4 rudebusch (2016) show probability economic upturn break increase proportion time lasted. however, case economic upturn prior second world war. 5 see, example, summer (2018). 4 [24] 0.75 –0.5 per cent, cut would 1.25 percentage points, much le estimate 2.5–3 percentage points.6 raise repo rate ammunition ready? here i like briefly touch particular question i go on. if one concern repo rate sufficiently high next economic downturn comes, one raise suitable level now, preventive measure – ammunition available needed? this argu-ment sometimes put forward general debate. but unfortunately number problem argument. firstly, economy course affect interest rate increases. growth would slow inflation would fall. if one raise rate quickly sub-stantially, one might even cause economic downturn one ultimately aim-ing prevent. but even case then, secondly, probable scenario would inflation nevertheless fell substantially, perhaps 1 per cent lower, is, level year ago. this could turn mean credibility inflation target question economic agent would begin expect inflation average would 1 per cent rather 2 per cent. the effect would practice target low 1 per cent. with low expect rate inflation nominal interest rate economy, include repo rate, average lower. this mean future economic downturn distance repo rate low bind may small before. if repo rate hit low bind earlier, remain long periods, le effective tool counteract economic downturns. it even difficult bring real interest rate low one might need. the essence “preventive” increase repo rate would ultimately result ammunition, less. it therefore important increase repo rate make way inflation tangibly low confidence inflation target put risk. cut repo rate further? another possible mean counteract economic slowdown cut in-terest rate −0.5 per cent level far low point. it may possible go even low − instance, policy rate swit-zerland −0.75 per cent. but personally i think possibility fairly limited. it may much question purely economic aspects, rather feasible accord social convention possible create understand for. during period negative repo rate, individual face negative interest rate thus need pay money bank. 6 i assume –0.5 per cent, is, low level riksbank ever cut repo rate, low bind much rate cut. this assumption course discussed, i shall return shortly. 5 [24] but repo rate become sufficiently negative, may happen. on theoreti-cal level, one argue policy would powerful great effect economy – so-called monetary policy transmission mechanism would function better. but also risk lead various type problem. a i see it, big problem economic argument usually raised, general public want empty bank account hold cash instead. hold save cash is, come it, troublesome costly give people sweden get use live with-out cash would natural thing do. the threshold would probably relatively high here. the main problem, i see it, another one. a couple year ago i hold speech i explain necessarily unnatural negative nominal interest rate negative real interest rate, is, interest rate discount inflation.7 unlike negative nominal interest rate, negative real in-terest rate arise every then. the reason one might think big difference usually purchase power concern us. if one lend money, one able consume le before, case negative real interest rate negative nominal interest rate. in case negative real interest rate, inflation high in-terest one receives, one therefore unable buy much sum money one receive borrower. when nominal interest rate nega-tive, one say negative return write contract start. but see term purchase power, negative nominal interest rate different negative real interest rate. since i hold speech negative repo rate two years. my experience communication negative interest rate be-come easier, i think would case. although negative nominal in-terest rate unnatural economic term negative real interest rate, evident former, unlike latter, perceive go social economic conventions. i therefore strongly suspect would dif-ficult foster understand policy mean individual “pay save”. this perhaps limitation one must simply accept. ultimately, legitimacy of, confidence in, independent institution like riksbank base general public understand policy conducted, least consider illogical unjust. this mean i say refrain use scope seem hold repo rate negative level situation necessary avoid major cost economy. but limit far rate cut. and, i said, view would difficult cut rate low people force pay money bank. do expectation affect future repo rate? if one cut repo rate far one consider possible, one also try af-fect expectation future repo rate among economic agent way 7 jansson (2016). 6 [24] stimulate demand. what i mind strategy usually term “lower-for-longer” “makeup strategy” advocate previous chairman federal reserve (the u central bank) janet yellen.8 the idea pretty straightforward. let u assume central bank reces-sion cut policy rate far consider possible. exactly low interest rate set obvious assessment vary country country. the federal reserve usually regard zero low bind talk “zero low bound”, sweden countries, cut policy rate zero, talk “effective low bound”. for sake simplicity i refer simply “lower bound” policy rate. let u assume central bank would actually need cut policy rate low low bind monetary policy become sufficiently expansionary. to compensate able this, central bank instead hold policy rate low bind long period time (see figure 4).9 see slightly long perspective, instance ten-year period, give roughly average policy rate one able cut rate low bound. if economic agent aware central bank apply strategy interest rate low bound, regard credible, long in-terest rate adapt roughly way low bind comprise limit.10 if one us reasonable assumption demand economy solely dependent current level policy rate also depend interest rate long maturities, give central bank possibility stimulate economy even time policy rate low bound. one advantage makeup strategy apply within frame-work current inflation-targeting policy. however, condition work predictable element central bank’s policy. if one wish ap-ply strategy, would therefore good idea formalise advance mean strategy document describe central bank act situa-tion interest rate low bound.11 in moment i discus specific application makeup strategy. moderately strict odyssean forward guidance? when central bank try give economic agent idea policy rate develop, know “forward guidance”. in sweden riksbank publish quantitative forecast repo rate. this call academic litera-ture delphic forward guidance, reference oracle delphi, 8 yellen (2018). the expression “lower-for-longer” usually ascribe reifschneider williams (2000). 9 for detail reasoning, see instance söderström westermark (2009). 10 this follow so-called expectation hypothesis, briefly say long interest rate de-termined expectation future policy rate. 11 yellen (2018) proposed, instance, could do unite state mean revision federal open market committee’s “statement long run goal monetary policy strategy” publish separate supplement, “committee guideline implement policy zero low bound”. 7 [24] think able see future. how well strategy function de-pends successful central bank predict future interest-rate policy. if forecast policy rate often correct, common economic agent believe central bank's forward guidance. but forecast policy rate accurate, forward guidance take le seriously. and unfortunately seem quite difficult forecast policy rates. if economy hit shocks, often case, fore-casts accurate. our experience sweden illustrate problem clearly. both riksbank market often make substantial overestimate repo rate forecast (see figure 5).12 although market's forecast good riksbank's period 2011–2013, pattern essentially – sub-stantial overestimate inaccurate forecasts. a brief remark order here. sometimes one get impression de-bate riksbank produce inaccurate repo rate forecasts, analysts, include market, quite successful. apparently, case. one may perhaps object market may produce forecast own, merely assume riksbank follow repo-rate path. but experience period 2011–2013 indicate really case. i think useful picture bear mind. if one want implement makeup strategy situation repo rate low bound, probably necessary use convince approach delphic forward guidance. the alternative delphic forward guidance call odyssean forward guidance. this name also take greek mythology refer odysseus, men tie mast would tempt song siren steer ship towards cliffs. in term monetary policy, strategy le dependent accuracy forecasts; instead case commit oneself deviate interest-rate development one indicated. but odyssean forward guidance also problems. bind oneself partic-ular monetary policy matter may one hand indicate strong deter-mination thereby effect expectations. but hand, policy may appear obstinate unrealistic. if event occur cause policy appear inappropriate directly harmful, difficult implement it.13 and one deviate strategy one firmly undertake follow, one hardly appear credible try apply next time. when apply makeup strategy, le strict odyssean forward guidance might mean central bank – accordance predetermine clarify prin-ciples – make clear hold policy rate low bind in-flation, perhaps measure development real economy, 12 for detail analysis riksbank’s experience publish repo-rate forecasts, see sverige riks-bank (2017a). 13 see, instance, bernanke (2003). 8 [24] attain particular level. in case, one make unconditional com-mitment make one’s behaviour depend certain

market rate financial price various channels.15 what one nor-mally talk signal channel – work purchase signal monetary policy expansionary repo rate remain low bind long time, portfolio balance channel – mean purchase contagion effect price asset pre-mium channel – work purchase reduce supply bonds, push bond price interest rate fall. a new monetary policy tool, give rise extensive academic re-search attempt estimate effects. the common conclusion policy function le expect complement policy rate cut useful way.16 one problem sweden become difficult use government bond purchase tool next economic downturn riksbank already own large share outstanding stock government bonds, 40 per cent. these available trade market, contrib-utes make market le liquid mean take long make transac-tions. the problem manageable far, large share riks-bank owns, great problem likely be. it may also case expansionary effect purchase gradually declines. of course, riksbank eventually taper holdings, probably slow pace.17 the riksbank therefore probably substantial hold government bond long time come. all all, mean limit regard opportunity use purchase government bond monetary policy tool go forward. my assessment probably pos-sible increase purchase little but, i said, limit. buy government security completely unnatural step central bank normally try affect economy adjust short-term risk-free interest rate, monetary policy rate. buy government bond mean one 14 the federal reserve bank england different occasion use conditional forward guidance. i apply strategy year ago i emphasise monetary policy discussion i intend vote favour raise repo rate long cpif inflation accelerate exceed 1.5 per cent (see, instance, sverige riksbank, 2014). a well known, happen time. the fact monetary policy decision often take committee complicate circumstance context. 15 see instance alsterlind et al. (2015) detail description. 16 see, instance, weale wiedalek (2016) de rezende (2017). 17 see article “the riksbank’s strategy gradual normalisation monetary policy” sverige riksbank (2017b). 9 [24] also try affect credit risk-free interest rates, via premium channel, alt-hough interest rate short long maturities.18 despite measure term “unconventional”, one say type monetary policy intervention follow standard way think one limit oneself try effect risk-free interest rates, “ground plate” inter-est rate set economy. the idea is, adjust repo rate, effect spread other, high risk interest rates. however, course also possible, although riksbank yet do so, buy financial asset government bonds. the federal reserve, european central bank, bank england bank japan, instance, also purchase different type commercial securities, include mortgage bond corporate bonds. unlike purchase government securities, often entail direct intervention higher-risk assets. the market interven-tion take place experience “positive fund effect”, interest rate market concern become low relation com-mercial market issuer market question find “safe” lender. this type measure therefore require detail considera-tion moreover knowledge different commercial market function interlink part economy. therefore, surprise purchase commercial security of-ten use serious problem particular market risk problem negative effect econ-omy whole. for example, federal reserve purchase large amount mortgage bond market threaten cease functioning, could serious consequence credit supply household sector. purchase commercial paper thus principle different type measure purchase government paper. but definitely comprise possible tool use need arises, even riksbank. natural fiscal policy play large role all all, riksbank thus without mean counteract next eco-nomic downturn. but hardly possible claim opportunity good were, say, 15-20 year ago, neutral interest rate still relatively high plenty scope cut repo rate. depend next downturn occur deep is, thus risk mone-tary policy suffice come counteract it. a i see it, implication look upon division role stabili-sation policy. there long tendency, sweden abroad, claim almost default, float exchange rate job monetary policy fiscal policy stabilise economic activity. perhaps 18 for economy sustainable public finances, government bond credit-risk free. the interest rate long maturity government bond reflect path expect short-rates compensation risk re-lated horizon investment liquidity bond market. 10 [24] time, light experience follow crisis, qualify picture somewhat. in way, course, fiscal policy always contribute stabilise economic activ-ity. for instance, system tax expenditure often design automatically adapt economic developments. example progressive income tax unemployment benefits. on hand, long scepticism use so-called discre-tionary fiscal policy – direct decision adjust tax public expenditure – aim stabilise economic activity. one problem discretionary fis-cal policy measure often implement effect late various delays, therefore aggravate economic fluctuation rather stabilise them. another perhaps even great problem type fis-cal policy historically tend use generously therefore cause problem sustainability public finances.19 but may reason consider condition today somewhat dif-ferent couple decade ago. a i point out, one new circum-stance central bank great difficulty counteract economic downturn cut policy rate, low bound. another change, especially sweden, public finance much good con-dition before. the fiscal policy regulation introduce cri-sis begin 1990s contributed, together good growth, swedish gross public debt decline 70 80 per cent gdp mid-1990s around 40 per cent today. thus, prospect use fiscal policy counteract economic downturn much good nowadays. however, obvious form would take. in unite kingdom, propose bank england’s monetary policy committee indicate prevent low bind stimulate economy much consider appropriate.20 it propose situation committee state much would want cut policy rate. the unite kingdom's treasury invite implement fiscal policy meas-ure choice replacement rate cut. the treasury take note proposal, also ignore it, publish response. if treasury take advice, office budget responsibility (equivalent swedish fiscal policy council) ass whether measure compatible sus-tainable fiscal policy. the idea thus discretionary fiscal policy measure shall replace mone-tary policy stimulation bring low bound. some argue would effective economically reliable 19 soon turn millennium, committee investigate stabilisation policy conduct event sweden introduce euro (swedish government official reports, 2002). the committee con-sidered normal economic fluctuation would enough allow automatic stabiliser work discretionary fiscal policy would use case unusually large disruptions. the reason committee reach conclusion type problem. 20 see yates (2017). 11 [24] mechanism try achieve effect through, instance, pur-chase financial assets.21 it open question whether similar solution might function sweden. one condition one bear mind, british proposal emphasises, use discretionary fiscal policy always entail balance act. sweden's cur-rently strong public finance provide protection shocks. for time long affect financial premium result credibil-ity problem economic policy. this seen, instance, fact difference ten-year government bond yield sweden germany much le (see figure 6). the fact interest rate exchange rate vary relatively little despite dif-ficulties form new government also regard indication swedish economy enjoy high level confidence. the fiscal policy frame-work introduce crisis 1990s central stability im-portant safeguard it. create confidence take long time, lose quickly. have say this, course feel reassure fiscal policy room manoeuvre, even one would prefer use it. the role fiscal policy play therefore uncomplicated question. but i think nevertheless important question stabilise economic activity riksbank's possibility unlimited bring economic policy agenda.22 before i go on, may worth emphasise yet another alternative stim-ulating economy sometimes mention – know “helicopter money” – also require interaction monetary policy financial stability. in brief, helicopter money involve government increase public expenditure cut tax fund permanent increase money stock.23 however, i choose ignore alternative involve considerable legal complications. international debate change mon-etary policy framework a i mention start, discussion research circle among central bank whether current inflation-targeting policy re-formed, replace monetary policy framework, con-ditions counteract economic downturn recession good future. this rather interest discussion, least people promi-nent ideological debate monetary policy influential policy-makers somewhat vary view solution appropriate. i 21 see, instance, stirling (2018). a aside here, worth mention also macropru-dential policy tool could principle use stabilisation purposed. however, main task macroprudential policy significance measure exaggerated. 22 see also fiscal policy council (2018). 23 see, instance, bernanke (2016). 12 [24] already mention janet yellen argue one might perhaps need make many change current framework might suffice makeup strategy, central bank follow formalise plan mean interest rate hold low bind long time. temporary price level target yellen's predecessor chairman federal reserve, ben bernanke, pro-posed solution regard special application makeup strat-egy.24 this base central bank certain circumstance target inflation, instead development price level. the differ-ence may appear subtle, inflation change price level, po-tentially quite important. let u assume inflation target target increase price level 2 per cent. if, inflation-targeting regime, one inflation rate undershoot 2 per cent target period time, central bank's task bring back target. the fact inflation deviate target important – “bygones bygones”. but instead develop-ment price level target inflation deviate 2 per cent, must “made for”. the principle thus yellen's makeup strategy, one clarify advance target refer price level rather inflation. the difference price level target inflation target illustrate figure 7.25 if something unexpected occur inflation-targeting regime cause inflation low target, enough bring inflation back 2 per cent (the bottom right figure). express term path price level, thus sufficient slope (upper right fig-ure). it matter new path original one. but one in-stead price level target, one must return early path (upper leave fig-ure). this mean inflation must 2 per cent period time compensate early period (lower leave figure). one advantage price level target may thus economic agent ad-just expectation way anticipate low inflation rate today compensate expansionary policy, fast growth high inflation future. the downward pressure real interest rate cause alleviate original downturn production inflation speed future recovery. this may course particularly beneficial period low bind set restraint. one disadvantage price level target central bank cannot disregard, “see through”, supply shock temporary push inflation. a one need return path price level, period unusually high inflation – regardless cause – must follow contractionary policy hold back price development contribute period unusually low inflation. the 24 see bernanke (2017a). 25 the figure take andersson claussen (2017), review different alternative inflation target-ing. 13 [24] negative supply shock may already affect production employment negatively monetary policy must also tightened, effect no-ticeable. this make difficult central bank credibly commit strategy. however, variation propose bernanke, central bank would al-ways price level target, interest rate cut low low bind bind – thus temporary price level target.26 in normal case central bank ordinary inflation target 2 per cent, like today. the central bank’s communication way continue fo-cus inflation target. at low bind temporary transition price level target explain communicate term keep policy rate low bind average inflation since date pol-icy rate first hit zero least 2 percent.27 one advantage price level tar-get apply low bind one avoid problem need compensate supply shock temporarily push inflation, one would need price level target always applied. bernanke’s proposal temporary price level target therefore regard special application yellen’s “makeup strategy”, one aim make “makeup” mechanism specific potentially credible formalise term temporary new target definition central bank. high inflation target a proposal olivier blanchard, former chief economist interna-tional monetary fund (imf), one strong advocate raise cen-tral banks’ inflation targets.28 the idea straightforward. with high inflation target, say 3 per cent, nominal policy rate would average 1 percentage point high compare inflation target 2 per cent, assume new target credible. there would therefore 1 percentage point reduce rate reach low bound. an increase inflation target 4 per cent would increase scope reduce policy rate another percentage point, on. however, argue raise target good idea. one fear high inflation would mean inflation would also vary more, indeed ap- 26 see also, instance, evans (2012). 27 one might also therefore call approach temporary target average inflation. a target average infla-tion strategy reminiscent price level target, nevertheless different certain aspects, see nessén vestin (2005) andersson claussen (2017). 28 see, instance, blanchard, dell’ariccia, mauro (2013). example others advocate ball (2014), krugman (2014) rosengren (2015). even janet yellen say time chairman federal reserve question whether inflation target raise “one im-portant question face monetary policy around world future” (federal open market committee, 2017, p. 14). 14 [24] pear case look historical data. this could lead great un-certainty, make difficult household company make economic decisions.29 surely, sufficiently high level inflation difficult claim infla-tion still low stable. but confidence target 3 4 per cent way target 2 per cent, obvious reason infla-tion vary more. the historically negative covariation level stability inflation likely reflect fact period high inflation also period clear anchor inflation form inflation target. whether inflation rate 3 4 per cent still regard low ques-tion judgement. personally, i think one say is. i return proposal raise inflation target shortly. target nominal gdp growth a proposal central bank target growth nominal gdp. larry summers, former unite state secretary treasury active debater many economic policy issues, one advo-cated this.30 nominal gdp measure reflect price volume. growth nominal gdp principle sum change prices, word in-flation, growth output volume, is, real gdp growth.31 one advantage sometimes highlight nominal growth target “automati-cally” take account real economy monetary policy case put much emphasis growth real economy inflation. when real gdp growth low, central bank conduct expansionary policy maintain nominal growth target – vice versa growth high. a i see it, however, decisive difference relation flexible inflation targeting, nor-mally take account real economy way stabilise economic activ-ity. in long-term perspective, one view nominal growth target mean-ing central bank implicit target inflation, give growth po-tential economy. for instance, target nominal gdp growth 5 per cent growth potential 3 per cent implicitly entail inflation target 2 per cent. one advantage put forward basis nominal growth target provide desirable adjustment even long-term 29 see cecchetti schoenholtz (2017). for detail review different type criticism, see yellen (2015) (footnote 14) bernanke (2017b). 30 summer (2018). however, interest note one summers’ argument favour target nominal gdp growth (of 5-6 per cent) it: ”would attenuate issue around explicitly announce high inflation target, i think little problematic political economy grounds”. example advocate scott sumner jeffrey frankel (see, instance, sumner, 2011 frankel, 2012). another var-iation target instead concern level nominal gdp. for discussion target definition i take here, see andersson claussen (2017). 31 inflation case measure accord so-called gdp deflator. 15 [24] change economy. if, example, growth potential declines, proba-ble neutral real interest rate fall. but low growth potential mean nominal growth target one also high implicit inflation target, turn make easy attain negative real interest rate expansionary monetary policy situation needed. the effect would thus similar increase inflation target i talk ear-lier.32 a number disadvantage nominal growth target also put forward. one fairly major problem nominal gdp publish long time lag revise substantially often. the fact data revision substantial illustrate figure 2, see outcome adjustment quarterly basis often around 1 percentage point case lot this. in u data revision appear somewhat smaller, even question substantial difference preliminary adjust figures. this naturally create major difficulty monetary policy target express way. another problem inflation expectation risk poorly anchor nominal growth target. inflation probably vary quite substantially explicit quantify level inflation help anchor expectations. there ultimately risk prompt deterioration condition price-setting wage formation. this important argument, especially country like sweden, instability wage formation previously major problem. finally, argue would much difficult communicate target nominal gdp growth actually entail communicate target inflation. my reflection amendment framework the fact different proposal amendment monetary policy framework advocate among well-reputed economist show advantage disadvantage none clearly good others. personally, i believe, i say beginning, one need think care-fully change current framework all. one must certain one come end road, probably yet, i see it. for instance, many problem i take resolved, least al-leviated, global neutral interest rate rises. although people believe low long time come, also believe up-turn far away.33 32 disregard long-term argument obvious target nominal gdp growth contribute resolving, even alleviating, problem interest rate’s low bound. 33 for example, goodhart pradhan (2017) say global demographic trend come decade turn around downward trend global neutral interest rate. 16 [24] high inflation target natural development but i nevertheless force take stand, i would say i lean towards raise inflation target natural mean develop monetary policy framework. when come it, inflation-targeting policy function well long time, problem arise difficulty make policy sufficiently expansionary, result low bound, financial crisis. raise target would solve, least reduce, problem. it would also affect one parameter framework would entail extensive revision it. this mean would necessary try convince explain merit new system deal potential adjustment cost teethe problems. it always advantage hold much old system possible, case i think would good idea. would economic agent accept inflation rate 3-4 per cent? i think would, especially would entail le negative interest rate future – something know experience perceive unnatural problem-atic several ways. it could also reasonably mean would le probable one need employ purchase various financial asset complement policy rate cuts. although criticism part policy may sharp criticism negative interest rate, still arisen. a i say before, claim riksbank create liquidity problem participant government security market, also over-stepping mark begin conduct fiscal policy. if new asset purchase concern asset government bonds, possibility riksbank's hold government bond substantial foreseeable fu-ture, criticism would probably intensify. make monetary policy intervention aim various risky market rate i say completely different matter limit oneself intervention government bond yields, like normal repo-rate policy concern risk-free interest. but realistic assume inflation target 3-4 per cent possi-ble? when come it, central bank difficulty attain current target around 2 per cent. my view obvious limit come choice level inflation target, case regard percentage talk about. inflation determine long run monetary policy conduct average effect policy inflation expectations. establish “truths” kind certainly reconsider revise then, refute extensive comprehensive theoretical empirical evidence. there evidence available present. in addition, inflationary pressure recently begin rise last several country appear enter situation similar normal prior financial crisis.34 34 jansson (2017) contain detail discussion possibility monetary policy continue attain-ing inflation target. 17 [24] temporary price level target – tempt probably com-plex one practical complication raise inflation target would diffi-cult individual country move away prevail norm 2 per cent.35 one problem, least point view communication, country follow example would high target world around u would mean, else equal, ex-change rate constantly weakened. from perspective, would perhaps easy individual country begin apply temporary price level target bernanke advocated. this mean inflation target conduct usual normal time tar-get definition modify low bind reached. for economists, proposal temporary price level target probably tempt-ing many ways, question whether would function practice. i rather doubtful. the purpose proposal get inflation expectation rise “automatically” policy rate reach low bound. this would push real interest rate thereby increase probability low bind create many problems. but work require lot communication central bank well economic agents’ ability take comprehend temporary change formulation target. such change could even counterproductive would become dif-ficult rather easy understand monetary policy involves. raise inflation target would course also entail problems. however, as-sessment easy affect inflation expectation state clear figure aim at. there number early example possible practice. admittedly, usually concern bring inflation expecta-tions, simple task either. not least case sweden, strong headwind considerable doubt would succeed. my important message let conclude briefly summarise important messages. in short term, within current framework, riksbank number tool counteract next economic downturn. but low neutral interest rate, com-bined need conduct expansionary policy recent years, may create certain problems, depend soon downturn come deep is. in situation riksbank's monetary policy scope unlimited, important question economic downturn shall counteract economic policy agenda. there currently large reserve fiscal pol-icy, use unproblematic. if low real interest rate persist, may long run become necessary modify monetary policy framework 2 per cent inflation target 35 it fairly common, especially among emerge market economies, low inflation target confidence inflation-targeting regime increases. however, example country raise inflation target (see, instance, apel, armelius claussen, 2017). 18 [24] central bank currently apply. of various proposal circulate interna-tional debate, i currently lean towards raise inflation target best option. at time would alleviate problem repo rate cannot always cut much needed, also relatively undramatic straightforward. but mean something i feel soon. a fairly major problem difficult make kind change inde-pendently countries. but always good well-prepared advance therefore worth start think possible modification already to-day. reference alsterlind

measures, global bank system resilient. for example, compare toearlier decade, common equity tier 1 risk-weighted asset internationally active banksstand around 13%, 7% before. their leverage ratio average 6% now, fromless 2% previously.implementation post-crisis regulatory reforms7 we also remember global bank regulatory standard minimumrequirements. national supervisor use lever basel framework apply higherstandards additional requirement banks, appropriate, base idiosyncraticconsiderations.8 there general consensus financial system safe before. but follow-on question be: safer, yes – system safe enough?9 to say regulator address go wrong would great hubris. indeed,this contrary evolve adaptive nature financial activity. the reality arecurrence financial crisis economic history. i would add amount regulation andsupervision prevent crises; regulator seek reduce likelihood andnegative impact one. this require bank regulator remain vigilant emergingrisks, hence importance forward-looking supervision complement regulations.10 on hand, last global financial crisis become distant shadow sorts,there already call “this time different” dial enhance regulatoryrequirements – crisis it.11 two week ago, forum international conference bank supervisors, sirjohn vickers (who oversee vickers report reform uk bank market) share hisviews basel iii capital requirement stringent enough, sufficientlyreduced likelihood crisis intended. i say view mas. i amsure many banker disagree. but point area deserve ofgreater discourse.12 evaluate effect bank reform key exercise. one set issuesrevolve around whether reform intend outcome or, hand,whether unforeseen undesirable effects. this involve assessment banks’behavioural responses, whether new form arbitrage strategies, spillovereffects broad economy.cross-border lend develop economies13 one example relate impact cross-border lend develop economies.14 there study indicate global bank reduce presence andactivities develop economy part business review, attribute thisto bank reforms. establish clear, causal link decline trend cross-border bank loan develop economy post-crisis reform helpful, ifpossible.15 such investigation support basel committee’s work full, timely andconsistent implementation reform globally.the increase role market-based finance credit provision16 the decline bank inflow develop economy partially offset 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech economy rely market-based finance, non-bank financial intermediation. in myview, positive development since diverse fund system comprise bank-basedfinance market-based finance possibly good meet change need realeconomy. 17 but increase prominence market-based finance also lead concern thatlarge redemption open-ended fund potentially pose liquidity risk hencedestabilise financial markets.18 international organisation standard-setting body financial stabilityboard (fsb), international organisation security commission (iosco) baselcommittee seek ass potential financial stability risk pose market-basedfinance. the fsb, example, develop set policy recommendation address structuralvulnerabilities open-ended funds, iosco review recommendations.19 there relate area merit investigation, include academia.for example, interaction market-based finance traditional asset managementactivities, effect underlie market invested.evaluating impact macroprudential policies20 a key element basel iii reform macroprudential framework ass newsystem-wide risk use countercyclical capital buff warranted. in addition,macroprudential policy become integral many central banks’ policy toolkits. variousjurisdictions asia singapore, hong kong, indonesia use macroprudentialmeasures reduce risk domestic financial system dampen impact ofeconomic shocks, application loan-to-value limit mortgage borrowings.however, detail impact macroprudential policy arguably le well understood.21 there research challenge regard. for example, bank internationalsettlements (bis) highlight impact tool likely vary across jurisdiction basedon domestic circumstance phase financial cycle. a key focus area bestto study spillover impact across jurisdiction macroprudential policy decision point ofview.22 another challenge relate effectiveness. macroprudential tool largely beenemployed recent years, isolate effectiveness measure requirefurther studies.23 in context, may remiss mention apparent artificial divide hasexisted analysis financial vis-à-vis real side economy. during thegfc, i recall criticism economist use mathematical model sufficientlyfactor critical role bank financial institution play economy.24 since then, important stride made, include workhorse dynamicstochastic general equilibrium (dsge) model use central banks, good capture keyinteractions financial sector rest economy. this pertinent forregulators central banks’ work economy-wide forecasting, policy analysis scenariosimulation. i would also encourage research area, include develop empirically-validated feedback relationship embed model stress test purposes.evaluating impact fintech25 turn recent pet topic interest – fintech. much write reportedon technology innovation continue disrupt business models. there alsomany view around disruption job socio-economic relationships. 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech 26 let make brief comment mas’ regulatory stance towards innovation infinancial services. for innovation new technology-based business model take off, itmust purposeful value creating.27 for example, fintech entity enter financial inclusion space,especially rural areas, boost economic growth.28 there examples. robo-advisory service allow investor great access tocustomised, low-cost financial advice. other initiative like open bank provide potentialbenefits broad range consumer allow easy portability data paymentinstructions. the use distribute ledger technology, blockchain, may replace traditionalcentral party system intermediary create alternative trust platforms. suchblockchain-based immutable transaction account record may help facilitate cross-bordertransactions, cut cost settlement time without compromise security andcertainty.29 there contradiction regulation safety prudence vis-à-vis regulationsthat open to, supportive of, good financial innovations. these may new businessmodels use technology promote competition, improve customer experience orsimply efficient pleasant delivery services. so far adopt luddite instinct,many financial regulator fact set dedicate team support monitor newfintech developments.30 but innovation era, fintechs also bring new risks. in thisregard, international organisation international monetary fund, fsb, iosco thebasel committee produce several useful public report potential risks.31 a example new risk typologies, may increase vulnerability anti-moneylaundering effort counter finance terrorism, give anonymity digitalcurrencies. cyber-security another area fintechs vary size risk managementcapabilities. there also increase macro-financial risk contagion,procyclicality, excess volatility give increase speed financial transactions, newnetworks relationships. open bank ease move fund also lead topotentially destabilise movement money, pose liquidity risks.32 i welcome research study guide developments. it probably earlyto determine whether fintechs bigtechs may change behaviour incumbentfinancial institutions. it also unreasonable expect traditional business line betweenfinancial services, general commerce telecom increasingly blur – activitiesmay concentrate big institution superior competitive advantage include theareas talent, customer base, customer data. the faangs bat world – thetechnology giant – come mind. these may also implication financial stability.indeed, next systemically important institution could bigtech root e-commerce,and therefore, whether entity require form oversight financial regulator infuture.33 with increase use artificial intelligence (ai) various form data analytics(da), another area focus around governance use. the ma recentlyreleased guide co-created industry partner set principle forfairness, ethics, accountability transparency (or feat) use “aida”. whether andhow increase use machine-learning system (both supervise unsupervised),algorithms data-driven insight affect behaviour decision-making financialinstitutions rich area research attention. regulator generally like idea ofdeploying smart system good job risk detection risk management. but whatabout business decision say, personnel decisions? whether ai-driven system willperpetuate bias discrimination also ripe extensive studies. 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech 34 another field research work around central bank digital currencies, use thebuzz word, cbdc. globally, discussion potential implication ofcbdcs, still relatively green field thinking. i delve subject canbe seminar theme itself.conclusion35 a realised, i flag question answer evening. i thinkthe post-crisis financial landscape excite time economist, analyst researcherin support financial market development, well help shape policy review thinking.many development i touch rapidly evolving, also mutuallyexclusive one another.36 there view accept central role incorporate belief andexpectations understand shape financial market developments. new advance inbehavioural economics provide tractable psychologically-founded model beliefsto integrate standard analytical framework finance macroeconomics.37 it important policymakers regulator firm grasp interaction anddevelop new technique calibrate policy mitigate risks.38 the ma therefore welcome opportunity engage research community,hopefully many you, knowledge, expertise research rigour, candeepen collective learn understanding.39 a example, recently collaborate asian bureau finance economicresearch (abfer) nu

check against delivery thank invite speak today. in age partnership discontinued, wall build be-tween countries, i find important focus considerable ad-vantages society continue development rule-based international cooperation offers. i choose talk three topical issue which, separate ways, relate cross-border cooperation essential fi-nancial stability denmark. they are: anti-money laundering, crisis reso-lution mortgage credit institution bank union. but first i would like express appreciation good cooperation many areas. you contribute strongly process connect danish krone target2-securities. it great step forward danish bank able settle security via single european settlement platform. many also help launch kronos2, jointly achieve significant result payment council. in fsor, increase cyber resilience financial sector, agree perform sophisticate test resilience individual institu-tions come year – know red team tests. ----- unfortunately, money launder everyone's lip 2018. a simple search infomedia show danish word "hvidvask" use four time frequently year 2017. 3 december 2018 page 2 6 we witness extensive misuse financial infrastructure il-legal activities. there still need strengthen effort area. at danmark nationalbank interest issue money launder jeopardise financial stability. customer investor con-fidence essential prerequisite provide financial services. so, loss confidence harmful bank. if confidence single participant eroded, may rapidly impact rest sector. the reputation authority country may also severely affected. this become clear imf annual meet oc-tober i receive many enquiry money launder chal-lenge danish financial sector. bank play key role financial infrastructure. and role come important social responsibility. a responsibility ensure business use illegal activities. the number suspicious transaction report anti-money laun-dering secretariat soar recent years. if continues, au-thorities face huge task relation handle volume re-ports. there indication line defence far back. they reach long report become necessary. in words, bank knowledge customers. a payment system become fast efficient, para-mount importance bank in-depth knowledge cus-tomers. it role authority investigate case money launder suspicion illegal activities. but come that, bank responsibility engage customer relationship real motif customer dubious. the political agreement strengthen anti-money launder effort denmark conclude autumn necessary. but money launder know borders. cross-border activity call strength-ened cross-border supervision eu. so, essential also enhance european cooperation. that pro-vide far good overview activity international bank groups. and also enable build-up strong competence area. page 3 6 ----- now i turn attention another topic. something i talk previously. resolution mortgage credit institutions. my interest topic purely academic. i witness near-death mortgage credit institution 90s, i know others present today share experience. it make impression – presumably also you. so, i would like reiterate: one key lesson learn fi-nancial crisis must possible manage crisis financial sector without use government funds. it must possible large, systemically important institution continue case experience problems. they perform function critical society essential financial stability. how ensure this? well, one precondition sufficient owner creditor fund absorb losses, also know eligible liability funds. a know, danish mortgage credit institution exempt minimum requirement eligible liability funds, mrel. instead, must meet debt buff requirement. in danmark nationalbank's opinion, bad idea. and still think so, even though thing change since i last address you: since then, legislative amendment introduce sifis include mortgage credit institutions. for them, sum mrel capital debt buff requirement must constitute least 8 per cent total liability funds. the amendment step right direction. however, solve problem; still sifis requirement sufficiently high institution recapitalised continue crisis situation. furthermore, problem current requirement mortgage credit institution risk-sensitive. the mrel is. it increase risk increase, typically bad times. that need mrel mortgage credit institutions. and good news. at danmark nationalbank calculat-ed cost introduce mrel mortgage credit institution 8 per cent requirement. and cost negligible. page 4 6 our calculation show sector's total cost range kr. 100 200 million. the institution finance reduce cost dividend payments. if choose raise administration margin instead, cal-culated cost equivalent average increase le 1 basis point administration margins. surely low price pay ensure mortgage credit institu-tions resolve without jeopardise financial stability taxpayer funds? a i see it, right thing do. i would like wake morning, drink cup coffee know make right choice society. do away exemption also give authority option use resolution fund required. my final message regard resolution this: precondition credible resolution financial institution handle without knock-on effect sector overall. i would like make clear danmark nationalbank essence mortgage bond suffer losses. fortunately, bank recovery resolution directive – brrd – provide solution: pos-sible exclude certain liability fund write converted. that case mortgage bonds. instead, must sufficient eligible liability funds. that mrel mortgage credit institutions. ----- anti-money launder crisis resolution rule – two topic i talk far – example area bind international cooperation offer clear advantages. the government envisage next autumn final decision make danish participation bank union. what would mean term anti-money launder resolution fail bank mortgage credit institution denmark join bank-ing union, might ask. page 5 6 about anti-money laundering, supervision still matter na-tional authorities. when come crisis resolution, single insurance element bank union important, probability invoke low. however, number good reason denmark join bank union. the union establish sake bank serve interest citizens, firm financial stability. and de-velopment single market financial services, strengthen competition. for banks, increase competition may advantage. but citizen firm clear advantage. the ecb's single supervisory mechanism, ssm, exist four year prove strong capable supervisory authority. the ssm bring together strong skill analytical powers. this necessary effective supervision large banks, com-plex, operate across border use sophisticate models. the ssm necessarily give bank latitude. but under-pins financial stability. in context, parallel anti-money launder-ing also relevant. the case see illustrate international activity require response form close bind international collaboration authorities. the great change denmark join bank union dan-ish bank subject ssm supervisory practices. the impact direct large banks, supervise ecb via instruction danish financial supervisory authority. the small bank still supervise danish financial supervisory authori-ty within framework define ecb. participation bank union give denmark say relation single supervisory practice via participation ecb's supervisory board. and via ecb voice influence basel committee financial stability board, key body design financial regulation. page 6 6 those danish participation bank union often argue danish taxpayer bank customer risk foot bill bank e.g. greece italy fail. at danmark nationalbank study aspect closely. the heart matter joint liability bank union participant likelihood invoked. our reply structure bank union mean joint liabil-ity apply extreme loss scenarios. the joint liability kind insurance disaster, result regular flow fund bank union member states. we one concern end bill others ought pay. the structure bank union practice characterise euro area member states' handle euro debt crisis reflect precisely concerns. very large influential euro area player share view ensure move far wrong direction. reluctance transfer fund member state see connection crisis resolve within bank union now. most recently, see italy provide government support – without use fund member states. the joint liability already part bank union form single resolution fund, srf, build also contain protective elements. this mean loss scenario must reach late stage srf activated. and finally, also establish single deposit insurance scheme apply connection extremely large loss only. irre-spective single deposit insurance scheme designed. this mean single insurance element matter. but mean conclusive argument danish participation bank union. let sum i say emphasise rule-based interna-tional cooperation best solution cross-border challenges. not least small country like denmark. thank you. bankofghanaest.1957 launch of the cyber security directive for financial institution a safe digital

launch of mobile money interoperability phase ii speech deliver by dr ernest y. addison governor, bank of ghana ghipss, accra november 28, 2018 1 his excellency vice president, alhaji dr. mahamudu bawumia, the minister communications, the board management ghipss, ceo ghana chamber telecommunications, ceo telco financial institutions, invite guests, media, lady gentlemen. good morning 1. it's honour witness launch second phase mobile money interoperability (mmi) project. this undoubtedly another major milestone quest deepen financial intermediation inclusion; digitize economy level play field bank unbanked. 2. a recall, first phase project launch may, 2018 tremendous success. i must state though 2 significance project lose u outset, international commendation subsequent launch, underscore uniqueness novelty global payment industry. 3. before proceeding, let acknowledge thank his excellency, vice president, alhaji dr. mahamudu bawumia vision, unflinching support dedication conception homegrown project initiate bank ghana way back 2007 full implementation today. also, i would thank banks, mobile money operator fintechs strong collaboration ghipss bank ghana execution project. the zeal commitment exhibit successful execution project commendable signal good prospect develop inclusive, safe efficient payment ecosystem ghanaian economy. 3 4. it gratify note performance interoperability platform since implement first phase impressive base key pillar convenience, accessibility, value for money. since then, total transaction value volume increase gh¢8.3 million 96,907 respectively may 2018 gh¢32.6 million 319,094 respectively september 2018, represent 292.8 percent 229.3 percent growth value volume respectively. this growth trend expect increase second phase become fully operational innovative product service become available. 5. lady gentlemen, i please inform recent annual global policy forum alliance financial inclusion (afi) hold september 2018 sochi russia, ghana three (3) eight (8) awards, include technology award recognition interoperability project. a result 4 laudable achievements, host number visitor central bank african continent understudy project design implementation, visit schedule next year. 6. his excellency, lady gentlemen, completion second phase interoperability project, ghana achieve objective establish integrate interoperable payment ecosystem. all three (3) key national payment circuits, namely; mobile money, e-zwich gh-link interoperable, enable seamless movement fund across systems. 7. a develop digital financial ecosystem, integrity service delivery channel become paramount. transmission channel electronic payment guarantee security transactions. this achieve adherence 5 international best practice standard acquisition, deployment management channels. consequently, bank ghana draft guideline operation electronic payment channel provide framework management efficient secure transmission electronic transaction across various payment channels. we also must bear mind issue regard cyber security electronic transfer ensure proper structure system place handle threats. 8. with implementation second phase infrastructure, payment service provider would opportunity scale access financial service digital channels. however, strict financially inclusive society must ensure financial product accessible meet need different category customers. 6 9. currently, digital financial product available ghanaian ecosystem category savings, payments, investment insurance. credit product receive le attention thereby limit capacity unbanked underserved borrow economic activities. a deliberate concert effort develop electronic credit market therefore necessary promote financial inclusiveness. 10. in regard, bank work financial sector deepen (fsd) africa implement credit market diagnostic project. the project assist identify constraint credit delivery propose measure overcome them. this complement effort towards expand scope financial access bank unbanked society. 11. his excellency, sole regulator mobile money sector, central bank ensure right thing do various player sector. we continue regulate 7 monitor activity within space ensure participant play rules. the bank ghana key responsibility safeguard integrity financial system underscore trust central financial deepen development. it therefore critical ensure confidentiality transactions, privacy data collect operator space (including personal financial data), security transactions, smooth operation stakeholder regulator provide complementary service space. 12. the interoperability exist e-zwich, bank account mobile money wallets, offer participant endless opportunity develop various value add service public. let therefore challenge fintechs work closely banks, non-bank financial institution especially rural community bank come several product service bring bank financial transaction close public. i see endless opportunity 8 financial inclusion triangle i hope player also realise enormity opportunity presents. 13. to conclude, i wish thank stakeholder one way help full implementation interoperability project say future ghana’s financial inclusiveness cash-lite society well within reach. 14. thank attention. benoît cœuré: the role european union fosteringconvergencespeech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, atthe conference european economic integration (ceei), vienna, 26 november 2018.* * *this conference rename 14 year ago reflect “growing together europe”. in myremarks today i would like focus precisely three topics: growth, europe andtogetherness. i argue three element need accomplish treaty oneuropean union promises: economic social cohesion.i focus remark today economy central, eastern south-eastern europe(cesee), cover already part european union (eu) thatare eu candidate country potential candidates.i start brief review current state convergence cesee economies, thenexplain three key european policy area – completion single market, launch ofa true capital market union target use eu fund – help accelerateconvergence thereby also foster cohesion europe.the current state convergencecesee economy see significant improvement live standard past twodecades, absolute relative terms. since 2000, growth real gdp per caput hasaveraged 3.8% region whole, compare 1.4% eu-28. a result, haveseen economy make measurable welcome progress catch euaverage.but catching-up process neither linear time homogeneous acrosscountries. you see first slide.123456 1 / 16bis central bankers' speech clearly, countries, convergence towards eu-28 average practically stall sincethe outbreak financial crisis 2008 – difference yellow dot theupper end blue bar.and crisis, convergence noticeably fast economy already part ofthe euro area. in many economies, relative live standard increase half, 40 to50% eu average 2000, around 70% 2016. but one move right onthis slide, contrary neoclassical growth theory would suggest, le compellingstrong convergence becomes.in western balkans, example, relative income level increased, havedone much slow pace. at current growth rates, fast convergence towards eu-28average remain illusory many eu candidate country potential candidates.these economies, see next slide, would need much high gdp growthrates previous year even reach half eu-28 average within next 20 year orso, possible exception montenegro. 2 / 16bis central bankers' speech clearly, pace convergence disappointing. it imply live standard europe willremain highly vary uneven considerable period time, even within eu. and ifthere credible prospect lower-income country catch soon, risk thatpeople live country begin question benefit membership eu orthe currency union. such doubt would particularly worrisome unstable world arecurrently live in.we need eu remain force change, source growth development ananchor stability. action therefore need two main fronts: first, bring convergence ineu member state back onto pre-crisis path and, second, jump-start convergence eucandidate country potential candidates.to understand need do tackle challenges, useful look driversof growth factor recently hold back. you see mynext slide. 3 / 16bis central bankers' speech what see that, since crisis, growth cesee economy essentiallyslowed two main factors: sharp drop total factor productivity (tfp) growth and, toa less extent, contribution capital growth.there two thing worth highlight here.the first highly unusual pre-crisis convergence largely reflect technologicalprogress innovation. during transition phase, growth typically base capital andlabour accumulation, late tfp growth. or, borrow word paul krugman, itis base first perspiration late inspiration.the flipside economy face notable capital shortfall. the capitalstock per person employ remain substantially eu-28 average almost ceseeeconomies. you see next slide left-hand side.78 4 / 16bis central bankers' speech in cesee euro area member states, also remain well emerge economies,such south korea, similar per caput income levels. and, worse, investment rate havefallen since crisis cesee economies. you see right-hand side.the second fact worth highlight remarkable contribution productivity growth,both upswing downturn, likely artefact growth model adopt bymost cesee economies. this growth model relies, large, deep integration globalproduction chains.you see clearly next slide. cesee economy world’s mostintegrated. they far integrate global value chain eu peers, example.sizeable foreign direct investment (fdi) inflow pre-crisis period – see onthe right-hand side – promote role cesee economy global productionprocesses. these inflow account around 6% gdp run-up crisis. in eu-28 whole, fdi inflow account 3.4% gdp period. 5 / 16bis central bankers' speech the role fdi support tfp growth well known. by integrate local firm globalvalue chains, facilitate transfer technology expertise. the transfer technology,moreover, stop firm directly integrate global value chains, also extend totheir domestic supplier via local production networks.empirical evidence show that, case central eastern european (cee) economies,this transfer technology contribute strong tfp growth run-up crisisand recent slowdown.you see clearly next slide. there close link tfp growth incee economy tfp growth non-cee eu countries. this link likely reflect scale andscope technology spillovers. so, fdi inflow decelerate participation rate globalvalue chain level off, tfp growth cesee economy abate too.9101112 6 / 16bis central bankers' speech global value chain source tfp growth futurein sum, therefore, diagnosis highlight two key facts: cesee economy lack ofcapital, strong reliance global production processes.the easy answer, course, brush away weakness fdi inflow temporaryphenomenon. after all, law decline marginal return capital continue hold, weshould still expect capital flow catching-up economies, reboot tfp growth.i would somewhat cautious, however. it true weakness trade investment,worldwide, part collateral damage crisis. a leave legacybehind, headwind fade too.but recent shift also likely reflect development structural nature – is, theslowdown global value chain formation may well persist.there three main reason this. first, natural disaster increase climate-relateddisruptions lead firm rethink length design value chain mitigate therisks costly supply disruptions. this become increasingly visible may still amplify asclimate change take toll economies.second, past sizeable wage differential unskilled labour make internationalfragmentation production process worthwhile. some wage differential havenarrowed considerably emerge economy grow richer. in eu ceseeeconomies, example, real wage increase slightly 50% since 2000. in theeu-28, real wage grow 18% period.1314 7 / 16bis central bankers' speech and, third, increase use robot artificial intelligence potential turn globalvalue chain head cause firm reconsider offshoring practices.the second third factor may press ones.put simply, robot deliver output cheaply, efficiently close theconsumer, firm may few reason spread production across countries. by someestimates, average price industrial robot decline 40% past tenyears project fall considerably further. a survey boston consult grouprevealed 70% senior manufacture executive unite state think thatrobotics improve economics local production.the implication that, extent grow automation narrow wage differentialsmake outsource production process le profitable, policymakers ceseeeconomies, emerge market economy generally, need think aboutdeveloping growth models.to reboot tfp growth deepen capital accumulation need stimulate domesticinvestment spend help new, innovative industry grow develop. only waywill convergence towards eu-28 average accelerate.these joint efforts, however, bring second part remarks.europe help, three main ways. first, provide market make thedevelopment new industry profitable. second, channel fund sector countrieswhere capital use productively. and, third, provide direct financial assistanceto foster convergence support national reform efforts.reaping benefit single marketlet take point turn, start market dimension.the eu’s single market valuable source competitive advantage firm locate incesee economies, particular compete economy similar stage ofdevelopment.it large market world, offer benefit enormous economy scale, andhas help establish product safety standard use worldwide. there compellingevidence single market positive impact exports, investment, innovation andproductivity.to exploit full potential, accelerate convergence, two thing need done.first, member state need strengthen enforcement single market initiativestranslate concrete positive effect ground.a key ingredient efficient administration level government. indeed, lack ofreal convergence income level is, often not, result lack convergence ininstitutional quality. you see next slide – slide i like show i think itmakes compel point, notwithstanding usual caveat two-way causality betweeninstitutional quality income levels.151617181920 8 / 16bis central bankers' speech most cesee economy still low left-hand corner, mean remain asignificant gap overall institutional quality compare average level observe euas whole.some eu member state recently renew interest process lead toparticipation exchange rate mechanism (erm ii) adoption euro. this couldbecome fundamental catalyst institutional reform year come.second, scope single market must broadened.for eu, mean expand reach industry prime driver innovationand catalyst future growth.this particularly relevant cesee economies. a see next slide, ofthese country still classify modest moderate innovators. there somenotable improvement certain country time, others process graduallycatching eu peer appear stalled, even backtracked, recentyears. 9 / 16bis central bankers' speech the first priority therefore complete single market services, already account fortwo-thirds global gdp employment, represent many potential growth sector inthe age digitalisation automation.research escb’s competitive research network (compnet) shows, example, thatmany firm eu service sector far behind productivity frontier, particularly incesee economies. reallocate capital labour productive firm would help boostoverall competitiveness support employment.a second, direct, avenue increase effort build “european data economy”, os digital single market, also advocate european commission communicationlast week. digitalisation offer particularly promise opportunity catching-up economiesto leapfrog advance economy adopt new technology fast them, therebymitigating risk hurt reshoring premature deindustrialisation.convergence role capital market unionthe second key area europe help – close heart conference – isby channel fund use productively.there compel evidence importance finance technological innovation and,ultimately, long-run growth rates. difference quality financial intermediation acrosscountries find significant implication economic growth.in particular, research increasingly challenge view bank market-based financetend support economic development live standard similar ways.21222324 10 / 16bis central bankers' speech evidence grow globally large bank system associate systemic riskand low economic growth, particular country grow richer. in addition, recent work byecb staff highlight that, euro area sovereign debt crisis, capital misallocationincreased substantially among firm reliant bank finance.other research suggest deep equity market effective promote innovationand productivity and, hence, bring economy close technological frontier. recentecb research, example, suggest eu member state increase ratio ofstock market capitalisation bank credit 25th 75th percentile, average growthrate high-tech industry could expect increase 3.1 percentage points,everything else equal.none say bank become redundant. they continue play key socialrole pool save engage maturity risk transformation.but recent find increasingly reflect ongoing policy discussion. the europeanpush towards capital market union, example, reflect need increasedcross-border risk-sharing currency union, also hope deep better-integratedequity market support innovation productivity growth european union.this also include make new innovative financial technology available firm ensuringthey safe conventional technologies. europe spearhead process. europe’spayment service directive (psd2), example, revise introduce morecompetition financial intermediation require bank share account information newcontenders.china, course, prime example new financial technology support growth thetransition towards high income levels. although eu data requirement stringent – forgood reason – considerable scope technologies, use prudently, also fostergrowth convergence eu.on next slide see europe generally, cesee economy inparticular, technology yet gain much traction. in words, progresstowards true capital market union support fund investments, therebyhelping overcome current lack capital accumulation, and, time, foster useand distribution new financial technology may become source ofgrowth.252627282930 11 / 16bis central bankers' speech use eu fund foster convergencethe third area europe help arguably contentious one. it relate totransfers member state foster convergence eu.such transfer already happening, course. cohesion policy, design reduce structuraldisparities among region member states, second large item eu’s 2014-20budget. over period, see left-hand side last slide, thecumulated available fund cesee country range 8 21% average annual gdp,with allocation resource link prevail income levels. in words, fund arenot negligible. 12 / 16bis central bankers' speech one problem, however, country equally successful access them. onereason link importance institutional quality, i mention earlier. youcan see chart right-hand side, suggest positive correlationbetween institutional quality country’s ability effectively absorb available transfer andsecure new fund opportunities.such pattern even visible consider eu fund opportunity socialpolicies, education training. under european fund strategic investment plan, forexample, cesee economy able attract le 5% total fundingallocated social infrastructure projects.this mean two things.first, need strengthen ability receive economy access absorb funds. thisshould part broad effort improve institutional quality.second, eu allocation rule make simple possible. the european commissionhas already make several important suggestion respect, single rulebook plannedto cover several eu funds, le red tape light control procedure business andentrepreneurs benefit eu support. such initiative essential want people andcompanies take full advantage opportunity eu provides.conclusionlet conclude.3132 13 / 16bis central bankers' speech achieve similar standard live across continent speak highestaspirations. it recognition history economic prosperity, opportunity peacefulsocieties closely link mutually reinforcing. the prospect relative income level ineurope, without action, remain unacceptably large foreseeable future istherefore warn sign. it urge policymakers think new way howconvergence accelerated, role europe play process.i highlight today must begin acknowledge convergence require jointefforts responsibility. it require member state translate eu initiative andrecommendations concrete positive effect ground, candidate country andpotential candidate achieve institutional excellence early possible transitionprocess. convergence must build strong institutions. and adhere standards, eustandards, powerful vehicle growth.accelerating convergence also require eu, euro area particular, helpunderwrite process. this include complete single market, build new digital marketand serious develop true capital market union. transition

firm dynamic effect economic growth. two keynote lecture also delivered, i would like thank internationally renowned speakers, professor ufuk akcigit university chicago professor gian luca clementi new york university.there need underline importance study firm dynamic today. the recession follow global financial crisis hit whole world almost simultaneously ten year ago, though vary degree different countries. firm dynamic key explain difference impact. country-specific friction physiological exit entry firm market may severely limit growth prospect economy. italy case point, i discus later. in short run, affect affect business cycle fluctuation financial shocks.at moment time, year recovery, economic growth slow somewhat world. forecast make international organization currently reflect decline show conjunctural data. grow trade tensions, political uncertainty, expectation monetary stimulus gradually reduce main economic area world cite facts. in many advance economies, economic slowdown raise concern potential output, since recovery recent year accompany buoyant increase productivity might expected.that’s firm dynamic important ever before. innovation technology adoption many firm possible main source 4growth job economy, depend much process firm entry, survival, growth, exit market select efficient innovative players. new young firm drive input accumulation output growth. if productive firm thrive le productive one exit smoothly market, economic system work well. these idea old, date back least joseph schumpeter’s ‘creative destruction’ intrinsic part empirical analysis around world. indeed, thank effort several scholar research centres, among i would like thank oecd researcher conduct seminal firmdyn project, lot comparable data firms’ entry, growth exit market, entire age distribution, national system.these country-level indicator course deeply affect business environment policies. for instance, entry barrier direct indirect public subsidy firm trouble alleviate welfare cost crisis short term, may long-term negative effect firm selection economic growth. to take another example, judiciary work badly private contract difficult enforce, incumbent clear advantage entrants. finally, political system work badly, firm may escape competition thank political connections.finance also play role shape firm dynamics. new business need money, can’t always provide banks, riskiness venture scarcity collateral. venture capitalist right answer, yet contribution quite vary across countries. technological improvements, fintech label proxy, fill gaps, process uncertain uneven. for now, least countries, new young firm rely bank credit face tight capital constraints. if leave aside cross-country difference time-series analyses, notice decline business dynamism since early 2000s world: oecd countries, new firms’ entry rate significantly low begin century. what cause phenomenon? one may possible increase market power incumbents. another may fact technological change globalization increase ability productive firm gain market 45share. these two possible explanation markedly different policy implications. the scientific debate currently ongoing, workshop possible explanation discuss depth several presenters.recent research highlight firm dynamic may role explain long-term potential growth also business cycle fluctuations. the procyclicality entry rate could drive tight selection new firm downturns, slack entry requirement economy well. while phenomenon stylize fact, implication propagation

standards. we several specific dysfunctions, widespread tax evasion, political connection entrepreneurs, cronyism, distort competition economy, slow creative destruction firm churning, negative

today discus take note important topic country’s economy, would like express high consideration kosovo bank association, daily basis advance kosovo’s bank sector representation aspects. i consider topic conference fit raise time bank sector make quite significant progress improve condition sustainable finance economy. *** in last years, kosovo bank sector significantly increase role term fund country’s economic growth accelerate pace credit growth considerably reduce credit interest rates. the ease credit standard, follow reduction credit interest rates, serve important incentive increase credit demand, thus result annual credit increase 11.6 percent october year. this show access finances, long report business key barrier development businesses, constantly improving. the observe increase credit economy sector previous period limit access bank financing. the concrete example consider sector agriculture production, lastly among sector high increase accept credits. however, total amount credit issue sector still remain low. in october 2018, credit issue agriculture sector represent 3.8% total credit enterprises, whereas credit production sector represent 12.7% total credits. take due account fact today’s topic relate bank sector’s role fund faqe 2 nga 5 development, i would like emphasise great support economic sectors, sector high potential generate economic growth, fundamental achieve viable economic growth. nonetheless, aware diversification bank sector credit portfolio strictly rest supply part, rather great extent, also depend credit demand part. in context, i would like emphasize bank high financial potential increase crediting, ease credit standards, significantly reduce cost access bank financing. in october 2018, average credit interest rate 6.6%, represent significant improvement compare period long ago. these indicator show credit supply significantly improved. however, order ensure good credit sector currently low access bank financing, enough improve credit supply, also necessary ensure sectors’ credit demand high good quality. with i want say comprehensive approach need term identify support development sector great

would like reconfirm that, base financial soundness indicators, kosovo’s bank sector remain stable. i would like attach particular importance good quality credit portfolio, show bank’s good credit risk management, could well serve important indicator favourable economic environment bank operation kosovo. during september year, rate non-performing credit 2.8%, reflect good situation term quality

curaçao en sint maarten on occasion information session on: aml/ctf within international bank sector centrale bank van curaçao en sint maarten december 12, 2018 2 lady gentlemen, good evening, i would like express gratitude association international banker (iba) initiative organize important seminar title aml/cft within international bank sector. i please share open remark you. this year mark 10-year anniversary global financial crisis. if learn anything crisis, international cooperation policy coordination crucial shape sound, transparent, attractive financial system. a manage director international monetary fund (imf), christine lagarde, state “the time fix roof sun shining.” that say, wait (reputational) storm come way act agile. lady gentlemen, financial sector integral importance achieve sustainable economic growth. suffice say that, though contribution decline past 20 years, international financial service sector remain key economic pillar curaçao. the ifs sector generate 6% foreign exchange earnings, provide labor intensive high-skilled employment 1,000 persons, contribute approximately 6% gdp. in addition direct effects, sector indirect spillover effect across relate industries, include business, telecommunication, transportation, hospitality sectors. amid increase complexity financial transactions, become imperative financial intermediary international banks, keep re-inventing new innovative product services. simultaneously, supervisory role central bank ensure proper control prevent systemic collapse achieve market integrity. today, i would like touch upon history international financial service (“ifs”) sector, main challenge sector facing, achieve far, next step are. lady gentlemen, first allow take back history ifs sector. by mid-1960s curaçao become well-known international financial center purpose global tax planning. however, prosperity ifs sector come halt termination tax treaty unite state abolishment u.s. foreign withhold tax 1985. in addition, sector also negatively affect developments, negative connotation global tax plan increase bundle tax-exempt region. over past years, however, curaçao take several measure meet international standards. one main measure take enactment new fiscal regime 2002 full compliance policy organization economic cooperation development (oecd) fair tax practices. the new tax regime create line recommendation offer oecd, avoid label jurisdiction harmful tax practices, thus intend avert inclusion oecd’s ‘black-list’ non-transparent offshore jurisdiction 2000. lady gentlemen, let u continue main challenge ifs sector facing. with implementation global regulatory standards, include anti-money launder (“aml”) combat finance terrorism (“cft”) rules, bank face increase compliance cost 3 provide correspondent bank relations. in addition, tax information-sharing agreement also result cost bank add de-risking trend, result end correspondent bank relations. both domestic bank sector international financial service sector caribbean face challenge. a correspondent bank relation crucial financial institution caribbean, give limit access foreign financial markets. furthermore, without correspondent bank relation, caribbean financial institution cannot properly service clients’ accounts. recently, many correspondent bank terminate relation high perceive risk caribbean latin american region. in monetary union curaçao sint maarten, however, cbc inform correspondent bank effective implementation aml-cft regulations, positive assessment caribbean financial action task force (cfatf), lead favorable results. for example, jp morgan recently reinstate correspondent relation two major bank curaçao. the cbc continue effort toward correspondent relation attain favorable results, thus minimize de-risking effects. the cbc always active promote financial stability minimize risk via sound prudential conduct supervision. the cbc constantly strive way strengthen financial sector enhance quality effectiveness supervision. accordingly, promote high standard skills, integrity, good governance among supervise institution individuals. although substitute sound regulation, aware overregulation prevent jurisdiction maintain competitive position ifs sector. hence, another challenge face achieve proper balance effectiveness rule regulation one hand relate risk ifs sector other. to attain balance believe information-sharing collaboration among cbcs, government, ifs sector crucial. together strive continuously reform fiscal legal framework financial industry adapt ever-changing international business environment, thereby create confidence (international) public. lady gentlemen, i would like pay attention recent achievement area regulation supervision could help strengthen ifs sector. we successfully positively assess major standard-setting body past years, oecd, world bank, fatf, subsequently, implement recommendations. in addition, curaçao recently sign base erosion shift (beps) multilateral instrument (mli). currently, 117 country participate inclusive framework beps, represent 90% world trade. the standard adopt european union one requirement jurisdiction meet exclude eu-list non-cooperative jurisdictions. the cbc also recently entrust supervision security intermediary asset managers. finally, cbc process become signatory member international organization security commission (iosco). with positive development area regulation supervision, take step right direction strengthen ifs sector certainly benefit international bank sector. lady gentlemen, discuss history, main challenges, key achievement ifs sector, opinion, question remain is, next steps? the cbc understand 4 innovation change environment you, financial service providers, we, regulator supervisors, operating. with need process analyze ever-increasing volume, frequency, granularity data, prompt implement regulatory technology (regtech) supervisory technology (suptech) financial sector supervision increase effectiveness efficiency. in aim preserve foster reputation curaçao sound, transparent, attractive, reputable international financial center, strive achieve institutional agility adaptability guide financial sector new, technology-driven, era. research show 85% global fintech’s direct toward relate financial service business. this suggest financial service industry, especially international bank sector, likely considerably disrupt upcoming years. consider innovation new financial technology transcend border market international bank operate, take charge shape future regional global financial service provision. lady gentlemen, imperative i underscore cbc commit fight money launder terrorist financing, continue provide guidance financial sector combat abusive illicit practice within jurisdiction. the cbc currently update aml/cft provision & guideline (p&g). in addition, cbcs, financial intelligence unit curaçao (fiu), game control board (gcb) agree meet quarterly basis provide platform monitor trends, local threat vulnerabilities, new development area aml/cft. in 2022 jurisdiction subject fourth round mutual evaluation cfatf. a vital part preparation mutual evaluation national risk assessment (nra) identify, analyze, understand, address aml/tf risk curaçao. the nra track complete end 2019 provide jurisdiction sufficient time duly prepare next cfatf evaluation. allow close follow statement: “it always good compliant sorry”. i thank attention wish fruitful seminar. check delivery esteem colleagues, governors, it pleasure today address distinguish panel. before i start, let briefly thank host governor matolcsy valuable insights. build point raised, i would like give broad topic central bank cooperation somewhat specific twist. when talk institutional cooperation, especially within diverse group countries, indeed think numerous possible layer collaboration – simple capacity build information share complex aspect reserve management bilateral swap lines. yet remark i focus particularly emerge issue still get know – innovative financial technologies, fintech. i believe topic equal interest europe china. let’s look numbers. in first half year alone global investment fintech company hit 58 billion u dollars. in regard, europe china among lead market worldwide. even though i represent european side, i admit domain – level fintech adoption population – china way ahead european peers. while fintech rather new phenomenon central bank community, much already say write topic. i pretty sure well aware pro con associate financial innovations, i go detail issue. yet let briefly mention benefit risk bring fintech i find key. look benefit side, fintech offer possibility boost economic growth provide additional source credit, especially relevant smes. in fact, estimate 2024 global peer-to-peer market worth nearly 900 billion u dollars, grow roughly 50% annually. i must say – quite impressive trend, illustrate scale opportunity alternative fund source hold. financial innovation may also enhance financial inclusion. world bank data indicate 1,7 bn people globally still enjoy access formal financial system. fintech solution – mobile payment crowdfunding platform – play critical role regard, help ‘democratize’ access finance deepen financial markets. on top, fintech create instrument may use enhance efficiency financial sector regulation oversight. here i mind particularly possibility employ regtech suptech tool boost aml/cft compliance. with amount money launder globally range 800 billion 2 trillion u dollar year, fintech definitely lend help hand. move challenges, stand potential impact fintech broad financial system. by build novel consumer relationships, fintech firm put pressure operative model establish financial institutions. to precise, nearly 90% incumbent europe asia claim least part business model risk due rise competition innovators. this suggest traditional player either change, risk lose market share – even completely push game. yet establish financial institution need change. the regulator community face similar challenge. without adapt frameworks, risk sideline unable meet expectation – especially come issue like ensure financial stability. more regulator around world – include within 16+1 framework – seem realize this, tailor toolkits choose facilitate rather restrict innovations. a move towards regulatory flexibility, remain alert concern new risk stem fintech. this do, first foremost, cyber security. rely novel technological solutions, cloud computing, certainly offer efficiency gain financial entities. but also create additional headache regulators, critical ict infrastructure supervise institutions, well vast amount sensitive data expose hack form malware. apart this, essential keep close eye potential intensification macrofinancial risks. while currently fintech pose direct threat financial stability due limit overall size, situation may change rapidly leave unchecked, especially give rapid expansion sector. and hide build-up risk definitely outcome regulator would like see. fintech development also lately attract elevate attention international financial institutions. various risk map assessment opportunity embed financial innovation carry financial stability board, basel committee bank supervision key bodies. just last month international monetary fund announce fintech agenda, serve basis deep fund’s involvement field – primarily term coordinate coherent international approach towards fintech assist member country construct domestic policy frameworks. while multilateral response useful create grind spread best-practices across borders, authority must part domestically – especially bear mind international initiative still early stage. it therefore regulator choose standpoint fintech. in vein, i briefly present approach adopt implement bank lithuania. what position merely watchdog, also supportive regulator. in practice, attitude reflect format ‘newcomer’ program, one-stop shop new market entrants, provide consultation advice establishment, licence relate issues. we also recently launch regulatory ‘sandbox’, aim facilitate encourage development innovative financial products. at time, allow build know-how constantly upgrade

always act good faith, best available information cognizance current economic conditions, pursue price financial system stability, support job creation massive scale ensure inclusive growth economy. after wave scathing criticism trail past policies, many measure today widely applaud brilliant conscientious actions. a policymakers, perspective typically different many talk heads, data, information source outlook remain superior. i therefore enjoin critic avoid hasty condemnation policies. some policy take time bear fruit. 9. let point briefly explain macroeconomic geopolitical context central bank nation operating. 8 a quick overview 10. on global scene, number recent development noticeably impact outcome outlook especially emerge market economy include nigerian. these include: i. rise global interest rate due sustain tighten stance advance economy consequently unfortunately heighten fragilities, imbalance vulnerability emerge markets. the feed fund rate raise steadily 2.25 percent september 2018 promise one hike end 2018 three 2019. similarly, bank england raise policy rate august 2018 first time since 2008. some emerge market economies, include india, indonesia, mexico turkey also raise interest rate response shock; ii. the consequent huge capital flow reversal emerge market lead immense pressure 9 exchange rates, fx reserves, sharp loss capital markets. argentina, brazil, south africa, turkey russia already depreciate currency significantly due shock; iii. uneven fluctuation international price commodity include crude oil, gold, cocoa, etc. after hit $86 per barrel october 2018, oil price drop 30% november 25, 2018; iv. profound geopolitical trade tension (including u china, u iran, russia western economy etc.) impact dynamic global trade consequently flow capital; v. the rise incidence protectionism, nationalism, anti-globalization especially western hemisphere; vi. uneven growth global economy accompany tepid short-term outlook. 10 11. what likely implication issue nigeria? and step take avoid repeat economic slowdown occur 2016 2017? give structure economy, cbn’s attention primary focus three factors, including; • one, rise trade tension u china could taper global growth, extension demand commodity crude oil • second, ensure nigeria’s economy insulate adverse consequence face emerge frontier markets, due rise rate unite states. • third, likely impact crude oil market sharp rise u oil production, currently stand 11.7m barrel per day likely rise 14m barrel 2 years? 11 12. a may recall, nigeria’s political-economy experience significant challenge last year reveal structural deficiency particularly regard dependence crude oil, major source revenue foreign exchange, well dependence people import item even good could produce locally. the 60 percent decline crude oil price 2015 2016 help shape trajectory economy, ultimately trigger economic recession q1 2016. road recovery 13. the country’s overdependence crude oil fx revenue mean

evident rise value u dollar relative naira; rise consumer price index due increase cost import input goods. in bid contain rise inflation cushion impact drop fx supply nigerian economy, bank take three bold steps; 14. first, the cbn tighten money supply order contain inflation improve yield local bonds, attract attention foreign investors. second, analyze import bill encourage manufacturer

business nigeria. this lead set-up enable business committee pebec, chair his excellency vice president. pebec mandate unlock bureaucratic constraint business nigeria. the cbn pebec work together improve access credit underserved nigerians, set-up national collateral registry passage credit bureau act. a result initiative addition reforms, nigeria move 24 point world bank’s 2017 do business rankings. (145 167 2016) 18 key takeaway 21. the ongoing global tension well economic recession 2016 provide u key lesson step need take intend improve wealth base nation. our understand nature nigeria’s domestic imbalance indicate two key factor accentuate vulnerability global shocks. the first diminish total factor productivity nigeria due low inadequate infrastructural base. the second overdependence import capital good domestic consumption. 22. with regard inadequate infrastructural base, i aware ongoing effort make fiscal authority construct critical road network 2nd niger bridge, lagos – ibadan highway, abuja – kano road network, rail line port-harcourt - maiduguri, 19 itakpe - ajaokuta lagos – kano. these measure go long way reduce logistics cost business nigeria, open new market farmers, trader manufacturers. 23. with regard overdependence imports, economic recession trigger mainly drop crude oil prices, strengthen case need move nation wholly dependent consumption, nation produce large proportion needs, particularly area resource input need production widely available across country. this think process shape decision impose restriction access forex 41 item produce nigeria. 24. there considerable discourse particularly whether restriction access foreign exchange 41 item drive local 20 production, nay-sayers state constrain productivity growth economy. base internal research conduct central bank nigeria, strong support recovery economy recession may much weak even negative, without implementation restriction 41 items. our research support conclusion combination restriction 41 item along measure impose fiscal monetary authority help promote recovery. any attempt reverse course action may untold consequence growth trajectory economy particularly push diversify restructure economy. in fact, recommendation make cbn list 41 item expand include additional item locally produced. 21 25. second, many entrepreneur take advantage policy venture domestic production restrict item remarkable success great positive impact employment. the dramatic decline import bill increase domestic production item attest efficacy policy. noticeable decline steadily record monthly food import bill us$665.4 million january 2015 us$160.4 million october 2018; cumulative fall 75.9 percent imply save us$21 billion food import alone period. most evident 97.3 percent cumulative reduction monthly rice import bills, 99.6 percent fish, 81.3 percent milk, 63.7 percent sugar, 60.5 percent wheat. we glad accomplishment record far. accordingly, policy expect continue vigor underlie imbalance within nigerian economy fully resolved; 22 26. development finance: in continue recognition role agent development aim ensure self-sufficiency reduce nigeria’s excessive dependence imports, cbn invigorate development finance activities. we maintain particular focus support farmers, entrepreneur well small medium scale businesses, various intervention program anchor borrower program, nigeria incentive-based risk share system agricultural lend (nirsal) national collateral registry. the cbn recently introduce real sector support fund; facility mean provide cheap fund 9 percent new project agric manufacture sectors; aim boost output create jobs. 23 27. in agriculture sector, anchor borrower programme (abp) ensure nigeria emerge net importer rice become major producer rice, supply key market neighbor countries. a october 2018, total number 862,069 farmer cultivate 835,239 hectares, across 16 different commodities, far benefit anchor borrower programme, generate 2,502,675 job across country. anchor borrower program - 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 600,000 700,000201520162017jan-nov. 14, 2018no. of farmer (862,069)no. of hectare (873,053) 24 28. it light success anchor borrower program regard cultivation rice maize monetary policy committee last meet 21st november 2018 recommend anchor borrower program apply area palm oil, tomato fishery mention few. 29. our effort support small scale farmer smes base awareness critical role play support economic recovery growth, well create job opportunity million nigerians. so far, cbn msme fund disburse n100billion msme sector, still feel lot done. under auspex banker committee, sum n60 billion far set aside agsmies fund fund micro small medium enterprise business 25 agriculture manufacture sector economy. the cbn recognize great challenge confront msme’s local farmer access credit, unlock growth potential country; group must access fund seamlessly. in response challenge, cbn due course take action directly bring bank service rural community license national micro finance bank, presence local government nigeria, thereby support channel credit rural communities. we continue explore ways, partner fiscal authorities, best provide farmer smes support need expand operations. 30. the day i visit unnamed popular supermarket lagos, big contrast visit shop 5 year ago, 26 visit november. what apparent huge increase number make nigerian process good sell store; from locally produce rice well package ready use tomato stew, dry fruit also cassava chips. a i walk round shop i could see huge potential nigerian entrepreneurs, develop product could compete peer climes. i could also imagine number people employ entrepreneur support production goods. for u grow nation, must continue encourage business provide goods, help sustain vitality community live work. 31. financial inclusion – cognizant fact close 40% adult nigerian access financial services, bank implement series step help drive effort aim 27 build financially inclusive society. some measure include agent bank guideline share agent network facility (sanef), intend deepen penetration agent network underserved location across country. the recent launch policy payment service bank october 2018, additional step aim leverage distribution network non-bank entities, fast-moving consumer good companies, fintechs, mobile network operators, provide financial service under-served communities. with scheme place, believe next 2 years, 80% nigerian access financial services. 32. credit allocation: a part long-term strategy strengthen nigerian economy, bank establish initiative resolve underlie challenge long-term gdp growth, economic 28 productivity, unemployment poverty pervade economy past decades. hence, cbn establish credit bureau national collateral registry improve access credit domestic economy. we believe measure help instil strong credit culture unlock access finance deserve nigerians, include may fix asset provide bank collateral. 33. furthermore, spur bank lend high-impact sector, bank, july 2018 mpc, pledge refund crr bank certain conditions. bank bring proposal fund new project expansion exist one agriculture manufacture sector will, accordingly, qualify crr refund 100 percent. it expectation bank would use opportunity expand credit real sector. 29 34. risk base supervision: the recent weaken naira, follow shift flexible foreign exchange mechanism, impact somewhat balance sheet domestic banks. to guarantee financial stability nigeria continue flexible exchange rate system, cbn take number steps, including: monitor compliance supervise institution foreign exchange management framework issue june 2016 risk-based supervision methodology, also involve review international trade foreign exchange operation local banks; monitor financial position performance supervise institutions; assessment risk profile governance management practice bank in event major deterioration key risk indicator, engage affect bank 30 order mitigate concern shore-up capital base. 35. a i always emphasized, collective duty ensure potential prospect nigerian economy optimally realized. the ongoing economic recovery require joint effort wise counsel everyone seat here, must make giant stride forward. the cbn determine ever remain forefront effort ensure rebound overturned. peer review emerge market economy 36. lady gentlemen, assess nigeria’s recovery effort performance, essential conduct comparative assessment peers. strikingly, discover nigeria fare badly vis-à-vis emerge market 31 economy like brazil, south africa, turkey, argentina, similar economic experiences. 37. amidst grow challenges, nigeria manage keep real gdp growth positive avoid double-dip recession contrast emerge market economies. 38. in comparison follow 2016 contractions, south african economy record double-dip recession renew contraction 2.6 0.7 percent first second quarter 2018, respectively. in argentina, though economy recession throughout 2016, moderate uptick peak 1.9 percent quarter two 2017 end recession. however, argentinian economy shrink 4.0 per cent quarter two 2018, bring country brink another recession. 32 39. the brazilian economy recession since 2015 emerge first quarter 2017 growth rate 1.0 percent. since growth slow progressively last quarter 2017 growth remain flat. however, economy gradually rebound record 0.1 0.2 percentage growth rate first second quarter 2018. 40. give rise yield advance markets, capital outflow emerge market increase tremendously. this lead substantial exchange market pressure many emerge market fx reserve fall 25.2 percent argentina, 9.6 percent turkey, 2.1 percent south africa since begin year. also, significant currency depreciation record argentina (by 101 percent), turkey (43 percent), brazil (19 percent), russia (19 percent) 33 india (16 percent); even naira remain stable.(-.006%) 41. a matter fact, recent bloomberg data financial market performance show nigeria bond market remain one attractive investment destination -in bloomberg’s emerging-market

investor also sure exit position want, crucial drive investor market. 35 outlook policy thrust 2019 43. global growth projection 2018 2019 revise downward 3.7 percent 3.9 percent early projected. growth momentum u project remain strong fiscal stimulus continue 2019. in emerge markets, growth forecast revise downward argentina, brazil, iran, turkey, south africa reflect country-specific factors, uncertainty financial conditions, rise geopolitical tension well high oil import bills. 44. in light current development global domestic economies, base extensive simulations, cbn view short-term outlook nigerian economy remain good. we expect that: • monetary policy stance remain judicious, research driven, adequate supportive real 36 economy subject underlie fundamentals. the current tight stance expect continue near-term, especially view rise inflation expectation exchange market pressures. though act appropriately adjust policy rate line unfold condition outlooks, cbn continue ensure policy interest rate delicately set balance objective price stability output stabilization; • gdp: with favorable oil price development continue effort drive indigenous production high-impact real sector activities, especially agriculture manufacturing, gdp expect pick-up remain two quarter 2018. this buoy anticipate budgetary electioneer spend near-term. from 1.5 percent quarter two 2018, growth project quicken 1.7 percent quarter three 1.9 fourth quarter; 37 • inflation: inflation expectation rise backdrop anticipate politically-related liquidity injections. for rest 2018 towards mid-2019 nigeria’s rate inflation project rise slightly 11.4 percent moderate thereafter; • exchange rate: though cbn far manage maintain exchange rate stability, current capital flow reversal emerge market expect continue exert considerable pressure market rates. this pressure could amplify forthcoming elections, especially political market place heat up. notwithstanding pressures, cbn determine maintain stable exchange policy stance next month give relatively high level reserves. gross stability project fx market give increase oil relate inflow contain import bill. i like make categorically clear 38 “sustaining stable exchange rate override importance u even continue put measure place shore reserves”; • bop: overall balance payment expect remain positive short-term. hop oil price continue recover, expect current account balance strengthen even further. this support improve non-oil performance diversification effort begin yield result reduce undue imports. • support domestic production: give remarkable success achieve stimulate domestic production good rice, cassava maize, result restriction place cbn access forex 41 items, cbn intend vigorously ensure policy remain place, additional effort would make block attempt unscrupulous parties(both individual 39 corporates) intend find avenue access forex, order import item nigeria. the cbn’s economic intelligence bank supervision department work hard efcc expose sanction any, bank, company fx operator collude unscrupulous individual / company undermine policy 41 items. such sanction include, limit prohibit bank maintain bank account institution person nigeria. give global domestic headwind face nation, volatility experience crude oil market, option, leader interest progress nation, work hard spur job creation revive agricultural industrial activity country. if continue support growth small holder farmers, well help revive palm oil refineries, rice mills, cassava tomato process 40 factories, imagine amount wealth job create country; these could include new set small holder farmer engage productive activities; new logistics company transport raw material factories, finish good market; new storage centre build store locally produce goods; additional growth bank financial institution able provide financial service support new businesses; finally, million nigerian employ factory support process goods. if turn blind eye opportunity create result policy 41 items, spell doom nation. we long afford depend solely import give size population, need create job people. this precisely purpose behind intention restrict access forex 41 items, i urge stakeholder 41 come onboard, intend vigorous pursuit objective. • domestic credit: the bank explore possibility leverage technology enhance credit critical sector economy, especially, agriculture manufacturing. our recently announce policy refund portion crr bank finance new project (or expand exist ones) agriculture manufacture sector intensify enrich come years. this, believe, bolster job creation support agenda correct nigeria’s imbalance vulnerabilities. • open foreign investors: a monetary fiscal authority continue work tirelessly support recovery economy, important acknowledge nigeria’s endure strengths, offer significant reward current prospective foreign investors. notwithstanding 42 impact recession, nigeria’s economy remain large africa size gdp, well diversify mix opportunity across different sectors, ict, manufacturing, solid minerals, trade agriculture. the central bank indeed federal government open foreign investor keen support effort unlock immense opportunity economy, know offer mutual gain investor nation. investor assure investment nigeria would duly protect authorities, fully aware various advantage provide economy term capital technological know-how. we hereby reaffirm commitment investor nigeria indeed open business. conclusion 45. distinguish lady gentlemen, i would like conclude remark today story 43 revere mongolian warrior name genghis khan, falcon exceptionally well-trained hunting. the falcon would usually sit meekly warrior’s arm would everything warrior command —even word spoken. khan love falcon boast lavishly bird’s loyalty. it could see thing sky human could not. 46. on certain day, however, warrior entourage embark hunt. despite group’s best efforts, find nothing. they stay forest long expected, irate khan desperately tire thirsty. then, delight, saw thread water flow rock front him. he take cup fill drink. just raise lips, falcon pluck cup hand spill it. once again, fill cup falcon spill second time. khan, enrage intolerable disrespect, draw 44 sword, third time refill cup. a falcon take flight towards him, khan, one thrust, kill it. 47. the trickle thread water had, however, dry time. when khan climb rock search water saw one poisonous snake lay dead pool. if drink water, he, too, would died. it khan realize

affair conference paris, tuesday 4 december 2018 keynote address denis beau – first deputy governor “old new challenge insurance sector, regulator supervisors” 2 good morning you, dear president member icmif amice, i happy today exchange view stimulate le challenge development insurance sector, especially mutual insurers, well regulator supervisors, face upcoming month years. after word economic financial context relate challenge insurers, i first focus bring regulatory development currently making, finish new risk insurers, regulator supervisor address, namely cyber-risks climate change-related risks. overall, macroeconomic environment favourable. the recovery global economy strengthen last year. global gdp grow 3.8% 2017 expect grow similar pace next two years. the european economy perform well inflation rate europe line european central bank’s target (2%). even recent survey data somewhat weaker, medium-term outlook euro area remain broadly positive. however, global domestic uncertainty growing. the tighten monetary policy response improve economic condition may impact growth major advance economies. the u federal reserve bank england progressively raise interest rates; meanwhile, european central bank start phase bond-buying programme (qe). the impact monetary policy normalisation financial market closely monitored. the overall market sentiment optimistic, sign possible repricing financial market emerging. market volatility increase since begin year price correction observed, significantly equity markets. valuation remain stretch equity, bond certain real estate market create high risk asset repricing. recent tension emerge markets, especially turkey argentina, initiate flight safety mainly towards u investments. in near future, threat global trade create protectionist tensions, grow political uncertainties, also europe follow development italy significant probability hard brexit may weigh negatively global environment. in addition, european insurance sector face unprecedented challenge low interest rate environment past four years. the downward trend bond yield direct impact return investments, especially life insurer 3 hold substantial portion investment bond securities. the dilution investment yield reinforce risk industry serious lapse risk interest rate rise abruptly, financial loss insurer guarantee high technical rate compare financial returns, risk relate insufficient cost coverage. among quick review salient characteristic environment insurer operate i would like add climate change risk become reality although insurer usually know deal climate risks, include extreme events, likely adjustment needed. against backdrop, french insurance company react three main ways: low pay interest rate life insurance, development alternative investment strategy adaptation traditional business model include increase business diversification. a result, instance, unit-linked liability increasing, profit-sharing payment euro-denominated contract decreasing. however, i note payment remain significantly high mutual undertakings: amount 2.3% last year french average lower, reserve defer profit share strongly reinforce amount approximately 6% mathematical reserve ye 2017, 50% high french average. a result, french insurance company remain fairly solid, fund hold largely cover regulatory solvency capital requirement life non-life insurance companies, important asset challenge environment operating. this notably case mutual insurance sector. it solvency coverage ratio significantly exceed 300%, high average france, thank particular prudent long-term approach, le pressure financial markets. however, adapt challenge environment come without new risks. for instance, necessary closely monitor risk relate policyholder protection advice, excessive lengthen bond maturity aggressive search yield. now, i would like focus regulatory developments, numerous may impact insurance business model go forward. the french insurance landscape experience major regulatory change recent years: modification 4 taxation system life/savings insurance contract (flat tax), possibility change credit insurance contract annually (loi hamon/amendement bourquin), creation specific prudential status french pension funds. the new pacte bill bring change seek promote long-term investment equity, include reform french life long-term insurance product (also know eurocroissance). in addition, international european level significant regulatory development also making. at international level, iais work systemic insurer international capital standard (or ics) recently make significant strides. a know, part post-crisis action plan, iais develop 2013 identification method systemic risks, review 2016. this lead identification nine global systemically important insurers, specific measure apply (increased supervision, specific management plans, chiefly liquidity, recovery resolution, capital add-on measure, currently postpone 2022). give recognise shortcoming methodology, include weak factual basis, fsb ask iais review three key focuses: develop activities-based approach supplement entity-based approach, review order correct deficiencies. a new framework hence develop make possible reconcile activities-based entities-based approach, good capture relevant risk systemic undertakings. in meantime, list global systemic insurer remain freeze 2019 could suspend beyond 2022, enough experience gain new approach. regard international capital standard, aim develop international capital standard order able establish comparable basis term prudential requirement international groups, recent progress make kuala lumpur november 2017 lead to, end 2019, version call “ics 2.0” use reference international supervision colleges, transitory period five years. during timeframe, internationally active insurance group ensure compulsory confidential five-year monitor period base ics, standard expect become effective. now, i turn ifrs17: would unreasonable apply new ifrs17 account framework right now. give obvious issue timing, quite welcome iasb reopen discussion application standard postpone one year. this primarily give u time reach agreement identify group loss-making contracts. we also want bring discussion 5 treatment reinsurance contract hold satisfactory conclusion. at point, much room interpretation standard, could interfere comparability consistent application across countries. in europe, current “hot topic” forthcoming solvency 2 review. this review must include full objective assessment framework place three years. of course, insurer significantly improve risk capital management solvency 2, insurance market resilient good equip cope financial crises. the average scr ratio european union stand 241% first quarter 2018. it tend even high mutual insurer but positive must allow overshadow question need ask radical change, particularly impact equity investment finance european economy, well issue relate volatility complexity. therefore i invite insurer play active role discussion come so-called “long term guarantee package” 2020 review. a case 2018 review, acpr call progress towards significant simplification framework. we also expect review good take account impact solvency 2 finance economy. this said, irrespective outcome forthcoming reviews, proportionality principle harmonise application across european union remain major concern eiopa course acpr. on topical note, i would add crucial supervisor apply prudential requirement equal rigour. the string failure insurer business french market freedom provide services, particularly construction insurance, reminder importance this. the freedom provision service sometimes odds specific feature national markets. complex long-term product require improve skill part insurer provide product supervisory authorities, eiopa’s support. the requisite convergence supervisory practice need become reality soon. i know eiopa make priority. incidentally, three-year review european supervisory authority (esas), underway. follow public consultation propose european commission, draft legislation look strengthen authorities’ chiefly eiopa’s role power without 6 call question exist architecture. this support goal increase convergence supervisory practices, turn promote improve effectiveness. accordingly, proposal represent positive step forward europe. however, close eye keep place give national supervisors, especially regard question internal model supervisory colleges. they remain within national supervisors’ realm competence, eiopa’s mediation role essential reinforced, especially regard cross-border issues. however, incompatible assume responsibility validate national internal models. a eiopa role cross-border case guidance national supervisor member state would favour, exchange could take place within dedicate coordination platforms. beyond regulatory adaptation, challenge ahead relate technological environmental changes, new yet crucial matter attention insurers, regulator supervisors. insurance players, size risk exposures, face digital revolution, inescapable development business sector travel, tourism cater show. to remain competitive term customer relationships, insurer need raise customer experience high levels. this require fundamentally review processes, tool information systems. it also call upgrade human resource policies. the risk associate digital revolution numerous, i would like stress big risk associate procrastination. this risk seem particularly important essential focus attention supervisors. the digital revolution ramification require attention supervisors. one increase inclusion insurance product within package deals. this particularly case affinity insurance products. these often involve multiplication intermediary value chain. this phenomenon blur responsibility intrinsic economic value products, therefore vigilant consumer protection especially important strengthen european regulatory framework product governance (via insurance distribution directive particular). another one access use data. to remain competitive customer relationship risk management, access data ability efficiently use essential. these development involve cooperation personal data protection authority insurance supervisory authorities. this cooperation already 7 become reality thank cnil's (national commission information technology civil liberties) presence artificial intelligence task force lead acpr, publish report come months. i hope cooperation deepen come years. a result, data ever strategic asset. in circumstances, face risk cybercrime, imperative ensure security. the digital revolution accompany emergence it attacks, increasingly publicised. the insurance industry, information system play major operational role, immune cyber-attacks. insurer need manage guard risk, which, case, increase criticality data (medical, personal, financial, etc.) handle store information systems. public authority seek address challenge undertake major initiative raise awareness among insurer new type operational risk, it system insurance sector still vulnerable. it primarily market design efficient security scheme compatible opening-up information system innovation. this huge challenge, spirit acpr works. cyber security remain one supervisory priority come year important actively maintain engage dialogue regard, facilitate emergence dissemination best practices, strengthen resilience insurance sector. in decisive transition phase, i would like draw attention acpr's paper it risk, discus best practice regard it risk specifically cyber risk. while digital revolution create new risk insurer targets, also offer new opportunity growth industry cover cyber risk policyholders. the acpr therefore particularly vigilant development cyber insurance, require insurer adapt, manage ”new” risk term selection underwriting, pricing, portfolio oversight. the last supervision priority i would like mention relate climate change. although loss natural disaster world first half 2018 half observe period 20171, good news. the long-term impact 1 loss amount usd 33 billion first half 2018 usd 65 billion first half 2017 8 climate change remain key area vigilance insurers, climatologist foresee long-term increase natural disasters. such change impact side insurers’ balance sheet, via increase physical risk transition risk low carbon economy, work obviously need address properly. for instance, common methodology develop yet properly ass impact foresee increase frequency natural catastrophes. regard exposure transition risk low carbon economy, exposure french insurer risk assessed. at end 2017, eur 250 billion, around 10% total portfolio french insurers, invest sector define sensitive transition risk, see significant exposure. this figure ballpark figure, though, definition methodology measure carbon footprint asset portfolio still construction. these example show still sufficient recognition need act rapidly order reach objective paris agreement term climate change. regulators’ action give right incentive player act quickly. in respect, banque de france acpr set actively coordinate network central bank supervisor green financial system (ngfs). let conclude say mutual insurer course expose challenge i mentioned. i trust will well equip live them. over last year order face new challenges, mutual sector, historically comprise large number entities, adapt successfully achieve necessary concentrations. it important continue adapt, include international level, especially since value mutual insurance essential stability insurance model base risk-sharing. thank attention. reserve bank of fiji 1 keynote address by the reserve bank of fiji governor, mr ariff ali south pacific central bank research conference,

reform would need build resilience. the reform aim strengthen sector become strong, solid, well capitalised, good position support fast grow page | 4 economy. madam president, expected, reform continue 2018, seek also overhaul entire supervisory framework. 6. madam president, financial system stability remain central development agenda country. historically, central bank use lender last resort function principal tool ensure stability. today financial stability go beyond lender last resort function. indeed financial stability monetary policy complementary without financial stability, monetary policy impulse economy cannot transmit real economy. in ghana, central bank mandate laws; bank ghana act, 2002 (act 612) amend act 918 2016, bank specialise deposit-taking institution (bsdi) act, 2016 (act 930) ensure safe sound financial sector. 7. madam president, inherit financial system considerable state distress, bank meet capital adequacy requirement, bank suffer capital erosion high non-performing loan lead weak transmission monetary policy real economy. some bank insolvent illiquid, others solvent illiquid. our predecessor continue provide page | 5 liquidity support weak fail banks, without address underlie problem lead illiquidity insolvency institutions. in short, financial system reach tip point could assume business usual. the clean objective ensure orderly exit insolvent bank industry view bank license regulate bank ghana guarantee access deposit need victimize wholly own ghanaian entity detractor seek impugn. the reform also aim address legacy problem bank sector poor corporate governance, false financial reporting, insider dealings, practice leave bank insolvent. 8. madam president, take decisive action underpin strengthen legal framework bank ghana

7 hold company affiliate bank sdis take advantage bank sdis within group expense depositor creditors. in addition, government indicate set high-level financial stability council key objective bring together financial sector regulatory body ministry finance work together minimize, eliminate, regulatory arbitrage sector-wide risks. 12. another key lesson weakness corporate governance structure banks. early year, issue corporate governance directive address fundamental flaw observe governance process draw international corporate governance principle develop basel committee bank supervision. we receive feedback several comment draft transitional provision implementation directive. we finalise provision public final version end 2018. 13. we also introduce fit proper person’s directive aim

assessment show directive already shape corporate governance structure within bank industry continue ensure full compliance. 14. the industry’s effort reduce high level non-performing loan gradually take shape, partly due compliance loan write-off directive. we expect improvement asset quality appropriate disclosure loan write-off banks’ year-end publish financial statements. the draft credit report regulation draft borrower lender bill final stages. when complete pass parliament, piece legislation help improve credit underwrite process facilitate enforcement loan collateral agreement bank regulate institutions. 15. madam president, bank adopt implement global credit risk management financial report standards. currently, quarterly financial publication bank report line ifrs 9, use expect credit loss standard. this improve credit risk management framework enable bank effectively measure risk embed credit portfolio. the full impact benefit page | 9 new standard credit administration process expect materialise come year. 16. to improve compliance risk governance within bank sector, bank ghana year issue final capital requirement directive compliance become effective

thank attention. 29 november 2018 deputy governor rannveig sigurðardóttir. introductory remark 2nd annual nordic cyber finance conference, helsinki, 29 november 2018 let begin say conference timely interest me, i office five months. give i come monetary policy department central bank iceland, cybersecurity much agenda now. it is, nonetheless, important topic. the central bank iceland, central bank face several new challenge area, financial sector generally central bank specifically. last week i attend interest macroprudential policy conference danmark nationalbank. the discussion paper prepare conference call while sun shining, prepare rainy day. sit there, i ponder discussion paper conference today might called. perhaps something like the snowstorm – wear? cybercrime world’s fastest-growing type crime. it shoot second place list top ten business risk worldwide, even make list five year ago. the financial sector particularly important grease wheel economies, cyber risk pose mount threat financial system. development since emergence internet show new technology bring new challenges. we need think robotics, artificial intelligence, blockchains, smart phone 5g wi-fi realize extent change lie ahead financial services. new technology also bring opportunities. the austrian economist, finance minister, banker joseph schumpeter demonstrate 1920s successive wave technological change raise productivity, income, live standards. however, know long experience technological change often result cost involve new risk must address order optimise net benefit. so fintech broaden consumers’ range choice financial intermediation, also bring new risks, security transaction privacy. to maintain financial stability real economic activity, need payment settlement system secure. a result, cybersecurity move technical issue central bank issue. that nordic central bank set forum discussion cooperation foster close cooperation cyber resilience cybersecurity. today focus financial market infrastructure. one question ask section conference is, “what challenge likely emerge new operate model new actor financial sector?” a i say before, fintech snowstorm already here. the new challenge respect cybersecurity emergence new player offer financial services, provide financial service before. the question therefore becomes: what technology using? be established, new unknown technology? we also know attitude towards security operational risk important. but tech firm rush offer new product market, risk insufficient emphasis security. this risk must monitor – new product new players, also incumbent businesses. tech giant like google, apple, alibaba look set become dominant players. their advantage come provide cross-border service already gather significant information users. they already present nordic marketplace. this development may lean towards monopolies, create entry barrier new small player market. if prof case, could negative impact competition go aim psd2 (the recent eu directive payment service internal market (2015/2366). this risk great payment mechanism outside jurisdiction relevant state. then question supervision. will new solution supervised, so, how? the challenge many new solution global, thus outside european economic area european single market. such supervision thus require cross-border cooperation among supervisors. the challenge supervisor also maintain comprehensive overview market. for legislator, challenge stay top rapid technological developments, rule tend lag behind technological changes. financial market participant must commit fully guard system. cybersecurity need promote levels. with respect fast-changing technology, keep one step ahead antisocial element constant challenge. a i see it, cooperation way forward. it vital financial system entity work together front – within country – identify address vulnerabilities. we need share success mishaps. we must mountain-climbers – tie together – together: central banks, financial service providers, fintech firms, consumers, regulators, politicians. and success combine force determine whether reach mountain peak go back base camp again. all system break. this u still use paper banknotes, even though sophisticate technology. but security improve upon recent centuries. try imagine would main topic conference florence time first medici’s. a paper money, technology discuss today become secure, although encounter blizzards. our role prevent reduce likelihood blizzard create systemic risk. 1 remark by the second deputy

bank industry meeting: reinvent bank improve management? iese pablo hernández de co governor 3/11 good morning. i like thank iese kind invitation open 14th edition bank industry meeting. this give excellent opportunity review progress make spanish bank industry main challenge currently faces. let start, however, brief explanation regard content speech. a member govern council european central bank i am, today, subject “quiet period”, meet monetary policy decision due taken. accordingly, reflection speech interpret indicate monetary economic outlook (see chart 1). follow last crisis, spanish bank carry major balance sheet clean-up, recapitalisation restructure which, last four half years, notably improve situation industry term basic parameters, asset quality, profitability solvency. start asset quality, december 2013 june 2018 reduction non-performing loan foreclose real estate asset notable. also, return equity turn positive euro area average, follow collapse 2012, minus 25%. the total capital ratio, meanwhile, increase 1.7 percentage point last four years, leverage liquidity ratio european averages. indeed, recent stress test carry european bank authority (eba) banco de españa show considerable resilience spanish banks’ solvency adverse scenarios. however, recognise significant progress make recent years, spanish bank industry continue face significant challenges, largely share euro area bank systems. notable among are: i) need progress reduce unproductive asset remain high levels; ii) raise profitability; iii) strengthen industry’s reputation prevent misconduct; iv) adapt new regulatory framework strengthen highest-quality capital ratios; v) compete new financial environment arise technological progress emergence new player (see chart 2). reduce unproductive asset a i already said, reduction non-performing loan foreclose asset peak level reach crisis significant. private-sector non-performing loans, fall 60% peak 2013, currently stand level 2009. foreclose asset follow similar pattern, fall 40% peak 2012. the economic recovery certainly contribute process, also drive credit institutions’ management trouble asset supervisory pressure. spain make relatively progress euro area country reduce volume non-performing loan build crisis. moreover, economic growth – albeit low rate – expect continue help gradually reduce next years. despite improvements, level unproductive asset spanish bank (especially relate business spain) remain relatively high pre-crisis levels. 4/11 reduce unproductive asset continue challenge industry, require bank strengthen application active management policy impair assets. in respect, agreement sell trouble asset portfolio announce past year accelerate reduction future npl ratio initially estimate solely basis cyclical improvement economy experience previous credit cycles. in order address challenge, european bank also face, european economic supervisory authority take initiative accelerate reduction npls. in particular, european commission announce package measure march year, include proposal review capital requirement regulation npl provision schedule. correct high level impair asset key two basic reasons. first, balance-sheet clean-up improve banks’ profitability solvency. that say, free resource currently devote finance unproductive asset allow use finance new lending. and second, correct level bad debt euro area smooth path creation pan-european, fully mutualised deposit guarantee scheme sufficient fiscal backing, since would enable risk share without problem inherit establishment single supervisory resolution mechanisms. this third pillar bank union, key element seeks, moreover, reduce link bank risk sovereign risk (see chart 3). restore profitability restore profitability another main challenge face spanish bank industry. although return positive value (7% june 2018), stand eu average, profitability remain pre-crisis level and, case, level developed-economy bank systems. the low average profit level generate spanish bank especially apparent business spain. in addition, international activity spanish banks, entail significant diversification risk valuable source profit crisis, challenges. some emerge market economy spanish bank expose – turkey argentina – currently considerable difficulty. that said, i like point geographical diversification bank source value add medium long-term stability relevant assessment profitability risk two reasons. first, correlation activity country may negative. this historically case many emerge country spanish bank international activity. second, characteristic bank market operate (much concentrated, le bank penetration) conducive existence high margin (see chart 4). return profitability bank business spain, comparatively low level explain variety factors. first, i already mentioned, high volume unproductive asset direct negative impact banks’ income statement reduce interest income increase impairment provisioning. second, low profitability also explain significant fall income associate banks’ deleveraging. in addition, current level interest rate squeeze banks’ 5/11 net interest income. that said, ecb’s monetary policy also positive effect economic activity (thus reduce loss loan defaults) banks’ capital gains. in short, ultimate net impact low interest rate bank profitability seem small factor i mentioned. a regard operate expenses, remain downward trend see recent years. this containment expense take place background adjustment operate capacity spanish bank basically take form significant reduction number staff branch business spain. the adjustment productive capacity spanish bank system already last ten years, number branch reduce 40% peak 2008, staff number fall 30%. in scenario, extraordinary growth total lend expect short medium term, effort restore profitability base adjust expense new size balance sheets, seek alternative source income improve efficiency. that said, must remember search profitable business cannot expense necessary vigilance credit conditions. this basic premise necessary condition appropriate management credit risk. i wish point see high rate growth bank lend household acquisition consumer durables (15% year-on-year september 2008, rate 20% previous quarters) and, symptomatic, default rate associate activity already begin accelerate significantly. this situation suggest ease risk acceptance selection standard segment. it vital lesson crisis forget here: past experience show loosen credit standard eventually lead notable increase default rates. although weight business segment lend spanish bank whole low, growth observe warn sign. it would acceptable search alternative source income short term become potential source future losses. in respect, price-setting policy product service level fundamental ensure appropriate risk-adjusted profitability. these policy must consistent, comprehensive rigorous ensure price charge product service cover least total cost, include risk premium inherent type transaction. from viewpoint appropriate risk management, control risk incurred, assess develop time apply conservative condition negotiate rollover loan basic element credit standard bank must observe keep date policies. moreover, viewpoint customer protection, appropriate assessment solvency capacity repay also protection future vulnerability (see chart 5). 6/11 reputation conduct one large challenge face bank today precisely manage one main assets: reputation, fundamental generate appropriate framework trust within develop customer relations. the reputation bank erode last crisis, result management failure part system, also result inappropriate market customers, undermine trust. in fact, number complaint customer banks’ customer complaint service increase almost six-fold 2014 2017. this lead grow concern conduct risk social, political supervisory domains, naturally industry itself. this concern also share internationally, reflect recent work financial stability board strengthen governance remuneration framework order mitigate risk misconduct. the banco de españa strengthen supervisory activity relation conduct four year ago. this great supervisory presence, along regulatory requirements, need adapt new demand customer judicial rule defence consumers, prompt bank react, make effort implement measure need correct practices. however, much remain done. bank must proactive develop strong culture orient towards comply customer transparency regulations, also fundamentally towards identify satisfy customer interests. this require involvement commitment govern body spread value throughout institution; especially sale network, must incentive mechanism give rise perverse counter-productive incentives. in short, bank must incorporate customer protection perspective risk appetite framework, make cornerstone governance decision-making processes. for process successful, control regulatory compliance market management bank product service need strengthened. and, simultaneously, role customer service department need bolstered, focus improve treatment complaints, also ensure serve alert mechanism conduct risks, manager promptly aware area customer relation give rise conflict dissatisfaction. thus, comprehensive approach customer relation required. a satisfy customer one main asset bank basis sustain profitability (see chart 6). adapt new regulatory framework strengthen solvency i shall turn fourth important challenge face spanish bank industry: adapt new regulatory framework. i start one element introduce context basel iii: inclusion macro-prudential tool supplement micro-prudential regulation supervision. 7/11 from financial stability perspective, provide supervisor macro-prudential tool would allow good adjust financial expansions, one hand cushion impact contraction and, other, help financial institution continue perform function finance real economy time tension. the arsenal macro-prudential tool indeed expand significantly since financial crisis. apart countercyclical capital buffer, systemic risk buffer, buff global local systemically important banks, possibility limit excessive risk concentrations, increase capital requirement review risk weight asset real estate exposures. these tool allow u supervisor develop macro-prudential policy interact micro-prudential policy monetary policy. however, create macro-prudential tool sufficient. to ensure effectiveness, must appropriately assign institutional point view avoid so-called inaction bias. in respect, spanish government announce macro-prudential authority set up, compose representative ministry economy enterprise, banco de españa national security market commission. spain one european country still without national macro-prudential authority. by set new authority, spain comply recommendation european systemic risk board, urge eu member state establish authority. the aim authority carry macro-prudential supervision spanish financial system, order contribute prevention mitigation systemic risk. for purpose, banco de españa due give new power area. these include, notably, possibility activate tools, sectoral countercyclical capital buffer, limit sectoral credit concentration others relate credit standards. give banco de españa new macro-prudential tool clearly strengthen spanish supervisory system bring line best international practice. macro-prudential policy especially important country like spain, belong monetary union bank union, since – see past – financial business cycle various country make currency always harmonise euro area whole. consider euro area common monetary policy supervisory policy limit scope fiscal policy measures, macro-prudential policy fundamental role play address credit cycle. i move institutions’ adaptation component international regulatory reform strict requirement fund liquid assets, requirement new resolution legislation. these regulatory change agree international level response shortcoming become apparent financial crisis break ten year ago now. their aim boost bank systems’ resilience adverse shocks, minimise cost taxpayer event resolution. in words, seek reduce likelihood future financial crises, happen, reduce impact society. 8/11 the first phase reforms, agree 2010 2011, focused, among things, strengthen quantity quality banks’ capital introduce new liquidity requirement limit credit concentration. almost requirement come force end 2019. subsequently, december 2017 saw completion second phase reform basel iii framework. among thing reform introduce enhancement standardise method calculate credit operational risk, restriction use internal model change leverage ratio. these change implement two phases, due complete 2027. a regard bank resolution, common european resolution framework define situation fail bank must subject liquidation resolution. for purpose new category non-preferred debt instrument created, rank senior debt order priority creditor facilitate compliance minimum requirement fund eligible liability available absorb losses. the single resolution board start establish requirement liability european significant institution gradually extend le significant institutions. small spanish institution tend basically fund via capital deposit rather tap capital markets. while feature generally give liability great stability, mean low level eligible liability limit pool investors, possible difficulty access non-preferred debt markets. lastly, issuance type instrument likely much big impact cost fund medium-sized spanish institution large ones. this due difficulty access market i mention earlier, conjunction high liquidity premia potential investor likely demand. a seen, regulatory reform far-reaching worth anticipate impact as, although spanish bank largely adapt regulatory changes, application reform still outstanding. although total capital ratio rise 1.7 percentage point last four year (reaching 15.1% june 2018, exceed regulatory minimum), leverage liquidity ratio slightly european averages, focus regulatory capital great loss-absorbing capacity, i.e. ordinary capital cet1, ratio rise 0.3 percentage points. in regard, banco de españa’s in-house stress test ass prospectively level solvency spanish bank system reveal institution high degree resilience possible adverse macroeconomic scenarios. nevertheless, view dispersion result across bank possibility risk materialise exceed envisage adverse scenario, bank would advise strengthen capital insofar recovery profit allows. indeed, accord june 2018 data european bank authority, spanish institutions’ cet1 tier 1 solvency ratio low among euro area’s bank systems. apart need adopt strategy strengthen top quality capital show comparison across europe, spanish bank also need to: (i) take advantage 9/11 current economic growth recovery profit raise level solvency generate operate margin meet economy’s future credit demand stable way; (ii) anticipate impact reform pending implementation framework basel iii; (iii) ensure compliance resolution requirement without excessive dependence market’s appetite absorb new non-preferred debt instrument (see chart 7). the new competitive environment however, beyond difficulty adapt post-crisis regulation restore banks’ balance-sheet income statement quality, big challenge face spanish bank sector new competitive framework operates, particular, derive new technology advance financial disintermediation. in new competitive environment, bigtechs fintechs alter traditional paradigm retail banking, particular, traditional role customer account build loyalty essential pillar offer universal bank services. these new operator leverage opportunity offer technology new payment regulation offer value-added service use “basic” deposit-taking account-management service platform provide bank system. this scenario represent short-term challenge, insofar new competitor may enter specific areas, retail payment services, consequent drop business income bank area, and, fundamentally, major future challenge derive risk bank may relegate provide undifferentiated low value-added basic services. against competitive background, bank number initial advantage force react order capitalise opportunity new situation offers. the response may range specialisation digital transformation, take advantage possibility offer technology new regulations, emphasis adequate data management. in event, transition entail short-term increase cost context low profitability. issue cybersecurity also take particular significance process adaptation institution new technology also lead increase operational reputational risk. i would also like highlight grow challenge bigtech firm pose financial sector, prominent customer-facing facet, provider significant amount financial-sector infrastructure area cloud-based services. these actor constitute critical component financial sector. in event, new technology offer bank fresh opportunities, term business potential efficiency gains. the application artificial intelligence use large database real-time information (big data) may also provide significant efficiency gain term business activity regulatory compliance. 10/11 similarly, use new technology financial sector may offer advantage society reduce intermediation costs, improve households’ smes’ access finance facilitate financial inclusion (see chart 8). financial disintermediation another factor make environment credit institution operate competitive advance financial disintermediation. in spain, country germany italy, bulk non-financial corporations’ borrow traditionally come bank loans. however, countries, unite state unite kingdom, capital market play much big role corporate finance. there consensus optimal finance structure best ensure financial stability economic growth. on one hand, true interaction company bank involve handle non-public information company may facilitate access bank lend low cost. on hand, liquid efficient financial market make possible channel households’ save long-term project large share finance form capital. also, although experience recent international crisis teach u appropriate diversification companies’ source finance reduce vulnerability shock affect bank lend channels, also evidence capital market procyclical. these issue take special importance context potential increase long-term save associate population ageing. in event, recent year company increasingly turn european capital market finance. this trend towards financial disintermediation explain factor ecb's corporate debt purchase programme, along permanent factor introduction new international bank regulation response financial crisis. the primary aim regulatory reform foster financial stability strengthen banks’ resilience future shocks, side-effect create incentive move typical bank service outside reach sector’s safety nets. indeed, various analytical study –including annual fsb non-banking financial intermediation monitor reports– suggest fund managers’ business grow substantially past decade. moreover, growth observe particularly case open-ended fund offer unit-holders daily reimbursement invest asset somewhat illiquid long maturities. in words, perform activity share need manage risk characteristic typical bank business, maturity transformation, leverage liquidity risk. i therefore feel international financial regulation need follow principle activity similar risk subject similar supervision regulation. and supervision regulation entity activities, risk pose financial system, particularly systemic importance, must take account. look beyond regulatory viewpoint, trend towards great development capital market could encourage headway make create capital 11/11 market union which, together culmination bank union, would allow good allocation risk within economic monetary union. these change structure financial markets, conjunction emergence new technologies, clearly represent challenge banks, particularly current context low profit among europe’s bank systems. in event, point time ultimate impact new technology structure financial system highly uncertain, depend various factors, include future regulatory treatment new players. conclusion to conclude, spanish credit institution improve significantly term solvency, profitability asset quality recent years. despite progress, spanish bank sector still face important challenges, challenge largely share euro area bank systems. the significant challenge are: (i) step pace sale unproductive assets; (ii) strengthen capital liability suitable internal recapitalisation; (iii) build sector's reputation avoid risk inappropriate conduct; (iv) confront challenge make profit without undue ease lend standards; (v) utilise new technologies, major challenge sector opportunity institution harness them. additionally, challenge regulatory supervisory area persist, full integration macro-prudential tool economic policy design, ensure regulatory framework guarantee typical bank risk treat similarly regardless legal nature entity originate manage them. in short, institution supervisory community share challenge future ensure stable financial system offer good service society. thank much. 14.12.2018 economic policy: challenge future crisis speech governor banco de españa barcelona círculo de economía mark ten year since lehman brother collapse pablo hernández de co governor 3/14 i wish start thank barcelona círculo de economía kind invitation today, close cycle lecture organise mark tenth anniversary collapse lehman brothers. the economic financial crisis attributable broad complex range factors, doubt event remain engrave collective memory moment particular significance, mark way symbolic start crisis. the past decade provide u numerous lesson future, particular area economic policy management. today, order identify outstanding tasks, i go devote speech review change occur years, international national level, determine ability prevent emergence new crisis mitigate effect materialise. i shall start reform international level, particular global financial architecture, risk arise protectionism, intensification may significant negative effect world growth medium term. i address change euro governance, move discus role play recent year monetary policy. finally, i focus case spain, briefly review event last year outline main challenge face public finances, supply-side policy bank industry. progress institutional design supra-national economic policy challenge reform international financial system at international level, global financial crisis highlight need far-reaching reform regulatory supervisory frameworks. the effort make recent year area give economic policymakers update instrument new tool address future risk relate financial system, stability relationship economy whole. thus, right early stage crisis, g20 set motion series reform cover number areas, include microprudential macroprudential bank regulation, international account standard regulation monitor non-banking sectors, among measures. we currently phase assess suitability new instruments, still test crisis situations. in microprudential domain, basel committee bank supervision undertake far-reaching review regulatory framework, would become know “basel iii”, aim increase resilience bank system reduce impact financial crisis economy. some key reform introduce include increase quantity quality minimum regulatory capital creation capital buffers. new prudential requirement also introduced, limit large exposures, maximum leverage ratio two liquidity requirements, time reform framework evaluate market risk securitisations launched. in addition, last december, second wave reform introduce within framework basel accord completed. the focus measure calculation 4/14 risk-weighted assets, i.e. denominator capital ratio, order improve comparability capital ratio across bank jurisdictions. another lesson crisis necessary prevent mitigate effect excessive build-up risk financial system whole. an exclusively microprudential base regulatory framework clearly sufficient achieve this. new instrument consider necessary help moderate address cyclical systemic risk (such as, example, associate credit cycle) cross-sectional systemic risk (for example, link risk arise from, among aspects, size, complexity density interconnection financial institutions). with regard cyclical systemic risks, countercyclical capital buff introduced, view prevent risk arise excessive credit growth aggregate level. a cross-sectional systemic risks, financial stability board promote set measure strengthen capital requirement systemic bank establish strict supervisory requirement strong resolution framework them. the development microprudential policy also entail change institutional nature. in europe, european systemic risk board created, task microprudential supervision financial system european union (eu). however, time necessary create framework action national level enable different source systemic risk monitor adequacy new macroprudential policy matter instrument available assessed. follow roadmap, spanish government recently announce intention create macroprudential authority comprise representative ministry economy enterprise, banco de españa national security market commission. this new authority responsible macroprudential supervision spanish financial system, aim contribute prevention mitigation systemic risk. the crisis also highlight certain vulnerability international account standards, result provision need cover risk recognise late inadequate amount. in response, expect loss account model introduced, which, along reform prudential area, help improve recognition credit risk increase resilience bank unexpected deterioration credit portfolios. however, reform intend bolster resilience alert face shock source risk, also promote development effective resolution mechanisms. this seek address problem know “too big fail”, problem become obvious crisis, authority various country force use public fund rescue banks, owe serious consequence insolvency might rest financial system economy whole. with regard resolution, number principle develop order guarantee orderly management bank severe difficulties. these include development bail-in tool permit orderly resolution process minimise impact financial stability, ensure continuity critical bank function minimise need public funds. 5/14 apart reform i mentioned, g20 promote strict regulation close monitor activity non-bank financial intermediaries. the aim improve monitor development sector, ass regulatory instrument used, take account risk intermediary pose financial stability. these risk may, certain circumstances, similar consequence traditionally assume banks. the measure i mention generally lead healthier, resilient diversify financial system, without adverse effect provision credit economy. in particular, since 2011, large international bank almost double high quality capital, $2 trillion $3.7 trillion 2017. moreover, since start crisis, halve leverage improve liquidity profiles, mainly thank increase high-quality liquid assets. progress also make areas, simplify boost transparency otc derivative markets, include use central clearinghouses, measure take reduce risk arise non-bank financial intermediation. nonetheless, cannot ignore persistence certain risk vulnerabilities. first, although large bank le leveraged, overall debt level remain high. global public-sector non-financial private-sector debt increase 40 percentage point (pp) since financial crisis reach 250% global gross domestic product (gdp); public-sector debt increase significantly advance economy private-sector debt emerge economies, especially china. second, increase weight non-bank financing. the weight financial intermediary (ofis)1 global financial system grow recent years, reach 30% december 2016, accord late data available. this trend confirm growth non-bank financial intermediation, generate similar risk banking; weight global financial industry increase 11.6% 2010 13.4% 2016. these trend may potentially important implication function resilience financial markets, particular time stress. third, number challenge remain relate implementation approve reforms, particular late package basel iii reform agree december 2017. finally, time ass whether approve reform effective identify unintended consequences. in respect, fsb due launch assessment policy agree address too-big-to-fail problem next year. review globalisation world trade rule 1 the fsb define ofis exclusion. this statistical definition, therefore, since cover various category national financial accounts: non-bank intermediary central bank, public institutions, insurance entities, pension fund financial auxiliaries. 6/14 the political social consequence crisis impact economic policy area trade policy, global level. trade tension proliferation protectionist measure one bad legacy economic policy response country current post-crisis period. in fact, protectionism currently significant risk factor world trade, give late developments, cannot rule escalation tensions, severe consequence global growth. there broad consensus academic literature economic cost protectionism. in short medium term, economy subject protectionist measure suffer reduction export investment, result adverse effect activity. also, effect economy adopt protectionist measure far positive, owe increase price imports, which, turn, lead increase production cost business low purchase power households, lead adverse effect private consumption investment. in addition, uncertainty associate trade tension possible tighten financial condition may discourage investment worsen negative impact activity potential growth. the estimate main international organisation relation recent trade tension unite state china suggest measure currently force relatively moderate impact (less 0.5 pp gdp china unite states, even small effect global gdp). however, application tariff additional non-tariff measures, announce two major powers, along foreseeable deterioration confidence financial market scenario could give rise, would involve much high costs. accord international monetary fund (imf), could, three years, subtract nearly one percentage point world gdp, pronounce impact china (-1.5 pp) unite state (-1 pp) areas, euro area, loss would somewhat le 0.5 pp. another particularly relevant case present juncture brexit, may significant effect uk eu economies. depend future framework relation eu unite kingdom, whether departure eu take place orderly manner, late estimates, publish bank england day ago, range long-term gdp loss unite kingdom around 2% gdp case orderly exit favourable future agreement, decline around 10% gdp agreement exit disruptive disorderly. the cost eu would lower, although event hard brexit impact could significant country close trade financial tie unite kingdom, ireland, belgium netherlands. at time, evidence suggest great protectionism raise vulnerability economy domestic adverse shocks. this international trade allow producer diversify business cope cyclical fluctuation domestic demand. this diversification mechanism even important crisis periods, see spain, business face severe contraction domestic demand recessionary phase last crisis find escape valve form export enable maintain activity limit job losses. 7/14 it also note negative effect protectionism tend grow strong long term, owe damage impact trade barrier competition, productivity, technological innovation potential growth. in present context, characterise risk heighten trade tensions, review world trade negotiation rule reform world trade organisation (wto), legal basis main trade exchange recent decades, even great consequence. in fact, broad perspective, late political reaction free trade come top deeper, pre-existing crisis multilateral trade system. the security provide trade rule enable average tariff unite states, europe japan cut 22% 1948 3% 2000. however, late round negotiation wto member countries, take place doha 2001, little progress make structural problem currently affect system become apparent. these include, notably, requirement unanimity among 164 member organisation approval new provision existence body rule prove inadequate manage variety challenge raise china’s join wto 2001. a possible way current crisis system rule world trade wto recently discuss would involve move multilateral system base unanimity flexible approach. this would allow resolution adopt particular area limit number countries, possibility economy join late stage. this multilateral approach could also use approve reform adapt wto rule recent change world economy thus restore global confidence system trade base respect clear well-defined rules, curb proliferation protectionist measure boost global growth long term. the need promote open trade services, potential gain still substantial, also mentioned. lastly, domestic policy realm, authority need adopt number policy (boosting labour market flexibility, solid social security network education train opportunities) satisfactorily address distribution potential benefit trade among different population groups. the new institutional architecture euro one structural element change result combine financial-sovereign crisis europe institutional architecture euro area. the financial crisis reveal number shortcoming deficiency various aspect design economic monetary union (emu), absence fiscal stabilisation mechanism area whole, lack crisis management instrument incoherence supervisory arrangement national bank resolution, manifest need progress towards genuine financial integration logical consequence monetary union. we recall weakness euro area’s cross-country risk-sharing mechanism base capital market bank system, especially comparison currency area similar size, unite states. 8/14 especially since emergence sovereign debt crisis, first part current decade, shortcoming prompt significant progress reform european institutional architecture, include strengthen mechanism surveillance fiscal macroeconomic imbalance creation european stability mechanism, single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism. despite reforms, significant limitation persist require emu deepening. first, second pillar bank union need complete mean creation common backstop single resolution fund guarantee financial sufficiency. moreover, essential launch european deposit insurance scheme ensure level protection depositor throughout euro area, reduce risk bank run situation financial stress weaken “doom loop” sovereign risk bank risk. in relation resolution, line international initiatives, european resolution directive stipulate minimum requirement fund eligible liability event resolution. the application directive pose number challenges, particular term transition towards compliance new requirement banks, i shall refer late discuss spanish banks. also, imf recently indicated, would desirable ass suitability bail-in strategy event systemic crises, give potentially adverse effect financial system whole, may ultimately raise social loss cost taxpayer. in order make progress reduce risk financial fragmentation within euro area, necessary boost private-sector risk-sharing channels, credit capital market channels, work alongside public-sector risk-sharing mechanisms. this requires, first, remove obstacle creation medium term genuine pan-european retail banks. in particular, single deposit insurance fund need created, euro area need treat single jurisdiction regulatory purpose and, all, market pressure need reach broad segment european bank system, public-sector banks, cooperative bank save banks. second, progress need make various capital market union initiatives. the implementation project lead efficient integrate capital markets, enable european business diversify broaden source fund reduce excessive dependence bank finance. however, complex objective require action various fronts, include development market infrastructures, review harmonisation market regulation supervision insolvency procedures, elimination bias favour debt finance countries’ tax systems. it also necessary move towards fiscal governance framework allow stabilise capacity fiscal policy euro area time crisis increased. for purpose, country take advantage current upswing generate scope stabilisation future crises, since national fiscal policy continue first line defence. 9/14 in fact, fiscal union, share responsibility macro-financial risk already subject common supervision, besides improve incentive would conducive sustainability public finance macroeconomic stability area. however, clear, strict fiscal rule also necessary member states. simplification complex web rule procedure currently make stability growth pact, automatic rule strong independent fiscal institutions, well strong european fiscal board, could also help achieve objective. also, development common fiscal capacity enable aggregate fiscal stance define apply area would supplement scope national fiscal action and, i already mentioned, stabilise effort monetary policy. completion current design emu provide solid governance priority will, however, require broad consensus political will. monetary policy i would like discus role monetary policy play year could play response future crises. when last crisis break out, central bank slash interest rates, rapidly reach near-zero level in cases, european central bank (ecb), rate even turn negative. in context, central bank implement series novel, “unconventional”, measures. these measure include asset purchase programmes, medium- long-term lend bank industry advantageous conditions, announcement future course monetary policy, know forward guidance. the empirical evidence show measure effective cushion impact economic crisis support subsequent recovery, form part central banks’ toolkit future. against background, scope monetary policy action event future crisis? a inflation outlook improve future, interest rate may expect rise gradually towards long-term equilibrium rate. the distance level effective low bind interest rate – i.e. level rate cut would counter-productive mean stimulate economy – determine future scope conventional monetary policy. we know low bind interest rate euro area zero, traditionally believed, negative number which, although difficult quantify, probably far current deposit facility rate -0.40%. economic theory empirical evidence suggest demography one factor underlie long-term interest rate. specifically, demographic development recent decade comparable countries, characterise decline birth rates, increase life expectancy, rise ratio pensioner workers, seem low long-term equilibrium “natural” interest rate likely continue future. demographic pattern seem therefore contribute progressive narrow 10/14 scope central bank low interest rate event deflationary shock like suffer much recent crisis. one tool mitigate foreseeable loss scope interest rate policy forward guidance. in recent years, short-term rate reach low limit, central bank announcement undertake keep interest rate low level long period prove effective flatten yield curve reduce uncertainty possible future interest rate developments, thus improve financial condition real economy. other tool also provide stimulus interest rate long able include monetary authority’s balance-sheet expansion measures. in recent years, world’s main central banks, include ecb, resort remarkable intensity. in particular, eurosystem expansion balance sheet mainly drive longer-term refinance operation asset purchase programme. these measure effective ease financial condition euro area and, ultimately, adjust inflation towards target. the ecb’s asset reinvestment policy, guide principle readjust yesterday, aim preserve monetary stimulus provide asset purchase programme full reinvestment asset programme’s portfolio mature. in short, monetary policy continue tool tackle future economic financial crises, although tool naturally limitations. therefore, govern council ecb say recent years, rather overemphasise role tools, need complement implementation structural reform fiscal policy foster growth. spanish economic policy: progress make challenge the spanish economy growth path since late 2013 gdp overtake pre-crisis level mid-2017. a number structural reform implement recession contribute dynamism. on domestic front, include labour market reform, balance-sheet clean-up restructure credit institutions, pension reform fiscal consolidation. these reform undoubtedly help largely correct spanish economy’s main imbalance pre-crisis period: particular, high level private sector debt, low competitiveness, excessive current account imbalance excessive weight real-estate sector. similarly, economic policy measure enable progress make correct problem face financial sector bad recent crisis. nevertheless, recovery also benefit series factor exogenous domestic economic policy vary degree persistence. these factor include role play ecb monetary policy significant drop oil price mid-2014 early 2016, and, end last year, improvement external markets, context global economic recovery. however, effect factor expect taper future. the foreseeable loss momentum expansionary effect demand-side policy also relevant. in 11/14 context, particularly desirable prominence give renew reform drive, gear towards correct spanish economy's persist vulnerabilities. fiscal policy i first mention fiscal policy situation. over past decade spanish authority make fiscal adjustment need guarantee sustainability public finances. this process bring budget-deficit-to-gdp ratio maximum 11% 2009 3.1% last year. despite deficit cut, spain’s public account continue show significant weaknesses. first, european commission estimate (cyclically adjusted) structural budget deficit still around 3% gdp 2018, high euro area. second, although government debt slightly downward path historical peak 100.4% gdp 2014, around 98%, still high. the empirical evidence reveal maintain high level public debt prolong period tend hamper economic growth become source vulnerability reduce scope public budget act stabiliser event recession. the simulation make number paper publish banco de españa show that, realistic assumptions, process reduce spain’s government debt gradual. it may even take several decade reach debt-to-gdp ratio 60%, reference value europe’s current fiscal rules. in light considerations, priority give take advantage current favourable economic context reduce vulnerability derive public finance create budgetary room manoeuvre address future crises. these effort give form medium-term programme spell measure enable budgetary objective met, prudent macroeconomic public revenue projections. this process reduce fiscal imbalance also need compatible improvement quality public finances. in connection, composition programme’s revenue expense adjustment relevant achieve objective without hind economic growth. combine fiscal consolidation effort structural reform also help respect. reduce vulnerability spain’s public finance even important consider medium long-term challenge pose population ageing. the late estimate predict significant increase public expenditure pensions, health-care long-term care stem substantial rise dependency ratio. even optimistic demographic projections, ratio set rise 25% today 50% mid-century. in case pension system, 2011 2013 reform include number adjustment make possible significantly counteract effect expect long-term increase dependency ratio. nevertheless, late legislative development ease implementation mechanism postponement application 12/14 sustainability factor 2023 and, all, return system annual pension increase line consumer price index. accord banco de españa's calculations, reintroduce index system permanent basis would lead additional spend increment 3 pp gdp 2050. consequently, guarantee financial sustainability public pension system require additional measure revenue expenditure side system offset additional burden. pending structural reform in context described, characterise need pas baton demand-side policy underpin current expansionary phase boost growth potential, would particularly desirable give prominence measure correct spanish economy’s structural vulnerability strengthen capacity adapt future shocks. the structural reform undertake spain course recent year help make economy robust adaptable adverse situations. this particularly desirable increasingly changeable uncertain global environment. one key element provide great resilience flexibility labour-market reform, give business internal flexibility. this flexibility provide additional tool adjust labour cost event short downturn instead traditional mechanism whereby worker – mainly temporary contract – lay off. other reform also encourage good allocation fund financial system new, high potential, investment projects. these include financial system reform insolvency law reform, particular. despite changes, spanish economy still face major structural challenge limit potential growth. i would like highlight three challenges: population ageing, high unemployment rate, low productivity growth. population age consequence effectiveness traditional macroeconomic policies, sustainability public finances, productivity growth. address challenge require multidisciplinary policy create incentive old worker remain labour force, revise migration policy try adapt need labour market, boost birth rate bring close rate european country improve work-life balance enhance job stability childbearing years. meanwhile, high unemployment rate remain serious drag growth welfare. specifically, particularly worry almost half unemployed situation year unemployment rate among low-skilled population group stand 25%. the serious mismatch skill employee unemployed tend arise case suggest need active employment policy foster employability socio-demographic group use tool prove effective them. a rigorous evaluation exist programme therefore necessary. in addition consideration economic efficiency, highlight recent analysis banco de españa, low unemployment rate directly reflect improvement level inequality. this positive effect employment income inequality would 13/14 strengthen reduce high level temporary employment labour market, provide decrease come price reduce incentive permanent hiring. a regard productivity, spain’s level low international standards. improve dynamic variable require measure various areas. in particular, call improvement human technological capital. in regard, necessary bolster legal framework education raise quality address challenge pose globalisation, technological progress automation. this reform also need foster innovation university channel toward productive system. additionally, despite fact productive company gain weight respective sector past decade, still certain obstacle limit efficient allocation resources. specifically, need analyse level competition sector persistently high profit margins. it would also desirable reduce impact factor prevent productive company growing. in regard, regulatory threshold contingent company size legislation need revising. make decisive progress structural reform agenda crucial increase economy's long-term growth lay foundation society offer citizen opportunities. many policy i refer early foster reduction economy’s structural imbalance inequality, possible build broad-based consensus approval, despite obvious difficulty cause current political fragmentation. the challenge financial sector in wake last crisis, spanish bank carry thorough process balance-sheet clean-up, recapitalisation restructure which, last four half years, markedly improve industry’s position basic parameters, asset quality level profitability solvency. start asset quality, december 2013 june 2018 significant reduction non-performing loan foreclose real-estate assets. similarly, return equity return positive terrain rate euro area average, recover slump -25% 2012. for part, total capital ratio increase 1.7 pp past four years, leverage liquidity ratio european averages. indeed, recent stress test european bank authority banco de españa show spanish banks’ solvency position give considerable resilience adverse scenarios. nevertheless, even recognise significant progress make recent years, spanish bank sector continue face important challenges, largely share euro area bank systems. the significant challenge are: i) speed sale unproductive assets; ii) strengthen capital liability subject bail-in; iii) improve industry's reputation avoid risk misconduct; iv) confront challenge profitability without undue ease lend standards; v) make progress use new technologies, which, although represent major challenge 14/14 sector, time present opportunity entity able use advantage. in short, supervisory community financial institution share future challenge ensure stable financial system offer good service society. conclude remark in talk i review economic policy’s exist room manoeuvre instrument address future crises. i start discuss element (such reform euro’s institutional architecture, international financial system reform development world-trade rules, increasingly shape national economic policy). i turn monetary fiscal policy, main tool manage economic cycle, argue that, present, different reasons, le freedom action recent past. therefore, opinion, fundamental conclusion necessary take advantage current cyclical position spain, condition remain favourable, build budgetary leeway future recession introduce structural reform take recent years’ expansionary demand-side policy order prolong current economic growth phase boost economy’s growth potential. in short, economic policy provide u national, european global toolkit that, wish avoid repeat error past, use properly prepare next economic crisis, surely arrive. the anniversary collapse lehman brother ten year ago, economic financial crisis suffered, particularly spain, spur u press

panel 1 "after reforms: where end up?" 6th frankfurt conference onfinancial market policy: "european financial market – too much variety?", frankfurt main,14 december 2018.* * *it’s often say every crisis opportunity. and case financial crisis, ithink regulator seize opportunity.the crisis prompt overhaul bank regulation. and national oreuropean level. through g20 basel committee bank supervision, reformsbecame common project global level.so general idea behind reforms?the primary aim address specific issue lay bare crisis. this wasthe first step. but regulator knew, course, late crisis never blueprint nextone. the next crisis might come completely different form.so second step enhance general resilience banks, make strongenough withstand type storm. this idea underpin three main build block thereforms: capital, liquidity governance.and much do three fronts. bank hold capital theydid crisis; capital also need high quality. bank therefore suffermore loss actually fail.at time, bank fulfil much strict liquidity standard before, providingthem cushion case trust evaporate fund dry up. this allow bank survivesuch situation long past.reforms improve governance risk management also come about, havereceived le attention. for long, governance risk management take backseat inpublic academic debates.but important capital liquidity – important. after all, goodgovernance sound risk management help prevent bank get trouble thefirst place. capital liquidity merely backstop bad management – bad luck.new rule help bank set appropriate process integrate theirorganisational structures. in context, one standard develop baselcommittee somewhat underappreciated view.i refer bcbs 239 principle effective risk data aggregation risk reporting,which play significant role adequately manage risk bank. in order make sounddecisions, top management need sound data.these basics. where stand turn actual policy?well, take time work long list individual reforms. some arealready place; others implement – delay there. 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech the final part basel iii agree year ago, december 2017. so, major set ofreforms still need implemented. and speed play role here, substance alsoimportant.the reform need turn actual law, law reflect agree inbasel. it important happen relevant financial markets. and i fear thismight case.not least europe, seem basel standard might implementedfaithfully. this affect important thing leverage ratio, net stable fund ratio andthe fundamental review trade book.other part rulebook also come pressure.pillar 2 capital recent example. supervisor set level pillar 2 capital account riskswhich not, partially, cover regulatory capital requirements; thus animportant additional tool make bank resilient.so far, significant bank euro area cover pillar 2 requirement withcommon equity tier 1, high quality capital. this, however, might change. in future,banks might generally allow use lower-quality capital build pillar 2 buffers.such change encourage bank market come financial innovation withregard additional tier 1 capital, at1 short. and something supervisor notvery keen on, least already see significant market volatility.on top that, play field large small bank might become uneven. unlike largebanks, small bank often unable access at1 markets. so opportunity use at1 inorder meet pillar 2 requirement would little benefit them. large banks, contrast,would advantage, least at1 coupon tax-deductible memberstates.to sum up: bank would become le resilient play field le even.but let come back basel.the reform agree basel make sense, strengthen resilience banks.a key feature reform global nature. they design ensure safe andsounder bank also level play field.so reform implement agreed, play field become uneven, open thedoor regulatory arbitrage.but regulation game town, course. supervision count too. and althoughsupervisors need rule guide work, see everything becaptured rules. global reform devise basel transposition intoeuropean law cannot perfectly tailor every business model bank pursue.at best, rule cover average case. this particularly true sector change asquickly banking.so supervisor adapt capital requirement bank’s specific risk profile inorder cater deviation average case. to end, rule principle-based leave sufficient discretion supervisors.in european context, need even greater, nowadays, often deal 19slightly different national rule apply case. 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech common principle-based regulation, apply 19 countries, would allow supervisor caterfor bank-specific risk national environment, thus ensure level play field.so, let conclude.the overarch question is: reform far help make bank sector saferplace? my answer is: yes have, still need finalised. the key point toimplement reforms, turn actual law.so, cannot stand still; move on. and circumstance movebackwards.thank attention. 3 / 3bis central
